CHAPTER 46
MINORS
 
46.01 Curfew                 46.03 Contributing to Delinquency
46.02 Cigarettes and Tobacco
 
46.01   CURFEW.
The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote the
public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and specifically
to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults responsible for
minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors committed after
the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences and criminal
activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.
1.   Definitions. For use in this section, the following terms are defined:
   A.   “Emergency errand” means, but is not limited to, an errand relating to
a fire, a natural disaster, an automobile accident or any other situation
requiring immediate action to prevent serious illness, bodily injury, or loss
of life.
   B.   “Knowingly” means knowledge that a responsible adult should reasonably
be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that responsible
adult’s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful or careless
adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult responsibility
through an objective test. It is therefore no defense that an adult responsible
for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or
whereabouts of the minor.
   C.   “Minor” means any unemancipated person under the age of 18 years.
   D.   “Nonsecured custody” means custody in an unlocked multipurpose area,
such as a lobby, office or interrogation room that is not designed, set aside,
or used as a secure detention area, and the person arrested is not physically
secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically
accompanied by a law enforcement officer or a person employed by the facility
where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to
providing nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate
juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the person’s
parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but
not for longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or
magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
   E.   “Public place” includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys, and sidewalks dedicated to public use and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises, whether publicly or privately owned,
that are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited
commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is
permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has
access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is
considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.
   F.   “Responsible adult” means a parent, guardian or other adult
specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have
custody or control of a minor.
2.   Curfew Established. It is unlawful for any minor to be or remain upon any
of the alleys, streets or public places or places of business and amusement in
the City between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. of the following day on
days commencing on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday and between
the hours of 12:30 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday.
3.   Exceptions. The following are exceptions to the curfew:
   A.   The minor is accompanied by a responsible adult.
   B.   The minor is on the sidewalk or property where the minor resides or on
either side of the place where the minor resides and the adult responsible for
the minor has given permission for the minor to be there.
   C.   The minor is present at or is traveling between home and one of the
following:
      (1)   Minor’s place of employment in a business, trade or occupation in
which the minor is permitted by law to be engaged or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of work;
      (2)   Minor’s place of religious activity or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of the religious activity;
      (3)   Governmental or political activity or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of the activity;
      (4)   School activity or, if traveling, within one hour after the end or
before the beginning of the activity;
      (5)   Assembly such as a march, protest, demonstration, sit-in or meeting
of an association for the advancement of economic, political, religious or
cultural matters, or for any other activity protected by the First Amendment of
the U.S. Constitution guarantees of free exercise of religion, freedom of
speech, freedom of assembly or, if traveling, within one hour after the end or
before the beginning of the activity.
   D.   The minor is on an emergency errand for a responsible adult;
   E.   The minor is engaged in interstate travel through the City beginning,
ending or passing through the City when such travel is by direct route.
4.   Responsibility of Adults. It is unlawful for any responsible adult
knowingly to permit or to allow a minor to be in any public place in the City
within the time periods prohibited by this section unless the minor’s presence
falls within one of the above exceptions.
5.   Enforcement Procedures.
   A.   Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in the
absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driver’s license,
a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance, use his
or her best judgment in determining age.
   B.   Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody. Grounds for arrest are that
the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the person’s
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any nonsecured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into
custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.
   C.   Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into custody,
the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the minor as
soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible for the
minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at such
time as the court may direct.
   D.   Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minor’s parent, guardian or other person
legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the
law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative
of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person
who is known to the child.
6.   Penalties.
   A.   Responsible Adult’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation
by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall, by certified mail, send to the
adult responsible for the minor, written notice of the violation with a warning
that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew
ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with applicable
penalties.
   B.   Responsible Adult’s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as defined
in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows the minor
to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a municipal
infraction.
   C.   Minor’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a minor,
the law enforcement officer shall give the minor a written warning, which
states that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the
curfew ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with applicable
penalties, or, at the law enforcement officer’s discretion, may issue the minor
a citation for a first violation.
   D.   Minor’s Second Violation. For the minor’s second and subsequent
violations of any of the provisions of this section, the minor is guilty of a
municipal infraction.
46.02   CIGARETTES AND TOBACCO.
It is unlawful for any person under 21 years of age to smoke, use, possess,
purchase, or attempt to purchase any tobacco, tobacco products, alternative
nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes. Possession of tobacco,
tobacco products, alternative nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes
by an individual under 21 years of age shall not constitute a violation of this
section if the individual under 21 years of age possesses the tobacco, tobacco
products, alternative nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes as part
of the person’s employment and said person is employed by a person who holds a
valid permit under Chapter 453A of the Code of Iowa or who lawfully offers for
sale or sells cigarettes or tobacco products.

Notes
  † EDITOR’S NOTE: A suggested form of notice for the abatement of nuisances is
  included in the Appendix of this Code of Ordinances. Caution is urged in the use
  of this administrative abatement procedure, particularly where cost of abatement
5 is more than minimal or where there is doubt as to whether or not a nuisance does
  in fact exist. If compliance is not secured following notice and hearings, we
  recommend you review the situation with your attorney before proceeding with
  abatement and assessment of costs. Your attorney may recommend proceedings in
  court under Chapter 657 of the Code of Iowa rather than this procedure.

vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without notification
procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more wheels or
other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable. The police

and other uses where the water so used does not enter the sanitary sewer
system, and no sewer service charge shall be made for water so used.
1.   Application for Irrigation Meter. An application must be filed with the
City Clerk by any customer desiring to install an irrigation meter, which
application will state the desired meter size. With the application the
customer will pay a fee for the meter and for inspection charges based on the
following rate schedule:
Standard ¾ inch meter    $   200.00
Standard 1 inch meter    $   325.00
Standard 1½ inch meter    $   1,900.00
(Subsection 1 – Ord. 596 – Dec. 23 Supp.)
2.   Installation of Irrigation Meter. The customer is responsible for all
installation and plumbing costs. The irrigation meter shall be installed
parallel with the prime meter, with a valve on each side of the meter. All
irrigation meters shall be installed horizontal to the floor or ground with the
arrow on the meter in the same direction as the flow of water. Deduct type
meters are not permitted. The actual piping may vary provided that all water is
only metered once.
Any piping and fitting that is installed by the customer on City-owned right-
of-way will be at the customer’s risk for damage resulting from any utility
digging or other work undertaken in the right-of-way, and in no event shall
such piping and fitting extend more than one foot outside the curb side of the
sidewalk (or standard sidewalk location).
3.   Backflow Prevention. All irrigation meters are required to incorporate a
backflow prevention device which meets the current standards of the Building
Code (
Chapter 150 of the Code of Ordinances).
Before the irrigation meter and the system may be activated, a certified tester
must certify to the City in writing that the backflow prevention device is in
working order and meets all applicable regulations for backflow prevention
devices. The written test results shall be filed with the City Clerk, who will
provide the test results to the Director.
4.   Inspection. The customer is required to notify the City Clerk when the
irrigation meter, backflow prevention device, and system have been installed,
so that the City may inspect the installation. The exemption from the sewer
service charge shall not be effective until the City has inspected the
installation and determined that all requirements of the City have been met.
5.   Rates for Water Passing Through Irrigation Meters. The rate for the first
50,000 gallons of water passing through the irrigation meter each month shall
be the same as the rate established in Section
92.02 of the Code of Ordinances. The rate for water in excess of 50,000 gallons
each month shall be 150 percent of the per 1,000 gallons rate established in
Section
92.02.
6.   Annual Certification. On or before April 1 of each year after a customer
has installed an irrigation meter, the Director will notify the customer in
writing of the City’s requirement that the irrigation meter and backflow
prevention device be tested and certified to be in working order and compliant
with all applicable regulations by a certified tester within 60 days of the
Director’s notice.
The customer shall, at the customer’s expense, arrange for the testing and
provide a copy of written test and certification results to the City Clerk. In
the event the customer does not provide the test and certification results by
July 1 of each year, the City will disconnect water service to the customer’s
premises. The City will not restore service until the written test and
certification results have been filed with the City and the customer has paid a
$50.00 re-connect fee to the City.
(Paragraph 2 of Subsection 6 - Ord. 576 - Jul. 22 Supp.)
7.   Exception for Agricultural Uses. In lieu of the backflow prevention
procedures required in Subsections 3, 4, and 6 above, a double check valve may
be used in connection with the agricultural use of irrigation meters. The
Director shall approve the installation of a check valve. The annual
certification required in Subsection 6 above shall not be required for a double
check valve. For purposes of this subsection, “agricultural use” shall mean the
use of water for the care of livestock, spraying and for uses in and around
farm buildings.

of Water Warning or Water Emergency use restrictions will not occur.
Any customer charged with a violation of the Water Warning or Water Emergency
use restrictions may request a hearing before the Water Appeal Board. The Water
Appeal Board may conclude that a violation did not occur or that the
circumstances under which the violation occurred warrant a complete or partial
mitigation of the penalty.
93.14   MUNICIPAL INFRACTION.
In addition to any penalties imposed by this chapter, a second or subsequent
violation of the Water Warning or Water Emergency use restrictions, by any
person within a 12-month period constitutes a municipal infraction. Any person

wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from
periodic grab samples.)

100.01   PURPOSE.
The City has determined the necessity of establishing a policy and a procedure
to be utilized to recover the cost of designing and constructing major sanitary
sewer facilities and major water main facilities in those instances in which a
significant number of the properties to be benefited by such facilities are not
sufficiently developed to permit the recovery of those costs through the
special assessment process as provided in Chapter 384 of the Code of Iowa. The
City hereby declares its intent to utilize connection fees, as herein provided,
to recover the costs of designing and constructing such major sanitary sewer
facilities and major water main facilities from property owners who connect to
such facilities subsequent to their construction. The purpose of this chapter
is to establish the method of recovery of proportional cost shares from those
property owners who connect their properties to major sanitary sewer facilities
and major water main facilities subsequent to their construction, so that in
the event all of the properties, other than street and road right-of-way, which
lie within the benefited district are connected to the major sanitary sewer
facilities and major water main facilities during their expected useful life,
then those properties shall bear, in the aggregate, up to 100% of the cost of
designing and constructing such facilities, including legal, administrative and
interest expenses associated therewith.
100.02   NOTICE OF HEARING ON ORDINANCE TO ESTABLISH BENEFITED DISTRICT AND
CONNECTION FEE.
In the event the Council determines the necessity of constructing a major
sanitary sewer facility or major water main facility, and determines that the
utilization of a connection fee is the most equitable manner in which to
recover the City’s costs associated therewith, the Council shall cause a
“Notice of Public Hearing on the Proposed Adoption of an Ordinance to Establish
a Benefited District and a Connection Fee,” to be published in a newspaper of
general circulation within the City as hereafter provided. In addition to
indicating the date, time and place of the public hearing, the notice shall:
1.   Indicate the nature and extent of the major sanitary sewer facility or
facilities, or major water main facility or facilities under consideration for
construction, as well as the estimated cost or costs for the design and
construction of same;
2.   Identify by general description the proposed benefited district to be
served by the major sanitary sewer facility or facilities, or major water main
facility or facilities; and
3.   Set forth the proposed schedule of connection fees to be paid by property
owners within the benefited district who connect to said facilities, expressed
in dollars per acre of land area served or such other method as the City shall
determine to be equitable for the benefited district.
100.03   PUBLICATION AND MAILING OF NOTICE.
The notice shall also state that the proposed connection fee ordinance is on
file, along with a plat of the area to be served, and both are available for
public inspection in the office of the City Clerk. The notice shall be
published not more than 45 days and not less than 20 days prior to the
scheduled date of the public hearing, and shall be mailed to each property
owner within the benefited district as shown by the records of the County
Auditor.
100.04   PROCEDURE AT HEARING.
At the public hearing, the owners of property within the proposed benefited
district shall be heard and may offer comments or objections as to:
1.   The necessity for the project;
2.   The calculation of the area benefited by the proposed major sanitary sewer
facilities or major water main facilities;
3.   The estimated cost of the proposed facilities; and
4.   The proposed connection fee.
100.05   COUNCIL ACTION FOLLOWING HEARING.
Upon concluding the hearing, the Council shall rule upon any objections
presented during the hearing and may consider the adoption of the proposed
connection fee ordinance. Upon consideration of the proposed connection fee
ordinance, the Council may:
1.   Adopt the ordinance as proposed;
2.   Delete elements or portions of the proposed major sanitary sewer
facilities and major water main facilities from the proposed project and the
properties served thereby from the benefited district proposed; or
3.   Amend the ordinance to revise the connection fee.
100.06   PROVISIONS OF CONNECTION FEE ORDINANCE.
The connection fee ordinance may provide, at the Council’s discretion, that
single family residences within the benefited district, in existence or under
construction upon the effective date of the ordinance, and located within the
corporate limits of the City, are eligible for connection to the major sanitary
sewer facility or major water main facility. In that event, the ordinance shall
include the following provisions:
1.   The owners of residences on parcels of less than one acre in size located
within the City may connect such residences to the major sanitary sewer
facility or major water main facility upon approval of their application for
connection, payment of the connection fee for the parcel, and any associated
permit fee, and construction, at the owner’s expense, of appropriate connection
structures, as determined necessary by the City.
2.   The owners of residences on parcels in excess of one acre in size located
within the City may connect such residences to the major sanitary sewer
facility or major water main facility upon approval of their application for
connection and division of said parcel into a residence parcel and a remainder
parcel, payment of the connection fee for the residence parcel, and any
associated permit fee, and construction, at the owner’s expense, of appropriate
connection structures, as determined necessary by the City.
3.   The connection fee for the remainder parcel shall be payable at such time
as the remainder parcel shall be connected to the major sanitary sewer facility
or major water main facility. For purposes of this chapter, the division of the
property into a residence parcel and a remainder parcel may be accomplished by
submitting a drawing showing a graphical depiction of the two parcels including
dimensions accurate to within a distance of one foot, a legal description of
the entire parcel and a legal description of the residence parcel with such
accuracy as to allow the City to determine a reasonable description of the
remainder parcel. For purposes of this section, the division of property does
not require a subdivision of the property or a plat of survey.
The connection fee ordinance may also provide, at the Council’s discretion,
that sanitary sewer service or water service can be provided to recreational
and park facilities, and to commercial and industrial parcels and facilities,
in the same manner and under the same procedures set forth in this section for
single family residences within the benefited district.
100.07   SEWER AND WATER SERVICE TO OTHER PROPERTY.
All other property located within the corporate limits of the City and within a
benefited district shall be eligible for connection to the major sanitary sewer
facility or water main facility upon approval of an application for connection
by the owner thereof, as hereafter provided, and payment of the connection fee
for such property, provided such property has been appropriately subdivided for
development, and, where applicable, all sanitary sewer improvements and/or
water main improvements necessary to serve said property have been constructed,
at the owner’s expense, and accepted by the City.
100.08   PROCEDURE FOR APPLICATIONS FOR UTILITY CONNECTION.
After adoption, publication and recording by the City Clerk in each county
where property in the benefited district is located, of a connection fee
ordinance for a benefited district, all owners of those properties within the
benefited district whose properties are eligible for connection, and who
propose to connect such properties directly or indirectly to the major sanitary
sewer facility or water main facility, shall make application to the City for
such connection. The submittal of construction plans to the City for sanitary
sewer improvements and/or water main improvements on property being subdivided
for development shall constitute an application to the City for purposes of
this section. The sewer connection fee or water connection fee shall be due and
payable at the time application is made to the City for connection to the major
sanitary sewer facility or major water main facility. No connection shall be
made to a major sanitary sewer facility or major water main facility until such
application has been approved and until the required connection fee has been
paid. The sewer connection fee and/or water connection fee required by this
section shall be paid before the City will approve the final plat of property
subject to the connection fee.
100.09   CONNECTION FEE COMPUTATION.
The sewer connection fee or water connection fee shall be in an amount equal to
the maximum acre area of contiguous property, or fraction thereof, within the
benefited district under common ownership which can be lawfully served through
such proposed connection, multiplied by the per-acre connection fee or such
other fee basis as determined for the benefited district established in the
connection fee ordinance for that benefited district. The connection fee
ordinance may provide for a graduated connection fee, with annual interest
adjustments, such that property owners who connect in later years pay interest
on the connection fee for their property. The rate of interest applicable to
the connection fee established in each benefited district shall not exceed the
rate of interest applicable to special assessments pursuant to Chapter 74A and
Section 384.60(3) of the Code of Iowa in effect on the date that the connection
fee was established for that district by enactment of a connection fee
ordinance.
100.10   CONNECTION FEE PAYABLE TO CITY.
The sewer connection fee or water connection fee required by this chapter shall
be due and payable to the City. The sewer connection fee and/or water
connection fee required by this chapter is in addition to, and not in lieu of,
any other fees for connection required under the Plumbing Code or other
provisions of this Code of Ordinances.
100.11   CONSEQUENCES OF CONNECTION WITHOUT CITY’S APPROVAL.
In the event any property owner connects his or her property within a benefited
district to a major sanitary sewer facility or major water main facility
without having made application therefor or without having received approval
thereof, or without having paid the required connection fee established by a
connection fee ordinance, the City shall be entitled to disconnect such private
sewer connection or private water connection until such time as the property
owner has made application and received approval, and/or has paid the required
connection fee.
100.12   SOUTH TRUNK SEWER CONNECTION FEE DISTRICT.
The South Trunk Sewer Connection Fee District is hereby established consisting
of a tract of land in Sections Two (2) and Eleven (11), Township Seventy-nine
(79) North, Range Twenty-seven (27) West of the 5th P.M., Dallas County, Iowa,

outside the South Trunk Sewer Connection Fee District which use or derive
benefit from any of the sewer facilities constructed for the South Trunk Sewer
Connection Fee District. The connection fee as established in the foregoing fee
schedule shall be imposed at the time of determination that a benefit is
derived by the property.
3.   The above-established connection fee schedule shall not apply to any
properties within the South Trunk Sewer Connection Fee District which do not
use or derive benefit from any sewer facilities constructed for the South Trunk
Sewer Connection Fee District.
4.   The determination that a property is to be connected to the sewer facility
shall occur, and the appropriate connection fee shall be paid, prior to the

effective date of Ordinance No. 269 located upon a parcel in excess of one
acre, may apply to the Council for connection upon annexation to the City,
subdivision of said parcel into a single residence parcel and an outlot, and
payment of a single-acre connection fee. Any future development of said parcel
shall necessitate a revised application for connection and payment of the
connection fee as established in the above fee schedule.
6.   The owner of any other property may apply to the Council for connection
upon annexation to the City and for a determination of an appropriate
adjustment to the number of acres to be utilized in determining the connection
fee so as to achieve a fair and just application of the intent of this section.
Any future development of said parcel shall necessitate a revised application
for connection and payment of the connection fee as established in the above
fee schedule.
7.   Any parcel for which a proposal of development as a public school site
may, at the discretion of the Council, be exempt from the payment of any
connection fee to serve the school facilities.
The above-established connection fee schedule shall remain in force and effect
until such time that the Council adopts an ordinance to adjust the connection
fees to be imposed in subsequent years for the South Trunk Sewer Connection Fee
District. Nothing herein is intended to restrict the Council from appropriate
adjustment of the connection fee schedule to reflect future construction costs.

Residential Units and Amount of Charge
 
101.01   PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish the Storm Water Drainage Utility,
authorize charges, rates and fees for use of, and discharge to, the storm and
surface water drainage system; to provide a process for appeals from certain
decisions of the City Council relating to such charges; and to provide for
collection of delinquent charges. The City Council finds that the construction,
operation and maintenance of the City's storm water system should be funded
through user charges imposed for the discharge of storm and surface water to
the storm water drainage system, thereby charging those persons and activities
using or receiving service from that system. The City may be required to
provide increased quantity or quality controls to mitigate those impacts of
pollutants from discharging storm and surface waters into the storm water
system. Therefore, it is appropriate to impose a storm and surface water user
charge upon all users of property which may discharge, directly or indirectly,
into the storm water system.
101.02   DEFINITIONS.
The following words shall have the following definitions when used in this
chapter, and any resolution and order adopted pursuant hereto, unless the
context requires otherwise or unless such word is expressly defined otherwise:
1.   “Connection” means the physical act or process of directing or allowing
the flow of storm and surface waters to the storm sewer or drainage line, or
joining onto a private storm sewer, for the purpose of connecting private
impervious surface or other storm and surface water sources or systems to the
public storm and surface water system. It shall also include creation or
maintenance of impervious surface that causes or is likely to cause an increase
in the quantity or decrease in quality or both from the natural state of storm
water runoff, and which drains, directly or indirectly, to the storm and
surface water system.
2.   “Date of imposition” or “imposition date” means July 1 of each fiscal year
or such other date designated by the Council at which time a charge is imposed
and becomes the legal obligation of the user. The obligation may include the
cost of services to be provided during the billing period or for services
previously provided to the same person under this chapter.
3.   “Days” means calendar days unless otherwise specified.
4.   “Equivalent residential unit” or “ERU” means a measurement unit based on
the impervious surface area of an average improved single family dwelling lot
or parcel within the City (as determined by a statistical sampling performed by
the City). Except as provided in Section
101.05, one equivalent residential unit shall be deemed to be 3,500 square feet
of impervious material. See Section
101.06, Flat Rate Users for further clarification.
5.   “Impervious surface area” means all land area that has been altered from
its natural state such that it does not allow the infiltration and retention of
water equivalent to that of undisturbed soil. This shall include, but is not
limited to: pavement, buildings, decks, parking areas, and compacted gravel
areas. Impervious surface shall not include improved streets, roads and
sidewalks within the public right-of-way. Rather such facilities are deemed to
be part of the public surface water drainage conveyance system.
6.   “Occupant” means the person residing or doing business on the property. In
a family or household situation, the occupant responsible for the obligations
herein imposed shall be the adult heads of the household, jointly and
severally. In a dwelling or office sharing situation, the adult occupant
legally responsible for the management or condition of the property shall be
responsible.
7.   “Owner” means the legal owner(s) of records as shown on the tax rolls of
Dallas County, Iowa, or where there is a recorded land sale contract, the
purchaser thereunder.
8.   “Person” means any individual, public or private corporation, political
subdivision, governmental agency, municipality, partnership, association, firm,
trust, or any other legal entity whatsoever.
9.   “Rule” means any written standard, directive, interpretation, policy,
regulation, procedure or other provision, adopted by the City Council as a
resolution and order to carry out the provisions of this chapter.
10.   “Storm and surface water drainage system” means any combination of
publicly owned storm and surface water quantity and quality facilities,
pumping, or lift facilities, storm and secondary drain pipes and culverts, open
channels, creeks and rivers, force mains, laterals, manholes, catch basins and
inlets, including the grates and covers thereof, detention and retention
facilities, laboratory facilities and equipment, and any other publicly owned
facilities for the collection, conveyance, treatment and disposal of storm and
surface water system within the City, to which sanitary sewage flows are not
intentionally admitted.
11.   “User” means any person who uses property which maintains connection to,
discharges to, or otherwise receives services from the City for surface water
management. The occupant of occupied property is deemed the user. If the
property is not occupied, the person who has the right to occupy it shall be
deemed the user.
101.03   STORM WATER UTILITY ESTABLISHED.
Pursuant to the authority of Section 384.84 of the Code of Iowa, as amended, a
storm water utility is established in the City, except as provided in Section
101.06(1)(I). The entire City, as increased from time to time, shall constitute
a single storm and surface water drainage system district.
101.04   CHARGES AND FEES IN GENERAL.
The Council may adopt by rule, charges, rates, and fees for the use of the
City's storm and surface water system, and for services provided by the City
relating to that system. Such rules may include delinquency and interest
charges and penalties. Such charges and fees shall be just and equitable based
upon the actual costs of operation, maintenance, acquisition, extension and
replacement of the City’s system, the costs of bond repayment, regulation,
administration, and services of the City. Except as specifically provided in
this chapter or by resolution and order, all charges and service fees shall be
due and payable in advance of provision of service. All billing procedures
shall be the same as for water usage and may be billed on the same bill.
101.05   STORM WATER UTILITY USER CHARGE.
1.   There is established a storm water utility system user charge. This charge
is imposed on every user within the City of the storm and surface water
drainage system on the imposition date. The charge shall be paid in advance of
the provision of service for the billing period. The charge due for the billing
period shall be the obligation of the user of the public storm system on the
imposition date, notwithstanding whether the user is the addressee of the bill.
2.   The charge shall be the personal obligation of the user on the imposition
date, regardless of whether that person has any ownership interest in the
property. This charge shall constitute a debt due the City as of the date of
imposition.
3.   There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the owner of the real
property, as shown in the records of the County Assessor, is the occupant.
4.   The storm water utility user charge shall be imposed upon any person who
uses or discharges to the public storm and surface water drainage system by:
   A.   Maintaining impervious surface connected to (directly or indirectly)
and capable of discharge to the public surface water management systems; or
   B.   Actually discharging storm or surface water into the system.
5.   The storm water utility user charge shall be charged for all users of
properties within the boundaries of the City. A property containing impervious
surface, is presumed to discharge storm water to the storm and surface water
drainage system, and to generate a demand for storm and surface water drainage
services unless that property has an on-site disposal system which meets the
standard of Section
101.06(1)(I) and any rules adopted thereunder.
101.06   CALCULATION OF EQUIVALENT RESIDENTIAL UNITS AND AMOUNT OF CHARGE.
1.   This subsection shall be used to determine the number of Equivalent
Residential Units (ERUs) for a property for purposes of determining the amount
of Storm Water Utility (SWU) service charges and the water quantity component
of the SWU.
There are two types of uses: flat rate uses and measured uses. These are
defined as follows:
   A.   Flat Rate Uses. Improved properties that qualify under this section as
flat rate uses shall be charged at the rate of one ERU per dwelling unit. The
following uses shall be defined as “flat rate” uses:
      (1)   Single Family Residence. A residential structure not attached to
another residential structure on one or more parcels of land, providing there
are not more than two residential structures on one parcel. This definition
also includes mobile homes and manufactured homes, if on separate parcels. Two
separate dwelling units on a single parcel shall be charged one ERU per
dwelling unit. Three or more residential dwelling units on one parcel, whether
attached or unattached, shall be considered a multiple family residential use.
      (2)   Duplex. Two dwelling units joined to each other with a common wall,
or one above the other, on one or two parcels. The units may be under one
ownership, or owned separately. Each dwelling unit of the duplex shall be
charged one ERU.
      (3)   Multi-Family Residential Use. Three or more dwelling units joined
to each other horizontally or vertically, on one or more parcels. The units may
be under one ownership or more. Each dwelling unit shall be charged one ERU.
The owner of the taxed land parcel shall be deemed the user; except where
multi-family dwelling units are individually metered the occupant of each unit
is deemed the user and shall be charged one ERU.
      (4)   Condominiums. Each living unit of a condominium shall be charged
one ERU.
Unit is defined as living units and do not include supporting uses, such as
garages, even though they may be on separate parcels.
      (5)   Mobile Home Parks. Includes mobile homes on a single tax lot (even
if there are more than two per tax lot) under one ownership, where spaces are
leased or rented for a mobile home to be placed. Each space in a mobile home
park shall be charged one ERU whether or not there is a mobile home on the
space. Other impervious areas contained within the boundaries of the mobile
home park shall not be measured. The owner of a taxed lot shall be deemed the
user.
   B.   Measured Uses. Properties that are not flat rate uses shall be measured
uses. For such uses, the impervious surfaces of the property, as defined by
rule, shall be measured. The area shall be estimated using one or more of the
following: aerial photographs, assessment records, building permits,
construction plans, site visits, ad valorem property tax records, storm and
surface water system connection permits, field surveys or other sources deemed
reliable by the City. This area shall then be divided by 3,500 square feet, the
area of one equivalent residential unit within the City. The ERU for all of the
uses in this subsection shall be determined by measuring the impervious area.
All values shall be rounded to the next lowest whole number, but not less than
one ERU.
Measured uses include the entire range of office, manufacturing, service,
sales, restaurant, day care, nursery, warehouse, churches, schools, utilities,
public service buildings, parks, hospital, nursing home, rest home, retirement
home, and other similar uses. This category includes land with an impervious
surface with no building improvements.
      (1)   Single Occupancy Parcels. For a single occupancy parcel the number
of ERUs shall be determined based on the entire parcel. Billing shall be to the
occupant, unless there is no water meter account. For parcels with no water
meter account the billing shall be to the owner.
      (2)   Multiple Occupancy Parcels. For parcels with multiple occupants,
including combinations of owner occupied and tenant occupied, the number of
ERUs shall be determined based on the impervious area of the entire parcel and
prorated to the individual occupancy units based on their respective proportion
of building space to the total building space. Common areas and exterior areas
with impervious surfaces will be allocated to the occupied areas and no
separate allocation will be made for these common spaces and exterior spaces.
Billing shall be to the occupant unless there is no water meter for the
occupant. Parcels with no occupant water meter shall be billed to the owner.
      (3)   Mixed Use Parcels. For parcels that include a combination of
residential and non-residential uses each residential unit shall be billed as
one ERU as the equivalent of a flat use. For the non-residential portion of a
mixed use parcel, the total number of ERUs billed to the site shall be
calculated based on the total impervious area. The number of ERUs allocated to
the residential units shall be subtracted from the total number of ERUs for the
parcel. The balance of the ERUs allocated to the parcel will be allocated to
the non-residential parcels. In the event there is more than one non-
residential occupant the number of ERUs will be proportioned as provided. Each
non-residential portion of the site shall be billed a minimum of one ERU.
For mixed use parcels the billing shall be to the water meter account of the
occupant of each residential and non-residential portion of the parcel. In the
event there are units or spaces without a water billing account, the owner will
be billed.
      (4)   Multiple Parcels Under Common Ownership. For purposes of
administration and billing, parcels under the same ownership may be
consolidated for the billing. The consolidation may include separate parcels
with individual water meter accounts, or parcels without water meter accounts
and parcels with water meter accounts.
   C.   General Policies.
      (1)   No Limit on Charge for a Measured Use. If a use is a measured use,
its charge shall not be limited.
      (2)   Minimum Charge. The minimum charge for any parcel with impervious
areas subject to the SWU charge shall be one ERU.
      (3)   Community Facilities. The flat rate category includes typical
residential uses within a parcel or single ownership, as defined above. If a
community or neighborhood recreation center or similar facility exists within a
subdivision, even if associated with the single family or duplex properties,
that property shall be measured and charged separately to the user of that
property.
      (4)   Seasonal Impervious Area. Properties which have areas that are
impervious for only a portion of the year shall constitute seasonal impervious
area. If an impervious area is in place for more than three months per year, it
shall be subject to the SWU charge.
      (5)   Miscellaneous.
         (a)   No credits, exemptions, or reductions shall be given for
impervious surfaces that are submerged for a portion of the year.
         (b)   If impervious areas are so small they cannot be detected on
aerial maps at a scale of 1” = 50’, then they shall not be included in the
total impervious area.
         (c)   A residence of any kind and a garage for that residence, shall
be charged one ERU, even if on two adjacent parcels.
         (d)   Swimming pools are exempted from SWU fees providing the filter
drains are connected to the sanitary sewer system.
         (e)   No waiver shall be given for small impervious areas on a large
pervious property.
         (f)   The City may elect not to bill small measured use parcels when
the administrative cost of the billing exceeds the revenue generated.
   D.   Public Roads. Public roads shall not be included in the measurement of
impervious surface areas.
   E.   Private Roads.
      (1)   All private roads that are gravel or paved on a measured use parcel
shall be considered impervious and subject to the SWU fee.
      (2)   All private roads on a flat rate use parcel shall be considered
part of the impervious area of the flat rate use parcel.
      (3)   Private roads shall include private streets, private alleys and
driveways.
   F.   Parking and Storage Areas.
      (1)   All parking and vehicle storage areas that are gravel or paved on a
measured use parcel shall be considered impervious and subject to the SWU fee.
      (2)   All parking and vehicle storage areas a part of a flat rate use
parcel shall be considered a part of the impervious area of the flat rate use
parcel.
   G.   Landscaping Exempted. Gravel areas that are used for landscaping or
foot traffic and are not considered highly compacted shall not be considered
impervious for purposes of the determining the SWU fee.
   H.   Exclusion from Impervious Surface Measurement.
      (1)   Users of properties for which all storm water is disposed of on-
site, as defined by City standards, may request an exemption from SWU service
charges. No partial exemptions for disposal of only a portion of the storm and
surface waters on-site, shall be allowed. In order to qualify for service
charge exemption, the user must design, construct and maintain an on-site
facility that keeps all storm and surface water for the full range of storms
during the year. This applicant for exemption must pay an initial inspection/
review fee.
      (2)   For the purpose of this subsection, the term “property” means a
parcel of land, or a group of adjacent parcels working in cooperation. The term
“on-site disposal” means on the parcel, or on another parcel in the near
vicinity of the parcel requesting the exemption.
      (3)   In order to qualify for the exemption, the on-site system must
encompass the entire property (except for incidental impervious areas as
defined below), must be completely separated from the public system, and must
provide adequate on-site disposal. Incidental areas such as sidewalks, decks,
and driveway aprons, shall not exceed ten percent of the total impervious area.
      (4)   On-site disposal facilities that may qualify are dry wells,
injection wells, retention basins with percolation/evaporation capacity, and
retention basins with capacity large enough to accommodate the total of all
storms through the year. Many of these may have a possible adverse effect on
ground water, and some techniques may require approval of State, Federal and
local agencies.
      (5)   To qualify, an applicant must submit a request to the City for a
waiver of monthly service charges relating to the property. This request shall
include a certification from an engineer, or other evidence acceptable to the
City, that shows the system is separate and will dispose of the full range and
volume of storm water through the year on-site. The applicant shall also submit
a maintenance plan for assuring the system will function as designed. The
application must be signed by the property owner.
      (6)   An inspection/review fee shall be paid at the time of application.
If the application is denied, the inspection/review fee will be credited to the
service charges due. If the request for the waiver is made as part of the
construction plans, this fee shall be waived.
      (7)   A decision denying an exemption may be appealed. If approved, the
waiver will be effective for the next billing cycle.
      (8)   The City retains the right to inspect the on-site measures to
assure they are functioning as designed. If at any time the measures are found
to not be effective, the exemption shall cease.
   I.   Exemption from Storm Water Utility Fee.
      (1)   Users of properties that are located in certain areas of the City
may be exempt from the storm water utility fee.
      (2)   Areas may be exempted from the storm water utility fee if the City
Council determines the following are applicable to the properties considered
for exemption:
         (a)   Runoff from the area is not tributary to a City of Dallas Center
storm sewer or storm drainage system owned by the City of Dallas Center, and
         (b)   The area of the property is considered rural or agricultural in
character or is considered a large lot rural subdivision in character.
      (3)   Exempt areas shall be illustrated on a map with said map being
approved by resolution.
      (4)   The determination of exempt properties may be amended from time to
time by a resolution adopted by the Council.
2.   Rates. The rates for the service charge shall be calculated in accordance
with Section
101.06 and shall be calculated on a fiscal year basis, based on the estimated
storm water utility system actual costs, less other projected revenue, if any,
divided by the estimated total number of ERUs connected to the City storm water
utility system. The rate of the service charge will be $4.00 per ERU per month.
The estimated storm water utility system actual costs may include funds that
are budgeted for accumulation for future capital improvement projects even
though said funds may not be expended during the fiscal year in which the
revenue is budgeted for collection.
3.   Records. All ERU records for all properties within the City of Dallas
Center shall be kept on file in the City Clerk’s office and shall be available
during normal office hours for examination.
4.   Deposit. All users of the storm water utility shall be subject to the
provisions of the combined utility deposit set forth in Section
92.09 of this Code of Ordinances.
101.07   BILLING.
1.   The City shall send a bill for the amount due by regular mail to every
user in the City. Mailing to the owner of record as shown in the assessor
records or to the occupant with a water account, as determined appropriate by
the City, shall satisfy this requirement. The billing period shall be the same
as for the water usage. The bill may be made part of the regular billing for a
water account or a separate billing as determined by the City. In the event a
user has more than one water account, the City may consolidate the storm water
utility user charge on one or more water accounts.
2.   The recipient of the first billing after the imposition has 20 days after
receipt of the first billing to notify the City of Dallas Center the recipient
is not the responsible party and to provide information on the relationship of
the recipient to the property and the occupant of the property as of the
imposition date. Failure to file notice within 20 days after the receipt of the
initial billing shall be deemed to establish the original addressee as the user
on the imposition date.
3.   Upon receipt of the notice from the recipient, the City shall determine
who is obligated for payment. Based on this determination, the City shall:
   A.   Issue a new bill to the occupant if the property was occupied by
someone other than the original recipient;
   B.   Reissue the bill to the recipient if it is found that the person was
the occupant;
   C.   Issue a bill to the owner as the user, if the property was not
occupied.
The City may take into account any reasonably reliable information available to
it, including utility or water district records.
4.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any person may agree
in writing to be responsible for payment of the charge. Upon filing of such a
writing with the City, subsequent bills shall be sent to that person, and that
person shall be deemed to be the user.
5.   It is a violation of this chapter to knowingly provide false information
to the City regarding any fact related to billing of a storm water utility
service charge or other charge by the City.
101.08   DELINQUENCY, COLLECTION, INTEREST, AND PENALTIES.
1.   Charges imposed under this chapter are deemed delinquent when not paid in
full by the due date provided in a billing for the charge.
2.   It is unlawful and a violation of this chapter for any person to discharge
wastewater into the City’s storm water utility system. It is also unlawful and
a violation of this chapter to maintain a connection to or use the City’s storm
water utility system without paying the appropriate charges and fees
established in this chapter or any rule adopted pursuant hereto. Even if no
billing is received, such charges shall be due and owing and the user is
obligated to pay any charges in a timely fashion.
3.   All charges are due and payable under the same terms and conditions
provided for payment of a combined service account as contained in Section
92.04 of this Code of Ordinances. The provisions contained in Section
92.06 relating to a lien for nonpayment shall also apply in the event of a
delinquent account.
101.09   CONSERVATION DESIGN CREDITS AND REDUCTIONS.
To recognize the reduction in storm water runoff related to certain
conservation design practices, credits to the storm water utility user charge
are provided for flat rate users and measured users that implement conservation
design practices in accordance with the provisions of this section. The
conservation design credit is a permanent or time-limited credit against the
storm water utility user charges calculated in accordance with the provisions
of Section
101.06.
1.   Individual Flat Rate Users. A conservation design credit will be provided
to individual flat rate users incorporating approved conservation design
techniques, including rain gardens, bioswales or similar facilities. The credit
is based on the percentage of the property tributary to the conservation design
facilities. The credit is calculated as a percentage of the flat rate user
charge based on the following:
 
Percent of Property Tributary to Conservation Design Facilities Credit (%)
Less than 10 percent                                            0
10 percent to up to 25 percent                                  50
25 percent or greater                                           100
 
2.   Residential Conservation Design Subdivisions. All flat rate users within a
subdivision that incorporates conservation design practices as designated by
the City shall receive a 100 percent credit against the storm water utility
charge.
3.   Measured Users. The impervious area of measured user that are in
accordance with approved conservation design practices will be reduced by a
percentage of the total impervious area tributary to the facility. The
reduction is based on the impervious area tributary to or subject to the
conservation design practice and does not include a reduction of the impervious
area not tributary to the conservation design practice. The maximum credit
provided for any impervious area is the largest credit applicable for
individual conservation design practices and a cumulative reduction is not
allowed. The reduction of the impervious area of facilities tributary to
conservation design practices is:
   A.   Green roof design (roof area only): 75 percent reduction.
   B.   Rain gardens, bioswales and other absorptive facilities: 60 percent
reduction.
   C.   Flow through storm water retention facilities designed for the purpose
of reducing peak flow: 40 percent reduction.
   D.   Porous pavement: 50 percent reduction. The reduction for porous
pavement shall be valid for a period of five years. At the end of the five year
period the City will inspect the porous pavement to determine if the pavement
continues to maintain the high porosity associated with porous pavement design.
If the high porosity continues, the reduction will be renewed for a period of
five years. If the inspection reveals that the porosity has decreased due to
plugging or fouling, the reduction will not be renewed. For purposes of
determining whether the porous pavement maintains a high porosity, the standard
porosity of at least 50 percent of the porous pavement design porosity, the
City may request the measured users to document the porosity through field
testing. In the event the measured user elects not to complete field testing,
the reduction will not be renewed.
4.   Individual flat rate users and measured users seeking a conservation
credit or reduction in impervious area shall make application to the City
Clerk. The application will include a description of the conservation facility
and include information for the City to determine the area tributary to the
facility that is the basis for the application for a credit or reduction.
5.   The City Clerk shall review the application and accompanying information.
Within 30 days after receipt of a complete application, the City Clerk shall
approve or deny the application. Approved credits and reductions shall be
implemented on the next storm water utility billing. If the City Clerk
determines the application is incomplete, the City Clerk shall notify the
applicant. Upon receipt of additional information, the City Clerk shall
determine within 15 calendar days whether to approve or deny the application,
or determine additional information is still required to make the
determination. In the event no additional information is submitted within 60
days after a request, the application shall be denied.
6.   Individual flat rate users and measured users receiving a credit or
impervious area reduction for a conservation facility shall notify the City
Clerk within 30 calendar days after any substantive change that would decrease
or eliminate the effectiveness of the facility that served as the basis for the
credit or reduction. Within 15 calendar days after the receipt of the notice,
the City Clerk shall determine whether the facility on which the credit or
reduction was based is still effective or in existence. If the City Clerk
determines the facility no longer qualifies for a credit or reduction, the
credit or reduction shall be discontinued.
7.   If the City identifies or observes changes in conservation design
facilities subject to a credit or reduction for which notification of change
has not been provided as required herein, the City may provide written notice
to the user of the observed changes in the conservation design facility. The
user shall have 15 calendar days after notice in which to respond to the City’s
notice. At the expiration of the 15 day period, the City Clerk shall determine
whether the facility continues to qualify for the credit or reduction. If the
City Clerk determines the facility is no longer qualifying, the credit or
reduction shall be discontinued.
101.10   REQUEST FOR SERVICE; DISCONNECTION FROM SERVICE; USE RECLASSIFICATION;
TERMINATION OF USER CHARGES.
1.   The issuance of a storm water utility system connection permit relating to
impervious surface on a property or parcel shall be deemed to be a specific
request for provision of storm and surface water service to that property.
2.   Any user of the public storm water utility system may disconnect property
served by the system from service and terminate further user charges by
utilizing the procedure in this section.
3.   Any user of the public storm water utility may remove all or part of the
impervious surface on the property served by the system and apply for use
reclassification by utilizing the procedure in this section.
4.   A person desiring to disconnect property from the system shall make
application on a form provided by the City and pay the fee established
therefore. The application shall be signed by the owner of the property; shall
provide evidence of demolition or removal of any impervious surface on the
property, or of installation of an approved on-site storm and surface water
retention or infiltration system serving the property. Such on-site system
shall be designed and operated to retain or dispose of on-site all storm and
surface waters generated by the property, through the full range of storm
events prescribed by City rule. The Council may by rule, adopt additional
criteria and administrative procedures to provide for disconnection from storm
water utility service, and suspension or termination of user charges.
5.   Upon receipt of a complete application for disconnection or
reclassification, and verification of information thereon, and installation of
the on-site system or demolition of impervious area as provided in subsection 3
of this section, the City shall issue a permit for disconnection or
reclassification. Whether performed by the City or other person, the City shall
inspect the disconnection.
6.   The City may inspect the on-site system at any time. If at any time the
system fails to perform to the standard specified in Subsection 3 above, the
City shall notify the owner to correct the system. If the system is not
corrected to meet on site retention or infiltration standards within 30 days of
such notice, the City may treat such deficiency as a reconnection to the storm
water utility system and as a specific request for storm water utility service.
Service fees shall then relate back to the earliest date on which the system
failed to meet applicable performance standards for on-site retention or
disposal.
7.   If at any time after reclassification an impervious surface is added to
the property, the City shall consider such an addition as a reconnection to the
storm water utility and as a specific request for storm water utility service.
101.11   ADOPTION OF RULES; INTERPRETATIONS AND APPEALS.
1.   Adoption of Rules.
   A.   The Council may, by resolution and order, promulgate rules pertaining
to matters within the scope of this chapter.
   B.   Any rule adopted pursuant to this section shall require a public
hearing. Not less than four or more than 20 days before such hearing, public
notice of such hearing shall be given by publication in a newspaper of general
circulation within the City. Such notice shall include the place, time and
purpose of the hearing and the location at which copies of the full text of the
proposed rules may be obtained.
   C.   At the public hearing, the Council shall hear testimony concerning the
proposed rules. At the conclusion of the public hearing, the Council shall
either adopt the proposal, modify or reject it. If a modification is made, an
additional public hearing shall be held but no additional notice shall be
required if such additional hearing is announced at the meeting at which the
modification is made. All rules shall be effective upon adoption by the Council
and shall be filed in the office of the City.
   D.   Notwithstanding Paragraphs B and C of this subsection, a rule may be
adopted without prior notice upon a finding that failure of the Council to act
promptly will result in serious prejudice to the public interest or the
interest of the affected parties, including the specific reasons for such
prejudice. Any rule adopted pursuant to this subsection shall be effective for
a period of not longer than 180 days.
2.   Appeals.
   A.   The following may be appealed in accordance with the provisions of this
subsection.
      (1)   A determination that the person is obligated to pay the service
charge imposed herein.
      (2)   A dispute as to the proper calculation of the amount due from the
person. This shall not include, however, an objection to the overall
establishment of the storm water utility charge or the charge per ERU
established by the City Council or the establishment of classes of impervious
surface area.
      (3)   A discretionary decision implementing a rule adopted by the Council
if an appeal is provided in the action adopting the rule.
   B.   The initial appeal shall be filed in writing and addressed to the City
Clerk. The appeal must be received in the office of the City Clerk no later
than the 30th day after the action that is being appealed. The 30 days shall be
calculated from the due date of a bill, or a reissued bill, whichever is later.
   C.   The appeal filed in the office of the City Clerk shall be heard by the
City Council. The appellant shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to
submit written and oral support for the appellant's position. The City Council
shall issue a written decision within 30 days after the receipt of the appeal,
or ten days after receipt of the last information by the appellant in support
of the appellant's position, whichever is later.
   D.   The written decision of the City Council may be appealed to District
Court. Failure to properly exhaust the administrative remedies provided in this
section shall constitute a bar to judicial relief.

excess of typical costs of franchise fee administration.
111.22   FEE REFUNDS.
The Company shall not, under any circumstances be required to return or refund

a franchise fee or the ability of Company to collect from City customers and
remit franchise fees to City. Within 60 days of final franchise fee action, the
City shall notify Company and the parties shall meet to determine whether this
chapter can be revised, and, if so, how to revise the franchise fee on a
continuing basis to meet revised legal requirements. After final franchise fee
action and until passage by the City of revisions to the franchise fee

franchise fee if in its sole opinion it believes it is required to do so in
order to comply with revised legal requirements.
111.24   OBLIGATION RELIEVED.

party shall have 60 days to cure the breach, unless it notifies the non-
breaching party, and the parties agree upon a longer period for cure. If the
breach is not cured within the cure period, the non-breaching party may
terminate this franchise. A party shall not be considered to be in breach of

136.10 Failure to Repair or Barricade
 
136.01   PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to enhance safe passage by citizens on
sidewalks, to place the responsibility for the maintenance, repair,
replacement, or reconstruction of sidewalks upon the abutting property owner
and to minimize the liability of the City.
136.02   DEFINITIONS.
For use in this chapter the following terms are defined:
1.   “Broom finish” means a sidewalk finish that is made by sweeping the
sidewalk when it is hardening.
2.   “Established grade” means that grade established by the City for the
particular area in which a sidewalk is to be constructed.
3.   “One-course construction” means that the full thickness of the concrete is
placed at one time, using the same mixture throughout.
4.   “Owner” means the person owning the fee title to property abutting any
sidewalk and includes any contract purchaser for purposes of notification
required herein. For all other purposes, “owner” includes the lessee, if any.
5.   “Portland cement” means any type of cement except bituminous cement.
6.   “Sidewalk” means all permanent public walks in business, residential or
suburban areas.
7.   “Sidewalk improvements” means the construction, reconstruction, repair,
replacement, or removal, of a public sidewalk and/or the excavating, filling,
or depositing of material in the public right-of-way in connection therewith.
8.   “Wood float finish” means a sidewalk finish that is made by smoothing the
surface of the sidewalk with a wooden trowel.
136.03   REMOVAL OF ACCUMULATIONS OF SNOW AND ICE.
The abutting property owner is responsible for the removal of the natural
accumulations of snow and ice from the sidewalks within 24 hours after the
cessation of a snow or ice storm. If a property owner does not remove the
natural accumulations of snow and ice within said 24-hour period, the Mayor or
Clerk, upon receipt of a complaint from any person or upon his or her own
initiative, may cause the snow and ice to be removed by the City and the costs
thereof to be assessed against the property owner for collection in the same
manner as a property tax. The abutting property owner may be liable for damages
caused by the failure of the abutting property owner to use reasonable care in
the removal of the snow or ice. If damages are to be awarded under this section
against the abutting property owner, the claimant has the burden of proving the
amount of the damages. To authorize recovery of more than a nominal amount,
facts must exist and be shown by the evidence which afford a reasonable basis
for measuring the amount of the claimant’s actual damages and the amount of
actual damages shall not be determined by speculation, conjecture or surmise.
All legal or equitable defenses are available to the abutting property owner in
an action brought pursuant to this section. The City’s general duty under this
section does not include a duty to remove natural accumulations of snow or ice
from the sidewalks. However, when the City is the abutting property owner, it
has the specific duty of the abutting property owner set forth in this section.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[2b and e])
136.04   PROPERTY OWNER’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAINTENANCE.
The abutting property owner shall maintain in a safe and hazard-free condition

(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12(2)(c))
(Section 136.04 – Ord. 617 – Dec. 24 Supp.)
136.05   CITY MAY ORDER REPAIRS.
If the abutting property owner does not maintain sidewalks as required, the
Council may serve notice on such owner, by certified mail, requiring the owner
to repair, replace or reconstruct sidewalks within a reasonable time and if
such action is not completed within the time stated in the notice, the Council
may require the work to be done and assess the costs against the abutting
property for collection in the same manner as a property tax.

reconstructed, a curb ramp or sloped area shall be constructed or installed at
each intersection of the sidewalk or path with a street, highway, or road. Curb
ramps and sloped areas that are required pursuant to this subsection shall be
constructed or installed in compliance with applicable federal requirements
adopted in accordance with the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act,
including (but not limited to) the guidelines issued by the Federal

tracking and delivery information send a notice to the owner describing the
violation, stating the act or acts necessary to comply with this chapter,
stating the time in which compliance is required, and stating that if the
required actions are not satisfactorily completed by the owner, the City will
take the required actions and assess the costs against the owner and/or the
property. In the event the required actions are not undertaken or
satisfactorily completed by the owner as required and by the time specified in
the Clerk’s notice, the City may abate such violation by one or more of the
following means:

158.01   SITE PLANS.
Site Plans are required whenever the owner of any property in the City
undertakes new construction or reconstruction, expands an existing building by
twenty or more percent of the area of the existing building, or remodels an
existing building with a building permit value of $25,000.00 or more
(collectively “improvements” or “development”), except for the construction of
single-family and two-family homes on existing platted lots. Site Plans are
required for multiple-family dwellings and townhomes. As a part of the
submittal of a Site Plan, architectural plans also shall be submitted for the
development or redevelopment of any property within the City. The owners of
proposed agricultural outbuildings shall submit architectural plans; however,
the Council, upon recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission, may,
on a case-by-case basis exempt the proposed agricultural outbuildings from the
architectural standards established in this chapter. Single-family residences
and two-family residences are, however, exempt from the architectural standards
established in this chapter and from the requirement to submit architectural
plans.
158.02   STATEMENT OF INTENT.
It is the intent and purpose of this chapter to establish a procedure which
will enable the City to review certain proposed improvements to and development
of property. The Site Plan shall be designed to reflect consideration for (a)
impacts to existing and proposed developments surrounding the site; (b) impact
on public rights-of-way, utilities, facilities and services; and (c) impact to
existing on-site conditions. Further, in the interest of promoting the general
welfare of the community and to protect the value of buildings and property,
the image and character of a community is considered important. It is
recognized that the community should be visually attractive, and the manner in
which a use is accomplished is as important as the use. The quality of
architecture, building construction and building materials is important to the
preservation and enhancement of building and property values, prevention of the
physical deterioration of buildings, the promotion of the image of the
community, and the general welfare of its citizens.
158.03   DESIGN STANDARDS.
Site Plans shall reflect the following standards of design which are necessary
to insure the orderly and harmonious development of property in such manner as
will safeguard property values and the public’s health, safety and general
welfare:
1.   The design of the proposed improvements shall make adequate provisions for
surface and subsurface drainage, for connections to water and sanitary sewer
lines, each so designed as to neither overload existing public utility lines
nor increase the danger of erosion, flooding, landslide, or other endangerment
of adjoining or surrounding property.
2.   The proposed development shall be designed with a proper regard to
topography, surface drainage, natural drains and streams, wooded area, and
other natural features which will lend themselves to proper, harmonious and
attractive development of the site.
3.   The proposed improvements shall be designed and located within the
property in such manner as not to unduly diminish or impair the use and
enjoyment of adjoining property, and to this end shall minimize the adverse
effects on such adjoining property from automobile headlights, illumination of
required perimeter yards, refuse containers, and impairment of light and air.
Lighting, and its impact on adjacent property, shall be shown on the Site Plan.
For the purpose of this section, the term “use and enjoyment of adjoining
property” shall mean the use and enjoyment presently being made of such
adjoining property, unless such property is vacant. If vacant, the term “use
and enjoyment of adjoining property” shall mean those uses permitted under the
zoning district in which such adjoining property is located.
4.   The proposed development shall have such entrances and exits upon adjacent
streets and such internal traffic circulation pattern as will not unduly
increase congestion on adjacent or surrounding public streets. Any proposed
development which will include a loading dock or truck entrance facing an
exterior street must, as a part of the Site Plan approval process, conform to
any and all requirements which may be established by the City with respect to
the location of such loading dock or truck entrance.
5.   The proposed development shall have such buffers, screen fences and
landscaping and shall be designed, and the buildings and improvements located,
in such a manner as to not unduly diminish or impair the use and enjoyment of
adjoining or surrounding property. Buffers are required to minimize the impact
of automobile headlights on adjacent non-commercial property.
6.   The proposed development shall not duly increase the public danger of fire
or diminish the public safety, and shall be designed to adequately safeguard
the health, safety and general welfare of the public and of persons residing
and working in the development and in the adjoining or surrounding property.
7.   The proposed development shall utilize storm water management to limit the
release from any site to no more than a five-year undeveloped release rate.
8.   The proposed development shall conform to all applicable provisions of the
Code of Iowa, as amended, and all applicable provisions of the Code of
Ordinances, as amended.
158.04   STORMWATER DRAINAGE REQUIREMENTS – OVERLAND FLOW CHANNEL.
Overland flow channels for stormwater runoff downstream of stormwater runoff
surface drainage outlets, overflow structures, pipes and culverts shall be
designed as vegetative swales with soft armor protection as appropriate.
Whenever possible the use of bioretention/filtration practices shall be
implemented along overland flow channels.
Vegetated swales shall be reinforced by transition mats and turf reinforcement
mats as required to prevent erosion. Requirements for channel protection shall
be calculated based on the unvegetated or installation day performance ratings.
Documentation shall be submitted for all stormwater drainage channels,
including the design of soft armor protection and bioretention/filtration
practices.
The City reserves the right to require the incorporation of bioretention/
filtration practices for any overland flow channel for which the City
determines such practices are practical as a means of reducing and filtering
runoff.
The use of rip-rap or similar hard armor protection of overland flow channels
is discouraged and shall be implemented only with the approval of the City.
158.05   OUTDOOR LIGHTING REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS.
The provisions of this section are intended to reduce the problems created by
improperly designed and installed outdoor lighting; and to eliminate problems
of glare, minimize light trespass, and help reduce the energy and financial
costs of outdoor lighting by limiting the area that certain kinds of outdoor-
lighting fixtures can illuminate and by limiting the total allowable
illumination of properties subject to the requirements of this chapter.
Property owners should install luminaries with the idea of being a “good
neighbor” by keeping unnecessary direct light from shining onto abutting
properties and streets, and so that outdoor lighting does not interfere with
the reasonable use and enjoyment of property within the City. It is the intent
of this section to encourage lighting practices that will reduce light
pollution by reducing up-light, glare, and over-lighting.
1.   Definitions. For the purposes of this section, terms used shall be defined
as follows:
   A.   “Direct light” means light emitted directly from the lamp, off of the
reflector or reflector diffuser, or through the refractor or diffuser lens, of
a luminaire.
   B.   “Fixture” means the assembly that houses the lamp or lamps and can
include all or some of the following parts: a housing, a mounting bracket or
pole socket, a lamp holder, a ballast, a reflector or mirror, and/or a
refractor or lens.
   C.   “Fully shielded lights” means outdoor light fixtures shielded or
constructed so that no light rays are emitted by the installed fixture at
angles above the horizontal plane as certified by a photometric test report.
   D.   “Glare” means direct light emitted from a luminaire with an intensity
great enough to cause visual discomfort, eye fatigue, a reduction in a viewer’s
ability to see, or in extreme cases momentary blindness.
   E.   “Grandfathered luminaires” means luminaires not conforming to this
section that were in place at the time this section became effective.
   F.   “Lamp” means the component of a luminaire that produces the actual
light.
   G.   “Light trespass” means the shining of light produced by a luminaire
beyond the boundaries of the property on which it is located.
   H.   “Lumen” means a unit of luminous flux. One foot-candle is one lumen per
square foot. For the purposes of this section, the lumen-output values shall be
the initial lumen output ratings of a lamp.
   I.   “Luminaire” means a complete lighting system, and includes a lamp or
lamps and a fixture.
   J.   “Outdoor lighting” means the night-time illumination of any outside
area or object by any man-made device located outdoors that produces light by
any means.
   K.   “Up-lighting” means lighting that is directed in such a manner as to
shine light rays above the horizontal plane.
2.   Control of Glare – Luminaire Design Factors.
   A.   Any luminaire with a lamp rated at more than 1,800 lumens shall not
emit, in its installed position, any direct light above a horizontal plane
through the lowest direct light emitting part of the luminaire.
   B.   Any luminaire with a lamp rated at more than 1,800 lumens shall not
emit in its installed position any more than five percent of its total light
output in the zone from 10 degrees below the horizontal to the horizontal plane
through the lowest direct light emitting part of the luminaire.
3.   Exceptions to Control of Glare.
   A.   Any lighting source producing 1,800 lumens or less shall be exempt from
the restrictions and regulations of this section.
   B.   All temporary emergency lighting needed by the Police or Fire
Departments or other emergency services, as well as all vehicular luminaires,
shall be exempt from this section.
   C.   All hazard warning luminaires required by Federal regulatory agencies
are exempt from this section.
   D.   A building or structure that has been designated for historic
preservation by the City, the State, or any agency of the United States
Government shall be exempt from the “fully shielded” requirements, if an
historic restoration cannot be achieved by other means.
4.   Outdoor Advertising Signs.
   A.   Lighting fixtures used to illuminate an outdoor advertising sign shall
be mounted on the top of the sign structure. All such fixtures shall be “fully-
shielded lights.” An exception to this requirement may be allowed for ground-
mounted monument signs. Ground-mounted monument signs may be illuminated with a
ground-mounted or a bottom-mounted lighting fixture, provided that the light
output shall be directed totally to the monument sign surface to prevent up-
lighting and glare.
   B.   Outdoor advertising signs of the type constructed of translucent
materials and wholly illuminated from within do not require shielding. Dark
backgrounds with light lettering or symbols are preferred, to minimize
detrimental effects.
   C.   Electrical illumination of outdoor advertising off-site signs between
the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. shall only be done by means of lights
directed downward.
5.   Recreational Facilities. Lighting of outdoor recreational facilities
(public or private), such as, but not limited to, football fields, soccer
fields, baseball fields, softball fields, tennis courts, special event or show
areas, shall meet the following conditions:
   A.   All fixtures used for such lighting shall be “fully shielded,” or be
designed or provided with sharp cut-off capability, so as to minimize up-light,
spill-light, and glare.
   B.   Illumination of the playing field, court, track, or event site after
midnight is prohibited except to conclude a scheduled event that was scheduled
to be completed before 11:00 p.m. that circumstances prevented concluding
before 11:00 p.m.
6.   Grandfathering of Nonconforming Luminaires. Luminaires lawfully in place
prior to the effective date of this section shall be grandfathered. Such
grandfathered luminaires may be replaced with a like kind of luminaire unless
more than 50 percent of the like kind of luminaires on the same premises are
being replaced. In such case all of the replacement luminaires on the premises
shall meet the standards of this section.
7.   Light Trespass. All nonexempt outdoor lighting fixtures shall be designed,
installed, and maintained to prevent light trespass. Outdoor lighting fixtures
shall be installed and thereafter maintained so as not to cause direct light
from the luminaire to be directed toward residential buildings on adjacent or
nearby property or nearby land. If such condition should occur, the luminaire
shall be redirected or its light output shall be controlled as necessary to
eliminate such condition.

2.   The Site Plan must provide a distance of at least 23 feet from the
property side of any sidewalk to any garage face.
3.   Sidewalks shall be required along both sides of all streets unless an
alternate pedestrian access plan is approved that provides access to all
residential dwelling units.
158.09   ARCHITECTURAL PLANS.
Architectural plans for buildings (other than a single-family residence, two-
family residence, three-family residence, or any agricultural outbuilding)
shall be submitted simultaneously with the Site Plan. Architectural plan
documentation that must be submitted includes: (a) building elevations
indicating the building design and a description of the structural elements;
(b) a colored visual depiction; and (c) a description and percentage
calculation of the primary or predominant exterior construction materials and
trim to be used. A material board shall also be submitted to the City Engineer
prior to consideration by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
158.10   ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS.
The standards outlined in this section shall be utilized in all reviews of
architectural plans.
1.   Primary Exterior Material of Structures Subject to Architectural
Standards. Building architectural design shall recognize the importance of
material strength and permanency through the selection of building materials.
The primary exterior building material, less glass, shall constitute at least
75 percent of each façade area to which these standards apply. The primary
exterior material shall consist of a combination of brick, architectural
concrete panels, textured concrete block, architectural metal or stone panels.
The primary exterior material must be utilized on the front and the two sides
of any building, except as may be required by Section
158.08(4) of this chapter. However, no wood, masonite, asphaltic exterior wall
material, aluminum or steel siding, non-architectural sheet metal, non-textured
concrete block, stucco, vinyl, E.I.F.S. (Exterior Insulation and Finish
Systems) or other similar materials shall constitute a portion of the front and
two sides of any of the exterior walls of any building as a primary exterior
material. The remaining exterior materials utilized on the front and two sides
of the exterior walls shall be considered as building trim or accent. The term
“architectural metal” refers to an exterior steel product with concealed
fasteners other than siding.
2.   Building Trim and Accent Defined. For the purpose of this chapter, “trim”
or “accent” is defined as an ornamental design feature that, when removed,
significantly alters the appearance of the building. It would commonly consist
of building elements like moldings, cornices, parapet, frieze, sills, lintels,
string course, quoining, and ledgment. The maximum amount of trim or accent on
each façade area to which these standards apply shall not exceed 25 percent.
Materials used for trim or accent may, in addition to permitted primary
exterior materials, include wood, plastic, asphaltic exterior wall material,
aluminum or steel siding with concealed fasteners, stucco, vinyl, or
cementitious material based siding. In addition, E.I.F.S. (Exterior Insulation
and Finish Systems) may be used for trim and accent seven feet and higher from
the ground level of the building. Materials that are part of a recognized
corporate identity mark are permitted. Concrete block and materials with
exposed fasteners are not permitted.
3.   Wall Area Defined. In the application of these requirements, some
standards are based upon a percentage of the wall area. The “wall area” is
defined as the total square feet of the exterior elevation of the building in a
single plane that is perpendicular to the point-of-view and vertical to the
ground. It may contain a gable and/or dormer in the same plane of view. It does
not contain the elevation of a pitched roof, but would include the area of a
parapet wall. Each elevation must comply with the standards unless otherwise
approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
4.   Buildings that Face Streets, Other Public Places and Residential
Districts. A wall or side of a building that faces or is visible from a public
street, highway or roadway, recreational area, park, or a residential district
that is within 250 feet of that particular wall or side shall be built
consistent in design and use of primary exterior materials.
5.   Other Materials. The Council, in its sole discretion and after receiving a
recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission, may approve additional
primary materials and trim on a case-by-case basis, provided that such
materials and trim exhibit the structural strength and permanency desired,
contain sufficient architectural relief, and do not detract from the desired
aesthetic character of the building and the surrounding area.
6.   Loading Docks, Service Areas, and Drive-Thru Windows. Buildings shall not
expose loading docks, service areas, overhead doors, equipment (transformers,
generators, compressors, etc.), drive-thru windows, menu boards, and similar
features to the public right-of-way or to adjacent residential property, parks,
or recreational areas.
7.   Roof-Mounted Equipment. Roof-mounted mechanical, communications, or other
similar equipment shall be screened from view from the public right-of-way and
adjacent residential property, parks, or recreational areas by the use of
parapet walls or other roof structures. If a parapet wall or other roof
structure cannot feasibly screen the roof-mounted equipment, point-in-place or
other appropriate screening with similar design features to the building,
including material, shape, and color shall be required.
8.   Façade Modulation and Future Reuse. Commercial buildings shall be designed
to reduce the appearance of a box by incorporating façade modulation into all
building elevations, including with use of physical offsets and the use of
color, pattern, texture, and human scale elements in order to reduce the
negative aesthetic impact of long, expansive wall surfaces. In addition to
ensure the longevity and future usability of larger commercial buildings,
articulation and structural offsets shall be provided to ensure future reuse of
the structure by smaller user groups. The building shall be visually separated
into masses conducive to such reuse.
9.   Architectural Standards for Multiple-Family Dwelling and Townhome
Projects. Multiple-family and townhome projects shall be designed in compliance
with certain standards which shall be set forth in the presentation of the
architectural plan.
   A.   New buildings design should respect the context of any adjacent
residential neighborhood including the height, scale, mass, form and character
of the surrounding residential development.
   B.   Multiple-family and townhome developments shall provide a quality and
architectural character that avoids monotonous and featureless building design.
   C.   Each building in a multiple-family and townhome development should have
distinctive, yet consistent style. Fronts of buildings should be articulated
through the use of bays, balconies, porches or stoops relating to entrances,
windows and garages within the consistent architectural style. Unique style
presentations should be provided through the use of varying articulations from
building to building.
   D.   All sides of a multiple-family or townhome building shall be
constructed of similar features and architectural presentation. The buildings’
primary architectural features shall not be restricted to a single façade.
   E.   Garage doors shall constitute not more than the following percentage of
the lineal frontage distance of any multiple-family or townhome building:
One car attached   40 percent
Two car attached   50 percent
Three car attached   60 percent
   F.   All apartments, condominiums, and three-story above grade townhomes
shall incorporate a minimum of 40 percent brick or masonry in the overall
building design. Window and door openings shall count for this requirement if
completely surrounded by the brick or stone masonry material.
   G.   All single story and two-story townhome developments shall have a
minimum of 25 percent brick or masonry surfacing on the front side of the
building.
   H.   A variety of roof forms is encouraged to denote building elements and
functions.
10.   Screening. The outdoor placement of electrical or mechanical equipment,
as well as receptacles for garbage, trash and recycling, shall require the
placement and maintaining of a physical screen.
   A.   The requirement for screening shall be accomplished by landscaping
(including trees, shrubs and plants), earthen berms, solid walls, or a
combination thereof.
   B.   A written screening plan shall be submitted for review and approval as
a part of the architectural plan, or as a separate plan, and shall be submitted
simultaneously with the Site Plan and shall be considered with the Site Plan.
158.11   AMENDMENTS TO APPROVED SITE PLANS.
An approved Site Plan may be amended when there is any change in location,
size, design, conformity or character of buildings and other improvements,
provided that the amended Site Plan conforms to the provisions of this chapter
and other provisions of the Code of Ordinances. An amended Site Plan shall be
submitted to the City and reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission and
approved by the City Council in the same manner as an original Site Plan.
158.12   ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS.
As a part of the Site Plan approval process, the property owner may be required
by the Council to install public utilities, including but not limited to, water
lines, storm sewer, sanitary sewer, fire hydrants and such other utilities as
applicable to properly serve the proposed plan. The property owner may also be
required by the Council to construct street paving and sidewalks as applicable
to properly serve the proposed plan. Where required as part of a Site Plan
approval, utilities, streets and sidewalks shall be constructed in accord with
the City’s construction standards for those portions within the public right-
of-way and to be dedicated to the City. Utilities, streets and sidewalks may
also be required to be constructed to the same specifications for those
undedicated portions where such utilities and improvements may have a direct
affect on the future safety, proper functioning and maintenance of those
portions to be dedicated.
158.13   EXPIRATION OF APPROVAL.
All Site Plan approvals shall expire and terminate three hundred and 365 days
after the date of Council approval unless a building permit has been issued for
the construction provided for in the Site Plan. The Council may, upon written
request by the property owner, extend the time for the issuance of a building
permit for 60 additional days. In the event the building permit for
construction provided for in a Site Plan expires or is cancelled, then such
Site Plan approval shall thereupon terminate.
158.14   FEE FOR SITE PLAN REVIEW.
All costs in excess of $200.00 incurred by the City, including engineers’
costs, shall be reimbursed to the City by the person submitting the Site Plan
and any amended Site Plan.

160.02   STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
1.   The Legislature of the State of Iowa has, in Chapter 414 of the Code of
Iowa, as amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to
secure safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
2.   Findings of Fact.
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation
which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of
the community.
   B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by:
(i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
   C.   This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Paragraph 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
   A.   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows so
that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
   B.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
   C.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
   D.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
   E.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
1.   Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter shall apply
to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City which are located within the
boundaries of the Floodplain (Overlay) District as established in this Section
160.05.
2.   Rules for Interpretation of Floodplain (Overlay) District. The boundaries
of the Floodplain (Overlay) District areas shall be determined by scaling
distances on the official Flood Insurance Rate Map. When an interpretation is
needed as to the exact location of a boundary, the Zoning Administrator shall
make the necessary interpretation. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and
decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement,
decision, or determination made by the Zoning Administrator in the enforcement
or administration of this chapter.
3.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used, and no structure
shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
4.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
5.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
6.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated Floodplain (Overlay) District areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create
liability on the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
7.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.

the Floodplain District.
   B.   Any development which involves placement of structures, factory-built
homes, fill or other obstructions, storage of materials or equipment,
excavation or alteration of a watercourse shall be reviewed by the Department
of Natural Resources to determine (i) whether the land involved is either
wholly or partly within the floodway or floodway fringe and (ii) the base flood
elevation. The applicant shall be responsible for providing the Department of
Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make the
determination.
   C.   Review by the Iowa Department of Natural Resource is not required for
the proposed construction of new or replacement bridges or culverts where:
      (1)   The bridge or culvert is located on a stream that drains less than
two square miles, and
      (2)   The bridge or culvert is not associated with a channel modification
that constitutes a channel change as specified in 567-71.2(2), Iowa
Administrative Code.
2.   All development must be consistent with the need to minimize damage and
meet the following applicable performance standards. Where base flood
elevations and floodway data have not been provided on the Flood Insurance
Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute
such data. The applicant will be responsible for providing the Department of
Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make such
determination.
3.   All Development. All development within the Floodplain (Overlay) District
shall:
   A.   Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or

hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
      (1)   A minimum of two openings, with positioning on at least two walls,
having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot
of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
      (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade.
      (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
   Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access and
low damage potential storage. Where the distance between the floor and ceiling
of the fully enclosed area below the lowest floor is five feet or more, the
applicant shall be required to sign and record with the Dallas County Recorder
a Non-Conversion Agreement that ensures the lower enclosed area remains
compliant with the criteria outlined in this paragraph.

elevation.
   D.   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
plumbing, gas lines, water/gas meters and other similar service utilities
either elevated (or in the case of non-residential structures, optionally
floodproofed to) a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation or
designed to be watertight and withstand inundation to such a level.
7.   Factory-Built Homes:
   A.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including those
placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be elevated
on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the structure is a
minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation.
   B.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including those
placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be anchored
to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Anchorage systems may
include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground
anchors as required by the State Building Code.

consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements of
Subsection 7 of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built
homes.
15.   Pipeline River and Stream Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossings
shall be buried in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected
to prevent rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
16.   Maximum Damage Potential Development. All new or substantially improved
maximum damage potential development shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated a minimum of one foot above the elevation of the 500-year
flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed
to such a level. When flood proofing is utilized, a professional engineer
registered in the State of Iowa shall certify that the flood proofing methods
used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact
and uplift forces and other factors associated with the 0.2% annual chance
flood; and that the structure, below the 0.2% annual chance flood elevation is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water. A
record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in relation to
North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are flood proofed
shall be maintained by the Administrator. Where 0.2% chance flood elevation
data has not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The applicant will
be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with
sufficient technical information to make such determinations.
160.07   ESTABLISHMENT OF VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
1.   Appointment and Duties of Board of Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment
shall hear and decide (i) appeals and (ii) requests for variances to the
provisions of this ordinance, and shall take any other action which is required
of the Board of Adjustment.
2.   Appeals. Where it is alleged there is any error in any order, requirement,
decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the
enforcement of this chapter, the aggrieved party may appeal such action. The
notice of appeal shall be filed with the City Clerk and with the official from
whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason for the
appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to the Board
of Adjustment all the documents constituting the record upon which the action
appealed from was taken.
3.   Variance. The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in specific
cases such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary
hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.
   A.   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
   B.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
   C.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   D.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection
for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the applicant
shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator that: (i)
the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage;
and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
   E.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
4.   Hearings and Decisions of the Board of Adjustment.
   A.   Hearings. Upon the filing with the City Clerk of an appeal or a request
for a variance, the Board of Adjustment shall hold a public hearing. The Board
of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing and give public
notice thereof, as well as due notice to parties in interest. At the hearing,
any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney and present written or
oral evidence. The Board of Adjustment may require the appellant or applicant
to provide such information as is reasonably deemed necessary and may request
the technical assistance and/or evaluation of a professional engineer or other
expert person or agency, including the Department of Natural Resources.
   B.   Decisions. The Board of Adjustment shall arrive at a decision on an
appeal or variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an appeal, the
Board of Adjustment may, so long as such action is in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the
order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make
its decision, in writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons
for its decision. In granting a variance, the Board of Adjustment shall
consider such factors as contained in this section and all other relevant
sections of this chapter and may prescribe such conditions as contained in
Paragraph (B)(2) of this subsection.
      (1)   Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board of Adjustment Shall Be
Based. In passing upon applications for variances, the Board of Adjustment
shall consider all relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter
and:
         a.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
         b.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
         c.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability
of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
         d.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         e.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the City.
         f.   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
         g.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
         h.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development
and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
         i.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for the area.
         j.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         k.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.
         l.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer,
gas, electrical and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
         m.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
chapter.
      (2)   Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this
chapter. Such conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
         a.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
         b.   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
         c.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed
restrictions.
         d.   Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this chapter.
         e.   Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the
flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration,
rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated
with the regulatory flood. The Board of Adjustment shall require that the
applicant submit a plan or document certified by a registered professional
engineer that the floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory
flood protection elevation and associated flood factors for the particular
area.
5.   Appeals to the Court. Any person or persons, jointly or severally,
aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Adjustment may present to a court of
record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal,
in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition
shall be presented to the court within thirty days after the filing of the
decision in the office of the City Clerk.
160.08   NONCONFORMING USES.
1.   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before
the passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but which
is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be continued
subject to the following conditions:
   A.   If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any future use
of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
   B.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
   C.   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless
it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
State or local health, sanitary, building, or safety codes or regulations or
the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
designation.
2.   Except as provided in Subsection (1)(B) of this section, any use which has
been permitted as a variance shall be considered a conforming use.
160.09   PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with grants of variances) shall constitute a municipal
infraction. Nothing herein contained prevent the City from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy violation.
160.10   AMENDMENTS.
The regulations and standards set forth in this chapter may from time to time
be amended, supplemented, changed, or repealed. No amendment, supplement,
change, or modification shall be undertaken without prior approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.

days by filing with the Clerk the notice of appeal specifying the grounds
thereof. The Clerk shall immediately provide a copy of the appeal to the Board,
and the Zoning Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Board all papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from is taken. An appeal
stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the
Zoning Administrator certifies to the Board, after notice of appeal shall have
been filed, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would,
in his or her opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case,
proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may
be granted by the Board or by a court of record on application on notice to the
Board and the Zoning Administrator, and on due cause shown. The Board shall fix
a reasonable time for the hearing on the appeal, give public notice thereof as
required by State law as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and
decide the same within a reasonable time. At the hearing any party may appear
in person or by agent, or by attorney.
4.   Jurisdiction and Powers. The Board of Adjustment shall have the following
powers, and it shall be its duty:
   A.   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any
order, requirements, decision, or determination made by the Zoning
Administrator in the enforcement of this chapter.
   B.   To grant a variation in the requirements of this chapter when a
property owner can show that the property was acquired in good faith and where
by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a specific piece
of property, or where, by reason of exceptional topographical conditions or
other extraordinary or exceptional situations, the strict application of the
terms of this chapter actually prohibits the use of the property in a manner
reasonably similar to that of other property in the district, or where the
Board is satisfied under the evidence before it, that the granting of such
variation will alleviate a clearly demonstrable hardship; provided, however all
variations granted under this section shall be in harmony with the intended
spirit and purpose of this chapter.
   C.   To permit exceptions to the district regulations set forth in this
chapter, provided all exceptions shall by their design, construction and
operation adequately safeguard the health, safety and welfare of the occupants
of adjoining and surrounding property, shall not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, shall not increase congestion in the public
streets, shall not increase public danger of fire and safety, and shall not
diminish or impair established property values in surrounding areas.
   D.   To permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a
district divides a lot in a single ownership as shown of record or by existing
contract or purchase at the time of the enactment of this chapter, but in no
case shall such extension of the district boundary line exceed 50 feet in any
direction.
   E.   To issue special permits as provided in sections
165.41 and
165.45 of this chapter.
5.   Board Procedures. In exercising its powers, the Board may, in conformity
with the provisions of law, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify
the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and may make
such order, requirement, decision or determination as it believes proper, and
to that end shall have all the powers of the Zoning Administrator. The
concurring vote of three of the members of the Board shall be necessary to
reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the Zoning
Administrator, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which
it is required to pass under this chapter; provided, however, the action of the
Board shall not become effective until after the resolution of the Board,
setting forth the full reason for its decision and the vote of each member
participating therein has been recorded in the minutes. Such resolution
immediately following the Board’s final decision, shall be filed in the office
of the City Clerk, and shall be open to public inspection. Every variance and
exception granted or denied by the Board shall be supported by a written
testimony or evidence submitted in connection therewith.
6.   Abandonment of Variances. Uses of land, and uses of structures which would
have otherwise be prohibited under the provisions of this chapter but have been
allowed by the granting of a variance may continue until such variance lapses
as provided in this section. In the event any such use of land or of a
structure is not commenced by July 1, 1997, or within two years of the issuance
of the variance, whichever is later, or is discontinued for a period of one
year after January 1, 1997, such variance shall lapse and any subsequent use of
such land or structure shall conform to the district regulations for the
district in which such land or structure is located.
7.   Appeals of Board Decisions. Any resident, or any officer, department, or
board of the City, or any person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved by
any decision of the Board may present to a court of record a petition, duly
verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part,
specifying the grounds of the illegality, such petition shall be presented to
the court within 30 days after the filing of the decision in the office of the
Board. Upon the presentation of such petition, the court may allow a writ of
certiorari directed to the Board to review such decision of the Board and shall
prescribe therein the time within which a return thereto shall be made, which
shall not be less than 10 days and may be extended by the court. The allowance
of the writ shall not stay proceedings upon the decision appealed from, but the
court may, on application, upon notice to the Board and on due cause shown
grant a restraining order. The Board shall not be required to return the
original papers acted upon by it, but it shall be sufficient to return
certified or sworn copies thereof or of such portion thereof as may be called
for by such writ. The return shall concisely set forth such other facts as may
be pertinent and material to show the grounds of the decision appealed from,
and shall be verified. If upon the hearing, which shall be tried de novo, it
shall appear to the court that testimony is necessary for the proper
disposition of the matter, it may take such evidence or appoint a referee to
take such evidence as it may direct and report the same to the court with
findings of act and conclusions of law, which shall constitute a part of the
proceedings upon which the determination of the court shall be made. The court
may reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify the decision brought up
for review. Costs shall not be allowed against the Board unless it shall appear
to the court that it acted with gross negligence or in bad faith or with malice
in making the decision appealed from.
165.14   SCHEDULE OF FEES.
1.   Establishment. The Council shall establish a schedule of fees, charges and
expenses, and a collection procedure for Certificates of Zoning Compliance,

public notice and hearing as provided by law, and after report by the Planning
and Zoning Commission, amend any provision of this chapter or make any change
in the zoning map, and such amendment or change in the zoning map shall not
become effective except by the favorable vote of a majority of all the members

property and its boundaries as to which the change or amendment is desired,
duly signed by the owners of 50 percent of the area of all real estate included
within the boundaries of said tract as described in said petition, and in
addition, duly signed by the owners of 50 percent of the area of all real
estate lying outside of said tract but within 200 feet of the boundaries
thereof [intervening streets and alleys not to be included in computing such

within 90 days after the filing of the report and recommendations from the
Planning and Zoning Commission.

map shall be acted upon by the Council until after a public hearing thereon by
the Planning and Zoning Commission. At least seven days’ notice of the time and
place of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation
in the City. After the public hearing before the Commission, the Commission
shall make a report and recommendations in writing to the Council.

signed by the owners of 20 percent or more either of the area of the lots
included in such proposed change in the zoning map, or of those immediately
adjacent in the rear thereof, extending the depth of one lot or not to exceed
200 feet therefrom, or of those directly opposite thereto, extending the depth
of one lot or not to exceed 200 feet from the street frontage of such opposite
lots, such change in the zoning map shall not become effective except by the
favorable vote of at least three-fourths of all the members of the Council.
5.   Procedure After Denial. Whenever any petition for an amendment or change
in the zoning map shall have been denied by the Council, then no new petition
covering the same property or the same property and additional property shall
be filed with or considered by the Council until one year shall have elapsed
from the date of action by the Council on the first petition. In the event the
appellant withdraws the petition for rezoning prior to final action by the
Council, no new petition covering the same property or the same property and
additional property shall be filed with or considered by the Council until six
months shall have elapsed from the date of withdrawal.
6.   Fees Required. Before any action shall be taken as provided in this
section, the party or parties proposing or recommending a change in the
district regulations or district boundaries shall deposit with the City the sum
of $100.00 to cover the approximate costs of this procedure and under no
conditions shall said sum or any part thereof be refunded for failure of said
amendment to be enacted into law.
165.16   COMPLAINTS REGARDING VIOLATIONS.
Whenever a violation of any provision of this chapter occurs, or is alleged to
have occurred, any person may file a written complaint, setting forth the

provisions of this chapter after having previously been found guilty of
violating the same provision at the same location or at a different location
shall be guilty of a repeat offense.
3.   Owners, Tenants, and Others. The owner or tenant of any building,

Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the City from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation of this
chapter. In case any building, structure, or sign is erected, constructed,
reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted, or maintained, or any building,
structure, sign, or land is used in violation of this chapter, the City, in
addition to other remedies, may institute any proper action or proceedings to
prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration,
repair, conversion, maintenance, or use, to restrain, correct, or abate such
violation, to prevent the occupancy of the building, structure, or land, or to
prevent any illegal act, conduct, business, or use in or about the premises.

Except as hereinafter specified, no building or structure shall be erected,
converted, enlarged, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered, nor shall
any building or land be used which does not comply with all of the district
regulations established by this chapter for the district in which the building
or land is located.
165.20   CONTINUING EXISTING USES.

chapter may be continued subject to the conditions set forth hereafter, even
though such use may not conform with the regulations of this chapter for the
district in which it is located.
165.21   NONCONFORMING USES IN ANY “R” DISTRICT.
Any building or land devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in a
Residential District in which such building or land is located, except when
required by law, shall not on one or more cumulative occasions be substantially
enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, substituted or structurally
altered, at a value of greater than 50 percent of the fair market value of the
existing building or land, unless the use thereof is changed to a use permitted
in the district in which such building, structure or premises is located,
except as follows:
1.   Substitution. If no substantial structural alterations are made, as
specified above, a nonconforming use of a building or structure may be changed

Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to more restricted use or to a
conforming use, such shall not thereafter be changed to a less restricted use.
2.   Discontinuance. In the event that a nonconforming use of any building,
structure or land is discontinued for a period of one year, the use of the same
shall conform thereafter to the uses permitted in the district in which it is
located. The use of land upon which no building or structure is erected or
constructed which does not conform to the provisions of this chapter and the
use of land upon which no building is erected or constructed which becomes
nonconforming by reason of a subsequent change in this chapter shall be
discontinued within six months from the date of the change.

damaged to an extent of 50 percent or more of its fair market value (prior to
destruction or damage by fire, flood, explosion, war, riot, or Act of God),
shall not be restored or reconstructed and used as before this chapter unless
brought into conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
165.22   NONCONFORMING USES IN ANY DISTRICT OTHER THAN AN “R” DISTRICT.

limited to buildings on land owned of record by the owner of the land devoted
to the nonconforming use prior to the effective date of this chapter, or shall
not be greater than 50 percent of the fair market value prior to the
enlargement or alteration. In the event of such structural alteration or
enlargement of buildings, the premises involved may not be used for any
nonconforming use other than the use existing on the effective date of this
chapter.
2.   Discontinuance. In the event that nonconforming use of any building or
premises is discontinued for a period of one year, the use of the same shall
conform thereafter to the uses permitted in the district in which it is

fence which exceeds seven feet in height, shall be erected in a required yard
or court, except as provided hereinafter.
1.   Accessory buildings, including roof overhangs, shall be at least three
feet from lot lines of adjoining lots which are in any “R” District, and at
least five feet from lot lines of adjoining lots which are in any “E” District.
On a corner lot they shall conform to the setback regulations on the side
street. There shall be at least five feet from any other separate building or
structure on the same lot, and at least five feet from any alley line, if any,
except that, when any entrance to an accessory building for automobile access
faces an alley, said accessory building shall be at least 20 feet from the
alley line.
2.   Accessory buildings, except buildings housing animals or fowl, may be
erected as part of the principal building or may be connected thereto by a
breezeway or similar structure, and such accessory building shall be considered
as part of the principal building for all yard requirements.
3.   A carport or garage for a residence may be in a side yard provided that a
full required side yard is provided between the garage or carport, and the side
lot line. An accessory building within 60 feet of the front lot line shall have
a full side yard between it and the side lot line.
4.   The garage building shall not exceed one story or 15 feet in height in any
“R” District, and shall not exceed 25 feet in height [with the exterior side

any “E” District”. The height shall be measured from grade, and shall include
the foundation of retaining walls.

(such as a tornado shelter, garage, wine cellar, etc.) may be constructed
beneath the ground surface of any yard area; providing said structure shall
comply with the following requirements.
   A.   No portion of the structure shall be located less than three feet,

allowable surface building area of the lot and shall not be located in any
required yard area.
6.   Accessory buildings and structures, regardless of height, which are
constructed above the normal ground surface in any required yard area shall not
occupy more than 30% of the yard area in which it is located; however, this
regulation shall not be interpreted to prohibit the construction of a garage
not to exceed 750 square feet gross building area in any “R” District, and not
to exceed 1,500 square feet gross building area on a lot containing one acre or
more in any “E” District.
7.   No structure, including a satellite dish antenna or antenna tower, shall

shall be increased by an amount not less than 20 feet so as to allow for the
additional required street side yard, i.e. for a minimum required lot width of
60 feet, the minimum width of a corner lot shall not be less than 80 feet. All
yards fronting a public street shall meet the minimum front yard setback. On
corner lots platted and of record as of October 8, 1996, the same regulations
shall apply except that this regulation shall not be interpreted as to reduce
the buildable width of the corner lot. On any corner lot, the depth of a front
yard abutting a street shall be measured from the right-of-way line.
165.26   FRONT YARD.
In any “R” District there shall be a minimum front yard depth required as
stated in the yard requirements for the particular district; provided, however:

located thereon, the front yard depth for the lots in the replat shall not be
less than the smallest front yard depth of existing dwellings located within
200 feet of the replat, but in no event shall the front yard depth be less than
the smallest front yard depth of existing dwelling immediately adjacent thereto
which fronts on the same side of the street;
2.   No front yard depth of any existing lot without a dwelling shall be less
than the smallest front yard depth of any lot with existing dwelling
immediately adjacent thereto and within 200 feet fronting on the same side of
the street.
Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted as to permit a front yard depth
which is less than the minimum required front yard depth for the district in
which it is located.
165.27   FENCES, WALLS, AND VISION CLEARANCE.
1.   On a corner lot, nothing shall be erected, placed, planted or allowed to
grow in such a manner as to impede vision between a height of two and one-half
(2½) feet and ten (10) feet above the centerline grades of the area described
as follows:

2.   In any district, fences and walls not exceeding seven (7) feet in height
are permitted within the limits of side and rear yards, which do not front on
any public street. A fence or wall not exceeding four (4) feet in height is
permitted within the limits of the front yard setback or side yard setback
fronting any public street. In the case of retaining walls supporting
embankments, the above requirements shall apply only to that part of the wall
above the ground surface of the retained embankment.
3.   In any district where a fence or wall is required by a section of this
chapter, the Subdivision Regulations (
Chapter 170), or other provision of this Code of Ordinances, to serve as a
screening wall, buffer wall or other separating or protective wall, the
restrictions of Subsection 1 above shall yield to the requirements of the
specific requirement.
4.   A building permit shall be obtained prior to the construction of any fence
or wall, except for single section privacy panels abutting a house and not
exceeding eight (8) feet in length. Privacy panels do not require a building
permit but shall still comply with all other requirements for fences including
being constructed only out of permitted materials. Fences inside a garden and
not exceeding eight (8) feet in length shall not require a building permit and
may be constructed of any material.
5.   In the construction of any fence the finished side, if any, shall face
outward. Posts and other supporting elements shall be on and face the property
where the fence is being erected.
6.   Within any overland flowage easement only a chain link fence may be
constructed.
7.   Fences shall be constructed of customarily used materials such as chain
link, wrought iron, aluminum, wood, or polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Wood fences
shall be constructed of treated lumber, cedar, redwood, or similar types of
wood that are resistant to decay. Fence materials may include sheet metal or
corrugated metal as long as the metal has finished edges, is framed by wood,
and has a consistent or even height. Fences shall not be constructed out of
materials such as chicken wire, temporary construction fencing, snow fencing,
plywood, or components commonly used for penning of livestock.
8.   Walls shall be constructed out of brick, stone, textured concrete, precast
concrete, or tile block.

shall be maintained in a good state of repair, including replacement of
defective or damaged parts, painting, and other acts required for maintenance.
10.   Alterations, modifications or improvements of more than fifty percent of
an existing fence shall require a building permit and shall require the owner
to bring the fence into compliance with all current fence requirements if it is
not already in compliance. Modifications of less than fifty percent of an
existing fence do not require a building permit.
11.   Subsection 5 through 10 of this section shall not applicable in the A-
1 Zoning District.
(Section 165.27 – Ord. 556 – Dec. 21 Supp.)
165.28   REQUIRED YARD CANNOT BE REDUCED.
No lot shall be reduced in size so as to make the width or total area of the
lot, or any yard, or any other open space, less than the minimum required by
this chapter. No part of a yard or other open space provided about any building
or structure for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this chapter
shall be included as a part of a yard or other open space required under this
chapter for another building or structure. Off-street parking and loading areas
may occupy part of any required yard or open space except as specified in
Section
165.42 of this chapter.
165.29   BUILDING LINES ON APPROVED PLATS.
Whenever the plat of a land subdivision approved by the Council and on record
in the Office of the County Recorder and County Auditor shows a setback
building line along any street frontage for the purpose of creating a front
yard line, the building line thus shown shall apply along such frontage in
place of any other yard line required in this chapter unless specific yard
requirements in this chapter require a greater setback.
165.30   PENDING CONSTRUCTION.
Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the overall layout, plans,
construction, size or designated use of any building, or part thereof, for
which approvals have been granted before October 8, 1996, the construction in
conformance with such plans shall have been started prior to the effective date
of this chapter and completion thereof carried on in a normal manner and not
discontinued for reason other than those beyond the builder’s control.

which is a minimum of six feet in height consisting of a solid wall of a
building, fence, dense vegetation or combination thereof. The flyway barrier
shall extend a minimum of twelve feet beyond the hive in all directions so that
all bees are forced to fly at an elevation of at least six feet above ground
level over the property line(s) of the apiary. Dense vegetation used as a

11.   The beekeeper shall indemnify and hold harmless the City from and against
all damages, claims, actions, suits, and demands arising form the beekeeper’s
beekeeping operation.
12.   In the event a beekeeping operation is determined to be in violation of
this chapter, the beekeeper and/or property owners shall be given written
notice of the violation and be allowed 14 days from the date of the notice to

Certain uses possess characteristics of such unique and special form as to make
impractical their being included automatically in any classes of use as set
forth in the various districts established by this chapter; therefore, these
uses shall be subject to certain conditions and standards set forth in this
section, and the authority for the location thereof shall be subject to review
by the Board of Adjustment following a public hearing and the issuance of a

required:
   A.   A vicinity map illustrating the approximate location of existing
buildings and all existing land use within 500 feet of the proposed site
boundaries.
   B.   As the uses herein are classified by possessing characteristics of
unique and special form making automatic inclusion in the various districts
impractical, a brief report, prepared by a qualified professional person, which
shall outline and illustrate the provisions and methods for the abatement of
undesirable effects on the public, which are peculiar to the use, such as, but
not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Traffic density and control.
      (2)   Excessive lighting.
      (3)   Noise level.
      (4)   Hazardous conditions to spectators, participants, trespassers, or

a vicinity where the arterial traffic system is inadequate to provide for the
increased traffic density.
   D.   Uses involving the extensive use of exterior lighting shall not be
located in a vicinity where such lighting may be hazardous to air or ground
traffic ways, and such uses shall not be located less than a distance required
to reduce the light intensity to normal residential street lighting intensity
at any “R” District boundary.
4.   Temporary Uses. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the
Board of Adjustment may without notice, public hearing or other procedures
described in this section for the issuance of a special use permit, issue a
special use permit authorizing the operation of a charitable or nonprofit

hours and the trailer, truck, or temporary building, shed or office is promptly
removed thereafter.
165.43   OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING AREAS.
It is the intent of this section to prevent traffic congestion and to provide
for proper traffic safety by preserving the public thoroughfares for the
unimpaired movement of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. The requirements of
this section are minimum and in the certain uses of land, these requirements
may be inadequate. Where review of the site plans and intended land use
indicate through the application of proven standards or experienced statistics
that the requirements herein are inadequate for the specific land use
adaptation, a greater requirement for off-street parking space is justified and
may be required to preserve the intent of this section.
1.   Off-Street Loading Space Required. In any district, except the “C-1”
Traditional Central Business District, in connection with every building or
part thereof hereafter erected, having a gross floor area of 10,000 square feet

street intersecting the street onto which the drive enters.
      (3)   Such drives shall have on each side a triangular area formed by the
intersection of the driveway line, the street line and a straight line joining
said lines at points 30 feet distant from their point of intersection. Within
such triangular area, no parking or loading or unloading shall be permitted,
nor shall there be any obstruction to traffic visibility.
   C.   In the Industrial District no parking space or access thereto, except
entrance to exit drives as limited in this section, shall be within five feet
of any lot line. Entrance or exit drives connecting the parking and the street

recreational vehicles, boats, construction equipment, and any other motor
vehicle equipped for street and highway travel shall be on an asphaltic or
Portland cement concrete paved parking area that extends the entire length of
the vehicle. Driveways for individual single-family detached or attached
townhouse style residences on private property shall be asphaltic concrete or
Portland cement concrete, and shall connect to the public (or private) street.
The Council may waive or modify to a lesser requirement any provision or
requirement contained in this subsection with respect to any new subdivision
platted in an “E” District, after review by the Planning and Zoning Commission
and provided such change adequately safeguards the general public and the
surrounding property.
6.   Ingress/Egress Access Points. In Commercial and Industrial Districts the
number and location of ingress/egress access points to the public street from
off-street parking areas shall be approved by the Council and located to limit
vehicular conflicts, provide acceptable location of driveway accesses to public
streets, preserve proper traffic safety and, so far as possible, not impair
movement of vehicular traffic on public streets.
7.   Public Street Accesses. In the “R-3”, Commercial, and Industrial
Districts, and so far as possible, public street accesses shall be located in
alignment with driveway approaches gaining access to the same public street

shall be accomplished by any one of the following methods:
   A.   In newly developed areas, creating as a permanent screen an area not
less than 30 feet in width with plantings of evergreen type trees, shrubs and
plants so as to provide year-round effectiveness.
   B.   In other areas, creating as a permanent screen an area not less than 15
feet in width with plantings of evergreen type trees, shrubs and plants so as
to provide year-round effectiveness, the specificity of which shall be
established by the Council in the Site Plan review process under
Chapter 158 of this Code of Ordinances.
   C.   An alley bordering the Central Business and Commercial District shall
constitute a sufficient buffer.
3.   Burden of Provision of a Buffer. The burden of provision and selection of
the buffer shall be as follows:
   A.   Where two different districts, requiring a buffer between them, are
both in an existing improved condition, the above requirement is not
retroactive and should a buffer be desired, it shall be by mutual agreement
between the property owners or as otherwise provided by law. However, in the
event of any or all of the improved property is abandoned, destroyed,
demolished, etc., for the purpose of renewal, redevelopment, etc., that portion
of such property being renewed, redeveloped, etc., shall be considered vacant
land subject to the requirements herein.
   B.   Where one of two different districts requiring a buffer between them is
partially developed, the developer of the vacant land shall assume the burden.
   C.   Where both districts, requiring a buffer between them, are vacant or
undeveloped except for agricultural use, the burden shall be assumed by the
developer as the land is improved or developed.
4.   Access Drives. (Repealed by Ordinance No. 599 – Dec. 23 Supp.)
5.   Waiver of Buffer Requirement. Where the line between two districts,
requiring a buffer, follows a street right-of-way, railroad, stream, or other
similar barrier, the requirement for a buffer may be waived by the Council in
the Site Plan review process under
Chapter 158 of this Code of Ordinances, provided such waiver does not permit
the exposure of undesirable characteristics of land use to public view. †

of approval signed by the Mayor and attested by the Clerk shall be attached to
the original application. Notice of the public hearing shall be published
pursuant to the provisions of State law.
6.   Design Standards. Even though Planned Unit Developments promote and permit
flexibility of design, certain standards must be applied to assure
compatibility of the project with the intent of the Zoning Code. These
standards include:
   A.   Permitted Uses. Normal permitted uses are those of a residential
character including single-family (detached or attached), two-family and/or
multiple-family dwellings and the usual accessory buildings, such as garages,
storage space, maintenance structures, and buildings for recreational purposes.
Commercial uses may be located with residential buildings. However, if such
uses are proposed to be contained within a separate free-standing structure:
      (1)   It must be so designed to reflect the residential character of the
development; and
      (2)   It may contain an identification sign no more than four square
feet, placed flush on one wall and generally not observable from the periphery
of the development.
   B.   Density. The permitted maximum dwelling unit density shall not exceed
what is allowable in the zoning district in which the Planned Unit Development
is constructed. Where a Planned Unit Development is proposed and is contained
within two or more zoning districts, density shall be determined by adding the
maximum dwelling units allowable for each proportional part.
   C.   Tract Size. There is no minimum tract size.
   D.   Parking. All parking must meet the requirements of the zoning district
in which the Planned Unit Development is constructed. Where a Planned Unit
Development is proposed and is contained within two or more zoning districts,
parking requirements shall be determined by the Council, but shall not be any
less restrictive than the existing requirements in the zones in which the
Planned Unit Development is constructed. Parking lot design consideration shall
be as follows:
      (1)   Parking areas shall be treated as an integral part of the
development in scale, location and character.
      (2)   Parking areas shall be arranged to discourage through traffic.
      (3)   As appropriate, parking areas shall be screened from adjacent
structures and streets with hedges, plantings, fences, earth berms, changes in
grade, and/or similar buffers.
      (4)   Parking areas shall be designed to allow for the drainage of
surface water without erosion, flooding, and other inconveniences.
   E.   Height. There shall be no maximum height requirement. However, heights
shall be regulated to the extent that it relates to the proposed development
and to the general area within which the development is proposed to be located.
   F.   Open Space. A major portion of any Planned Unit Development is its open
space provisions, the integration of which is closely tied to the total
development. However, no quantitative standards are established in this
section. Quality standards acknowledge the separate and multiple functions of
open preservation of natural site amenities. In designing the Planned Unit
Development, consideration shall be given to such functions. All land in the
Planned Unit Development indicated as common land and common open space shall
be maintained by one of the following methods:
      (1)   If the land is deeded to a Homeowner’s Association, the developer
shall file a declaration of covenants and restrictions that will govern the
association, which shall be submitted with the application for the Planned Unit
Development. The provisions shall include, but not be limited to:
         a.   The Homeowner’s Association must be established before the
dwellings are sold.
         b.   Membership must be mandatory for each home buyer and any
successive buyer.
         c.   The open space restrictions must be permanent.
         d.   The Homeowner’s Association must be responsible for liability
insurance, taxes, and the maintenance of recreational and other facilities.
      (2)   All or any part of the open space system may be conveyed to the
City by joint agreement of the developer and the City. Such conveyance may be
by dedication of easement.
   G.   Additional Requirements. Planned Unit Development plans, where
applicable, shall comply with the final plat requirements of the Subdivision
Regulations contained in
Chapter 170.
   H.   Other Considerations. A number of major factors should undergo
evaluation as a portion of design standards, including:
      (1)   Natural drainage areas shall be retained as appropriate and, if
necessary, improved.
      (2)   Due consideration shall be given to preserving natural site
amenities and minimizing the disturbance to the natural environment.
      (3)   Existing trees shall be preserved wherever possible. The location
of trees is to be considered in designing building location, underground
services, and paved areas.
      (4)   If the development includes floodplain areas, they shall be
preserved as permanent open space.
      (5)   Due consideration shall be given to the natural topography. Major
grade change shall be avoided. If the development includes hillsides and
slopes, special evaluation shall be given to geological conditions, erosion,
and topsoil loss. If unfavorable development conditions exist, the Council may
restrict clearing, cutting, filling, or other substantial changes in the
natural conditions of the affected area.
165.48   COUNTRY LIVING ESTATES PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
The Country Living Estates Planned Unit Development is created and approved as
of the effective date of Ordinance No. 308, pursuant to Section
165.46 of this chapter, and is reflected on the official Zoning Map established
pursuant to Section
165.05 of this Zoning Code.
1.   The Master Plan, approved by the Council, is a graphic representation of
the property included in the Country Living Estates Planned Unit Development
and delineates the approximate location and configuration of the parcels for
the purpose of easier reference for the applicable provisions of this section.
Changes or modifications to the graphic representation may be necessary to
acquire workable street patterns, grades, and usable building sites. The
graphic representation including the relationship of uses to each other, the
relationship of land use to the general plan framework, and development
requirements shall, however, be used as the guide for implementing the planned
unit development. The graphic representation is intended to convey the
developer’s conceptual plan, and is meant to be illustrative and to provide
guidance to all parties.
2.   Monument or landscape signs are permitted at the primary access to U.S.
Highway 169.
3.   The Master Plan document delineates 52 numbered lots and seven designated
lettered lots in the planned unit development. A lake is centrally located on
the parcel of land, and will constitute a portion of the adjacent lots. 50 lots
are available for single-family residences. Lot 14 will not be built upon as it
provides an area for water discharge from the dam for the lake. Lot 35 will be
a park area. Lot G is an outlot platted as a potential method of extending
Lakeshore Drive if additional development were to occur south of Country Living
Estates. Lots A and B will be deeded to the City of Dallas Center for highway
and street right-of-way, and Lots C, D, E, and F are the rights-of-way for
private streets within the development which on May 1, 2024, were deeded to the
City of Dallas Center as public streets.

as many as eight of the lots may have a frontage less than 75 feet so long as
such lots have a minimum frontage of 46 feet.
      (4)   The minimum front yard depth shall be 30 feet; the minimum side
yard depth shall be 20 feet; and the minimum rear yard depth shall be 30 feet.
5.   Streets. Adequate street rights-of-way shall be provided for the
construction, reconstruction, and widening of adjoining streets adjacent to, or
within the planned unit development. Rights-of-way in existing highways and
streets shall be dedicated to the City prior to recording the Final Plat. The
private streets within the development on May 1, 2024, were deeded to the City
of Dallas Center as public streets.
(Subsection 5 – Ord. 609 – Dec. 24 Supp.)
6.   Variances to Subdivision Requirements. Certain requirements of the chapter
on Subdivision Regulations are waived or modified for this development.
   A.   The following requirements with respect to the development are waived:
      (1)   The requirement of Section
170.16 of this Code of Ordinances that requires the construction of sidewalks
on each owner’s property.
      (2)   The requirement of Section
170.14 of the Code of Ordinances that water mains be constructed and installed
in accordance with the plans and specifications adopted by the Council, with
such waterlines accessible to each lot.
   B.   The requirement of Section
170.14 of the Code of Ordinances that requires concrete paving with curbs be
installed on all streets in the development dedicated for public use and that
requires they be constructed of Portland cement concrete, is modified to
provide that following May 1, 2024, such streets may be constructed with
asphalt concrete, with the final construction of said streets subject to the
approval of the City Engineer.
   C.   In lieu of water service being provided by the City of Dallas Center,
the provision of water by the Xenia Rural Water District is approved. However,
the installation of a dry hydrant in the vicinity of the proposed lake is
required, unless the City’s Fire Chief determines such installation is not
practical.
   D.   No requirement is imposed to upgrade that portion of 230th Street which
will be a part of the subdivision plat, and which will be dedicated to the
City.
   E.   The original designation of the interior streets as private roadways
was permitted, but on May 1, 2024, such streets were deeded to and dedicated to
the City of Dallas Center as public streets.
   F.   The requirement that all off-street parking and loading areas and
access roadways, including driveways for individual single-family residences on

date of its adoption unless and until the sign is altered or relocated. Every
sign permit issued by the Administrator shall become null and void if
manufacture is not commenced within 120 days from the date of such permit. If
work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for 120 days any time
after the work is commenced, a new permit shall be first obtained to do so, and
the fee will be one-half the amount required for a new permit for such work,
provided that no changes have been made in the original plans. Such permit may
not be unreasonably withheld, providing that proper application and payment of
permit fees is complied with.
166.08   APPLICATION FOR PERMIT.
Application for a permit in accordance with the requirement appearing at
Section
166.07, shall be made to the Administrator upon a form provided by the
Administrator and shall be accompanied by such information as may be required
to assure compliance with all appropriate laws and regulations of the City,
including:
1.   Name and address of owner of the sign.
2.   Name and address of owner or the person in possession of the premises
where the sign is located or to be located.
3.   Clear and legible drawings with description definitely showing location of
the sign which is the subject of the permit and all other existing signs whose
construction requires permits, when such signs are on the same premises.
4.   Drawings showing the dimensions, construction supports, sizes, electrical
wiring and components, materials of the sign and method of attachment and
character of structural members to which attachment is to be made. The design,
quality, materials and loading shall conform to the requirements of the
Building Code, as amended. If required by the Administrator, engineering data
shall be supplied on plans submitted certified by a duly licensed engineer.
166.09   EXEMPTIONS.
The following types of signs are exempt from the requirement of obtaining a
permit subject to the terms and conditions contained herein:
1.   Flags. The flying of individual national, State or City flags attached to
freestanding poles mounted on the ground, limited to a total of three in
number, provided that such flags shall not be used in such a way as to attract
the attention of the public for commercial purposes.
2.   Banners. Two flag banners shall be permitted for any model home, at the
time the model home is open for inspection. Each banner shall not exceed 15
square feet.
3.   Directional signs.
4.   Political signs, as permitted in Section
166.03(17).
5.   One nonilluminated residential identification sign, or combination of
signs, not exceeding three square feet in sign face and not exceeding four feet
in height if the sign is a fence or freestanding sign. Duplexes are permitted
two signs pursuant to this subsection.
6.   Real estate signs which are designed and installed pursuant to
166.04.
7.   Any window sign or combination of window signs, the area of which does not
exceed 20 percent of the window area, including door windows if any, on which
the sign or signs are located.
8.   Vehicle tow-away signs erected pursuant to State or City law.
9.   Seasonal/holiday signs, provided that their erection shall not occur prior
to 40 days before the season, holiday, or festive occasion and their removal
shall take place no less than 20 days after the season, holiday, or festive
occasion.
10.   A nonilluminated numerical address sign in a business/
commercial/industrial/nonresidentially zoned district, the sign area of which
does not exceed two square feet per sign face and a maximum aggregate sign area
of four square feet, not to exceed a height of 10 feet.
166.10   ISSUANCE OR DENIAL OF PERMIT.
The Administrator shall issue a permit for the erection, alteration, or
relocation of a sign within the City when an application therefor has been
properly made and the sign complies with all appropriate laws and regulations
of the City. The Administrator may, in writing, suspend or revoke a permit
issued under provisions of this section whenever the permit is issued on the
basis of a misstatement of fact or fraud. When a sign permit is denied by the
Administrator, he or she shall give written notice of the denial to the
applicant, together with a brief written statement of the reasons for the
denial. No permit for a sign issued hereunder shall be deemed to constitute
permission or authorization to maintain an unlawful sign nor shall any permit
issued hereunder constitute a defense in an action to abate an unlawful sign.
166.11   PERMIT FEES.
Applications for a permit shall be filed with the Administrator, together with
a permit fee for each sign in accordance with the following schedule.
1.   The fee for a permit, exclusive of any permit costs for electrical
components, shall be not less than $25.00 for any sign valued at $100.00 or
more.
2.   The fee shall be $10.00 for any sign valued at less than $100.00.
3.   An expedite fee of $50.00 shall be imposed any time an inspector is
required to make a special trip to inspect a sign not in conjunction with any
other inspections in the City at the same time.
In addition, when any sign is hereafter erected, placed, installed or otherwise
established on any property prior to obtaining permits as required by this
section, the fees specified hereunder shall be doubled but the payment of such
double fee shall not relieve any person from complying with other provisions of
this section or from penalties prescribed herein.
166.12   VARIANCES.
Since the strict application of the requirements of this chapter may work an
undue hardship on certain applicants, variances from the strict application of
the provisions of this chapter, except with respect to necessary approval by
the Planning and Zoning Commission, may be granted by the Council. Each
application for a variance under this section shall be in writing and shall
state the reasons for the request for a variance. The application shall be
signed by the applicant and the sign company, if any, responsible for the sign
for which the variance is being sought. The application shall be accompanied by
a filing fee in the amount of $50.00. Each application for a variance of the
provisions of this chapter shall first be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning
Commission, which shall review the application and make a written
recommendation to the Council regarding disposition of the application. Within
35 days of the receipt of the recommendation from the Planning and Zoning
Commission, the Council shall consider the application for the variance. The
Council may grant the variance, grant the variance with conditions, or deny the
application.
166.13   NOTICE OF CHANGE.
Whenever there is a change in the sign user, owner, or owner of the property on
which the sign is located, the new sign user, owner or new property owner shall
forthwith notify the Administrator of the change. No new sign permit is
required, unless the sign is altered or relocated.
166.14   INSPECTION.
The person erecting, altering or relocating a sign shall notify the
Administrator upon completion of the work for which permits are required.
1.   Inspections. All free-standing signs shall be subject to a footing
inspection, prior to erection, and all signs to a final electrical inspection
by the Administrator.
2.   Maintenance. Every sign in the City, including but not limited to those
signs for which permits or for which no permits or permit fees are required,
shall be maintained in good structural condition at all times. All signs,
including those exempted, shall be kept neatly painted, including all metal
parts and supports by which these conditions are deteriorating. An inspection
can be applied in two alternative methods:
   A.   The Administrator can request that a licensed sign company duly certify
and file with the City that the sign meets as nearly as possible all of the
structural, electrical and material specifications set out in this code or the
laws or regulations of the City; or
   B.   Alternatively, the City shall send out an inspector, and the inspector
shall verify that the sign is in a safe condition with respect to its physical
characteristics.
3.   Signs Declared Unlawful. The Administrator may declare any sign unlawful
if it endangers public safety by reasons of inadequate maintenance,
dilapidation or abandonment. Any such declaration shall state the reasons of
the Administrator for stating that the sign constitutes a safety hazard to the
general public. Any sign owned, kept, displayed or maintained by any person
within the City, the ownership keeping a display which is unlawful pursuant to
the provisions of this chapter is hereby declared to be in violation of this
chapter. The Administrator may declare any such sign to be unlawful, and such
declaration shall state in writing the reason or reasons why such sign and the
keeping, owning, maintenance, construction, and display or operation thereof,
is unlawful under the terms of this chapter, such declaration shall be sent to
the owner and shall include notification that unless such violation is
corrected within 30 days, said sign shall be removed at the owner’s expense.
166.15   NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
Nonconforming signs may be continued and maintained subject to the provisions
of Subsection 2 below, provided that a nonconforming sign shall not be
enlarged, reconstructed, structurally altered or changed in any manner, nor
shall copy on an on-premises nonconforming sign be changed to advertise or
identify any use other than that in operation on the effective date of this
chapter.
1.   Legally Nonconforming Signs. Such signs may be continued and maintained
subject to the provisions of Subsection 2 below, provided that a nonconforming
sign shall not be enlarged, reconstructed, structurally altered or changed in
any manner, nor shall copy on an on-premises nonconforming sign be changed to
advertise or identify any use other than that in operation on the effective
date of this chapter.
2.   Termination of Legally Nonconforming Signs. A legally nonconforming sign
shall immediately lose its legal status, and shall immediately comply with the
provisions of this chapter or be removed, if any of the following occurs:
   A.   Abandonment. Any sign which advertises or identifies a business,
product, or service that has not been available or in operation at the location
for more than 90 days, or which has not been maintained in a state of good
repair for such time, shall be deemed to be abandoned and nonconforming rights
extinguished, and shall be removed. This provision shall not apply to permanent
signs accessory to businesses which are open only on a seasonal basis, provided
there is a clear intent to continue operation of the business.
   B.   Destruction, Damage, or Obsolescence. If more than 60 percent of the
face of a sign is damaged or destroyed, or if a sign is structurally damaged,
the sign shall be brought in conformance with this chapter.
   C.   Amortization. Legally nonconforming signs shall be maintained only as
long as they advertise or identify the business or nature thereof in existence
on the effective date of this chapter. Change of copy, enlargement, relocation,
reconstruction, structural alteration, or other change shall not be permitted.
The right to maintain a legally nonconforming sign shall be deemed to run with
the business in existence on the effective date of this chapter and shall not
be transferable to another business, use, or lot, but shall expire along with
discontinuation of the business, service, or product being advertised on the
effective date of this chapter. Copy on off-premises signs and changeable copy
boards which is meant to be periodically changed may be changed without
affecting legally nonconforming status.
3.   Maintenance and Repair. Nothing in this chapter shall relieve the owner or
user of a legally nonconforming sign or the lot owner from maintaining such
sign in a state of good repair.
166.16   APPEALS.
Appeal may be taken to the Board of Adjustment from the Administrator’s denial
of a sign permit. The Administrator’s failure to either formally grant or deny
a sign application within 30 days of the date an application meeting the
requirements of this Code is filed shall be grounds for appeal to the Board of
Adjustment.

170.01   PURPOSE.
It is deemed essential to establish minimum standards for the design and
development of all new subdivisions so that existing developments will be
protected and so that adequate provisions are made for public utilities and
other public requirements and to improve the health, safety and general
welfare.
170.02   JURISDICTION.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 354.9 of the Code of Iowa, these
regulations are adopted by the City governing the subdivision of all lands
within the corporate limits of the City and governing subdivision of all lands
within two miles of the corporate limits. The standards and conditions applied
by the City for review and approval of a subdivision outside the corporate
limits shall be the same standards and conditions used for review and approval
of subdivisions within the City limits, or shall be the standards and
conditions for review and approval established by any agreement of the City and
Dallas County pursuant to Chapter 28E of the Code of Iowa. The Council may, by
resolution, waive its right to review a subdivision outside the corporate
limits or waive the requirements of any of its standards or conditions for
approval of subdivisions, and certify the resolution which shall be recorded
with the plat.
170.03   DEFINITIONS.

bounded by streets, highways, or ways, except alleys; or by streets, highways
or ways, except alleys and the exterior boundary or boundaries of the
subdivision.
3.   “Building lines” shall be shown on all lots intended for residential use
of any character, and on commercial and industrial lots when required by
regulations. Such building lines shall not be less than required by the zoning
regulations. Where the subdivided area is not under zoning control, the
Commission shall require building lines in accordance with the needs of each
addition.
4.   “City Engineer” means the City Engineer, consulting engineer or any other
agent of the City designated to fulfill the function of City Engineer with
respect to this chapter.
5.   “Commission” means the Planning and Zoning Commission of the City.

the major system of arterial streets and highways, including the principal
entrance streets of a residential development and streets for circulation
within such a development.
7.   “Cul-de-sac” means a short, minor street, having one end open to motor
traffic, the other end being permanently terminated by a vehicular turn-around.
8.   “Easement” means a grant by the property owner of the use for a specific
purpose, of a strip of land by the general public, a corporation, or a certain
person or persons, and within the limits of which the owner of the fee shall

18.   “Subdivision” means the division of land into two or more lots for the
purpose, whether immediate or future, of transfer of ownership. A division of
land which creates a new street right-of-way or modification of existing street
right-of-way shall be considered a division of property for the transfer of
ownership or building development under the provisions of this definition. A
division of property for the purpose of adjusting boundaries which does not
create a new and independent parcel capable of building development shall not
be considered a division of land into two or more lots for purpose of this
definition. The term “subdivision,” when appropriate to the context, relates to
the process of subdividing, or to the land subdivided, or the resubdivision of
land heretofore divided or platted into lots, or any other division of land.
The creation of easements which do not affect the taxable status of land shall
not be considered a division of land. The creation of easements which affect

170.04   APPROVAL PROCEDURE.
Subdivision approval procedure is as follows:
1.   Submission. Whenever the owner of any tract or parcel of land within the
jurisdiction of this chapter wishes to subdivide or plat the same, said person
shall cause to be prepared a preliminary plat of said subdivision, and shall
submit 10 copies of said preliminary plat and other information to the Clerk.
The preliminary plat shall contain such information and data as is outlined in
Section
170.17.
2.   Referral. The Clerk shall immediately refer copies of the preliminary plat
to the Commission and to the City Engineer. The City Engineer shall carefully
examine the plat as to its compliance with the regulations of the City, the
existing street system, and good engineering practices and shall, as soon as
possible, submit his or her findings to the Commission.
3.   Commission Review and Recommendation. After receiving the City Engineer’s
report, the Commission shall study the preliminary plat and other material for
conformity to this chapter. The Commission may confer with the subdivider on
changes deemed advisable and the kind and extent of such improvements to be
made. Before approving a preliminary plat, the Commission may, at its
discretion, hold a public hearing on the proposed plat, notice of which shall
be given by publication in a local newspaper of general distribution, or by
posting notices on the tract, or by sending notices to affected property owners
by mail. Such notice shall be given within seven days prior to the public
hearing. The Commission shall file with the Council recommendations for
approval or rejection of such preliminary plat within 45 days after the date of
submission of the plat to the Commission. Upon receiving recommendations of the
Commission, the Council shall consider the same, and if the plat is found to
conform to the provisions of this chapter, the Council shall approve the
preliminary plat.
4.   Effective Period of Preliminary Plat Approval. The approval of the
preliminary plat by the Council shall be null and void unless the final plat is
presented to the Council within one year after the date of the preliminary plat
approval, except as provided in Subsection 5 below.
5.   Phased Preliminary Plat. A “Phased Preliminary Plat” is a preliminary plat
that, due to its size and magnitude, is not likely to be developed in a single
phase and for which the developer has expressed intent to develop the project
in a phased implementation. In the case of such larger developments, the
Council encourages developers to include in a preliminary plat the entire
parcel to be developed. Such a procedure enables the City to review and comment
on the overall development.
6.   Procedure for Designating a Phased Preliminary Plat. A developer must file
with the Commission a written request that a project be designated as a phased
preliminary plat. The request shall include an outline of the developer’s plan
for phased implementation of the development. Following review by the City
Engineer, the Commission shall either grant or deny such request within 45 days
of its submission. The Commission may, however, on its own motion, determine
that a project will be designated as a phased preliminary plat. Thereafter, the
review and approval process shall be the same as for all other preliminary
plats.
7.   Effective Period of Phased Preliminary Plat Approval. The approval of a
phased preliminary plat by the Council shall be null and void unless the final
plat is (or final plats are) presented to the Council within two years after
the date of the phased preliminary plat approval. However, the filing of a
final plat constituting more than five percent of the area of the phased
preliminary plat extends the validity of the phased preliminary plat by two
additional years.
8.   Approval of Final Plat. Approval of the final plat and final acceptance of
improvements shall be given by resolution of the Council, which shall direct
the Mayor and Clerk to certify the resolution which shall be affixed to the
final plat. The procedure for approval of the final plat is outlined in Section
170.16 of this chapter.
9.   Minor Plat Approval. The Commission and Council may, on a case by case
basis and in their sole discretion, determine that the approval of a
preliminary plat that does not include any improvements also constitutes the
approval of the final plat.
170.05   SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS.
The standards and details of design herein contained are intended only as
minimum requirements so that the general arrangement and layout of a
subdivision may be adjusted to a wide variety of circumstances. However, in the
design and development of a plat, the subdivider shall use standards consistent
with the site conditions so as to assure an economical, pleasant and durable
neighborhood. The Council may waive or modify to a lesser requirement any
provision or requirement contained in this chapter on subdivision regulations
with respect to any new subdivision platted in an “E” District, after review by
the Planning and Zoning Commission, and provided that such waiver or
modification does not adversely affect the intent of this chapter and such
change adequately safeguards the general public and the surrounding property.
170.06   STREET DESIGN STANDARDS.
Street design standards are as follows:
1.   Comprehensive Plan. All proposed plats and subdivisions shall conform to
the comprehensive plan. All proposed plats and subdivisions shall also conform
to additional proposed street plans as set out by the City.
2.   Continuation of Existing Streets or Planned Streets. Proposed streets
shall provide for continuation or completion of any existing streets
(constructed or recorded) or any streets which are part of an approved
preliminary subdivision plan, in adjoining property, at equal or greater width,
but not less than 60 feet in width, and in similar alignment, unless variations
are recommended by the Commission.
3.   Circulation. The street pattern shall provide ease of circulation within
the subdivision as well as convenient access to adjoining streets,
thoroughfares, or unsubdivided land as may be required by the Commission. In a
case where a street will eventually be extended beyond the plat, but is
temporarily dead ended, an interim turnaround may be required.
4.   Street Intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right
angles as possible.
5.   Cul-de-sac. Whenever a cul-de-sac is permitted, such street shall be no
longer than 600 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround
having a street property line diameter of at least 130 feet in the case of
residential subdivisions. The right-of-way width of the street leading to the
turnaround shall be a minimum of 50 feet. The property line(s) at the
intersection of the turnaround and the lead-in portion of the street shall be
rounded at a radius of not less than 150 feet; or equal straight approach
lines. A turnaround diameter greater than 130 feet may be required by the
Commission in the case of commercial or industrial subdivisions if it is deemed
necessary.
6.   Street Names. All newly platted streets shall be named and in a manner
conforming to the prevailing street naming system. A proposed street that is
obviously in alignment with other existing streets, or with a street that may
logically be extended although the various portions be at a considerable
distance from each other, shall bear the same name. Names of new streets shall
be subject to the approval of the Commission in order to avoid duplication or
close similarity of names.
7.   Physical and Cultural Features. In general, streets shall be platted with
appropriate regard for topography, creeks, wooded areas, and other natural
features which would lend themselves to attractive treatment.
8.   Half Streets. Dedication of half streets will not be permitted. Where
there exists a dedicated or platted half street or alley adjacent to the tract
to be subdivided, the other half shall be platted if deemed necessary by the
Commission.
9.   Alleys. Alleys may be permitted in residential districts. (Except where
justified by unusual conditions, alleys will not be approved in commercial or
industrial districts.) Dead-end alleys shall be provided with a means of
turning around at the dead end thereof.
10.   Easements. Easements for utilities shall be provided along rear or side
lot lines or along alleys, if needed. Whenever any stream or important surface
water course is located in an area that is being subdivided, the subdivider
shall, at the subdivider’s own expense, make adequate provision for widening
the channel so that it will properly carry the surface water, and shall provide
and dedicate to the City an easement along each side of the stream, which
easement shall be for the purpose of widening, improving, or protecting the
stream and for the purpose of installation of public utilities. The waterway
easement shall be adequate to provide for these purposes, and said easement
shall be a minimum of 50 feet on each side of the centerline of the stream or
watercourse.
11.   Neighborhood Plan. If any overall plan has been made by the Commission
for the neighborhood in which the proposed subdivision is located, the street
system of the latter shall conform in general thereto.
12.   Land Not Platted. Where the plat to be submitted includes only part of
the tract owned by the subdivider, the Commission may require topography and a
sketch of a tentative future street system of the unsubdivided portion.
13.   Major Thoroughfares. Where a new subdivision, except where justified by
limiting conditions, involves frontage on a heavy trafficway, the street layout
shall provide motor access to such frontage by one of the following means:
   A.   A parallel street, supplying frontage for lots backing onto the
trafficway;
   B.   A series of cul-de-sacs or short loops entered from and planned at
right angles to such a parallel street, with their terminal lots backing onto
the highway;
   C.   An access drive separated by a planting strip from the highway to which
a motor access from the drive is provided at points suitably spaced;
   D.   A service drive or alley at the rear of the lots.
Where any one of the above-mentioned arrangements is used, deed covenants or
other means shall prevent any private residential driveways from having direct
access to the trafficway.
14.   Dedication. A deed to the City shall be given for all streets before the
same will be accepted for City maintenance.
15.   Railroads. If a railroad is involved, the subdivision plan should:
   A.   Be so arranged as to permit, where necessary, future grade separations
at highway crossings of the railroad.
   B.   Border the railroad with a parallel street at a sufficient distance
from it to permit deep lots to go back onto the railroad; or form a buffer
strip for park, commercial or industrial use.
   C.   Provide cul-de-sacs at right angles to the railroad so as to permit
lots to back thereto.
16.   Street Widths. All streets shall have a right-of-way width of 60 feet and
a pavement width of 31 feet. However, in residential districts, the Council may
approve, after recommendation by the Commission, streets having a minimum
pavement width of 26 feet, and minimum right-of-way of 55 feet when a street is
a cul-de-sac with no other intersection or exit, or when a street is a
continuation of an existing street and matches the existing pavement and right-
of-way width, or when a wider width is incompatible with the physical
constraints of the subdivision, or when a street is a subsidiary street
connected only to other primary streets that meet the full width requirement
and the Commission in consultation with the City Engineer determines that the
narrower width may be beneficial for reducing potential traffic speed.
(Subsection 16 – Ord. 603 – Aug. 24 Supp.)
17.   Street Grades. Streets and alleys shall be completed to grades which have
been officially determined or approved by the City Engineer. All streets shall
be graded to the full width of the right-of-way and adjacent side slopes graded
to blend with the natural ground level. All streets must have a minimum grade
of one-half of one percent. The maximum grade shall not exceed six percent for
main and secondary thoroughfares, or 10 percent for minor or local service
streets. All vertical curves must be approved by the City Engineer. The grade
alignment and resultant visibility, especially at intersections, must meet the
approval of the City Engineer.
18.   Power Lines and Telephone Lines. All power lines and telephone lines
shall be underground construction. All leads to light poles shall be
underground. The subdivider shall submit his or her proposed plan directly to
the utility company so proper planning can be made for this construction. See
Standard Specifications for Public Works for utility locations.
19.   Trees. Each lot is required to have one street tree for every 30 feet of
street frontage, with a minimum of one street tree per street frontage.
   A.   Street trees shall be planted on each platted lot in the right-of-way
or parking.
   B.   Following the final grading of each property and installation of
sidewalks, the Tree Board shall cause street trees to be planted in the right
of way. The Tree Board shall be responsible for selection of the street trees
and shall seek input from homeowners before finalizing the selection.
   C.   The subdivider shall pay a tree fee of $400.00 for each street tree for
each lot in the final plat upon which a residential dwelling or commercial
building may be constructed. This fee will cover the City’s costs for the
planting of street trees and shall be paid to the Clerk prior to the Council’s
approval of the final plat.
   D.   Each lot in the plat shall also have a minimum of one private tree on
the lot that is selected and planted by the subdivider or homeowner, within one
year after the City’s issuance of a temporary occupancy permit or occupancy
permit, whichever is issued first. In special circumstances where Council has
approved, after recommendation by the Commission, in the event a right-of-way
or parking does not offer sufficient width for planting street trees [a minimum
of nine feet], this requirement shall be increased so that each lot shall
instead have a minimum of two trees on the lot with at least one of the trees
located in the front yard.
170.07   TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM POLICY AND SIDEWALK DESIGN AND CONNECTIVITY.
It is the policy of the City that the transportation system shall reasonably
seek to accommodate the different forms of surface travel including travel by
automobiles, pedestrians and bicycles within and through the City. The planning
and design of subdivision of land development projects shall provide for
automobile, pedestrian and bicycle movements adjoining, within and through the
subdivision or development as needed to connect to the neighborhood and
remainder of the community, as well as to provide access by foot and bicycle
for all residents to parks and other recreational amenities, schools, the
library, and other public amenities.
During review of a preliminary plat submission, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall consider the proposed pedestrian and bicycle access within the
remainder of the community. If there are interruptions in the City’s sidewalk
network that would prevent residents of the development from accessing parks
and other recreational amenities, schools, the library, other public amenities,
or other areas of the community, the Commission shall propose to the Council a
plan for City action for resolving those interruptions in order to provide
walkability throughout the entire community. The Council shall consider the
proposed plan, and adopt or amend the proposed plan. After Council action the
necessary improvements to the City’s sidewalk network shall, insofar as
possible, be completed within 48 months of the approval of the Final Plat.
170.08   BLOCK DESIGN STANDARDS.
Block design standards are as follows:
1.   Length. No block shall be longer than 660 feet. This distance may be
reduced by the City if it is considered to be excessive in its particular
application.
2.   Block Corner Radius. At street intersections, block corners shall be
rounded with a radius of not less than 15 feet; unless at any one intersection
a curve radius has been previously established, then such radius shall be used
as standard.
170.09   LOT DESIGN STANDARDS.
Lot design standards are as follows:
1.   Corner Lots - Widths. Corner lots shall have a minimum width of 80 feet in
order to permit adequate building setbacks on both front and side streets.
2.   Double Frontage Lots Prohibited. Double frontage lots, other than corner
lots, shall be prohibited except where such lots back onto a major street or
highway or except in the case of large commercial or industrial lots.
3.   Side Lot Lines. Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles to
the street or radial to curved streets.
4.   Lot Size - Public Sewer Not Available. For the purpose of complying with
minimum health standards, lots which cannot be reasonably served by an existing
public sanitary sewer system shall have a minimum width of 100 feet, measured
at the building line, and an area of not less than 20,000 square feet.
170.10   STORMWATER DRAINAGE REQUIREMENTS – OVERLAND FLOW CHANNEL.
Overland flow channels for stormwater runoff downstream of stormwater runoff
surface drainage outlets, overflow structures, pipes and culverts shall be
designed as vegetative swales with soft armor protection as appropriate.
Whenever possible the use of bioretention/filtration practices shall be
implemented along overland flow channels.
Vegetated swales shall be reinforced by transition mats and turf reinforcement
mats as required to prevent erosion. Requirements for channel protection shall
be calculated based on the unvegetated or installation day performance ratings.
Documentation shall be submitted for all stormwater drainage channels,
including the design of soft armor protection and bioretention/filtration
practices.
The City reserves the right to require the incorporation of bioretention/
filtration practices for any overland flow channel for which the City
determines such practices are practical as a means of reducing and filtering
runoff.
The use of rip-rap or similar hard armor protection of overland flow channels
is discouraged and shall be implemented only with the approval of the City.
170.11   STORMWATER DETENTION.
All new subdivisions shall be required to provide stormwater management
facilities to mitigate the impact of increased stormwater runoff resulting from
the subdivision. Stormwater management is required to reduce the runoff from a
100 year recurrence interval storm event in the fully developed condition to no
greater than the runoff from a five year recurrence interval storm event in the
undeveloped condition. Stormwater management shall generally be in accordance
with the procedures and requirements set forth in the Statewide Urban Design
Standards.
The stormwater management plan must be set forth as part of the preliminary
plat submittal. The stormwater management plan must evaluate the onsite
stormwater management and must identify and evaluate the downstream conveyance
of stormwater for the allowed release from the site as well as any emergency
overflow that would occur from a stormwater retention facility.
The City reserves the right to modify or waive the requirement for stormwater
management for any subdivision for which the City Engineer determines there is
already adequate stormwater management or the provisions of additional
stormwater management may create a potentially adverse impact on downstream
stormwater drainage.
170.12   DRAINAGE AREAS DESIGN AND AS-CONSTRUCTED ELEVATIONS.
For any subdivision that utilizes overland flowage easements or drainage swales
the construction plans must include design elevations along the drainage way at
each lot line and at the midpoint within each lot and at increments of 100 feet
if the width of the lot is greater than 200 feet.
For any area for which elevations are required under this section the developer
must measure the as-constructed elevation at the same location and provide that
information on the as-constructed plans.
170.13   PARK LAND DEDICATION.
1.   Definition. For purposes of this section the term “Development
Application” shall mean any presentation or filing with the City for
residential development purposes of any subdivision of land over which the City
has subdivision review and approval authority or the filing or presentation of
any site plan, planned unit development (PUD), PUD specific plan, permitted
conditional use plan or development, subdivision master plan or area
development plan, over which the City has approval authority or a declaration
of horizontal property (condominium) regime pursuant to Iowa Code Chapter 499B.
2.   Dedicate Land for Park and Recreational Purposes. All persons making a
Development Application shall dedicate to the City, within the land covered by
the Development Application, land for park and recreational purposes sufficient
to meet the requirements of this section.
   A.   In each tract of land covered by a Development Application, there shall
be reserved and dedicated to public use 10 acres of land for park purposes for
each 1,000 people, based upon the projected population of the completed
Development Application as calculated in accord with this section. Such
dedication shall be prorated to the amount indicated by the projected
population to the nearest 1,000 square feet of land to be dedicated, but in any
event, no dedication of land for park use shall contain a total for park usage
of less than 10,000 square feet of land so dedicated. For purposes of this
section, property subject to a horizontal property condominium regime under
Iowa Code Chapter 499B shall be treated as single-family detached.
   B.   For purposes of this section, population in the completed area covered
by the Development Application will be determined by multiplying the number of
housing units projected in the area covered by the Development Application for
each use category times the anticipated average per unit as given below. The
quantity calculated for each residential type shall be added together and the
sum shall be the projected population for purposes of the Development
Application. For the purposes of this section, the following population
estimates per residential type will be used:
      (1)   Single-family detached: 3.0 people.
      (2)   Single-family attached: 2.5 people.
      (3)   Multi-family unit: 2.0 people.
   C.   The City may require that all land dedicated under this section be
configured or located to optimize aggregations of land and thus may require
that the dedicated land be adjacent to the land affected by other development
applications or to otherwise maximize usefulness of the land in accordance with
the City’s Comprehensive Plan. The location of land that is dedicated under
this section must be approved by the City. In its approval the City will take
into consideration the utility of the land proposed for dedication. In its
review of the location of proposed park land dedication, the Planning and
Zoning Commission will consult with the Parks and Recreation Board and seek the
Board’s input on the proposed location of park land.
(Paragraph C – Ord. 587 – Aug. 23 Supp.)
   D.   This section shall not apply to any Development Application which does
not include residential development, provided, however, to the extent any
Development Application includes residential uses then dedication of park land
shall be required to the extent determined in accord with paragraphs A and B of
Subsection 2 of this section.
   E.   For purposes of this section the water area of ponds, streams,
retention basins, detention basins and other bodies of water, or the land area
of buffer park easements and site plan open space requirements, shall not be
included in determining any area dedicated for park purposes.
   F.   The dedication of land for park purposes shall include dedication of a
corridor or point of connection for public pedestrian access, the areas of
which shall be included in determining compliance with this section.
   G.   The required land dedication under this section shall be reduced when
the person making the Development Application provides public access by
easement to recreational facilities, playgrounds, unobstructed open spaces,
ball fields, soccer fields, tennis courts, basketball courts, volleyball
courts, picnic shelter, recreational trails and other similar non-duplicated
recreational facilities which have been (or will be) ADA-compliant constructed
and maintained by the applicant. There shall not be any credit for swimming
pools, clubhouses, and other similar facilities. In order to determine the
credit the City shall ascertain the fair market value of the land required to
be dedicated under this section and from such value subtract the cost of the
recreational facilities constructed by the applicant and provided under this
section. The person making the Development Application shall then only be
required to dedicate land equal in value to the remainder.
3.   Alternative to Dedication. As an alternative to dedication under this
section, any person filing a Development Application may provide jointly with
other persons for the dedication of land in an amount at least equal to the
amount required under this section, at a location which is not part of the land
for which approval is sought, provided such alternative is within the same
neighborhood park area as the land for which a Development Application has been
made, that the alternative jointly provided will provide for a park with a
total land area of at least five acres, consistent with the Comprehensive Plan
and that such alternative dedication of land is or has actually been dedicated
to the City and has been accepted by the City for use in accordance with the
Comprehensive Plan.
4.   Dedication Requirement Less Than 10,000 Square Feet. Where application of
the formula set forth in Subsection 2 of this section results in a dedication
requirement of less than 10,000 square feet the person making or filing the
development application may elect to dedicate 10,000 square feet of land or
fulfill their obligation by participating in an option provided by Subsection 3
of this section, but such alternative participation shall be based upon the
actual calculation under Subsection 2 of this section and not upon the
equivalent of 10,000 square feet of land.
5.   Alternate Plan.
   A.   Subsections 2 and 3 of this section notwithstanding, any entity
required to comply with this section may present an alternate plan which meets
the purposes of this section as a means of complying herewith. It will be the
burden of the entity presenting such plan to establish that such plan meets the
purposes of this section. Any proposed plan shall be first reviewed by the
Planning and Zoning Commission. Any alternate proposal must directly and
proportionately benefit the development. A plan may include a payment to the
City in lieu of land dedication. Such payment may be used only for park and
recreation facility and park connectivity purposes consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan. An appraiser selected by mutual agreement of the City
Administrator-Finance Director and the developer shall determine the value of
the land contained within the Development Application. The proposed payment in
lieu of land dedication shall be equal to the appraised value or a minimum of
$28,000 an acre, whichever is higher. The developer shall pay the cost of the
appraisal. Half of the cost of the appraisal shall be subtracted from any
payment to the City in lieu of land dedication. The City Administrator-Finance
Director, after consultation with the Mayor, may in writing waive the
requirement for an appraisal when it is reasonably determined that an appraisal
would not exceed a value of $28,000 an acre.
   B.   An entity that chooses to present an alternate plan shall file its
written plan with the Planning and Zoning Commission for review prior to any
action by the Commission to recommend to the Council approval or rejection of
the preliminary plat. In its review of the alternate plan, the Commission will
consult with the Parks and Recreation Board and seek its input on the alternate
plan. The Commission shall include its recommendation on the alternate plan in
its report to the Council on the preliminary plat. The Council shall either
accept or reject the alternate plan in connection with its action on the
preliminary plat.
   C.   Following approval of the preliminary plat and prior to any entity’s
submittal of a final plat, the entity shall initiate the appraisal process set
out in Subparagraph A. The report of the appraisal shall be filed with the
Commission and the City Clerk. The Council shall accept the amount of a payment
in lieu of land dedication in connection with its approval of the final plat.
   D.   In the event a phased preliminary plat has been approved, or a
development is otherwise divided into multiple final plats, the appraisal
process set out in Subparagraph A shall be repeated at the time of each final
plat submission unless any payments in lieu of land dedication already have
been made to the City.
(Subsection 5 – Ord. 587 – Aug. 23 Supp.)
6.   Single-Family Residential Units. This section shall not apply to any
development application containing three or fewer single-family residential
units. A person making or filing a development application shall not divide
land into separate plats in order to seek a waiver under this provision. Where
a Development Application is made for multiple contiguous tracts within any two
years the City may treat all the Development Applications as one for purposes
of this section.
7.   Condominium Regime. No declaration of a condominium regime under Iowa Code
Chapter 499B, nor any conversion of an apartment to a condominium under Iowa
Code Section 499B.3 shall be completed before the person or entity filing the
declaration shall have complied with the land dedication requirements of this
section.
8.   Appeal Procedure.
   A.   Notice of Appeal; Fee. Any person making or filing a Development
Application or any person, entity, or developer affected by any decision made
by an official, board or commission acting under this chapter, may appeal to
the City Council by filing notice of appeal with the City Clerk and paying a
filing fee of $100.00 payable to the City to be credited to the General Fund of
the City. Such appeal shall be taken within 10 days from the decision of the
official, board or commission acting under this chapter and shall set out in
detail the reasons and grounds for the appeal. The City Clerk shall forthwith
transmit to the City Council all papers constituting the record upon which the
action appeal is taken. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the
appeal.
   B.   The City Council shall upon the filing of an appeal fix a reasonable
time for a hearing, giving public notice thereof as well as due notice to the
parties in interest. All interested persons may offer oral or written testimony
at the public hearing on the appeal. A vote of three members of the City
Council may affirm, modify, or reverse any decision of any official, board or
commission acting under this chapter.
   C.   Appeal to District Court. Any person, entity, or developer aggrieved by
an appeal decision of the City Council may within 30 days from the date of the
City Council rendering a decision, appeal therefrom to the District Court of
Dallas County, Iowa, in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure, Division
XIV, entitled “certiorari.”
170.14   REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
Required improvements are as follows:
1.   General. The subdivider shall install and construct all improvements
required by this chapter. The subdivider shall submit three sets of the plans
and specifications for all public improvements to be reviewed by the City
Engineer and approved by the Council prior to start of construction. All
required improvements shall be installed and constructed in accordance with
Standard Public Works Specifications on file in the office of the Clerk, unless
otherwise approved by the City Engineer. Inspection shall be provided by the
City, at the subdivider’s expense, as deemed necessary to assure the quality
workmanship on all portions of the construction to be dedicated to the City.
Said inspection costs which are a part of the review and inspection costs
provided for in Section
170.20 shall be paid for by the subdivider before final approval will be given.
The subdivider shall provide a minimum of 24 hours’ notice to the City prior to
the commencement of construction work so the City can make arrangements for an
inspector. At the completion of construction, all improvements required by
these regulations shall be reviewed and approved by the Council.
2.   Grades. All streets, alleys and sidewalks within the platted area which
are dedicated for public use shall be brought to the grade approved by the
Council after receiving the report and recommendations of the City Engineer.
3.   Paving. Concrete paving with curbs shall be installed on all roadways in
the plat being dedicated for public use and shall be constructed of Portland
cement concrete, all in accordance with designs and specifications approved by
the Council and at grades established by the City Engineer.
4.   Water and Sewers. Water mains, sanitary sewer lines, and storm sewers and
their appurtenances shall be constructed and installed in accordance with the
plans and specifications adopted by the Council. Water and sewer lines shall be
made accessible to each lot.
5.   Storm Sewer. A suitable storm sewer for sump pump drainage shall be
available to all lots within a subdivision.
6.   Extension of Services to Property Line. The subdivider shall extend
services for water, sewer and sump pump discharge to the lot lines for each lot
within a subdivision. The locations of the services must be clearly marked and
a record of the service locations provided to the City by the subdivider.
7.   Broadband Communication. On the plans and specifications for all public
improvements, the subdivider shall identify the provider that will provide
broadband high speed fiber internet access to all parcels within the
subdivision, and indicate the date on which such access will be available,
unless such requirement is waived by the Council in its approval of the
preliminary plat.
(Subsection 7 – Ord. 588 – Aug. 23 Supp.)
170.15   AS-CONSTRUCTED PLAN DRAWINGS. Prior to approval of the final plat the
developer must provide as-constructed plans showing the location and elevation
of all public utilities. The as-constructed plans must include as-constructed
elevations located along any drainage swale or drainage easement as required
under this chapter.
170.16   APPROVAL OF FINAL PLAT, AND FINAL ACCEPTANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Provisions for the final approval and acceptance of the final plat and
improvements are as follows:
1.   Construction of Improvement or Posting of Bond. Before the Council
approves the final plat, all of the improvements required in Section
170.14 shall be constructed and accepted by formal resolution of the Council.
Before passage of a resolution of acceptance, the City Engineer shall report
that the improvements meet all City specifications and ordinances or other
requirements, and all agreements between the subdivider and the City; and the
City Attorney shall report that the subdivision owner has filed in proper form
a maintenance bond (or bonds) to cover all construction being dedicated to the
City. Maintenance bonds shall be in the name of the contractors who have done
the work. Maintenance bonds shall be in effect from the passage of the
resolution of acceptance by the Council, then for the following numbers of
years:
   A.   Concrete paving – four years;
   B.   Storm sewers and appurtenances – four years;
   C.   Sanitary sewers and appurtenances – four years;
   D.   Water mains and appurtenances – four years.
2.   Waiver. The requirements for the construction of all improvements may be
waived if the subdivider will post a performance bond or certified check with
the Council guaranteeing that the improvements will be constructed within a
period of one year from final acceptance of the plat. However, if a performance
bond is posted, final acceptance of the plat will not constitute final
acceptance by the City of any improvements to be constructed. Improvements will
be accepted only after all construction has been completed, all in accordance
with the requirements of this chapter. No maintenance work will be done by the
City and no public funds will be expended in the subdivision until such
improvements have been completed and accepted by the City.
3.   Provision for Sidewalks. Following the issuance of a building permit, but
prior to the issuance of a certificate of zoning compliance, each individual
property owner within the subdivision shall construct sidewalks on the owner’s
property. Sidewalks shall be minimum of five feet in width and shall be
constructed of Portland cement concrete in accordance with the designs and
specifications approved by the Council, at grades approved by the City Engineer
and otherwise in compliance with all sidewalk requirements contained within
this Code of Ordinances. The subdivider must include within protective
covenants or restrictions a provision which states:
It is the responsibility of each individual property owner within the
subdivision, and not the subdivider, to construct sidewalks on the owner’s
property. Sidewalks shall be minimum of five feet in width and shall be
constructed of Portland cement concrete in accordance with the designs and
specifications approved by the Council, at grades approved by the City
Engineer, and otherwise in compliance with all of the City’s sidewalk
requirements contained in the Code of Ordinances of the City of Dallas Center.
The City will not issue a certificate of zoning compliance, and no structure
may be occupied, until the sidewalk construction has been completed and
approved by the Building Official.
(Subsection 3 – Ord. 582 – Dec. 22 Supp.)
4.   Resubdivisions. The Council may waive the requirements for the
construction and installation of some or all of the required improvements in
cases of resubdivisions where only the size, shape and arrangement of the lots
are being changed and no new streets are required and in case of dedications of
land or rights-of-way to public use where such dedication is in excess of the
needs of the subdivision and is desired by a public agency in lieu of a
purchase or condemnation proceeding.
170.17   PRELIMINARY PLAT REQUIREMENTS.
The preliminary plat of a subdivision is not intended to serve as a record
plat. Its purpose is to show on a map all facts needed to enable the Commission
to determine whether the proposed layout of the land in question is
satisfactory from the standpoint of the public interest. The subdivider, or his
or her representative, may call at the City offices in advance of submitting
the preliminary plat in order to discuss the proposed subdivision and in order
to obtain information as to the requirements necessary for approval of the
plat.
1.   Number of Copies and Scale. 10 copies of the preliminary plat shall be
submitted as prescribed for review. The scale of the map shall be one inch
equals 50 feet (1” = 50’) on small subdivisions and one inch equals 100 feet
(1” = 100’) on large subdivisions, unless otherwise approved by the Commission.
2.   Contents of Preliminary Plat. Preliminary plat contents are as follows:
   A.   Name of subdivision, date, point of compass, scale, and official
description of the property being platted.

line.
   L.   Zoning classification of the area.
   M.   Proposed utility service:
      (1)   Source of water supply.
      (2)   Provision for sewage disposal.
      (3)   Provision for storm water drainage.
   N.   A vicinity sketch at a legible scale showing the relationship of the
plat to its general surroundings.
   O.   Lot numbers.
   P.   Proposed street widths.
   Q.   A note indicating the developer’s review, consideration, and possible
action on sidewalk connectivity within the subdivision and from the subdivision
to adjoining subdivisions and parcels.
3.   Accompanying Material. Any plat that cannot reasonably be served by public
sewer shall show results of soil percolation tests made by the engineer
preparing the plat. Such tests shall be made in accordance with specifications
approved by the City Engineer.
170.18   FINAL PLAT REQUIREMENTS.
Final plat requirements are as follows:
1.   Number of Copies and Scale. When and if the preliminary plat is approved,
the subdivider shall submit 10 copies of the final plat for review by the
Commission. The scale of the map shall be one inch equals 50 feet (1” = 50’) on
small subdivisions and one inch equals 100 feet (1” = 100’) on large
subdivisions, unless otherwise approved by the Commission.
2.   Monumentation. Prior to the offering of the plat of any subdivision for
record, the following procedure shall be followed:
   A.   The surveyor shall confirm the prior establishment of control monuments
at each controlling corner on the boundaries of the parcel or tract of land
being surveyed. If no control monuments exist, the surveyor shall place the
monuments. Control monuments shall be constructed of reasonably permanent
material solidly embedded in the ground and capable of being detected by
commonly used magnetic or electronic equipment. The surveyor shall affix a cap
of reasonably inert material bearing an embossed or stencil cut marking of the
Iowa registration number of the surveyor to the top of each monument which the
surveyor places.
   B.   Control monuments shall be placed at the following locations:
      (1)   Each corner and angle point of each lot, block, or parcel of land
surveyed.
      (2)   Each point of intersection of the outer boundary of the survey with
an existing or created right-of-way line of a street, railroad, or other way.
      (3)   Each point of curve, tangency, reversed curve, or compounded curve
on each right-of-way line established.
   C.   If the placement of a monument required by this section at the
prescribed location is impractical, a reference monument shall be established
near the prescribed location. If a point requiring monumentation has been
previously monumented, the existence of the monument shall be confirmed by the
surveyor.
   D.   At least a minimum number of two survey control monuments are required
to be placed before the recording of a subdivision provided the surveyor
includes in the surveyor’s statement a declaration that additional monuments
shall be placed before a date specified in the statement or within one year
from the date the subdivision is recorded, whichever is earlier.
3.   Contents of Final Plat. Every plat of a subdivision offered for record
shall conform to all of the following provisions where applicable:
   A.   The plat shall be a permanent copy or a photographic print made on a
stable plastic film. Exact copies of the plat to be recorded shall be provided
to and filed by the County Recorder, Assessor and Auditor. The original plat
drawing shall remain the property of the registered land surveyor.
   B.   The size of each sheet showing any portion of the subdivided lands
shall not be greater than 18 inches by 24 inches nor less than eight and one-
half inches by 11 inches.
   C.   Whenever more than one sheet is used to accurately portray the lands
subdivided, each sheet shall display both the numbers of the sheet and the
total number of sheets included in the plat, as well as clearly labeled match
lines indicating where the other sheets adjoin. An index sheet shall be
provided to show the relationship between the sheets.
   D.   A maximum scale of 100 feet to one inch (100’ = 1”) shall be used
unless permission to use a different scale is obtained in writing from the
local governing body. The scale used shall be clearly stated and graphically
illustrated by a bar scale drawn on every sheet showing any portion of the
lands subdivided.
   E.   Subdivisions shall be designated, by name or as otherwise prescribed,
in bold letters inside the margin at the top of each sheet included in the
plat.
   F.   An arrow indicating the northern direction shall be drawn in a
prominent place on each sheet included in the plat.
   G.   All monuments to be of record shall be adequately described and clearly
identified on the plat. When additional monuments are to be established
subsequent to the recording of the plat, the location of the additional
monuments shall be shown on the plat.
   H.   Sufficient survey data shall be shown to positively describe the bounds
of every lot, block, street, easement or other areas shown on the plat, as well
as the outer boundaries of the subdivided lands.
   I.   All distances shall be shown in feet to the nearest one-hundredth of a
foot, and in accordance with the definition of a foot adopted by the United
States Bureau of Standards. All measurements shall refer to the horizontal
plane.
   J.   The course of every boundary line shown on the plat shall be indicated
by a directed bearing reference or by an angle between the boundary line and an
intersecting line having a shown bearing, except when the boundary line has an
irregular or constantly changing course, as along a body of water, or when a
description of the boundary line is better achieved by measurements shown at
points or intervals along a meander line having a shown course. All bearings
and angles shown shall be given to at least the nearest minute of arc.
   K.   Curve data shall be stated in terms of radius, central angle and
tangent, or length of curve, and unless otherwise specified by local ordinance
curve data for streets of uniform width may be shown only with reference to the
centerline, and lots fronting on such curves may show only the chord bearing
and distance of such portion of the curve as is included in their boundary. In
all other cases, the curve data must be shown for the line affected.
   L.   The minimum unadjusted acceptable error of closure for all subdivision
boundaries shall be 1.10,000 and shall be 1.5,000 for any individual lot.
   M.   When any lot or portion of the subdivision is bounded by an irregular
line, the major portion of that lot or subdivision shall be enclosed by a
meander line showing complete data with distances along all lines extending
beyond the enclosure to the irregular boundary shown with as much certainty as
can be determined or as “more or less” if variable. In all cases, the true
boundary shall be clearly indicated on the plat.
   N.   All interior excepted parcels shall be clearly indicated and labeled,
“not a part of this plat.”
   O.   All adjoining properties shall be identified, and where such adjoining
properties are a part of a recorded subdivision, the name of subdivision shall

contained in this chapter, and accepted by the Council as a public street.
170.23   CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.
Any provision of this chapter may be changed and amended from time to time by
