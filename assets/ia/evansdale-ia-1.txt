not specify standards to govern the exercise of the power, the power shall be
exercised in light of the following standard: The discretionary power to grant,
deny, or revoke any matter shall be considered in light of the facts and
circumstances then existing and as may be reasonably foreseeable, and due
consideration shall be given to the impact upon the public health, safety and
welfare, and the decision shall be that of a reasonably prudent person under
similar circumstances in the exercise of the police power.

substance.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[1])
   2.   “Hazardous condition” means any situation involving the actual,

ground waters, the responsible person shall cause the condition to be remedied
by a cleanup, as defined in the preceding section, as rapidly as feasible to an

accomplishing the cleanup and stating that the City will proceed to procure
cleanup services and bill the responsible person for all costs associated with
the cleanup if the cleanup is not accomplished within the deadline. In the

the present danger to the public health, safety and welfare, then no notice
shall be required and the City may proceed to procure the cleanup and bill the
responsible person for all costs associated with the cleanup. If the bill for
those services is not paid within 30 days, the City Attorney shall proceed to

CHAPTER 46
MINORS
 
46.01 Curfew                 46.03 Contributing to Delinquency
46.02 Cigarettes and Tobacco
 
46.01   CURFEW.
   The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote
the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the City and
specifically to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults
responsible for minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors
committed after the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences
and criminal activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.
   1.   Definitions. For use in this section, the following terms are defined:
      A.   “Emergency errand” means, but is not limited to, an errand relating
to a fire, a natural disaster, an automobile accident or any other situation
requiring immediate action to prevent serious illness, bodily injury, or loss
of life.
      B.   “Knowingly” means knowledge which a responsible adult should
reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that
responsible adult’s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful
or careless adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult
responsibility through an objective test. It is therefore no defense that an
adult responsible for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or
conduct or whereabouts of the minor.
      C.   “Minor” means any unemancipated person under the age of 18 years.
      D.   “Nonsecured custody” means custody in an unlocked multipurpose area,
such as a lobby, office or interrogation room which is not designed, set aside
or used as a secure detention area, and the person arrested is not physically
secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically
accompanied by a law enforcement officer or a person employed by the facility
where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to
providing nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate
juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the person’s
parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but
not for longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or
magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
      E.   “Public place” includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys and sidewalks dedicated to public use; and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises whether publicly or privately owned which
are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited
commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is
permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has
access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is
considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.
      F.   “Responsible adult” means a parent, guardian or other adult
specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have
custody or control of a minor.
   2.   Curfew Established. It is unlawful for any minor to be or remain upon
any of the alleys, streets or public places or to be in places of business and
amusement in the City between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. of the
following day on days commencing on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and
Thursday and between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 5:00 a.m. on Friday and
Saturday.
   3.   Exceptions. The following are exceptions to the curfew:
      A.   The minor is accompanied by a responsible adult.
      B.   The minor is on the sidewalk or property where the minor resides or
on either side of the place where the minor resides and the adult responsible
for the minor has given permission for the minor to be there.
      C.   The minor is present at or is traveling between home and one of the
following:
         (1)   Minor’s place of employment in a business, trade or occupation
in which the minor is permitted by law to be engaged or, if traveling, within
one hour after the end or before the beginning of work;
         (2)   Minor’s place of religious activity or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of the religious activity;
         (3)   Governmental or political activity or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of the activity;
         (4)   School activity or, if traveling, within one hour after the end
or before the beginning of the activity;
         (5)   Assembly such as a march, protest, demonstration, sit-in or
meeting of an association for the advancement of economic, political, religious
or cultural matters, or for any other activity protected by the First Amendment
of the U.S. Constitution guarantees of free exercise of religion, freedom of
speech, freedom of assembly or, if traveling, within one hour after the end or
before the beginning of the activity.
      D.   The minor is on an emergency errand for a responsible adult;
      E.   The minor is engaged in interstate travel through the City
beginning, ending or passing through the City when such travel is by direct
route.
   4.   Responsibility of Adults. It is unlawful for any responsible adult
knowingly to permit or to allow a minor to be in any public place in the City
within the time periods prohibited by this section unless the minor’s presence
falls within one of the above exceptions.
   5.   Enforcement Procedures.
      A.   Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in
the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driver’s
license, a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance,
use his or her best judgment in determining age.
      B.   Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody. Grounds for arrest are
that the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the person’s
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any nonsecured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into
custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.
      C.   Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into
custody, the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the
minor as soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible
for the minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at
such time as the court may direct.
      D.   Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minor’s parent, guardian or other person
legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the
law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative
of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person
who is known to the child.
   6.   Penalties.
      A.   Responsible Adult’s First Violation. In the case of a first
violation by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall provide, to the adult
responsible for the minor, written notice of the violation with a warning that
any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew
ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with applicable
penalties.
      B.   Responsible Adult’s Second or Subsequent Violation. Any responsible
adult as defined in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly
allows the minor to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of
a municipal infraction.
      C.   Minor’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a
minor, the law enforcement officer shall give the minor a written warning,
which states that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of
the curfew ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with
applicable penalties, or, at the law enforcement officer’s discretion, may
issue the minor a citation for a first violation.
      D.   Minor’s Second or Subsequent Violation. For the minor’s second and
subsequent violations of any of the provisions of this section, the minor is
guilty of a municipal infraction.
46.02   CIGARETTES AND TOBACCO.
   It is unlawful for any person under 21 years of age to smoke, use, possess,
purchase, or attempt to purchase any tobacco, tobacco products, alternative
nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes. Possession of tobacco,
tobacco products, alternative nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes
by an individual under 21 years of age shall not constitute a violation of this
section if the individual under 21 years of age possesses the tobacco, tobacco
products, alternative nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes as part
of the person's employment and said person is employed by a person who holds a
valid permit under Chapter 453A of the Code of Iowa or who lawfully offers for

expenses on behalf of the City.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[3h])
   6.   Collection of Costs. The Clerk shall send a statement of the total
expense incurred by certified mail to the property owner who has failed to

Treasurer and such costs shall then be collected with, and in the same manner
as, general property taxes.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[3h])
   7.   Installment Payment of Cost of Abatement. If the amount expended to

animal’s location and condition. Upon being so notified, the owner of such
animal shall either immediately take custody of such animal or cause said
animal to be transported to a veterinarian, or authorize its destruction in a
humane manner.
   2.   In the event an injured animal at large cannot be apprehended, or if it
displays vicious tendencies which would make its capture unduly hazardous, or
in the event that an animal is found at large so seriously injured as to make
its recovery improbable, or its condition deteriorates to that point, the
Animal Control Officer may immediately destroy such animal in a humane manner
in the interest of humane treatment.
   3.   In the event an animal regulated by Chapters 481A and 481B of the Code

another.
   5.   No person owning or having an animal under his or her control or care
and custody shall permit such animal to create a noise disturbance or to bark

disturb the peace. Kennels, veterinary clinics, animal hospitals, and animal
shelters located within properly zoned areas shall be eligible for a variance
from this requirement.
   6.   It is unlawful for any person owning, controlling, or caring for any
animal that has died from any cause to allow the carcass to lie about the

odors or health problems arise), such person shall pick up any and all feces so
as to prevent accumulation and same shall be properly disposed of. Feces shall
be held in watertight and fly-tight containers pending disposal and shall be

same in a sanitary sewer receptacle, or by depositing same in a proper
receptacle for disposal as solid wastes. The animal and place where the animal
is maintained shall also be kept free of obnoxious odors and shall be

in a humane manner. The order shall immediately be served upon the person
against whom issued in the same manner as the notice of hearing. If the order
is not complied with within three days of its issuance, the Animal Control
Officer is authorized to seize and impound the animal. An animal so seized

   2.   Emergency Rabies Control. If the County Board of Health believes rabies
to be epidemic, or believes there is threat of epidemic within the City, it may
declare a quarantine of all or part of the City and such declaration shall be
reported to the Council and the State Department of Health. During the period
of the quarantine, any person owning or having a dog or other animal in his or
her possession in the quarantined area shall keep such animal securely enclosed

animal under quarantine shall be at the expense of the owner of such animal. If
an animal is held by a veterinarian, it may not be released until the
expiration of the 10-day quarantine period without express written permission

examined in lieu of quarantine. A wild or stray animal which has bitten any
person may be destroyed immediately by the Animal Control Officer.
      C.   The owner of any animal which has bitten a person may apply to the
Animal Control Officer to release the animal for the purpose of allowing
quarantine at the home of the owner for a period of ten days. The application

vaccine and the signature of the veterinarian administering the vaccination.
The animal must also have a current City license, if required by 
Chapter 56, at the time of the bite.
         (2)   The animal was not running at large at the time of the bite.
         (3)   Prior to approval of home quarantine, the owner shall have the
animal examined by a veterinarian, licensed in the State of Iowa, who shall

an animal cannot be immediately examined, it shall be quarantined at the City
animal shelter until the owner can make arrangements for such examination.
         (4)   The person bitten (or if a minor, the minor’s parent or
guardian) must sign the application indicating that said person has been
advised of the risks of rabies, and that if the animal disappears during the
home quarantine, the person bitten may have to undergo anti-rabies treatment,

the Board of Health, the Department of Public Health and its agents from
liability if the animal disappears during the quarantine period.

Public Health of any changes in the animal’s health or disposition, to allow
representatives of the Department of Public Health or its agents to enter upon
said owner’s property and to examine the animal at any time and immediately to
take the animal to a licensed veterinarian for examination at any time when
directed by personnel of the Department of Public Health or its agents.
         (7)   At the end of the quarantine period, the owner shall have the
animal examined by a licensed veterinarian who shall certify that the animal
appears to be free of rabies or other zoonosis, and the quarantine should be
terminated.
         (8)   The owner shall pay all costs of impoundment, board, and
quarantine to the City before the animal is released, and shall agree to pay
all costs of examinations by a veterinarian during the quarantine period.
         (9)   The owner shall further agree to surrender the animal
immediately at any time the Director of Public Health or designee determines
the home quarantine should be terminated, or at any time that any provisions or
conditions of the home quarantine are violated, and the animal shall be
returned to the custody of the Department of Public Health, its agents, or a
licensed veterinarian in the State of Iowa.
         (10)   The County Board of Health may establish additional rules
pertaining to home quarantine.
   5.   Report of Condition During Quarantine. It is the duty of any
veterinarian or owner of other place at which an animal is placed under
quarantine for any reason to report at once any noticeable change in the
physical condition of such animal and to report at once if such animal dies. It
is the duty of the Animal Control Officer to cause at least one examination at
the end of the quarantine period and such other examinations as may be deemed
necessary to insure that the animal is alive and well and not apparently
infected with rabies. If deemed necessary, the Animal Control Officer may order
such examinations done by a licensed veterinarian, and the owner of the animal
shall pay all costs of such examinations.
   6.   Payment of Quarantine and Examination Costs.
      A.   The owner of any animal quarantined may redeem such animal after any
quarantine period upon the payment in full of all costs of confinement,

examination before the animal is released. If the animal is not claimed after
the ten-day quarantine period, whether the owner is known or unknown, the
animal may be disposed of pursuant to this chapter.
      B.   When an animal dies during quarantine, the owner, if known, shall be
billed for all costs of confinement to date of death and for all examinations
including post-mortem or laboratory tests for rabies.
      C.   If the owner of an animal or any other person or organization
specifically requests a post-mortem or laboratory examination of an animal for
rabies, then the person making such request shall pay all examination costs.

into custody any abandoned vehicle on private property. The police authority

vehicle in custody and upon payment of the costs of the notice. The notice
shall also state that the failure of the owner, lienholders or claimants to
exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property within the
time provided shall be deemed a waiver by the owner, lienholders and claimants
of all right, title, claim and interest in the vehicle or personal property and
that failure to reclaim the vehicle or personal property is deemed consent to
the sale of the vehicle at a public auction or disposal of the vehicle to a
demolisher and to disposal of the personal property by sale or destruction. If
the abandoned vehicle was taken into custody by a private entity without a
police authority’s initiative, the notice shall state that the private entity

or exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property within the
10-day reclaiming period, the owner, lienholders or claimants shall no longer
have any right, title, claim, or interest in or to the vehicle or the personal
property. A court in any case in law or equity shall not recognize any right,

expiration of the 10-day reclaiming period.

   If it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identity and
addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders, notice by one
publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the
vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice
under Section
80.03. The published notice may contain multiple listings of abandoned vehicles
and personal property but shall be published within the same time requirements
and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed notice in Section
80.03.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3b])
80.05   FEES FOR IMPOUNDMENT.
   The owner, lienholder, or claimant shall pay all towing and storage fees as
established by the storage facility, whereupon the vehicle shall be released.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3a])
80.06   DISPOSAL OF ABANDONED VEHICLES.
   If an abandoned vehicle has not been reclaimed as provided herein, the

vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without notification
procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more wheels or
other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable. The police
authority shall give the applicant a certificate of authority. The applicant
shall then apply to the County Treasurer for a junking certificate and shall
surrender the certificate of authority in lieu of the certificate of title.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.90[2e])
80.08   PROCEEDS FROM SALES.

expense of auction, cost of towing, preserving, storing, and notification
required, in accordance with State law. Any balance shall be held for the owner
of the motor vehicle or entitled lienholder for 90 days, and then shall be
deposited in the State Road Use Tax Fund. Where the sale of any vehicle fails
to realize the amount necessary to meet costs the police authority shall apply
for reimbursement from the Department of Transportation.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[4])
80.09   DUTIES OF DEMOLISHER.
   Any demolisher who purchases or otherwise acquires an abandoned motor

96.01   PERMIT.
   No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connection with or opening
into, use, alter, or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof without
first obtaining a written permit from the Building Inspector. The application
for the permit shall set forth the location and description of the property to
be connected with the sewer system and the purpose for which the sewer is to be
used, and shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications, or other
information considered pertinent. The permit shall require the owner to
complete construction and connection of the building sewer to the public sewer
within 60 days after the issuance of the permit, except that when a property
owner makes sufficient showing that due to conditions beyond the owner’s
control or peculiar hardship, such time period is inequitable or unfair, an
extension of time within which to comply with the provisions herein may be
granted. Any sewer connection permit may be revoked at any time for a violation
of these chapters.
96.02   PERMIT FEE AND CONNECTION CHARGE.
   The person who makes the application shall pay a permit fee, as established
by resolution of the Council, to the Building Inspector to cover the cost of
issuing the permit and supervising, regulating, and inspecting the work. In
addition, there shall be a connection charge paid to reimburse the City for
costs borne by the City in making sewer service available to the property
served in accordance with the following:
   1.   Building Sewer Connection Charges.
      A.   If the property to be connected to the public sewer has not been
assessed for any part of the cost of construction of the public sewer, or has
been assessed only as an unimproved lot, the owner shall pay a connection
charge in an amount which shall be an equitable portion of the costs of the
public sewer in relation to the benefits received by the property as determined
by the Building Inspector, subject to approval, modification, or revocation by
the Council.
      B.   If the property to be connected to the public sewer has been
specifically assessed for the sewer facilities prior to the time of the
application for connection, there shall be no additional connection charge,
unless at the time of assessment a deficiency was allowed. Then the sewer
connection charge shall be equal to the deficiency previously allowed.
      C.   If the property to be connected to the public sewer has not been
assessed or is not subject to an assessment for the construction of the sewer
facilities to which connection is sought and said sewer was constructed through
assessments, the connection charge shall be equal to the average front footage
charge assessed to all property on the sewer involved applied to the front
footage of the property to be connected. Where the property has frontage on two
intersecting streets, the footage to which the charge shall be applied shall be
the one considered the front in all usual proceedings for assessments. Where
unusual parcel shape would make the charge inequitable to the owner or to the
City, the frontage shall be taken as the lot width at the face of the building.
      D.   If the property to be connected has not been subject to assessment
for the cost of the public sewer, constructed after January 1, 1970, and the
cost thereof was paid by general taxation, the sewer connection charge shall be
set by resolution of the Council.
      E.   If the property to be connected has not been subject to assessment
for the cost of the public sewer, constructed after May 1, 1989, and the cost
thereof was paid by general taxation, the sewer connection charge shall be set
by resolution of the Council.
   2.   Cross and Lateral Sewer Connection Charges. Before a permit for a new
cross or lateral sewer connection to a main sewer shall be granted, the
applicant shall have complied with the terms and conditions for such connection
established by the Council. Such terms and conditions may include, but not be
limited to, engineering design, construction standards, requirements for
inspection of construction of the applicant’s sewer, and the setting of
equitable charges to be paid for the right to connect to the main sewer and all
sewerage facilities to which the sewer will be contributory.
   3.   Connection Charge Reductions. No building sewer connection shall be
made to a public sewer which is not in front of the property to be served
unless the public sewer cannot feasibly be extended and the building sewer can
be connected without creating difficulties for other utilities in the street or
unless any such difficulties are offset by a definite public advantage in
having the connection. Where a public sewer is extended by applicant at the
applicant’s expense, it shall be constructed in accordance with the
specifications of the City for public sewers and connection charges may be
reduced by the cost thereof, in whole or in part.
96.03   PLUMBER REQUIRED.
   All installations of building sewers and connections to the public sewer
shall be made by a State-licensed plumber.
96.04   CONNECTION REQUIREMENTS.
   The installation and connection of the building sewer to the public sewer
shall conform to the requirements of the City’s Plumbing Code (
Chapter 160 of this Code of Ordinances) and applicable rules and regulations of
the City.
96.05   SEWER TAP.
   Connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the
“Y” branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If no properly
located “Y” branch is available, a saddle “Y” shall be installed at the
location specified by the Building Inspector. The public sewer shall be tapped
with a tapping machine and a saddle appropriate to the type of public sewer
shall be glued or attached with a gasket and stainless steel clamps to the
sewer. At no time shall a building sewer be constructed so as to enter a
manhole unless special written permission is received from the Building
Inspector and in accordance with the Building Inspector’s direction if such
connection is approved.
96.06   EXCAVATIONS.
   All trench work, excavation, and backfilling required for the installation
of a building sewer shall be performed in accordance with the provisions of the
City’s Plumbing Code and the provisions of
Chapter 135 of this Code of Ordinances.
96.07   INSPECTION REQUIRED.
   No building sewer shall be covered, concealed, or put into use until it has
been tested, inspected, and accepted as prescribed in the City’s Plumbing Code.
96.08   PROPERTY OWNER’S RESPONSIBILITY.
   All costs and expenses incident to the installation, connection, and
maintenance of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall
indemnify the City from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be
occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.
96.09   ABATEMENT OF VIOLATIONS.
   Building sewers, whether located upon the private property of any owner or
in the public right-of-way, which are constructed or maintained in violation of
any of the requirements of this chapter shall be deemed a nuisance and the same
shall be abated by the City in the manner provided for the abatement of
nuisances.

97.01   PLANT UNDER CITY CONTROL.
   The POTW of the City is under the supervision and control of the City.
97.02   GENERAL DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.
   1.   No user shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or
indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater which will interfere with the operation
or performance of the POTW.
   These general prohibitions apply to all such users of a POTW, whether or not
the user is subject to national categorical pretreatment standards or any other
national, State, or local pretreatment standards or requirements. A user may
not contribute the following substances to a POTW:
      A.   Any liquids, solids, or gases which by reasons of their nature or
quantity are, or may be, sufficient (either alone or by interaction with other
substances) to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the
POTW or to the operation of the POTW.
   At no time, shall two successive readings on an explosion hazard meter, at
the point of discharge into the system (or at any point in the system) be more
than five percent or any single reading over 10 percent of the lower explosive
limit (LEL) of the meter. Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to:
gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols,
ketones, hydrides, and sulfides and any other substances which the City, the
State or EPA has notified the user is a fire hazard or a hazard to the system.
      B.   Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the flow
in a sewer or other interference with the operation of the wastewater treatment
facilities such as, but not limited to: grease, garbage with particles greater
than one-half inch in any dimension, animal guts or tissues, paunch manure,
bones, hair, hides or fleshings, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes,
cinders, sand, spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass, straw, shavings,
grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, waste paper, wood, plastics,
gas, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining, or processing of fuel or
lubricating oil, mud, or glass grinding or polishing wastes.
      C.   Any wastewater having a pH less than six (6.0), or higher than nine
(9.0), or wastewater having any other corrosive property capable of causing
damage or hazard to structures, equipment and/or personnel of the POTW.
      D.   Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity,
either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere
with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or
animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW, or to
exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. A toxic
pollutant includes (but is not limited to) any pollutant identified pursuant to
Section 307(a) of the Act.
      E.   Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, or solids which (either
singly or by interaction with other wastes) are sufficient to create a public
nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers
for maintenance and repair.
      F.   Any substance which may cause the POTW’s effluent or any other
product of the POTW, such as residues, sludges, or scums, to be unsuitable for
reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case
shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance
with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under
Section 405 of the Act; any criteria, guidelines or regulations affecting
sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the
Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, or State criteria applicable
to the sludge management method being used.
      G.   Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES and/or
State disposal system permit or the receiving water quality standards.
      H.   Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the treatment
process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning
solutions.
      I.   Any pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (B.O.D., etc.)
released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which a user knows or
has reason to know will cause interference to the POTW.
   The industry shall coordinate with the POTW for the discharge of any slug
load which may have the potential to cause interference with the POTW.
      J.   Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or creates a
public nuisance.
   2.   When the Wastewater Foreman determines that a user is contributing to
the POTW any of the above-enumerated substances in such amounts as to interfere
with the operation of the POTW, the Wastewater Foreman shall:
      A.   Advise the user of the impact of the contribution on the POTW; and
      B.   Develop effluent limitations for such user to correct the
interference with the POTW.
97.03   FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   Upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for
a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent
than limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that subcategory,
shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this chapter. The
Wastewater Foreman shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting
requirements under 40 CFR, Section 403.12.
97.04   MODIFICATION OF STANDARDS.
   Where the City’s wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of
pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the City may apply to the
approval authority for modification of specific limits in the federal
pretreatment standards. “Consistent removal” means reduction in the amount of a
pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater
treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is
achieved by the system in ninety-five percent (95%) of the samples taken when
measured according to the procedures set forth in Section 403.7(c)(2) of Title
40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, General Pretreatment Regulations for
Existing and New Sources of Pollution, promulgated pursuant to the Act. The
City may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal pretreatment
standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR Section 403.7 are fulfilled
and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained.
97.05   SPECIFIC POLLUTANT LIMITATIONS.
   The total wastewater discharge of all users, in combination with domestic
users, shall not contain pollutants in such mass and/or concentration which
shall cause the POTW to be in violation of the intent of the pretreatment
program. Such limits shall be established by the latest edition of the
industrial waste pretreatment program adopted by the Council and allocated to
various discharges through the permit process. State requirements and
limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent
than federal requirements and limitations or those in this chapter.
97.06   EXCESSIVE DISCHARGE.
   No user shall ever increase the use of the process water for the purposes of
attempting to dilute or to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete
substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations
contained in the federal categorical pretreatment standards or in any other
pollutant-specific limitation developed by the City or State. (Note: Dilution
may be an acceptable means of complying with some of the prohibitions set forth
in Section
97.03, e.g., the pH prohibition.)
97.07   ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES.
   1.   Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this chapter. Facilities
to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and
maintained at the owner’s or user’s own cost and expense. Detailed plans
showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be
submitted to the City for review, and shall be approved by the City before
construction of the facility.
   2.   Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, the user shall
submit to the Wastewater Foreman a detailed written report describing the cause
of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar
future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, fish kills or any other damage to person or property; nor
shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or
other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable law.
   3.   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a
dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or
suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency
notification procedure.
97.08   CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF INTERCEPTORS.
   1.   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Wastewater Foreman, they are necessary for the proper handling
of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amount, or any flammable
wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall
not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units.
   2.   All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the City,
and shall be located so as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious
materials capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature.
Interceptors shall be of substantial construction, watertight, and equipped
with easily removable covers which when bolted in place shall be gastight and
watertight.
   3.   Where installed, all grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be
maintained by the owner, at the owner’s expense, in continuous efficient
operation at all times and subject to inspection without notice.
97.09   WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITS.
   No direct or indirect nondomestic contributor shall discharge or convey (or
permit or allow to be discharged or conveyed) any wastewater to the POTW
without a City wastewater discharge permit except as authorized under the
provisions of this chapter.
   1.   General Permits. All major and minor industrial users proposing to
connect to the POTW shall obtain a wastewater discharge permit before
connecting to or contributing to the POTW.
   Each individual building sewer of a major or minor user must have a
wastewater discharge permit. Proposed new users must obtain such permit prior
to connecting or contributing to the POTW.
   2.   Permit Application. Users required to obtain a wastewater discharge
permit shall complete and file with the City an application in the form
prescribed by the City, and accompanied by the appropriate fee, at least 90
days prior to connecting to or contributing to the POTW.
   In support of the application, the user shall submit, in units and term

the City may issue a wastewater discharge permit subject to terms and
conditions provided herein.
   3.   Permit Modifications. Within nine months of the promulgation of a
federal categorical pretreatment standard, the wastewater discharge permit of
the users subject to such standards shall be revised to require compliance with
such standard within the time frame prescribed by such standard. Where a user,
subject to a federal categorical pretreatment standard, has not previously
submitted an application for a wastewater discharge permit as required by
subsection 2 above, the user shall apply for a wastewater discharge permit
within 90 days after the promulgation of the applicable federal categorical
pretreatment standard.
   4.   Permit Conditions. Wastewater discharge permits shall be expressly
subject to all provisions of this chapter and all other applicable regulations,
user charges, and fees established by the City. Permits may contain the
following as determined by the Wastewater Foreman or pretreatment program
manager:

97.07 of this chapter;
      K.   Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the City to ensure
compliance with this chapter.
   5.   Permit Duration. Permits shall be renewable as directed by the
Wastewater Foreman for a period of one year. Permits may be issued for a period
of less than one year or may be stated to expire on a specific date. The user
shall apply for reissuance a minimum of 90 days prior to the expiration of the
user’s permit. The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to
modification by the City during the term of the permit as limitations or
requirements are modified or other just cause exists. The user shall be
informed of any proposed changes in the permit at least 30 days prior to the
effective date of change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall
include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.
   6.   Permit Transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific
operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be reassigned or transferred
or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises, or a new or changed
operation without the approval of the City. Any succeeding owner or user shall
also comply with the terms and conditions of the existing permit.
97.10   REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
   1.   Compliance Reports. Within 90 days following the date for final
compliance with applicable pretreatment standards, or, in the case of a new
source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW,
any user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the
Wastewater Foreman a report indicating the nature and concentration of all
pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by
such pretreatment standards and requirements and the average and maximum daily
flow for these process units in the user facility which are limited by such
pretreatment standards or requirements. The report shall state whether the
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent
basis and, if not, what additional operation and maintenance and/or
pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements. This statement shall be signed by an
authorized representative of the industrial user and certified to by a
qualified professional.
   2.   Periodic Reports. Any user subject to a pretreatment standard shall
submit to the Wastewater Foreman a report indicating the nature and
concentration of pollutants in the effluent that are limited by that standard.
The report shall also include a record of all daily flows that exceeded the
daily flow reported by the user on its wastewater discharge permit. The
Wastewater Foreman has the right to require as many reports as said official
deems necessary, but reports must be submitted at least twice annually on dates
determined by the Wastewater Foreman. If a user is subject to mass limitations,
the report shall also indicate the mass of regulated pollutants in the user’s
effluent.
   3.   Other Reports. The Wastewater Foreman may require other reports from
industrial users as necessary, including (but not limited to) the reports
required by 40 CFR 403.12. Reporting requirements will be made conditions of
the treatment agreement.
97.11   MONITORING FACILITIES.
   1.   The City shall require to be provided and operated, at the user’s own
expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow
measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user’s premises, but the
City may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on
the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk
area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles.
   2.   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
facility and sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times
in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   3.   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the City’s
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following
written notification by the City.
97.12   INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   The City shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the
purpose of this chapter is being met and all requirements are being complied
with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the City or its representative ready access at all times
to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, random sampling,
records examination and copying, or in the performance of any of their duties.
The City shall have the right to set up on the user’s property such devices as
are necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance monitoring and/or
metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would
require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that upon
presentation of suitable identification personnel from the City will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities. The City has the right to randomly sample industry
without notification of sample taking.
97.13   PRETREATMENT.
   1.   Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to
comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all federal
categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by
the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pre-treat
wastewater to a level acceptable to the City shall be provided, operated, and
maintained at the user’s expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment
facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the City for review,
and shall be acceptable to the City before construction of the facility. The
review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user
from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an
effluent acceptable to the City under the provisions of this chapter. Any
subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation, which
affects quality or quantity of discharge, shall be reported to and be
acceptable to the City prior to the user’s initiation of the changes.
   2.   The City shall annually publish in the largest local newspaper a list
of the users which were not in significant compliance (as defined in CFR 403)
with any pretreatment requirements or standards at least once during the 12
previous months. The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions
taken against the users during the same 12 months.
   3.   All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be
made available to officials of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources or the
EPA upon request.
97.14   CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   1.   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires,
permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall
be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction
unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the City that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade
secrets of the user.
   2.   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made

in the County Court.
97.19   CRIMINAL PENALTIES.
   Any user who is found to have violated an order of the Council or who
willfully or negligently failed to comply with any provision of this chapter
and the orders, rules and regulations and permits issued hereunder, shall be in
violation of this Code of Ordinances. Each day on which a violation shall occur
or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense. In addition to the
penalties for a violation, the City may recover reasonable attorney’s fees,
court costs, court reporters’ fees, and other expenses of litigation by
appropriate suit at law against the person found to have violated this chapter
or the orders, rules, regulations, and agreements issued hereunder.

   The amount of sewage discharged into a City sewer by any user shall be
determined by and held to be the amount of water used by said user as shown by
the meter readings of the waterworks of the City or the meter readings for the
water from a private water supply. If a user shall use water which, in whole or
in part, comes from a private water supply, the user shall meter the water
coming from a private water supply at the user's own expense when required by
the City and shall pay the same sewer rental rates as allowed in Section 99.01.

99.06   PAYMENT OF BILLS.
   All sewer service charges are due and payable with and under the same terms
and conditions as payment for water service as established by the Utility Board
of Trustees. To the extent that the fees are billed as part of a combined
service account, utility services may be discontinued if the account becomes
delinquent.
99.07   LIEN FOR NONPAYMENT.
   The owner of the premises served, and any lessee or tenant thereof shall be
jointly and severally liable for sewer service charges to the premises. Sewer
service charges remaining unpaid and delinquent shall constitute a lien upon
the property or premises served and shall be certified by the Utility Board to
the County Treasurer for collection in the same manner as property taxes.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
99.08   LIEN EXEMPTION.
   1.   Exemption. The lien for nonpayment shall not apply to the charges for
any of the services of sewer systems, storm water drainage systems, sewage
treatment, solid waste collection, and solid waste disposal for a residential
rental property where the charge is paid directly to the City by the tenant, if
the landlord gives written notice to the City that the property is residential
rental property and that the tenant is liable for the rates or charges for such
service. The City may require a deposit not exceeding the usual cost of 90 days
of such services to be paid to the City. When the tenant moves from the rental
property, the City shall refund the deposit if all service charges are paid in
full. The lien exemption does not apply to delinquent charges for repairs
related to any of the services.
   2.   Written Notice. The landlord's written notice shall contain the name of
the tenant responsible for charges, the address of the residential rental
property that the tenant is to occupy, and the date that the occupancy begins.
Upon receipt, the City shall acknowledge the notice and deposit. A change in
tenant for a residential rental property shall require a new written notice to
be given to the City within 30 business days of the change in tenant. A change
in tenant for a commercial rental property shall require a new written notice
to be given to the City within 10 business days of the change in tenant. A
change in the ownership of the residential rental property shall require
written notice of such change to be given to the City within 30 business days
of the completion of the change of ownership.
99.09   LIEN NOTICE.
   A lien for delinquent sewer service charges shall not be certified to the
County Treasurer unless prior written notice of intent to certify a lien is
given to the customer in whose name the delinquent charges were incurred. If
the customer is a tenant and if the owner or landlord of the property or
premises has made a written request for notice, the notice shall also be given
to the owner or landlord. The notice shall be sent to the appropriate persons
by ordinary mail not less than 30 days prior to certification of the lien to
the County Treasurer.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
99.10   SPECIAL AGREEMENTS PERMITTED.
   No statement in these chapters shall be construed as preventing a special
agreement, arrangement, or contract between the Council, and any industrial
concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be
accepted subject to special conditions, rate, and cost as established by the
Council.

100.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter of this Code of Ordinances pertaining to Sump
Pump and Groundwater Standards is to set forth uniform requirements for the
installation, use and discharge of sump pumps or other groundwater conveyance
systems; to prevent the introduction of clean surface water, including but not
limited to, water from roof or cellar drains, springs, basement sump pumps, and
French drains into the City sanitary sewer system; and to establish the penalty
structures required to enforce rules and regulations set forth in this chapter.
100.02   DEFINITIONS.
   For use in this chapter, unless the context specifically indicates
otherwise, the following terms are defined:
   1.   "Conveyance systems" means any structures or facilities designed to
collect, convey, or discharge groundwater, including, but not limited to,
downspouts, sump pumps, and French drains.
   2.   "Groundwater" means storm water, surface water, groundwater, well
water, or water from industrial or commercial air conditioning systems
(residential properties may have a 20 gallon per day maximum discharge from air
conditioning systems).
   3.   "Property Owner" means the legal or equitable owner of real property
located within the City.
   4.   "Sanitary sewer" means a sewer which carries sewage and to which storm,
surface, and ground waters are not intentionally admitted.
   5.   "Sewer" means a pipe or conduit for carrying sewage.
100.03   RESTRICTIONS.
   No water from any roof, surface, ground, sump pump, footing tile, or from
any other natural precipitation source shall be discharged into the City
sanitary sewer system. Any dwelling, building or other structure subject to the
provisions of this chapter which, because of the infiltration or water into
basements, crawl spaces and the like, require a seepage collection system, a or
any sump pump system to discharge water, shall have a permanently-installed
discharge line which shall not at any time connect to or discharge such storm
water into the City sanitary sewer system. For purposes of this chapter, a
permanent installation shall be one which provides for a year-round discharge
connection to the City subdrain/storm sewer system or a surface discharge point
which shall be located no closer than ten feet from any property line, or as
otherwise approved by the City's Code Enforcement Officer or Wastewater
Foreman. Such discharge line shall consist of a rigid discharge line inside the
structure, without valving or quick connections for altering the path of
discharge and, if connected to the City subdrain/storm sewer system, shall
include a check valve.
100.04   SUMP PUMP AND RIGID PIPE INSTALLATION.
   1.   Where a sump pit exists in any building it shall have a pump installed
with a discharge pipe. A discharge pipe shall be installed through the outside
foundation wall of the building with rigid pipe (plastic, copper or galvanized)
one (1) inch inside diameter minimum, without valves or quick connections that
would alter the path of discharge. The discharge shall be directed away from
the foundation wall.
   2.   No discharge shall be directed so as to impact neighboring properties.
100.05   INSPECTIONS.
   1.   Property owners shall allow the Code Enforcement Officer, Wastewater
Foreman, or the City's designated representative to inspect the buildings to
confirm and document that there is no sump pump or other prohibited discharge
into the wastewater collections system. The City may periodically re-inspect
any building or premises to determine compliance with the requirements of this
chapter. Property owners may meet the requirements of this section by
contracting with a licensed plumber who is authorized to do business in the
City to perform such inspection. An inspection performed by someone other than
the Code Enforcement Officer, Wastewater Foreman or the City's designated
representative will require the completion and return of an inspection form
provided by the City, documenting the results of the inspection. Any plumber in
the City of Evansdale who falsely attests to documentation regarding compliance
with this chapter may lose their plumbing license privileges in the City. All
costs associated with an inspection by a licensed plumber retained by the
property owner under this section shall be the responsibility of the property
owner.
   2.   The owner of any dwelling, building or other structure shall have a
period of thirty (30) days from the date the City sends written notice to the
owner requesting admittance to the owner's property for an inspection, to
either allow a City inspection of the property, or to contract with a licensed
plumber to perform the inspection and return a completed inspection form to the
City. Such inspection, whether performed by the City or by a licensed plumber
hired by the property owners, shall be completed and the City notified of the
results within the thirty (30) day period.
   3.   When ownership of any home or other building is transferred, the
building must have a reinspection completed and passed within ninety (90) day
of the date of transfer. The new property owner is responsible for contacting
the City to schedule such. Property owners may meet the requirements of this
section by contracting with a licensed plumber who is authorized to do business
in the City to perform such inspection and return a completed inspection form
to the City. Such inspection, whether performed by the City or by a licensed
plumber hired by the property owners, shall be completed and the City notified
of the results within the ninety (90) day period.
100.06   REMOVAL OF CONNECTIONS.
   1.   Any property owner who previously made any connection or installation
in violation of this chapter shall immediately remove such connection or
correct such an installation. If not removed or corrected within 180 calendar
days after notice of the violation has been delivered personally or by
certified mail to the owner, the City shall impose a surcharge in the amount
provided by this chapter.
   2.   The owner of a building or premises found to not be in conformance with
this chapter upon expiration of the 180-day notice period commenced pursuant to
section 100.06(1) shall be subjected to a surcharge as provided herein starting
from the initial date of inspection.
   3.   The permit fee shall be waived for any property owner or plumber
pulling a permit for the purpose of coming into compliance with this chapter.
100.07   FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR COMPLIANCE.
   1.   Property owners with gross monthly income below the threshold set
annually by the Hardship and Grievance Committee are eligible for assistance
with the cost of compliance with this chapter. The gross monthly income
threshold applicable for exemption from garbage collection fees shall be the
same threshold that applies to this chapter. For those property owners who both
qualify for assistance and comply with the terms of this section, the City will
initially pay the costs of coming into compliance with this chapter. The City
Clerk shall then certify the costs to the County Treasurer and such costs shall
be collected with, and in the same manner as, general property taxes. The
assessment shall be paid by the property owner in up to ten (10) annual
installments in the same manner and with the same interest rates provided for
assessments against benefited property under State law.
   2.   To qualify for assistance under this section, eligible property owners
must submit a written application in complete form, including providing
required supporting documentation, to the City no later than one (1) year after
the date of notice of violation was issued pursuant to this chapter. The
application shall be on a form provided by the City.
   3.   Property owners seeking assistance under this section must have the
work required for compliance completed by a licensed plumber. The property
owner must submit invoices, vouchers, and documentation clearly establishing
the costs incurred. Additionally, the property owner must agree, in writing, to
the following:
      A.   Assessments: The property owner must agree, in writing, to have the
costs advanced by the City assessed and collected in the same manner as general
property taxes.
      B.   Maintenance and Repair: The property owner shall maintain the sump
pump system and timely complete any repairs or replacement of the sump pump
system.
      C.   Discharge Modifications Prohibited: The property owner shall not
modify the sump pump discharge in any manner that is not in compliance with
this chapter.
   4.   Nothing in this section shall delay or suspend any surcharge assessed
under section 100.08. Property owners eligible for assistance under this
section will still be subject to a monthly surcharge if they fail to come into
compliance with this chapter within the notice periods provided in section
100.05 or section 100.06.
100.08   SURCHARGE.
   1.   Any property owner who fails to timely comply with the requirement of
section 100.05 or 100.06 of this chapter shall be subject to and pay a monthly
surcharge on the property owner's utility bill. This surcharge is intended to
offset the added costs associated with having to treat and collect clear water
unnecessarily when the status of a property's connection to the sanitary sewer
system cannot be ascertained, or when the property owner has failed to timely
disconnect any discharge of storm water to the City sanitary sewer system. This
surcharge shall commence on the first day of the month following the expiration
of the thirty (30) day period set in section 100.05 of this chapter, or the
deadline set in section 100.06 of this chapter, as applicable, when the
property owner has either failed to timely allow for an inspection or has
failed to timely correct any illegal connections to the City sanitary sewer
system. Such surcharge shall continue to be imposed on the property owner's
utility bill for as long as the property owner continues to own the property
without complying with the requirements of this chapter. If ownership of
property transfers prior to coming into compliance with this chapter, the new
property owner shall receive notices and the opportunity to correct
noncompliance, as provided in 100.05 and 100.06, prior to a surcharge being
imposed on the new property owner.
   2.   A surcharge of fifty dollars ($50.00) per month is hereby imposed on
every sewer bill to property owners for the following conditions:
      A.   Not in compliance with this chapter.
      B.   Refusal of property inspection.
100.09   PENALTY.
    Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall become
liable to the City for any expense, loss or damage occasioned the City by
reason of such violation. The City additionally retains the right to pursue any
and all civil remedies including, but not limited to, injunction or abatement
actions to remedy a violation.
100.10   HEARING.
   Any person aggrieved by any provision of this chapter may request a hearing
before the City Council within 30 days following an inspection. The hearing
request must be by written notice to the Mayor, who shall schedule the hearing
within 30 days. The finding of the City Council shall be final. Any person
aggrieved by the actions of the City Council under this chapter may seek relief
through the Courts as provided by law.

way, streets, avenues, alleys and public places to serve customers within and

inhabitants. For the term of this franchise, the Company is granted the right

ordinance.† 7
 
Notes

  was passed and adopted on August 1, 2023.
110.02   RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES.
   The rights and privileges hereby granted are subject to the restrictions and
limitations of Chapter 364 of the Code of Iowa 2023, or as subsequently amended
or changed.
110.03   MANAGEMENT OF FACILITIES.
   Company shall have the right to excavate in any public street for the
purpose of laying, relaying, repairing or extending gas pipes, mains, conduits,
and other facilities provided that the same shall be so placed as not to
interfere with any above or below-ground utility services or facilities which
have been or may hereafter be located by or under authority of the City.
110.04   USE OF PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
   The Company shall, excluding facilities located in private easements
(whether titled in Company exclusively or in Company and other entities), in
accordance with Iowa law including Company's tariff on file with and made
effective by the Iowa Utilities Board as may subsequently be amended
("Tariff,") at its cost and expense, locate and relocate its existing
facilities or equipment in, on, over or under any public street or alley in the
City in such a manner as the City may reasonably require for the purposes of
facilitating the construction, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of the
street or alley. Relocation expenses related to other hard surfaces, including
pedestrian and non-motorized vehicle pathways, will be paid by the City. If the
City, in its sole discretion, has a reasonable alternative route for the
street, alley or public improvements or an alternative construction method,
which would not cause the relocation of the Company installations, the City
shall select said alternative route, or construction method. The City shall be
responsible for surveying and staking the right-of-way for City projects that
require the Company to relocate Company facilities. If requested the City shall
provide, at no cost to the Company, copies of its relocation plan and profile
and cross section drawings. If tree and vegetation removal must be completed by
the City as part of the City's project and are necessary whether or not utility
facilities must be relocated, the City at its own cost shall be responsible for
said removals. If the timing of the tree/vegetation removal does not coincide
with the Company facilities relocation schedule and Company must remove trees/
vegetation that are included in the City's portion of the project, the City
shall either remove the material at its cost or reimburse the Company for the
expenses incurred to remove said vegetation or trees. If project funds from a
source other than the City are available to pay for the relocation of utility
facilities, the City shall, with reasonable assistance from the Company,
attempt to secure said funds and provide them to the Company to compensate the
Company for the costs of relocation.

the installation of gas pipes, conduits or apparatus, Company shall not
unreasonably obstruct the use of the streets. The Company in making such
excavations, shall, if required by ordinance, obtain a City permit therefore
and provide City representatives with advance notice prior to actual
commencement of the work and shall comply with all provisions and requirements
of the City in its regulation of the use of the City right of way in performing
such work. In emergencies which require immediate excavation, the Company may
proceed with the work without first applying for or obtaining the permit,
provided, however, that Company shall apply for and obtain the excavation
permit as soon as possible after commencing such emergency work. The Company
shall comply with all provisions and requirements of the City in its regulation
of the use of City right of way in performing such work. The Company shall
comply with all City ordinances regarding paving cuts, placement of facilities
and restoration of pavement and other public infrastructure. The Company shall
replace the surface, restoring it to the condition as existed immediately prior
to excavation. Company agrees any replacement of road surface shall conform to

required to restore or modify public right of way, sidewalks or other areas in
or adjacent to the Company project to a condition superior to its immediate
previously existing condition or to a condition exceeding its previously
existing condition to the extent any alterations are required for the City to
comply with city, state or federal rules, regulations or laws. The Company
agrees to work reasonably with the City to coordinate efforts and timing for
such improvements the City seeks to undertake, at the City's expense, in the
event the Company has excavated for the installation of natural gas pipes,
conduits or apparatus.

of-way shall not deprive the Company of its right to operate and maintain
existing facilities on, below, above, or beneath the vacated property. Prior to
the City abandoning or vacating any street, avenue, alley or public ground
where the Company has facilities in the vicinity, the City shall provide
Company with not less than sixty (60) days advance notice of the city's
proposed action and, upon request grant the Company a utility easement covering
existing and future facilities and activities. If the City fails to grant the
Company a utility easement for said facilities prior to abandoning or vacating
a street, avenue, alley or public ground, the City shall at its cost and
expense obtain easements for the existing Company facilities.
110.07   RELOCATION.
   The Company shall not be required to relocate, at its cost and expense,
Company facilities in the public right of way that have been relocated at
Company expense at the direction of the City at any time during the previous
five (5) years.
110.08   RELOCATION REIMBURSEMENT.
   Pursuant to relocation of Company facilities as may be required here under,
if the City orders or requests the Company to relocate its existing facilities
or equipment in order to directly or indirectly facilitate the project of a
commercial or private developer or other non-public entity, City shall
reimburse or the City shall require the developer or non-public entity to
reimburse the Company for the cost of such relocation as a precondition to
relocation. The Company shall not be required to relocate in order to
facilitate such private project at its expense.
110.09   INDEMNIFICATION.

boundaries of the right of way, of all equipment which it owns or over which it
has control that is located in the public right of way, including documents,

part be considered a confidential record under state or federal law or both.
Upon receipt of a request from a third party for information concerning
information about the Company's facilities within the City, the City will
promptly submit same to Company. If the Company believes any of the information
requested constitutes a trade secret which may otherwise be protected from
public disclosure by state or federal law, or otherwise exempt from disclosure

Regulatory Commission Critical Energy Infrastructure requirements pursuant to
18 CFR 388.112 and 388.113, or Chapter 22 of the Code of Iowa, as such statutes
and regulations may be amended from time to time, then the Company shall
provide the City with a written explanation of the basis for such assertion of
confidentiality or exemption from disclosure within ten (10) days. Therefore,
City shall not release any Information without prior consent of the Company and
shall return the Information to Company upon request. City recognizes that
Company claims the Information may constitute a trade secret or is otherwise
protected from public disclosure by state or federal law on other grounds, and
agrees to retain the Information in its non-public files. Furthermore, the City
agrees that no documents, maps or other Information provided to the City by the
Company shall be made available to the public or other entities if such
documents or Information are exempt from disclosure under the provisions of the
Freedom of Information Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Critical
Energy Infrastructure requirements pursuant to 18 CFR 388.112 and 388.113, or
Chapter 22 of the Code of Iowa, as such statutes and regulations may be amended
from time to time. In the event any action at law, in equity or administrative
is brought against the City regarding disclosure of any document which the

   There is hereby granted to MidAmerican Energy Company, an Iowa corporation,
(hereinafter called "Company,)" and its successors and assigns, the right and
non-exclusive franchise to acquire, construct, erect, maintain and operate in
the City of Evansdale, Iowa, (hereinafter called the "City,)" a system for the

along, under, over and upon the streets, avenues, rights of way and alleys to
serve customers within the City, and to furnish and sell electric energy to the
City and its inhabitants. The Company is granted the right to exercise of

effective date of this ordinance.† 8
 
Notes
  † EDITOR’S NOTE: Ordinance No. 693 approving an electric and
8 telecommunications franchise for the City was passed and adopted on August 1,
  2023.
111.02   RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES.
   The rights and privileges hereby granted are subject to the restrictions and
limitations of Chapter 364 of the Code of Iowa 2023 or as subsequently amended
or changed.
111.03   MANAGEMENT OF FACILITIES.
   The Company shall have the right to erect all necessary poles and to place
thereon the necessary wires, fixtures and accessories as well as to excavate
and bury conduits or conductors for the distribution of electric energy and
communications signals in and through the City, provided the same shall be
placed in accord with this franchise and City code regulations of the City,
regarding the placement of structures, facilities, accessories or other objects
in the right of way, including ordinances which assign corridors or other
placements to users of the right of way and requirements which may be adopted
regarding separation of structures, facilities, accessories or other objects.
Included herein, the Company may not locate poles, wires, fixtures and
accessories or other conduits and conductors in such a way that interferes with
water pipes, drain or sewer, or the flow of any water therefrom, which have
been or may hereafter be located by authority of the City, whether by ordinance
or other grant of authority.
111.04   USE OF PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
   The Company shall, excluding facilities located in private easements
(whether titled in Company exclusively or in Company and other entities), in
accordance with Iowa law including Company's Tariff on file with and made
effective by the Iowa Utilities Board as may subsequently be amended
("Tariff"), at its cost and expense, locate and relocate its existing
installations located in, on, over or under the right-of-way of any public
street, right of way or alley in the City in such a manner as the City may
require for the purposes of facilitating the construction, reconstruction,
maintenance or repair of the street right of way or alley. If the City, in its
sole discretion, has a reasonable alternative route for the street, right of
way or alley or an alternative construction method, which would not cause the
relocation of Company installations or would minimize the cost or expense of
relocation of Company installations, the City and Company shall work together
to consider said alternative route or construction method. The City shall, in
the extension or modification of streets and roads, make provision for the
placement of company service lines and facilities on City-owned right of way
without charge to Company. In planning for the extension or modification of
streets, the City shall, to the extent practicable design such changes to limit
the need for relocation of Company facilities. The City shall be responsible
for surveying and staking the right-of-way for City projects that require the
Company to relocate Company facilities. If requested, the City shall provide,
at no cost to the Company, copies of the relocation plan and profile and cross
section drawings. If vegetation and tree removals must be completed by the City
as part of the City's project and are necessary whether or not utility
facilities must be relocated, the City at its own cost shall be responsible for
said removals. If the timing of vegetation and tree removals does not coincide
with Company's facilities relocation schedule and the Company must remove
vegetation and trees that are included in the City's portion of the project,
the City shall either remove them or reimburse the Company for the expenses
incurred to remove said materials. If project funds from a source other than
the City are available to pay for the relocation of utility facilities, the
City shall, with reasonable assistance from the Company, use its best efforts
to secure said funds and provide them to the Company to compensate the Company
for the costs of relocation.
111.05   EXCAVATIONS.
   In making excavations in any streets, avenues and public places for the
installation, maintenance or repair of conductor, conduits or the erection of
poles and wires or other appliances, the Company shall not unreasonably
obstruct the use of the streets. The Company in making such excavations shall,
if required by ordinance, obtain a City permit therefore and provide City
representatives with advance notice prior to the actual commencement of the
work, and shall comply with all provisions and requirements of the City in its
regulation of the use of City right of way in performing such work. In
emergencies which require immediate excavation, the Company may proceed with
the work without first applying for or obtaining the permit, provided, however,
that Company shall apply for and obtain the excavation permit as soon as
possible after commencing such emergency work. The Company shall comply with
all provisions and requirements of the City in its regulation of the use of
City right of way in performing such work. The Company shall comply with all
City ordinances regarding paving cuts, placement of facilities and restoration
of pavement and other public infrastructure. The Company shall replace the
surface, restoring the condition as existed prior to the Company's excavation
but shall not be required to improve or modify the public right of way,
sidewalks or other areas in or adjacent to the Company project to a condition
superior to its immediate previously existing condition. Company shall complete
all repairs in a timely manner. Company agrees any replacement of road surface
shall conform to current City ordinances regarding its depth and composition.
111.06   STREET VACATIONS.
   The City's vacating a street, avenue, alley, public ground or public right-
of-way shall not deprive the Company of its right to operate and maintain
existing facilities and their replacements on, below, above, or beneath the
vacated property. Prior to the City abandoning or vacating any street, avenue,
alley or public ground where the Company has electric facilities, the City
shall provide Company with not less than sixty (60) days advance notice of the
city's proposed action and, upon request grant the Company a utility easement
for said facilities. If the City fails to grant the Company a utility easement
for said facilities prior to abandoning or vacating a street, avenue, alley or
public ground, the City shall at its cost and expense obtain easements for the
existing Company facilities.
111.07   RELOCATION.
   The Company shall not be required to relocate, at its cost and expense,
Company facilities in the public right of way that have been relocated at
Company expense at the direction of the City in the previous five (5) years.
111.08   RELOCATION REIMBURSEMENT.
   Pursuant to relocation of Company facilities, if the City orders or requests
the Company to relocate its existing facilities or equipment in order to
directly facilitate a project for the primary benefit of a commercial or
private developer or other non-public entity, the City shall require the
developer or non-public entity to reimburse the Company for the cost of such
relocation as a precondition to relocation of its existing facilities or
equipment. The Company shall not be required to relocate in order to facilitate
such private project at its expense.
111.09   INDEMNIFICATION.
   The Company shall indemnify, save and hold harmless the City from any and
all claims, suits, losses, damages, costs or expenses, on account of injury or
damage to any person or property, to the extent caused or occasioned by the
Company's negligence in construction, reconstruction, excavation, operation or
maintenance of the electric facilities authorized by this franchise; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be obligated to defend, indemnify and save
harmless the City for any costs or damages to the extent arising from the
negligence of the City, its officers, employees or agents.
111.10   TREES AND VEGETATION.
   The pruning and removal of vegetation and trees shall be done in accordance
with current nationally accepted safety and utility industry standards and
federal and state law, rules and regulations. The Company is authorized and
empowered to prune or remove at Company expense, any tree extending into any
street, avenue, right of way, alley, public place or public grounds to maintain
electric reliability, safety, to restore utility service and to prevent limbs,
branches, or trunks from interfering with the wires and facilities of the
Company. The pruning and removal of vegetation and trees shall be completed in
accordance with nationally accepted safety and utility standards, NSI Z133.1-
2012, American National Standard for Arboricultural Operations-Safety
Requirements, and ANSI A300(part 1) - 2008 Pruning, (Revision of ANSI A300 part

Management - Standard of Practices (Pruning) or subsequent revisions to these
standards, and City ordinances regarding the pruning of trees that incorporate
by reference that standard.
111.11   INFORMATION.
   Upon reasonable request, the Company shall provide the City, on a project
specific basis, information indicating the horizontal location, relative to
boundaries of the right of way, of all equipment which it owns or over which it
has control that is located in City right of way, including documents, maps and
other information in paper or electronic or other forms ("Information.") The
Company and City recognize the Information may in whole or part be considered a
confidential record under state or federal law or both. Upon receipt of a
request from a third party for information concerning information about the
Company's facilities within the City, the City will promptly submit same to
Company. If the Company believes any of the information requested constitutes a
trade secret which may otherwise be protected from public disclosure by state
or federal law, or otherwise exempt from disclosure under the provisions of the
Freedom of Information Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Critical
Energy Infrastructure requirements pursuant to 18 CFR 388.112 and 388.113, or
Chapter 22 of the Code of Iowa, as such statutes and regulations may be amended
from time to time, then the Company shall provide the City with a written
explanation of the basis for such assertion of confidentiality or exemption
from disclosure within ten (10) days. Therefore, City shall not release any
Information without prior consent of the Company and shall return the
Information to Company upon request. City recognizes that Company claims the
Information may constitute a trade secret or is otherwise protected from public
disclosure by state or federal law on other grounds, and agrees to retain the
Information in its non-public files. Furthermore, the City agrees that no
documents, maps or other Information provided to the City by the Company shall
be made available to the public or other entities if such documents or
Information are exempt from disclosure under the provisions of the Freedom of
Information Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Critical Energy
Infrastructure requirements pursuant to 18 CFR 388.112 and 388.113, or Chapter
22 of the Code of Iowa, as such statutes and regulations may be amended from
time to time. In the event any action at law, in equity or administrative is
brought against the City regarding disclosure of any document which the Company
has designated as a trade secret or as otherwise protected from disclosure, the
Company shall assume, upon request of the City, the defense of said action and
reimburse the City any and all costs, including attorney fees and penalties to
the extent allowed by law.
111.12   STATE REGULATIONS.
   The Company shall construct, operate and maintain its facilities in
accordance with the applicable regulations of the Iowa Utilities Board or its
successors and Iowa law. During the term of this franchise, the Company shall

subdivision. At a minimum, the City agrees to require as a condition of issuing
a permit for open trenching to any utility or developer that: (i) the utility
or developer give the Grantee at least 10 days’ advance written notice of the
availability of the open trench; and (ii) the utility or developer provide the
Grantee with reasonable access to the open trench. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Grantee shall not be required to utilize any open trench.
112.11   REQUIRED EXTENSIONS OF THE CABLE SYSTEM.
   Grantee agrees to provide cable service to all residences in the service
area subject to the density requirements specified in this subsection. Whenever
the Grantee receives a request for cable service from a potential subscriber in
an unserved area contiguous to Grantee’s existing distribution facilities where
there are at least 10 residences within 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet (one-
quarter cable mile) from the portion of the Grantee’s trunk or distribution
cable which is to be extended, it shall extend its cable system to such
subscribers at no cost to said subscribers for the cable system extension,
other than the published standard/non-standard installation fees charged to all
subscribers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to extend the cable system into any portion of the
service area where another operator is providing cable service, into any
annexed area which is not contiguous to the present service area of the
Grantee, or into any area which is financially or technically infeasible due to
extraordinary circumstances, such as a runway or freeway crossing.
112.12   SUBSCRIBER CHARGES FOR EXTENSIONS OF CABLE SYSTEM.
   No subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily. However, if an area does
not meet the density requirements of Section
112.11 above, the Grantee shall only be required to extend the cable system to
subscribers in that area if the subscribers are willing to share the capital
costs of extending the cable system. Specifically, the Grantee shall contribute
a capital amount equal to the construction cost per mile, multiplied by a
fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of residences per 1,320
cable-bearing strand feet from the Grantee’s trunk or distribution cable, and
whose denominator equals 10. Subscribers who request service hereunder shall
bear the remaining cost to extend the cable system on a pro rata basis. The
Grantee may require that payment of the capital contribution in aid of
construction borne by such potential subscribers be paid in advance.
Subscribers shall also be responsible for any standard/non-standard
installation charges to extend the cable system from the tap to the residence.
112.13   SERVICE TO PUBLIC BUILDINGS.
   The Grantee, upon request, shall provide, without charge, a standard
installation and one outlet of basic cable service to those administrative
buildings owned and occupied by the City, fire stations, police stations, and
K-12 public schools that are passed by its cable system. The cable service
provided shall not be distributed beyond the originally installed outlet
without authorization from the Grantee. The cable service provided shall not be
used for commercial purposes, and such outlets shall not be located in areas
open to the public. The City shall take reasonable precautions to prevent any
inappropriate use of the Grantee’s cable system or any loss or damage to
Grantee’s cable system. The City shall hold the Grantee harmless from any and
all liability or claims arising out of the provision and use of cable service
required by this subsection. The Grantee shall not be required to provide an
outlet to such buildings where a non-standard installation is required, unless
the City or building owner/occupant agrees to pay the incremental cost of any
necessary cable system extension and/or non-standard installation. If
additional outlets of basic cable service are provided to such buildings, the
building owner/occupant shall pay the usual installation and service fees
associated therewith.
112.14   REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS.
   If funds are available to any person using the public way for the purpose of
defraying the cost of any of the foregoing, the City shall reimburse the
Grantee in the same manner in which other persons affected by the requirement
are reimbursed. If the funds are controlled by another governmental entity, the
City shall make application for such funds on behalf of the Grantee.
112.15   FRANCHISE FEE.
   1.   The Grantee shall pay to the City a franchise fee of three percent (3%)
of annual gross revenues (as defined in Section
112.01 of this chapter). In accordance with the Cable Act, the 12-month period
applicable under the franchise for the computation of the franchise fee shall
be a calendar year. The franchise fee payment shall be due annually and payable
within 90 days after the close of the preceding calendar year. Each payment
shall be accompanied by a brief report prepared by a representative of the
Grantee showing the basis for the computation.
   2.   Limitation on Franchise Fee Actions. The period of limitation for
recovery by the City of any franchise fee payable hereunder shall be three
years from the date on which payment by the Grantee is due to the City.
112.16   RATES AND CHARGES.
   The City may regulate rates for the provision of basic cable service and
equipment as expressly permitted by federal law.
112.17   RENEWAL OF FRANCHISE.
   1.   The City and the Grantee agree that any proceedings undertaken by the
City that relate to the renewal of the Grantee’s franchise shall be governed by
and comply with the renewal provisions of federal law.
   2.   In addition to the procedures set forth in the Cable Act, the City
agrees to notify the Grantee of all of its assessments regarding the identity
of future cable-related community needs and interests, as well as the past
performance of the Grantee under the then current franchise term. The City
further agrees that such assessments shall be provided to the Grantee promptly
so that the Grantee has adequate time to submit a proposal pursuant to the
Cable Act and complete renewal of the franchise prior to expiration of its
term.
   3.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this section, the
Grantee and the City agree that at any time during the term of the then current
franchise, while affording the public appropriate notice and opportunity to
comment in accordance with the provisions of federal law, the City and the
Grantee may agree to undertake and finalize informal negotiations regarding
renewal of the then current franchise and the City may grant a renewal thereof.
   4.   The Grantee and the City consider the terms set forth in this section
to be consistent with the express renewal provisions of the Cable Act.
112.18   CONDITIONS OF SALE.
   If a renewal or extension of the Grantee’s franchise is denied or the
franchise is lawfully terminated, and the City either lawfully acquires
ownership of the cable system or by its actions lawfully effects a transfer of
ownership of the cable system to another party, any such acquisition or
transfer shall be at the price determined pursuant to the provisions set forth
in Section 627 of the Cable Act. The Grantee and the City agree that in the
case of a final determination of a lawful revocation of the franchise, the
Grantee shall be given at least 12 months to effectuate a transfer of its cable
system to a qualified third party. Furthermore, the Grantee shall be authorized
to continue to operate pursuant to the terms of its prior franchise during this
period. If, at the end of that time, the Grantee is unsuccessful in procuring a
qualified transferee or assignee of its cable system which is reasonably
acceptable to the City, the Grantee and the City may avail themselves of any
rights they may have pursuant to federal or State law. It is further agreed
that the Grantee’s continued operation of the cable system during the 12-month
period shall not be deemed to be a waiver or an extinguishment of any rights of
either the City or the Grantee.
112.19   TRANSFER OF FRANCHISE.
   The Grantee’s right, title, or interest in the franchise shall not be sold,
transferred, assigned, or otherwise encumbered, other than to an entity
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Grantee, without
prior written notice to the City. No such notice shall be required, however,
for a transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment
of any rights, title, or interest of the Grantee in the franchise or cable
system in order to secure indebtedness.
112.20   BOOKS AND RECORDS.
   The Grantee agrees that the City, upon 30 days’ written notice to the
Grantee and no more than once annually, may review such of its books and
records at the Grantee’s business office, during normal business hours and on a
non-disruptive basis, as is reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the
terms of this chapter. Such notice shall specifically reference the section of
this chapter that is under review so that the Grantee may organize the
necessary books and records for easy access by the City. Alternatively, if the
books and records are not easily accessible at the local office of the Grantee,
the Grantee may, at its sole option, choose to pay the reasonable travel costs
of the City’s representative to view the books and records at the appropriate
location. The Grantee shall not be required to maintain any books and records
for franchise compliance purposes longer than three years. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Grantee shall not be required to
disclose information that it reasonably deems to be proprietary or confidential
in nature, nor disclose books and records of any affiliate which is not
providing cable service in the service area. The City agrees to treat any
information disclosed by the Grantee as confidential and only to disclose it to
employees, representatives, and agents thereof that have a need to know, or in
order to enforce the provisions hereof. The Grantee shall not be required to
provide subscriber information in violation of Section 631 of the Cable Act.
112.21   INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   The Grantee shall maintain insurance in full force and effect, at its own
cost and expense, during the term of the franchise. The City shall be
designated as an additional insured and such insurance shall be non-cancellable
except upon 30 days’ prior written notice to the City. Upon written request,
the Grantee shall provide a Certificate of Insurance showing evidence of the
coverage required by this subsection.
112.22   INDEMNIFICATION.
   The Grantee agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless, and defend the
City, its officers, boards and employees, from and against any liability for
damages and for any liability or claims resulting from property damage or
bodily injury (including accidental death), which arise out of the Grantee’s
construction, operation, or maintenance of its cable system in the service area
provided that the City shall give the Grantee written notice of its obligation
to indemnify the City within 10 days of receipt of a claim or action pursuant
to this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee shall not indemnify
the City for any damages, liability, or claims resulting from the willful
misconduct or negligence of the City.
112.23   ENFORCEMENT AND TERMINATION OF FRANCHISE.
   1.   Notice of Violation. In the event that the City believes that the
Grantee has not complied with any material term of the franchise, the City
shall informally discuss the matter with Grantee. If these discussions do not
lead to resolution of the problem, the City shall notify the Grantee in writing
of the exact nature of such alleged noncompliance.
   2.   The Grantee’s Right to Cure or Respond. The Grantee shall have 30 days
from receipt of the notice described in subsection 1: (i) to respond to the
City, contesting the assertion of such noncompliance; or (ii) to cure such
default; or (iii) in the event that, by the nature of such default, it cannot
be cured within the 30-day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such
default and notify the City of the steps being taken and the projected date
that they will be completed.
   3.   Public Hearing. In the event that the Grantee fails to respond to the
notice described in subsection 1 pursuant to the procedures set forth in
subsection 2, or in the event that the alleged default is not remedied within
30 days or the date projected pursuant to subsection 2 above, if it intends to
continue its investigation into the default, then the City shall schedule a
public hearing. The City shall provide the Grantee at least ten days’ prior
written notice of such hearing, which specifies the time, place, and purpose of
such hearing, and provide the Grantee the opportunity to be heard.
   4.   Enforcement. Subject to applicable federal and State law, in the event
the City, after the hearing set forth in subsection 3, determines that the
Grantee is in material default of any provision of the franchise, the City may:
      A.   Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other
equitable relief; or
      B.   In the case of repeated or ongoing substantial noncompliance with a
material term of the franchise, seek to revoke the franchise in accordance with
subsection 5.
   5.   Revocation. Should the City seek to revoke the franchise after
following the procedures set forth in subsections 1 through 4 above, the City
shall give written notice to the Grantee of its intent. The notice shall set
forth the exact nature of the repeated or ongoing substantial noncompliance
with a material term or terms of the franchise. The Grantee shall have 90 days
from such notice to object in writing and to state its reasons for such
objection. In the event the City has not received a satisfactory response from
the Grantee, it may then seek termination of the franchise at a public hearing.
The City shall cause to be served upon the Grantee, at least 30 days prior to
such public hearing, a written notice specifying the time and place of such
hearing and stating its intent to revoke the franchise. At the designated
hearing, Grantee shall be provided a fair opportunity for full participation,
including the right to be represented by legal counsel, to introduce relevant
evidence, to require the production of evidence, to compel the relevant
testimony of the officials, agents, employees or consultants of the City, to
compel the testimony of other persons as permitted by law, and to question
witnesses. A complete verbatim record and transcript shall be made of such
hearing. Following the hearing, the City shall determine whether or not the
franchise shall be revoked. If the City determines that the franchise shall be
revoked, the City shall promptly provide Grantee with its decision in writing.
The Grantee may appeal such determination of the City to an appropriate court
which shall have the power to review the decision of the City de novo. Grantee
shall be entitled to such relief as the court finds appropriate. Such appeal
must be taken within 60 days of Grantee’s receipt of the determination of the
City. The City may, at its sole discretion, take any lawful action which it
deems appropriate to enforce the City’s rights under the franchise in lieu of
revocation of the franchise.
   6.   Force Majeure. The Grantee shall not be held in default under, or in
noncompliance with, the provisions of the franchise, or suffer any enforcement
or penalty relating to noncompliance or default, where such noncompliance or
alleged defaults occurred or were caused by circumstances reasonably beyond the
ability of the Grantee to anticipate and control. This provision includes work
delays caused by waiting for utility providers to service or monitor their
utility poles to which the Grantee’s cable system is attached, as well as
unavailability of materials and/or qualified labor to perform the work
necessary. Furthermore, the parties hereby agree that it is not the City’s
intention to subject the Grantee to penalties, fines, forfeitures or revocation
of the franchise for violations of the franchise where the violation was a good
faith error that resulted in no or minimal negative impact on the subscribers
within the service area, or where strict performance would result in practical
difficulties and hardship to the Grantee which outweigh the benefit to be
derived by the City and/or subscribers.
112.24   ACTIONS OF PARTIES.
   In any action by the City or the Grantee that is mandated or permitted under
the terms hereof, such party shall act in a reasonable, expeditious, and timely
manner. Furthermore, in any instance where approval or consent is required
under the terms hereof, such approval or consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.
112.25   ENTIRE AGREEMENT.
   This chapter constitutes the entire agreement between the Grantee and the
City and supersedes all other prior understandings and agreements oral or
written. Any amendments to this chapter shall be mutually agreed to in writing
by the parties.
112.26   RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.
   Acceptance of the terms and conditions of this chapter will not constitute,
or be deemed to constitute, a waiver, either expressly or impliedly, by Grantee
of any constitutional or legal right which it may have or may be determined to
have, either by subsequent legislation or court decisions. The City
acknowledges that Grantee reserves all of its rights under applicable federal
and State Constitutions and laws.
112.27   NOTICE.
   Unless expressly otherwise agreed between the parties, every notice or
response required by this chapter to be served upon the City or the Grantee
shall be in writing, and shall be deemed to have been duly given to the
required party when placed in a properly sealed and correctly addressed
envelope: (i) upon receipt when hand delivered with receipt/acknowledgment;
(ii) upon receipt when sent certified, registered mail; (iii) within five
business days after having been posted in the regular mail; or (iv) the next

possible revocation of a license. Such notice shall contain particulars of the
complaints against the licensee, the ordinance provisions or State statutes
allegedly violated, and the date, time and place for hearing on the matter.
122.13   HEARING.
   The Clerk shall conduct a hearing at which both the licensee and any

the relocation of the building is not in the best interests of the surrounding
property owners due to the age of the structure or architecture not being
compatible with the existing buildings, a permit for the moving of a building
shall be denied and the reasons therefor endorsed upon the application. The
permit shall also be denied in the event the structure will not comply with
this Code of Ordinances or the laws of the State relating to electrical and
plumbing requirements of new structures, unless the owner has obtained a permit

refuses to consent to the operations; or in the event the structure will not

expense incurred by the City as a result of said person’s operations, or whose

front of or along which it is desired to excavate.
      D.   Location and dimensions of street cut.
      E.   Date of commencement of the work and estimated completion date.
   2.   Barricades, Fencing and Lighting. The permit holder shall protect the
excavation with adequate barricades, fencing, and red warning lights meeting
standards specified by the City from the time the work is started until it is
completed to the satisfaction of the City Inspector.
   3.   Backfilling Completed by Permit Holder. In case a permit holder has the
proper mechanical equipment for tamping backfills, and obtains permission from
the Inspector, said permit holder may do the backfilling and tamping with final
inspection by the Inspector. In the event the permit holder does the tamping
and backfilling, said permit holder shall be responsible for the maintenance of
such for one year.
   4.   Backfilling; Tight-Sheathed Excavations. Whenever an excavation made in
paving is of such nature that tight sheathing is required, the backfill shall
be made with dry sand as the sheathing is being removed, and in no case shall
any sheathing be pulled above the dry sand backfill before the backfill is
completed.
   5.   Backfilling; Replacement of Unsuitable Materials. Whenever, in the

moisture or any other cause, the permit holder shall be required to remove the
unsuitable materials and replace and compact the backfill with suitable
materials.

disturbances in the parking of any street shall preserve and protect all sod,
trees, and shrubbery and shall restore such parking to a condition as nearly

Inspector, make such restoration or repairs as are ordered by the Inspector
within five days after notice to do so by the Inspector, and in case the permit
holder fails to make the ordered restoration or repair within such time, the
City may make such repair or restoration, without further notice, and the
permit holder shall be liable to the City for the cost of such repair or
restoration. Whenever any excavation is make in such parkings, all excavated
materials, excepting the sod, shall be deposited in the roadway. The permit
holder, at the time of making and compacting the backfill, shall replace the

the Inspector. If found unsatisfactory, the permit holder will remove and
replace within two weeks. If two weeks expires and the removal and replacement
of the unsatisfactory road surface have not been made by the permit holder, the
Street Superintendent will remove and replace the material at the permit
holder’s expense.
   8.   Increasing Size of Excavation. No person shall increase the size of any
excavation, opening it more than 50 percent of the area provided for in the
permit or extend the dimensions of the excavation to such extent that the
street or alley will be blockaded, without obtaining the permission of the
Inspector.
   9.   Tunneling. Tunneling will be allowed only when permission is given by
the Inspector, excepting under curb and gutter, or sidewalks not over five
feet, four inches in width, and whenever tunneling is resorted to, it shall be
done with the minimum amount of excavation possible. In case any pavement or
sidewalk becomes unsupported, due to caving, or any other cause, to the extent
that, in the opinion of the Inspector, backfilling and compacting cannot be
made in a satisfactory manner, it shall be removed and replaced following
backfilling and compacting in its original condition. Pushing or jacking of
cast-iron sewer service pipe under roadways will be permitted, providing the
cast-iron pipe is left uncovered at each end so that it can be readily
ascertained that no excavation was made by tunneling. In case cast-iron pipe is
pushed through an existing service sewer, each end of the existing sewer shall
be closed against the cast-iron pipe with cement mortar.
   10.   Billing and Payment of Charges.

resolution of the Council to the Clerk, who shall provide a written receipt

front of or abutting property not owned by the person employing the applicant
for the permit shall be issued only when a release from the owner of such
property is filed with the application. In case the applicant is unable to
secure said release and the application is refused by the Inspector for this or
any other reason, the applicant shall have the right to petition the Council
therefor and if it is approved by the Council, the Inspector shall issue the
permit in accordance with this section.
   13.   License and Bond Prerequisites to Issuance. No permit required by this
section shall be issued to any person not holding and having a franchise,
license, or contract for which satisfactory bonds have been given to protect
and hold the City harmless and otherwise to do and perform all such acts, as
the ordinances of the City and the provisions of the contract require.

work is to be done shall be the same time the permit is valid or in force. Any

extension of time shall be valid unless signed by the Superintendent.

notice, call the Council together to review the determination of the Public
Works Committee. The person appealing shall be notified of the time and place
of the meeting of the Council and shall have the right to meet with the
Council, either alone or through an attorney, and present arguments as to why
the determination of the Public Works Committee should be overturned.

136.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to enhance safe passage by citizens on
sidewalks, to place the responsibility for the maintenance, repair,

particular area in which a sidewalk is to be constructed.
   3.   “One-course construction” means that the full thickness of the concrete
is placed at one time, using the same mixture throughout.
   4.   “Owner” means the person owning the fee title to property abutting any
sidewalk and includes any contract purchaser for purposes of notification
required herein. For all other purposes, “owner” includes the lessee, if any.
   5.   “Portland cement” means any type of cement except bituminous cement.
   6.   “Season” means October through the following April.
   7.   “Sidewalk” means all permanent public walks in business, residential,

or depositing of material in the public right-of-way in connection therewith.
   9.   “Wood float finish” means a sidewalk finish that is made by smoothing
the surface of the sidewalk with a wooden trowel.
136.03   REMOVAL OF SNOW, ICE, AND ACCUMULATIONS.
   It is the responsibility of the abutting property owners to remove snow,
ice, and accumulations promptly from sidewalks. If an owner does not remove
snow, ice, or accumulations as required by this section, the City shall serve
notice on the property owner by ordinary mail. The notice shall state the
address of the property in violation of this chapter and demand that any snow,
ice, and accumulations from the sidewalks be abated within three days from the
date the notice was served. The notice shall state that unless such snow, ice,
and accumulation be removed by the date stated in the notice, the City will
remove such snow, ice, and accumulations and assess the cost thereof to the
abutting property owner. The City may assess costs against the owner for
collection in the same manner as a property tax. The notice shall further state
that this notice constitutes notice for the remainder of the season and that
further action will be taken by the City to remedy the problem, without
additional written notice, if it occurs again on the same property. Any
property owner who violates the provisions of this chapter will be given one
(1) notice per season and the City is authorized to respond to additional
violations without further notice to the property owner. The abutting property

CHAPTER 146
WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS TOWERS
 
146.01 Purpose         146.05 Design Standards
146.02 Definitions     146.06 Other Design Requirements
146.03 Process         146.07 Abandonment
146.04 Where Permitted
 
146.01   PURPOSE.
   The special provisions of this chapter are intended to regulate the location
of new communication towers and antennas. The Telecommunications Act of 1996
restructured and deregulated many aspects of the country’s communications
industry. New telecommunication providers entering the market desire to build a
network that can require additional freestanding communication towers as well
as antennas mounted on existing buildings and other structures. It is the
desire of the City to encourage an aesthetically pleasing local environment. It
is also the intent of the City to encourage the expansion of wireless
technology, because it provides a valuable service to residents and
businesspersons in the City. It is not the City’s goal to unreasonably
discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services; and to not
have the effect of prohibiting, either directly or indirectly, the provisions
of personal wireless services. It is the goal to encourage wireless providers
to construct new facilities disguised as public art pieces, as natural
vegetation, or to mount antenna on buildings in a way that blends
architecturally with the built environment. In accordance with applicable
zoning regulations, any request to place, construct, or modify personal
wireless services facilities shall be acted on within a reasonable time after
the request is duly filed with the proper City office, taking into account the
nature and scope of each request. Any decision to deny a request to place,
construct, or modify personal wireless services facilities shall be in writing
and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record. The goals
are:
   1.   To minimize the adverse visual effects of communication structures
through careful design, siting, locating, and screening;
   2.   To locate and engineer communications support structures to mitigate
potential damage to adjacent properties from structural failure;
   3.   To allow for the reasonable location and efficient use of communication
structures though co-location of carriers; and
   4.   To preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort,
and convenience of the citizens of the City.
146.02   DEFINITIONS.
   For use in this chapter, the following terms are defined:
   1.   “Camouflage design” describes a piece of art, or an architectural
structure or element, that functions as a communications facility and
aesthetically blends with the surrounding historical or aesthetically sensitive
environment. Examples of camouflage design include, but are not limited to,
flagpoles, clock towers, monuments, and church steeples. Camouflage design also
applies in the architectural integration of communication facilities onto
existing buildings, sports field lights, highway sign, water towers, etc. All
such designs are subject to review and approval of the communications carrier,
the landlord, and the Planning and Zoning Commission. If deemed to be of major
significance, the request would be contingent upon final approval by the Board
of Adjustment, after review by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   2.   “Communications structure” means any tower or any other structure that
supports devices used in the transmission or reception of microwave energy,
analog data transfer techniques, radio frequency energy, and other digital data
transfer techniques.
   3.   “Communications structure site” means a tract or parcel of land that
contains the wireless communication structure, accessory buildings, and
parking, and may include other uses associated with and necessary for wireless
communication and transmission.
   4.   “Effectively screened” means an area of planting which provides an
effective visual barrier. For a single row, the screen shall consist of spruce,
firs, or pines spaced at a maximum spacing of 15 feet; or a double staggered
row of spruce, firs, or pines spaced at a maximum spacing of 20 feet within
each row; for Arborvitae and juniper, the spacing shall be a double staggered
row with maximum spacing of 10 feet within each row, or a single row with
maximum spacing of 6 feet.
   5.   “Minimum height” means the lowest vertical distance at which the
structure can still operate at an efficient level of service. An efficient
level of service is deemed to be 95 percent or greater of possible operative
levels.
   6.   “Monopole” means a self-supporting, cylindrical, metallic pole used as
a communications support structure and engineered to support more than one
communications carrier in exchange for a rental fee.
   7.   “Multiple use facilities (co-location effort)” means wireless
communications facilities that are shared with other existing or newly
constructed uses, such as, but not limited to, sports field lights, retail
business highway signs, flagpoles, or other shared competing communications
facilities, etc.
   8.   “Significance, major” means a request meeting the criteria as described
in Section
146.03(2). Any deviation from the design standards may revert to a request of
formerly minor significance to this classification.
   9.   “Significance, minor” means a request meeting the criteria described in
Section
146.03(1) and being in compliance with design standards.
   10.   “Structure height” means the vertical distance measured from the base
of the antenna support structure at grade to the highest point of the
structure. If the support structure is on a sloped grade, then the average
between the highest and lowest grades of the cell site shall be used in
calculating the height.
   11.   “Tall structure” means any structure the top of which is more than 50
feet above grade.
146.03   PROCESS.
   1.   Minor Significance. The proposed structure shall be subject to review
and approval by the Building Inspector if any of the following are true
(Agricultural, Manufacturing, and/or Commercial classifications):
      A.   All proposed structures to be constructed as a monopole design.
      B.   All proposed structures to be co-located on an existing
communications facility or structure at least 50 feet in height.
      C.   All proposed structures to be set back 1.5 times the height of the
tower from the nearest property line and of monopole design.
   2.   Major Significance. The proposed structure shall require review by the
Planning and Zoning Commission if any of the following are true:
      A.   Agricultural and Manufacturing zoning classifications: lattice or
guyed design towers as specified in Section
146.05(4) as contained herein.
      B.   Commercial zoning classifications: any structure not employing
monopole design or co-located upon an existing communications facility or
structure equal to or greater than 50 feet in height.
      C.   Residential zoning classification or uses: any structures.
146.04   WHERE PERMITTED.
   The proposed structure is classified as a permitted use, upon approval as
noted above in Sections
146.03(1) and (2), if any of the following are true:
   1.   Agricultural and Manufacturing zoning classifications and any other
specific plans allowing such uses:
      A.   Communications structures are not permitted within 150 feet of an
interstate or state highway. The tower shall be setback a distance equal to 1.5
times the height of the tower. This shall be measured from the outermost point
of the base to the nearest property line.
      B.   When mounted on a building and architecturally integrated into an
existing structure and/or multiple use facilities.
      C.   When the structure uses camouflage or monopole design.
   2.   Residential and Commercial zoning classifications and specific plans
allowing such uses:
      A.   When mounted on a building ad architecturally integrated into an
existing structure and/or multiple use facilities.
      B.   When the structure uses camouflage or monopole design.
146.05   DESIGN STANDARDS.
   The proposed structure must comply with the following provisions prior to
the issuance of any permits.
   1.   Necessity. The wireless communications company shall demonstrate that
the antenna must be located where it is proposed in order to satisfy the
antenna’s function in the company’s grid system.
   2.   Co-Location Effort. If the wireless communications company proposes to
build a tower (as opposed to mounting the antenna on an existing tall
structure), it shall demonstrate a reason of substantial nature describing the
inability to co-locate. This demonstration shall utilize one or more of the
following criteria to satisfactorily illustrate why co-location on an existing
tall structure is infeasible:
      A.   Structural Infeasibility. The wireless communications company shall
provide a structural analysis to show the structural loading, minimum height,
available space on the existing structure, or available ground space at the
proposed site is inadequate to serve its needs for a viable communications
structure site.
      B.   Economic Infeasibility. Co-location on an existing tall structure is
an incentive to, and is in the economic best interest of, each wireless
communication company shall provide evidence, to include written assurances in
the form of affidavits, that it could not obtain permission from owners of tall
structures within a ¼-mile radius of the proposed site to install its antennas
on those tall structures.
The Planning and Zoning Commission may deny the permit if it concludes that the
applicant has not made a good faith effort to mount the antenna on an existing

   1.   To integrate Storm Water Management Plans in the Evansdale Metropolitan
Area with other community plans such as the Hazard Mitigation Plan.
   2.   To encourage innovative and economic solutions, which provide for
multipurpose use of storm water management facilities. The use of land solely
for conveyance or storage of storm water runoff should be minimized.
   3.   To identify the roles and shared responsibilities of all participants
in urban storm water management, including regular maintenance of storm water
management facilities.
   4.   To implement a program addressing both individual development sites and
a watershed (drainage area) approach to the planning and construction of storm
water management facilities.
   5.   To develop storm water management standards to minimize soil erosion,
sedimentation, and adverse effects on ground water.
   6.   To reduce the adverse impacts on existing developed areas by the
implementation of storm water management practices on development sites.
   7.   To systematically reduce the existing level of storm water inundation
in areas currently experiencing flooding, in a manner consistent with the
overall goals and objectives for storm water management set forth in this
chapter.
   8.   To adopt engineering methods and techniques for estimating storm water
runoff which can be updated as technology improves, and to systematically
monitor the effectiveness of the storm water management program.

   This section applies to all facilities that have storm water discharges
associated with industrial activity, including construction activity.
   1.   The Building Inspector shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the Building Inspector.
   2.   Facility operators shall allow the Building Inspector ready access to
all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination, and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of
an NPDES permit to discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional
duties as defined by State and federal law.
   3.   The Building Inspector shall have the right to set up on any permitted
such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the Building Inspector
monitoring and/or sampling of the facility’s storm water discharge.
   4.   The Building Inspector has the right to require the discharger to
install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to
measure storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their
accuracy.
   5.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the Building Inspector and shall not
be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
   6.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Building Inspector access to a
permitted facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this
chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to
discharge storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if
the person denies the Building Inspector reasonable access to the permitted
facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by
this chapter.
   7.   If the Building Inspector has been refused access to any part of the
premises from which storm water is discharged, and said official is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter
or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety,
and welfare of the community, then the Building Inspector may seek issuance of
a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
148.11   REQUIREMENT TO USE BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The Building Inspector will adopt requirements identifying best management
practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or
contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain
system, or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a commercial
or industrial establishment shall provide, at said owner’s expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these
structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person’s expense, additional structural
and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions
of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated
with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance
with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a storm water
pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements
of the NPDES permit.
148.12   WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes (or such
person’s lessee) shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse.
148.13   NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of the United
States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the Building
Inspector in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business
day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the Building Inspector within three business days of
the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a
commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and
the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for
at least three years.
148.14   ENFORCEMENT.
   Whenever the Building Inspector finds that a person has violated a
prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the Building
Inspector may order compliance by written notice of violation to the
responsible person. Such notice may require, without limitation:
   1.   The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
   2.   The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
   3.   Violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist;
   4.   The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or contamination
hazards and the restoration of any affected property;
   5.   Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and
   6.   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation
or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should
the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the
work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the
expense thereof shall be charged to the violator.
148.15   APPEAL OF NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   Any person receiving a Notice of Violation may appeal the determination of
the Building Inspector. The notice of appeal must be received within seven days
from the date of the Notice of Violation. Hearing on the appeal before the
appropriate authority shall take place within 15 days from the date of receipt
of the notice of appeal. The decision of the municipal authority shall be
final.
148.16   ENFORCEMENT MEASURES AFTER APPEAL.
   If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the Notice of Violation, or in the event of an appeal within seven
days of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the decision of the
Building Inspector, then representatives of the Building Inspector shall enter
upon the subject private property and are authorized to take any and all
measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It is
unlawful for any person, owner, agent, or person in possession of any premises
to refuse to allow the government agency or designated contractor to enter upon
the premises for the purposes set forth above.
148.17   COST OF ABATEMENT OF THE VIOLATION.
   Within 14 days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the property
will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The
property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the
assessment within 14 days. If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner
as determined by the decision of the municipal authority or by the expiration
of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special
assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for
the amount of the assessment. Any person violating any of the provisions of
this chapter shall become liable to the City by reason of such violation. The
liability shall be paid in not more than 12 equal payments. Interest at the
rate of four percent per annum shall be assessed on the balance beginning on
the 31st day following discovery of the violation.
148.18   INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
   It is unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply
with any of the requirements of this chapter. If a person has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, the Building Inspector may
petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from
activities which would create further violations or compelling the person to
perform abatement or remediation of the violation.
148.19   COMPENSATORY ACTION.
   In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized by
this chapter, the Building Inspector may impose upon a violator alternative
compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at compliance
workshops, creek cleanup, etc.
148.20   VIOLATIONS DEEMED A PUBLIC NUISANCE.
   In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any
condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of
this chapter is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare and is declared
and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the
violator’s expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel
the cessation of such nuisance may be taken.
148.21   CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   Any person who has violated or continues to violate this chapter shall be
liable to criminal prosecution to the fullest extent of the law. Each day in
which a violation shall continue shall be deemed a separate offense. The
Building Inspector may recover all attorneys’ fees, court costs, and other
expenses associated with enforcement of this chapter, including sampling and
monitoring expenses.
148.22   REMEDIES NOT EXCLUSIVE.
   The remedies listed in this chapter are not exclusive of any other remedies
available under any applicable federal, State, or local law and it is within

installations, issuance of permits, and collection of fees, and to provide
penalties for violations of this chapter in order to protect public safety,
health, and welfare.
160.02   SCOPE.
   The provisions of this chapter apply to and govern the plumbing system,
which includes all potable water supply and distribution pipes from the City
main, all plumbing fixtures and traps, all drainage and vent pipes and all
building drains and house sewers, including their respective joints and
connections, devices, receptacles, and appurtenances within the property lines
of the premises and shall include potable water piping, potable water treating
or using equipment, fuel gas, piping, water heaters, and vents for the same.
For the purpose of this section, the term “plumbing fixture” means an approved
type installed receptacle, device, or appliance which is supplied with water or
which receives liquid or liquid-borne wastes and discharges such wastes into
the drainage system to which it may be directly or indirectly connected.
Industrial or commercial tanks, vats, and similar processing equipment are not
plumbing fixtures when and as otherwise provided for elsewhere in this chapter.
160.03   WORK TO CONFORM.
   All plumbing work shall be performed in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter.
160.04   UNIFORM PLUMBING CODE ADOPTED.
   The Uniform Plumbing Code, 2009 Edition, including future amendments to the
same, as published by the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical
Officials, and which includes appendices “A,” “B,” “C,” “D,” “E,” and “G,” is
hereby adopted as though fully set forth and is incorporated and made a part of
this section by reference. A copy of this chapter, certified as required by

160.06   SPECIFIC AMENDMENTS.
   The following additions and changes are hereby made to the 2009 Edition of
the Uniform Plumbing Code as adopted by this chapter and all references to
sections or chapters in this section refer to specific sections or chapters of
the 2009 Edition of the Uniform Plumbing Code:
   1.   Administrative Authority. Whenever the term “administrative authority”
is used in this code it shall mean the City Building Inspector or an authorized
representative.
   2.   Cleanouts. Section 1107. Cleanouts, is amended to add a paragraph (g)
to read as follows:
      (g)   There shall be a cleanout near the junction of the building drain
and building sewer or a cleanout with Y branch inside the building wall unless
the cleanout at the base of the stack is within five feet of the point where
the sewer enters the building and in such case the stack cleanout will be
sufficient.
   3.   Fees. Any and all fees associated with this chapter shall be set by
resolution of the City Council, the fee schedule contained in the adopted
version of the International Building Code notwithstanding.
160.07   CONFLICTS.
   If portions of this chapter are found to be at variance or inconsistent with
the Uniform Plumbing Code adopted by this chapter, the variance or
inconsistency shall first be reconciled; however, should such variance between
portions of this chapter and Uniform Plumbing Code be irreconcilable, the
portion of the Uniform Plumbing Code shall control and govern.
160.08   CORRECTION OF DEFECTS.
   1.   When a complaint in writing is made by an owner, agent or lessee in
regard to a licensed plumbing contractor’s work that a sewer or water
connection is faulty or defective, the master plumber, under whose bond such
work has been done, within one year of such construction, shall be notified in
writing by the Building Inspector to correct such faulty or defective work
within 10 days from date of such notification. In the event that the owner,
agent, or lessee shall have such work corrected on such faulty or defective
sewer or water connection before the expiration of the period of time specified
in such notification, such action shall be deemed a waiver of right of any
damages sustained by such faulty or defective work.
   2.   When the master plumber so notified to correct such faulty or defective
work has complied with such notification, and when, upon examination of such
faulty or defective work, it is found that the cause for such correction shall
have originated from other causes than faulty or defective construction, the
owner, agent, or lessee filing such complaint shall pay for all the cost of
said work caused by such complaint, and shall not be entitled to any damages or
attorney fees.
   3.   Should the property owner be dissatisfied with the determination by the
contractor and/or the Building Inspector as to the cause of the plumbing
problem, then and in that event the property owner shall have the right to
commence an action upon such bond in his or her own name without joining the
City to recover the costs of such reconstruction and damages sustained thereby,
and in case the property owner recovers damages therefor, is entitled also to
recover a reasonable attorney’s fee for the prosecution of such action.

maintenance work for that industry, gas utility, commercial building owner, or
manager of properties for the following plumbing maintenance work inside the
property line: the repairing of leaks or clearing of stoppage in soil, waste,
gas, water or vent pipes, valves, drains, traps or fixtures and the replacement
of the same with new, approved materials in any part or parts thereof.
160.10   APPLICABILITY OF STATE CODE.
   This chapter and the Uniform Plumbing Code, 2009 Edition, adopted by this
chapter shall not be construed to supersede the minimum requirements of the
State Plumbing Code, rules and regulations of the State Department of Health
governing the installation of plumbing published by the State, except that the
higher and more stringent, but not lower, standards as set forth in the State
Plumbing Code will be established as the minimum requirements under this

the same, as recommended by the National Fire Protection Association, is hereby
adopted in full except for the portions that are deleted, modified, or amended
by this chapter. From the effective date of the ordinance codified in this
chapter, all electrical work as defined in Section
162.01 shall be performed in accordance with the provisions of this code as
modified in this chapter. A copy of the National Electrical Code as adopted and
a certified copy of the ordinance codified herein are on file in the office of
the Clerk for public inspection.
162.03   AMENDMENTS.
   The following amendments, modifications, additions, and deletions to the
National Electrical Code are hereby made:
– NONE –
162.04   ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
   It is the duty of the Building Inspector to administer and enforce the
provisions of this chapter. The Building Inspector shall keep complete records
of all permits issued, inspections and re-inspections made, and other official
work performed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
162.05   INSTALLATION BY OWNER.
   In cases where the owner/occupant desires to install wiring or apparatus in
the owner/occupant’s own residence, the owner may appear before the Building
Inspector and show that said owner is competent to do the specific work for
which the permit is desired and upon such showing, may obtain a permit by
paying to the City the proper fees.
162.06   PERMIT FOR ELECTRICAL WORK.
   No electrical work as defined in Section
162.01 of this chapter shall be done unless a permit authorizing the work has
been issued by the Building Inspector. A permit shall be issued if the
electrical work, as proposed in the application for a permit, meets all the
requirements of this chapter. If plans and specifications are requested by the
Building Inspector, they must meet the requirements of this chapter.
162.07   PERMIT ISSUED.
   Permits shall be issued only to licensed electrical contractors. However,
any permit required by this chapter may be issued to the owner of a single-
family dwelling (or mobile home) used exclusively for living purposes, to do
any work regulated by this chapter in that dwelling, including the usual
accessory buildings and quarters, provided that the dwelling will be occupied
by the owner, that the owner appears before the Building Inspector and shows
himself or herself competent to do the specific work for which the permit is
desired, and that the owner personally shall purchase all materials and perform
all labor in connection with the work. All work done in accordance with this
exception must meet all the requirements of this chapter and shall be inspected
like other work.
162.08   APPLICATION FOR PERMIT.
   Applications for permits shall be made to the Building Inspector, on forms
provided by the Clerk, prior to beginning the particular work, except for

particular part or parts of the work that must be inspected as required by this
chapter. The applications shall be accompanied by fees in accordance with the
schedule of fees adopted by resolution of the Council. Permits shall be valid
for 90 days from date of issue.
162.09   PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   Plans and specifications showing the proposed work in the necessary detail
shall be submitted if requested by the Building Inspector. If a permit is
denied, the applicant may submit revised plans and specifications without
payment of any additional fee. If, in the course of the work, it is found
necessary to make any change from the plans and specifications on which a
permit was issued, amended plans and specifications shall be submitted. Fees in
the amount of half the fees originally required shall be paid. A supplementary
permit, subject to the same conditions applicable to the original permit, shall
be issued to cover the change.
162.10   EMERGENCY WORK.
   In emergency situations work can be initiated and completed by licensed
electricians without first obtaining a permit. However, a permit must be
obtained within a reasonable time after the passage of the critical period.
With this exception, all emergency work must be done in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter and shall be inspected by the Building Inspector for
full compliance.
162.11   FEES.
   Fees for permits to do electrical work are set by resolution of the Council,
a schedule of such fees being on file in the office of the Clerk.
162.12   INSPECTIONS.
   Upon the completion of electrical work that has been done under a permit,
the person doing the work shall notify the Building Inspector in person, by
phone, or by mail. The Building Inspector shall inspect the work within 24
hours, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, after receipt of notice,
or as soon thereafter as practicable. If the Building Inspector finds the work
to be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, the Building Inspector
shall issue the person that has done the work a certificate of approval and
shall deliver a duplicate copy of the certificate of approval to the owner of
the premises where the work was done. This certificate shall authorize the use
of the work and its connection to the supply of electricity. The Building
Inspector shall send written notice or phone this authorization to the agency
supplying the electricity. A certificate of approval may be issued authorizing
the connection and use of a temporary installation. Such certificate shall be
issued to expire at a stated time and may be revoked by the Building Inspector
for any violation of this chapter. If any electrical equipment is to be hidden
from view by the permanent placement of parts of a building, structure, or
grounds, the person installing the equipment shall notify the Building
Inspector. Such equipment shall not be concealed until it has been inspected
and approved by the Building Inspector or until twenty-four (24) hours,
exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, shall have elapsed after the
receipt of such notification by the Building Inspector. On installations where
the concealment of equipment proceeds continuously, the person installing the
equipment shall give the Building Inspector due notice. Inspections shall be
made periodically during the progress of the work.
162.13   RIGHT OF ENTRY.
   The Building Inspector shall have the right, during reasonable hours and
upon consent of the occupant, to enter any building or premises in the
discharge of official duties to make any inspection, re-inspection, or test of
electrical equipment that is reasonably necessary to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare. Where the building or premises is unoccupied, the consent
of the owner shall be obtained. If the Building Inspector has reasonable cause
to believe that electrical installations or equipment within the building or
premises constitute an extreme hazard to persons or property, the Building
Inspector shall have the right to enter immediately and inspect such
installations or equipment, and may use any reasonable means required to effect
such entry and make such inspection, whether such property be occupied or
unoccupied and whether or not permission to inspect has been obtained.
162.14   STOP WORK ORDER.
   Upon notice from the Building Inspector that work in or on any building or
structure is being done contrary to the provisions of this chapter or in a
dangerous or unsafe manner, such work shall be immediately stopped. Such notice
shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property or to an
agent or to the person doing the work and shall state the conditions under
which the work may be resumed.
162.15   REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   The Building Inspector may revoke a permit or approval issued under the
provisions of this chapter in case of false statement or misrepresentation as
to a material fact in the application or plans on which a permit or approval
was based.
162.16   SHUTTING OFF SUPPLY.
   If the Building Inspector finds that any electrical equipment or
installation is defective or that it has been installed in conflict with the
provisions of this chapter, the Building Inspector shall notify the person
responsible for the electrical equipment or installation of such findings and
orders. If the necessary changes or repairs are not completed within 15 days
(or longer periods as specified in the notice), the Building Inspector shall
have the authority to disconnect or order the discontinuance of electrical
service to the equipment or installation in question. No disconnection shall be
made during the pendency of an appeal to the Electrical Appeal Board. In cases
where maintenance of electrical service to electrical equipment or
installations constitutes an extreme hazard to persons or property, the
Building Inspector shall have authority to cause immediate discontinuance of
such service. If fires have damaged the wiring of any building or structure,
reconnection to electrical supply shall not be made until authorized in writing
by the Building Inspector.
162.17   APPROVAL OF MATERIALS.
   The Building Inspector may approve in advance electrical materials inspected
and approved by the Underwriters’ Laboratories, Inc. and other materials of
equal or higher quality. The Building Inspector shall keep on file a list of
such approved materials; this list shall be accessible for public reference
during regular office hours.
162.18   APPEALS.
   The City’s Board of Adjustment shall be the Electrical Appeal Board for the
purposes of this chapter. Necessary and actual expenses shall be allowed to
members of the board, but no other compensation shall be paid to them. Any
person aggrieved by any ruling, decision, interpretation or order of the
Building Inspector pursuant to this chapter shall have the right to appeal to
the Electrical Appeal Board by filing a written notice of such appeal with the
Clerk within 10 days from the date of the ruling, decision, interpretation, or
order. If such a notice is filed, the Appeal Board shall set a time and place
for a hearing, and notify the party that has filed the appeal. The date of the
hearing shall be not more than 15 days after the date the notice of appeal was
filed. The notice of the hearing shall be sent by certified mail. The hearing
shall be open to the public; all interested persons shall be given an
opportunity to be heard. The Electrical Appeal Board, by majority vote, shall
affirm, modify, or reverse any appealed ruling, decision, interpretation, or
order of the Building Inspector. The Electrical Appeal Board may permit
variance from the strict terms and provisions of this chapter if such variance
can be made without increasing the hazards to health or safety of persons or
property and when the granting of such variance will not violate the intent and
purposes of this chapter. Mere inconvenience to the appellant shall not be

improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and convenience of its
residents by minimizing flood losses with provisions designed to:
   1.   Restrict Use. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, or property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in
flood heights or velocities.
   2.   Vulnerable Uses Protected. Require that uses vulnerable to floods,
including public facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood
damage at the time of initial construction or substantial improvement.
   3.   Unsuitable Land Purchases. Protect individuals from buying lands which
may not be suited for intended purposes because of flood hazard.
   4.   Flood Insurance. Assure that eligibility is maintained for property
owners in the community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood
Insurance Program.

repairs necessary to keep a structure in a safe and habitable condition and
which do not trigger a building permit, provided they are not associated with a
general improvement of the structure or repair of a damaged structure. Such
repairs include:
      A.   Normal maintenance of structures such as re-roofing, replacing
roofing tiles and replacing siding;
      B.   Exterior and interior painting, papering, tiling, carpeting,

the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or
other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start
means either the first placement or permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of pile, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a factory-built home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start

attached to the ground, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories,
sheds, cabins, factory-built homes, storage tanks, and other similar uses.
   29.   “Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage
condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood-related damages
sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10-year period for
which the cost of repairs at the time of such flood event, on the average,
equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   30.   “Substantial improvement” means any improvement to a structure which
satisfies either of the following criteria:
      A.   Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost
of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure
either: (i) before the “start of construction” of the improvement, or (ii) if
the structure has been “substantially damaged” and is being restored, before
the damage occurred. The term does not, however, include any project for
improvement of a structure to comply with existing State or local health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure
safe conditions for the existing use. The term also does not include any
alteration of an “historic structure,” provided the alteration will not
preclude the structure’s designation as an “historic structure.”
      B.   Any addition which increases the original floor area of a building
by 25 percent or more. All additions constructed after the effective date of
the Flood Insurance Rate Map shall be added to any proposed addition in
determining whether the total increase in original floor space would exceed 25
percent.
   31.   “Variance” means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of
the flood plain management regulations.
   32.   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with this chapter.
165.03   LANDS TO WHICH CHAPTER APPLIES.
   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all lands and uses which have
significant flood hazards. The Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Black Hawk
County and Incorporated Areas, City of Evansdale, Panels 19013C0306F, 0307F,
0308F, 0309F, 0328F, dated July 18, 2011, which were prepared as part of the
Black Hawk County Flood Insurance Study, shall be used to identify such flood
hazard areas and all areas shown thereon to be within the boundaries of the
100-year flood shall be considered as having significant flood hazards. Where
uncertainty exists with respect to the precise location of the 100-year flood
boundary, the location shall be determined on the basis of the 100-year flood
elevation at the particular site in question. The Flood Insurance Study for the
County of Black Hawk is hereby adopted by reference and is made a part of this
chapter for the purpose of administering flood plain management regulations.
165.04   COMPLIANCE.
   No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall be
located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance
with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations which apply to
uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
165.05   ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any
existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this
chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provision of this chapter shall
prevail. Any ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to
the extent of the inconsistency only.
165.06   INTERPRETATION.
   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter
shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in
favor of the Council and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any
other powers granted by State statutes.
165.07   WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The standards required by this chapter are considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes. This chapter does not imply that areas outside the
designated areas of significant flood hazard will be free from flooding or
flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City
or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from
reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
165.08   GENERAL FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT STANDARDS.
   All uses must be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and shall
meet the following applicable performance standards. Where 100-year flood data
has not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Department of Natural
Resources shall be contacted to determine: (i) whether the land involved is
either wholly or partly within the floodway or floodway fringe; and (ii) the
100-year flood level. The applicant will be responsible for providing the
Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make
such determination.
   1.   All Development. All development within the areas of significant flood
hazard shall:
      A.   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
      B.   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.

governmental agencies including approval when required from the Iowa Department
of Natural Resources.
   2.   Residential Buildings. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the 100-year flood level. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
100-year flood level and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers) may be allowed, subject to favorable consideration by the City
Council, where existing topography, street grades, or other factors preclude
elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods used must be adequate to support
the structure as well as withstand the various forces and hazards associated
with flooding. All new residential structures shall be provided with a means of
access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the 100-year flood.
   3.   Nonresidential Buildings. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential buildings shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the 100-year flood level, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be flood proofed to such a level. When
flood proofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State
shall certify that the flood proofing methods used are adequate to withstand
the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and other
factors associated with the 100-year flood; and that the structure, below the
100-year flood level, is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum) to which any
structures are flood proofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
   4.   All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
      A.   Fully enclosed areas below the “lowest floor” (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
         (1)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
         (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
         (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, and
low damage potential storage.
      B.   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
      C.   New and substantially improved structures must be constructed with
electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and
other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding.
   5.   Factory-Built Homes.
      A.   All factory-built homes, including those placed in existing factory-
built home parks or subdivisions, shall be elevated on a permanent foundation
such that the lowest floor of the structure is a minimum of one foot above the
100-year flood level.
      B.   All factory-built homes, including those placed in existing factory-
built home parks or subdivisions, shall be anchored to resist flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not
limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
   6.   Utility and Sanitary Systems.
      A.   On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located or
designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
      B.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system as well as
the discharge of effluent into floodwaters. Wastewater treatment facilities
(other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood protection
equal to or greater than one foot above the 100-year flood elevation.
      C.   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. Water supply
treatment facilities other than on-site systems shall be provided with a level
of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the 100-year flood
elevation.
      D.   Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
   7.   Flammable or Explosive Materials. Storage of equipment and materials
that are flammable, explosive, or injurious to human, animal or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the 100-year flood
level. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or: (i)
not subject to major flood damage and anchored to prevent movement due to
floodwaters; or (ii) readily removable from the area within the time available
after flood warning.
   8.   Levees and Floodwalls. Flood control structural works such as levees,
floodwalls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from a 100-year flood
with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for adequate
interior drainage. In addition, structural flood control works shall be
approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
   9.   Watercourse Alternations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must
be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations must be
approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
   10.   Subdivisions. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and
subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the 100-year flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50
lots (whichever is less) shall include 100-year flood elevation data for those
areas located within the area of significant flood hazard.
   11.   Accessory Structures.
      A.   Detached garages, sheds, and similar structures accessory to a
residential use are exempt from the 100-year flood elevation requirements where
the following criteria are satisfied:
         (1)   The structure shall not be used for human habitation.
         (2)   The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential.
         (3)   The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building
site so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
         (4)   The structure shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation
which may result in damage to other structures.
         (5)   The structure’s service facilities such as electrical and
heating equipment shall be elevated or flood-proofed to at least one (1) foot
above the 100-year flood level.
      B.   Exemption from the 100-year flood elevation requirements for such a
structure may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of
the structure and its contents.
   12.   Recreational Vehicles.
      A.   Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of Section
165.08(5) of this chapter regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built
homes when the following criteria are satisfied.
         (1)   The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less
than 180 consecutive days, and
         (2)   The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
      B.   Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than 180
consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements of
Section
165.08(5) of this chapter regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built
homes.
   13.   Pipelines. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be buried in the
streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due
to channel degradation and meandering.
165.09   SPECIAL FLOODWAY STANDARDS.
   In addition to the general flood plain standards, uses within the floodway
must meet the following applicable standards. The floodway is that portion of
the flood plain which must be protected from developmental encroachment to
allow the free flow of floodwaters. Where floodway data has been provided in
the flood insurance study, such data shall be used to define the floodway.
Where no floodway data has been provided, the Department of Natural Resources
shall be contacted to provide a floodway delineation. The applicant will be
responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient
technical information to make such determination.
   1.   No use shall be permitted in the floodway that would result in any
increase in the 100-year flood level. Consideration of the effects of any
development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption that an equal
degree of development would be allowed for similarly situated lands.
   2.   All uses within the floodway shall:
      A.   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
      B.   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
      C.   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
   3.   No use shall affect the capacity or conveyance of the channel or
floodway of any tributary to the main stream, drainage ditch or any other
drainage facility or system.

shall meet the applicable general flood plain standards and shall be
constructed or aligned to present the minimum possible resistance to flood
flows.
   5.   Buildings, if permitted, shall have a low flood damage potential and
shall not be for human habitation.
   6.   Storage of equipment or materials that are buoyant, flammable,
explosive, or injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited. Storage
of other material may be allowed if readily removable from the floodway within
the time available after flood warning.
   7.   Watercourse alterations or relocations (channel changes and
modifications) must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within
the altered or relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations
must be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
   8.   Any fill allowed in the floodway must be shown to have some beneficial
purpose and shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary.
   9.   Pipeline river or stream crossings shall be buried in the streambed and
banks or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due to channel
degradation and meandering or due to the action of flood flows.
165.10   SPECIAL SHALLOW FLOODING AREAS STANDARDS.
   In addition to the general flood plain standards, uses within shallow
flooding areas must meet the following applicable standards.
   1.   In shallow flooding areas designated as an AO Zone on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), the minimum flood proofing/flood protection
elevation shall be equal to the number of feet as specified on the FIRM (or a
minimum of 2.0 feet if no number is specified) above the highest natural grade
adjacent to the structure.
   2.   In shallow flooding areas designated as an AH Zone on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map, the minimum flood proofing/flood protection elevation shall
be equal to the elevation as specified on the FIRM.
165.11   ADMINISTRATION.

operations) including the placement of factory-built homes.
165.13   APPLICATION FOR PERMIT.
   Application for a flood plain development permit shall be made on forms
supplied by the Administrator and shall include the following information:
   1.   Work To Be Done. Description of the work to be covered by the permit
for which application is to be made.
   2.   Location. Description of the land on which the proposed work is to be
done (i.e., lot, block, tract, street address or similar description) that will
readily identify and locate the work to be done.
   3.   Use or Occupancy. Indication of the use or occupancy for which the
proposed work is intended.
   4.   Flood Elevation. Elevation of the 100-year flood.
   5.   Floor Elevation. Elevation (in relation to North American Vertical
Datum) of the lowest floor (including basement) of buildings or of the level to
which a building is to be flood proofed.
   6.   Cost of Improvement. For buildings being improved or rebuilt, the

necessary (e.g., drawings or a site plan) for the purpose of this chapter.
165.14   ACTION ON APPLICATION.
   The Administrator shall, within a reasonable time, make a determination as
to whether the proposed flood plain development meets the applicable standards
of this chapter and shall approve or disapprove the application. For
disapprovals, the applicant shall be informed, in writing, of the specific
reasons therefor. The Administrator shall not issue permits for variances
except as directed by the Council.
165.15   CONSTRUCTION AND USE TO BE AS PROVIDED IN APPLICATION AND PLANS.
   Flood plain development permits, issued on the basis of approved plans and
applications, authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth
in such approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement or
construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. The applicant shall be
required to submit certification by a professional engineer or land surveyor,
as appropriate, registered in the State, that the finished fill, building floor
elevations, flood proofing, or other flood protection measures were
accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to the
use or occupancy of any structure.
165.16   VARIANCES.
   The Council may authorize upon request in specific cases such variances from
the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the public interest,
where owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of
this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances granted must meet
the following applicable standards:
   1.   Cause. Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
   2.   Prohibited. Variances shall not be issued within any designated
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the 100-year flood would
result. Consideration of the effects of any development on flood levels shall
be based upon the assumption that an equal degree of development would be
allowed for similarly situated lands.
   3.   Required To Afford Relief. Variances shall only be granted upon a
determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood
hazard, to afford relief.
   4.   Notice to Applicant. In cases where the variance involves a lower level
of flood protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this
chapter, the applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the
Administrator that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00
of insurance coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and
property.
   5.   Approval. All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval
of the Department of Natural Resources.
165.17   FACTORS UPON WHICH THE DECISION TO GRANT VARIANCES SHALL BE BASED.
   In passing upon applications for variances, the Council shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
   1.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
   2.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or downstream
to the injury of others.
   3.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
   4.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
   5.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
City.
   6.   The requirements of the facility for a flood plain location.
   7.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for
the proposed use.
   8.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
   9.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
flood plain management program for the area.
   10.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
   11.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwater expected at the site.
   12.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
   13.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this chapter.
165.18   CONDITIONS ATTACHED TO VARIANCES.
   Upon consideration of the factors listed in Section
165.17, the Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as
it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such conditions may
include, but not necessarily be limited to:
   1.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
   2.   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
   3.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
   4.   Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes, levees,
and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the Department of
Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative to achieving
the purposes of this chapter.
   5.   Flood proofing measures.
165.19   NONCONFORMING USES.
   1.   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful
before the passage or amendment of this chapter, but which is not in conformity
with the provisions of this chapter, may be continued subject to the following
conditions:
      A.   If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any future
use of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
      B.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
   2.   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless
it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
State or local health, sanitary, building or safety codes or regulations or the
cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
designation.
165.20   AMENDMENTS.
   The regulations and standards set forth in this chapter may from time to
time be amended, supplemented, changed, or repealed. No amendment, supplement,
change, or modification shall be undertaken without prior approval from the
Department of Natural Resources.
165.21   PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
   Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any
of the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with grants of conditional uses or variances) shall
constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to
comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not
more than $750.00 or each repeat offense not to exceed $1,000.00. Each day such
violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein
contained prevents the City from taking such other lawful action as is
necessary to prevent or remedy violation. The requirements of this chapter may
be enforced under the procedures applicable to municipal infractions as set
forth in
Chapter 4 of this Code of Ordinances.

regulate and limit the height and bulk of buildings hereafter erected or
altered, to regulate and limit the intensity of the use of lot areas and to
regulate and determine the area of yards, courts, and other open spaces within

   As shown by the official zoning map, the City is divided into 11 classes of
districts. The boundaries of these districts are hereby established as shown on
the official zoning map of the City, and said map and all notations, references
and other information shown thereon shall be and are hereby made a part of this
chapter by reference. The official zoning map, signed by the Mayor and properly
attested by signature of the Clerk and date of adoption, shall be and remain on
file in the office of the City Clerk.
170.06   AMENDING OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   Amendments, supplements or changes of the boundaries of districts as shown
on the official zoning map shall be made by an ordinance amending the Zoning
Ordinance. The amending ordinance shall refer to the official zoning map and
shall set out the identification of the area affected by legal description and
identify the zoning district as the same exists and the new district
designation applicable to said property. Said ordinance shall, after adoption
and publication, be recorded by the City Clerk as other ordinances and a
certified copy thereof shall be attached to the official zoning map. Such
amendatory ordinance shall, however, not repeal or re-enact said map, but only
amend it. The official zoning map, together with amending ordinances, shall be
the final authority as to the current zoning status of land and water areas,
buildings and other structures in the City. (See EDITOR’S NOTE following
Section
170.09 relative to amendments to the official zoning map.)
170.07   REPLACING OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   In the event that the official zoning map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost
or difficult to interpret because of use, the City Council may by resolution
adopt a new official zoning map which shall supersede the prior map. The new
official zoning map may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the
prior map, but no such correction shall have the effect of amending the
original Zoning Ordinance or any subsequent amendment thereof. The new official
zoning map shall be identified by date and the signature of the Mayor attested
by the City Clerk, under the following words: “This is to certify that this
Official Zoning map supersedes and replaces the Official Zoning map adopted
(date of adoption of map being replaced) as part of the zoning ordinance of the
City.”
170.08   BOUNDARIES IN DOUBT.
   Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various
districts as shown on the map accompanying and made a part of this Zoning
Ordinance, the following rules apply:
   1.   The district boundaries are either street lines or alley lines
otherwise shown; and where the districts, designated on the map accompanying
and made a part of this Zoning Ordinance, are bounded approximately by street
lines or alley lines, the street lines or alley lines shall be construed to be
the boundary of the district.
   2.   In unsubdivided property, the district boundary lines on the map
accompanying and made a part of this Zoning Ordinance shall be determined by
the use of the scale appearing on the map.
170.09   FUTURE ANNEXATION OF TERRITORY.
   All territory which may hereafter be annexed to the City of Evansdale shall
automatically be classed as lying in the U-1 Unclassified District until such
classification shall have been changed by an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance,
as provided by law.
EDITOR’S NOTE
The following ordinances have been adopted amending the official zoning map
described in Section
170.06 and have not been included as a part of this Zoning Ordinance but
have been specifically saved from repeal and are in full force and effect.

170.10   GENERAL REGULATIONS.
   1.   Conformance Required. Except as hereinafter specified, no building or
structure shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, or structurally
altered, nor shall any building or land be used which does not comply with all
of the district regulations established by this Zoning Ordinance for the
district in which the building or land is located.
   2.   Continuing Existing Uses. The use of a building existing at the time of
the enactment of this Zoning Ordinance may be continued even though such use
may not conform with the regulations of this Ordinance for the district in
which it is located. Any use in existence at the adoption hereof which was not
an authorized nonconforming use under previous zoning ordinances shall not be
authorized to continue as a nonconforming use pursuant to this Zoning Ordinance
or amendments thereto.
   3.   Nonconforming Uses or Buildings in Any R or U District. No existing
building or premises devoted to a use not permitted by this Zoning Ordinance in
the district in which such building or premises is located, except when
required by law, shall be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, substituted, or
structurally altered unless the use thereof is changed to a use permitted in
the district in which such building or premises is located, except as follows:
      A.   Substitution. If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming
use of a building may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or of
a more restricted classification. Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed
to a more restricted use or to conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be
changed to a less restricted use.
      B.   Discontinuance. In the event that a nonconforming use of any
building or premises is discontinued for a period of one year, the use of the
same shall conform thereafter to the uses permitted in the district in which it
is located.
      C.   Replacing Damaged Buildings. Any nonconforming building or structure
damaged more than 60 percent of its replacement value exclusive of the
foundations at the time of damage by fire, flood, explosion, war, riot, or act
of God, shall not be restored or reconstructed and used as before such
happening; but if less than 60 percent damaged above the foundation, it may be
restored, reconstructed, or used as before, provided that it is initiated
within six months of such happening, and is built of like or similar materials.
   4.   Nonconforming Uses or Buildings in any District Other than an R or U
District.
      A.   Structural Alterations and Enlargements. Any building in districts
other than an R or U District devoted to a use made nonconforming by this
chapter may be structurally altered or enlarged in conformity with the lot
area, the lot frontage, yard and height requirements of the district in which
situated, provided such construction shall be limited to buildings on land
owned of record by the owner of the land devoted to the nonconforming use prior
to the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance. In the event of such structural
alteration or enlargement of buildings, the premises involved may not be used
for any nonconforming use other than the use existing on the effective date of
this Zoning Ordinance, other provisions of this Ordinance notwithstanding.
      B.   Discontinuance. In the event that a nonconforming use of any
building or premises is discontinued for a period of one year, the use of the
same shall conform thereafter to the uses permitted in the district in which it
is located.
      C.   Replacing Damaged Buildings. Any nonconforming building or structure
damaged more than 60 percent of its replacement value exclusive of the
foundations at the time of damage by fire, flood, explosion, war, riot, or act
of God; shall not be restored or reconstructed and used as before such
happening, but if less than 60 percent damaged above the foundation, it may be
restored, reconstructed, or used as before, provided that it is started within
six months of such happening, and is built of like or similar materials.
   5.   Street Frontage Required. Except as permitted in Section
170.25 of this chapter, no lot shall contain any building used in whole or in
part for residence purposes unless such lot abuts for at least 40 feet on at
least one street, or unless it has an exclusive unobstructed private easement
of access or right-of-way of at least 20 feet wide to a street, and there shall
be not more than one single-family dwelling for such frontage or easement,
except that a common easement of access at least 50 feet wide may be provided
for two or more such single-family dwellings or for one or more two-family or
multiple dwellings.
   6.   Accessory Buildings. No accessory building shall be erected in any
required court or front yard. Accessory buildings shall be distant at least
five feet from alley lines and at least five feet from lot lines of adjoining
lots which are in any R District, except that accessory buildings constructed
in the rear 60 percent of the lot may be erected three feet from interior lot
lines, and on a corner lot they shall conform to the setback regulations on the
side street. Accessory buildings, except stables, may be erected as a part of
the principal building, or if at least six feet therefrom may be connected
thereto by a breezeway or similar structure, provided all yard requirements for
a principal building are complied with. An accessory building which is not a
part of the main building shall not occupy more than 30 percent of the rear
yard and shall not exceed 15 feet in height; however, this regulation shall not
be interpreted to prohibit the construction of a 440 square foot garage on a
minimum rear yard. A freestanding or attached portable shelter consisting of a
fabric covering stretched over poles used as a carport or similar structure
shall be prohibited in conjunction with any residential use.
   7.   Corner Lots. For corner lots platted after the effective date of this
Zoning Ordinance, the street side yard shall be equal in width to the setback
regulation of the lots to the rear having frontage on the intersecting street.
See Figure 1.
      A.   On corner lots platted and of record at the time of the effective
date of this Ordinance, the side yard regulation shall apply to the longer
street side of the lot except in the case of reverse frontage where the corner
lot faces an intersecting street. In this case, there shall be a side yard on
the longer street side of the corner lot of not less than 50 percent of the
setback required on the lots to the rear of such corner lot, and no accessory
building on said corner lot shall project beyond the setback line of the lots
in the rear; provided further, this regulation shall not be so interpreted as
to reduce the buildable width of the corner lot facing an intersecting street,
and of record or as shown by existing contract of purchase at the time of the
effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, to less than 28 feet or to prohibit
the erection of an accessory building. See Figure 2.
      B.   On corner lots, frontage may be considered on either street provided
that if front and rear yards are parallel to the lot line having the longer
dimension, then setbacks along both streets shall conform to the front yard
requirement of the district in which it is located.
   8.   Front Yard. In any R District there shall be a minimum front yard
required as stated in the yard requirements for that particular district;
provided, however, where lots comprising 30 percent or more of the frontage
within 200 feet of either side lot line are developed with buildings at a
greater setback, the front yard setback shall be the average of these building
setbacks and the minimum setbacks required for the undeveloped lots. In
computing the average setback, buildings located on reversed corner lots or
entirely on the rear half of lots shall not be counted. The required setback as
computed herein need not exceed 50 feet in any case. See Figure 3.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2221.png]
   9.   Required Yard Cannot Be Reduced. No lot shall be reduced in area so as
to make any yard of any other open space less than the minimum required by the
Zoning Ordinance. No part of a yard or other open space provided about any
building or structure for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this
Zoning Ordinance shall be included as part of a yard or other open space
required under this Zoning Ordinance for another building or structure. Off-
street parking and loading areas may occupy all or part of any required yard or
open space except as otherwise specified in this Ordinance.
   10.   Building Lines on Approved Plats. Whenever the plat of a land
subdivision on record in the office of the County Recorder shows a setback
building line along any frontage for the purpose of creating a front yard or
side street yard line, the building line thus shown shall apply along such
frontage in place of any other yard line required in this Ordinance unless
specific yard requirements in this Ordinance require a greater setback.
   11.   Pending Applications for Building Permits. Nothing herein contained
shall require any change in the overall layout, plans, construction, size, or
designated use of any building, or part thereof, for which approvals and
required building permits have been granted before the enactment of this Zoning
Ordinance, the construction of which conformably with such plans shall have
been started prior to the effective date of this Ordinance and completion
thereof carried on in a normal manner and not discontinued for reasons other
than those beyond the builder’s control.

principal permitted use, provided that the adult use complies with the minimum
separation requirements, as specified in these subparagraphs.
         (2)   An adult use shall be located at least 600 feet from any other
adult use measured in a straight line from the closest points of the property
lines in which the adult uses are located.
         (3)   An adult use shall be located at least 600 feet from any
residentially zoned property measured in a straight line from the closest point
of the property line in which the adult use is located to the closest
residentially zoned property line.
         (4)   An adult use shall be located at least 600 feet from any
protected use as defined herein, which distance shall be measured in a straight
line from the closest point of the property line in which the adult use is
located to the closest point of the property line in which is located an
aforementioned protected use. If a protected use is a legal nonconforming use,
this provision shall not apply.
         (5)   The minimum separation requirements may be varied by the Board
of Adjustments if the person applying for the variance files an application for
a variance with the Building Official. Included with said application shall be
a consent petition which indicates approval of the proposed adult use signed by
90 percent of the property owners within 600 radial feet of the lot on which
the use would be located. The Board of Adjustment, in considering such a
variance, shall make the following findings: (i) that the proposed use will not
be contrary to the public interest or injurious to nearby properties, and that
the spirit and intent of the ordinance will be observed; (ii) that the
establishment of an additional use of this type in the area will not be
contrary to the program of neighborhood conservation or improvement, either
residential or nonresidential; and (iii) that all applicable regulations of
this chapter will be observed.
      C.   Termination of Nonconforming Adult Uses. Any such adult use that, at
the time of the adoption of the Zoning Ordinance, becomes nonconforming because
it does not meet the minimum separation requirements between it and any other
such establishment, or between it and any residential zoning district shall
terminate all uses herein defined no later than one year after the date of the
adoption of the Zoning Ordinance. However, if in the opinion of the owner of
the business involved in such use, the termination would create an undue
hardship, the owner may appeal to the Board of Adjustment for an extension of
time for the termination. It shall be the responsibility of the owner to show
just cause for a time extension based upon evidence submitted by the owner
which demonstrates by the greater weight of evidence that one year was not an
adequate length of time to amortize the owner’s investment in such
establishment. The Board shall determine whether such a time extension shall be
granted and how long such extension shall be, based upon the evidence
presented. However, no establishment shall be granted more than one time
extension and no such extension shall be for longer than the minimum time
determined necessary by the Board for the owner to amortize the investment
which existed at the time of the adoption of the Zoning Ordinance. Any
investments in said nonconforming establishment subsequent to the adoption of
the Zoning Ordinance shall not be included for such amortization value
purposes. Such nonconforming establishment shall not increase, enlarge, expand,
extend or alter such land area, building, or structure involved in such
establishment except by changing the use to another use which is permitted in
that zoning district by the terms of the Zoning Ordinance. If the owner of the
nonconforming establishment desires to increase, enlarge, expand, extend or
alter such land area, building or structure involved in such establishment, the
owner shall be required to apply for a special permit under the provisions of
the Zoning Ordinance. In determining whether an adult use is nonconforming,
especially in relation to another adult use, the Board shall take into account
the length of time that said adult use has been operating at its present
location and shall consider the oldest adult use as a conforming use.
      D.   Violation and Penalty. Any person who violates, disobeys, omits,
neglects or refuses to comply with, or who resists the enforcement of any of
the provisions of this subsection shall be guilty of a simple misdemeanor, and
upon conviction, shall be fined not more than $100.00 for the first offense,
$250.00 for the second offense, and $500.00 for the third and subsequent
offenses.
         (1)   Any violation of the provisions of this subsection may also be
considered a municipal infraction. If a municipal infraction citation is
served, the procedures for enforcement of that civil offense shall be governed
by
Chapter 4 of this Code of Ordinances.
         (2)   Each day that a violation is permitted to exist shall constitute
a separate offense.
         (3)   In case any building or structure is erected, constructed,
reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted, or maintained, or any building,
structure or land is used in violation of this Zoning Ordinance, the City
Council, in addition to other remedies, may institute any proper action or
proceedings, including an action to enjoin such unlawful erection,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance, or
use, in the name of the City, to restrain, correct or abate such violations, to
prevent the occupancy of said building, structure or land, or to prevent any
illegal act, conduct, business or use in or about said premises.

any adverse effects upon adjacent properties.
   1.   Procedure. The owner or owners of any tract of land comprising an area
of not less than 10 acres may submit to the City Council a plan for the use and
development of the entire tract of land. Said development plan shall be
referred to the Planning Commission for study and for report after public
hearing. The Planning Commission shall review the conformity of the proposed
development with the standards of the Comprehensive Plan, and with recognized
principles of civic design, land use planning, and landscape architecture. The
Commission may approve the plan as submitted, or before approval may require
that the applicant modify, alter, adjust, or amend the plan as the Commission
deems necessary to the end that it preserves the intent and purpose of this
chapter to promote public health, safety, morals, and general welfare. The
development plan as approved by the Commission shall then be reported to the
City Council, whereupon the City Council may, after notice and public hearing,
approve or disapprove said plan as reported or may require such changes thereto
as it deems necessary to effectuate the intent and purpose of this Zoning
Ordinance.
   2.   Standards. The land usage, minimum lot area, yard, height, and

which the development is located shall not apply except that minimum yards
specified in the district shall be provided around the boundaries of the area
being developed.
      B.   Uses along the project boundary lines shall not be in conflict with
those allowed in adjoining or opposite property. To this end, the Commission
may require, in the absence of an appropriate physical barrier, that uses of
least intensity or a buffer of open space or screening be arranged along the
borders of the project.
      C.   A plat of the development shall be recorded regardless of whether a
subdivision is proposed, showing building lines, building locations, common
land, streets, easements, and other applicable items required by the
Subdivision Ordinance.
      D.   No building permits shall be issued until the final plat of the
development is approved and recorded.
   3.   Deed Restrictions. In its review of the plan, the Commission or Council
may consider any deed restriction or covenants entered into or contracted for
by the developer concerning the use of common land or permanent open space.
Common land as herein contained shall refer to land dedicated to the public use
and to land retained in private ownership but intended for the use of the
residents of the development unit or the general public.
   4.   Changes from Original Use. Any subsequent change in the initial
permitted use or uses shall be approved by the City Council upon the
recommendation of the City Planning Commission prior to the issuance of an
occupancy permit.
   5.   Changes and Modifications. No change or modification of the plat of any
such Planned District as to land use, density, and street location or size
shall be permitted except by the procedure providing for amendments to this

      A.   The Board of Adjustment may in appropriate cases and subject to
appropriate conditions and safeguards make special exceptions to the terms of
the ordinances in harmony with its general purpose and intent. Any property
owner aggrieved by the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance or any regulations
or restrictions thereunder may petition the said Board of Adjustment direct to
modify said regulations and restrictions as applied to such property owner and
the following rules shall apply:
         (1)   The Board of Adjustment shall have a public hearing on said
petition under the same terms and conditions as hereinafter provided for the
hearing of the appeals by the Board of Adjustment.
         (2)   The Board of Adjustment, in making any exception to the Zoning
Ordinance, shall be guided by the general rule that the exceptions shall by
their design, construction, and operation adequately safeguard the health,
safety, and welfare of the occupants of adjoining and surrounding property,
shall not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property,
shall not increase congestion in the public streets, shall not increase public
danger of fire and safety and shall not diminish or impair established property
values in surrounding areas.
         (3)   The Board of Adjustment is specifically authorized to permit
erection and use of a building or the use of premises or vary the height and
area regulations in any location for a public service corporation for public
utility purposes or for purposes of public communication, including the
distribution of newspapers, which the Board determines reasonably necessary for
public convenience or welfare.
         (4)   The Board of Adjustment is specifically authorized to permit the
extension of a district where the boundary line of a district divides a lot in
a single ownership as shown of record or by existing contract or purchase at
the time of the passage of this Zoning Ordinance, but in no case shall
extension of the district boundary line exceed 40 feet in any direction.
      B.   The Board shall have the power to hear and decide appeals where it
is alleged there is an error in any order, requirements, decision, or
determination made by the Building Official in the enforcement of this Zoning
Ordinance.
      C.   The Board shall have the power to authorize upon appeal in specific
cases such variance from the terms of the Zoning Ordinance as will not be
contrary to the public interest, where owing to special conditions a literal
enforcement of the provisions of the Ordinance will result in unnecessary
hardship, and so that the spirit of the Ordinance shall be observed and
substantial justice done. Special conditions shall include but not be limited
to a property owner who can show that his or her property was acquired in good
faith and where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a
specific piece of property, or where by reason of exceptional topographical
conditions or other extraordinary or exceptional situations the strict
application of the terms of this Ordinance actually prohibits the use of such
property in a manner reasonably similar to that of other property in the
district. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the extension or
expansion of a nonconforming use located in an R or U District.
   4.   Appeals. Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person aggrieved or
by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the City affected by any
decision of the Building Official. Such appeal shall be taken within a
reasonable time as provided by the rules of the Board by filing with the
Building Official and with the Board of Adjustment a notice of appeal
specifying the grounds thereof. The Building Official shall forthwith transmit
to the Board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action
appealed from is taken, and shall further transmit a copy of the notice of
appeal and the record to the Planning and Zoning Commission. Upon receipt of
the notice of appeal, the Board shall hold a public hearing on said appeal and
shall publish notice of said hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in
the City. Said notice shall specify the time, place, and purpose of said public
hearing and said public hearing shall not be less than two days or more than 10
days after the publication of said notice. The Board shall also give prompt
notice of such hearing to the Building Inspector and the Planning and Zoning
Commission. The final disposition of any appeal after public hearing shall be
in the form of a resolution by the Board and copy of such resolution shall be
filed with the Building Inspector, the Planning and Zoning Commission, and the
City Clerk. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the Building Official certifies to the Board, after
notice of appeal shall have been filed with said official, that by reason of
the facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in the official’s opinion,
cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case proceedings shall not be
stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Board
or by a court of record on application, on notice to the Building Official, and
on due cause shown. The Board of Adjustment shall give a reasonable time for
the hearing on the appeal, give public notice thereof and decide the same
within a reasonable time. At the hearing any party may appear in person or by
agent, or by attorney. Before an appeal is filed with the Board of Adjustment,
the appellant shall pay to the City Treasurer, to be credited to the General
Fund of the City, the cost of publishing said notice and the administrative
cost of said appeal as determined by the Board. In exercising the above-
mentioned powers, the Board may, in conformity with the provisions of law,
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination as it believes proper, and to that end shall have
all the powers of the Building Official. The concurring vote of three of the
members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement,
decision, or determination of the Building Official, or to decide in favor of
the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this
Ordinance; provided, however, the action of the Board shall not become
effective until after the resolution of the Board, setting forth the full
reason for its decision and the vote of each member participating therein, has
been spread upon the minutes. Such resolution, immediately following the
Board’s final decision, shall be filed in the office of the City Clerk, and
shall be open to public inspection.
   5.   Review by Council. The Council may provide for its review of variances
granted by the Board of Adjustment before their effective date. The Council may
remand a decision to grant a variance to the Board of Adjustment for further
study. The effective date of the variance is delayed for 30 days from the date
of the remand.
170.27   OCCUPANCY PERMITS.
   Certificates for occupancy and compliance shall be applied for
coincidentally with the application for a building permit for the construction,
expansion, or renovation of any structure and shall be issued within 10 days
after the lawful erection or alteration of the building is completed. A record
of all certificates shall be kept on file in the office of the Building
Official, and copies shall be furnished on request to any person having a
proprietary or tenancy interest in the building affected. No permit for
excavation for, or the erection or alteration of, any building shall be issued
before the application has been made for certificate of occupancy and
compliance; and no building or premises shall be occupied until that
certificate and permit are issued. A certificate of occupancy shall be
maintained by the Building Official for all nonconforming uses and shall verify
that such nonconforming use was not established in violation of Section
170.10 or amendments thereto. Nothing in this section shall prevent the
continuance of a nonconforming use as hereinbefore authorized, unless a
discontinuance is necessary for the safety of life or property. This section
shall not be construed to allow the occupancy or use of land or structures in a
manner which does not comply with the terms of the Zoning Ordinance. In the
event that an illegal use is established under circumstances not requiring a
building permit, the Building Official is empowered to take action as provided
in Section
170.30.
170.28   PLATS.
   Each application for a building permit shall be accompanied by a plat in
duplicate, drawn to scale, showing the actual dimensions of the lot to be built
upon, the size, shape, and location of the building to be erected, and such
other information as may be necessary to provide for the enforcement of this
chapter. A record of application and plats shall be kept in the office of the
Building Official.
170.29   AMENDMENTS.
   The City Council may from time to time on its own action or on petition,
after public notice and hearings as provided by law and after report by the
Zoning Commission, amend, supplement, or change the boundaries or regulations
herein or subsequently established; and such amendment shall not become
effective except by the favorable vote of a majority of all the members of the
City Council.
   1.   Prior to, and in addition to, the above requirements, whenever any
person, firm, or corporation desires that any amendment or changes be made in
this Zoning Ordinance as to any property in the City, there shall be presented
to the Commission a petition requesting such change or amendment and clearly
describing the property and its boundaries as to which change or amendment is
desired duly signed by the owners of 50 percent of the area of all real estate
included within the boundaries of said tract as described in said petition. A
plat shall be submitted showing the name and address of the owners of record as
found in the County Assessor’s record of all property lying within 250 feet of
the boundaries of the proposed property to be rezoned. If the petition is
requesting a P-D Planned Development District, it shall also have attached to
it such proposed plan.
   2.   Before any action shall be taken as provided in this section, the party
or parties proposing or recommending a change in the district regulations or
district boundaries shall deposit with the City Clerk the sum of $75.00 to
cover the costs of this procedure and under no condition shall said sum or any
part thereof be refunded for failure of said amendment to be enacted into law.
   3.   The Zoning Commission shall, upon receipt of said petition and plat,
notify through publication of legal notice and if deemed necessary by direct
mail, all parties concerned as shown on said plat of a hearing to be held by
said Commission. The notice of hearing shall be printed and mailed at least 15
days prior to the hearing and shall contain a description of the proposed
property to be rezoned and the present and proposed zoning classification. The
Zoning Commission may, upon the unanimous approval of members present at a
regular meeting, suspend the above hearing requirement and initiate the
rezoning request.
   4.   In case the proposed amendment, supplement, or change be disapproved by
the Zoning Commission, or a protest be presented duly signed by the owners of
20 percent or more either of the area of the lots included in such proposed
change, or of those immediately adjacent in the rear thereof, extending the
depth of one lot or not to exceed 200 feet therefrom, or of those directly
opposite thereto, extending the depth of one lot or not to exceed 200 feet from
the street frontage of such opposite lots, such amendment shall not become
effective except by the favorable vote of at least three-fourths of all the
members of the Council. Whenever any petition for an amendment, supplement, or
change of the zoning or regulations herein contained or subsequently
established shall have been denied by the City Council, then no new petition
covering the same property and additional property shall be filed with or
considered by the City Council until six months shall have elapsed from the
date of the filing of the first petition.
   5.   The zoning district classification of each lot, tract, or parcel of
land hereafter rezoned to a less restrictive classification as herein provided
shall after a period of two years be considered by action of the Zoning
Commission or the City Council for re-zoning to the zoning district
classification as established at the date of passage of this Zoning Ordinance
unless an application for an occupancy permit and building permit has been
approved and construction has commenced and is being done in an orderly and
progressive manner without undue delay indicating good faith to complete such
construction. Notice to property owners and public hearing would be required
prior to passage of said ordinance to rezone.
   6.   Publication of the legal description of the property or properties
zoned or rezoned shall constitute an official amendment to the official zoning
map; and as such, said map or portion of said map need not be published.
      A.   Changes; Protest. The regulations, restrictions, and boundaries may
from time to time, be amended, supplemented, changed, modified or repealed,
changing land from one zoning district to another zoning district, or by
adoption of an ordinance approving a site development plan, the Council may
impose conditions on a property owner which are in addition to existing
regulations if the additional conditions have been agreed to in writing by the
property owner before the public hearing required under this section or any
adjournment of the hearing. The conditions must be reasonable and imposed to
satisfy public needs which are directly caused by the requested change.
      B.   Change; Requirement for Sign for Zoning Change. The Zoning
Commission shall, upon receipt of said petition and plat, notify, through
publication of legal notice and by direct mail, all parties concerned as shown
on said plat of a hearing to be held by said Commission. The notice of hearing
shall be printed and mailed at least 15 days prior to the hearing and shall
contain a description of the proposed property to be rezoned and the present
and proposed zoning classification. In addition, a sign of 16 square feet,
using letters at minimum of three inches shall be erected on the site of the
planned zoning change in a clearly readable location, and it shall state:
NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING
EVANSDALE CITY HALL
(DATE) AT 7:00 P.M.
PROPOSED ZONING CHANGE
FROM (CURRENT) TO (PROPOSED)
The sign shall be erected at least 15 days prior to the public hearing. The
Zoning Commission may upon the unanimous approval of members present at a
regular meeting, suspend the above hearing requirement and initiate the
rezoning request.
170.30   VIOLATION, PENALTIES, AND ENFORCEMENT.
   1.   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to
comply with or who resists the enforcement of any of the provisions of this
Zoning Ordinance shall, upon conviction, be fined not more than $100.00 for the
first offense, $250.00 for the second offense, and $500.00 for the third and
subsequent offenses.  Each day that a violation is permitted to exist
constitutes a separate offense. The Building Official is hereby designated and
ordered to enforce this Zoning Ordinance.
   2.   Enforcement. In case any building or structure is erected, constructed,
reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted, or maintained, or any building,
structure, or land is used in violation of this Zoning Ordinance, the Building
Official, in addition to other remedies, shall institute any proper action or
proceedings in the name of the City to prevent such unlawful erection,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance, or
use; to restrain, correct, or abate such violation, to prevent the occupancy of
said building, structure or land, or to prevent any illegal act, conduct,
business, or use in or about said premises.
170.31   VALIDITY.
   Should any section or provision of this Zoning Ordinance be declared by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, that decision shall not affect
the validity of the Ordinance as a whole or any part thereof, other than the
part so declared to be invalid.

175.01   DEFINITIONS.
   For use in this chapter, the following terms are defined:
   1.   “Building line” means a line on a plat between which line and the
nearest street or alley no building or structure may be erected or placed.
   2.   “Lot” means a portion of a subdivision individually numbered or
designated on the plat for facility of description, conveyance, and taxation.
   3.   “Major street” means any thoroughfare, boulevard, parkway, or highway
designated by the Council to be used by persons and vehicles for through
traffic in, by, or through the City.
   4.   “Minor street” means any street which has not been designated by the
Council as a major street.
   5.   “Plat” means a map, drawing, or chart on which the subdivider’s plan of
the subdivision is presented and which the subdivider submits for approval and
intends in final form to record.
   6.   “Street width” means that horizontal distance between property lines.
   7.   “Subdivision” means: (a) the division of any tract of land into three
or more lots, which division may or may not establish streets and alleys; or
(b) the redivision of land heretofore platted into lots; provided, however, the
sale or exchange of small parcels of land to or between adjoining property
owners is not considered as a subdivision.
175.02   PRELIMINARY PLAT; INFORMATION REQUIRED.
   In seeking to subdivide land into lots and/or to dedicate streets, alleys,
or other land for public use, the owner shall submit four copies of a
preliminary plat to the City Planning and Zoning Commission (the “Commission”).
The preliminary plat, plainly marked “preliminary plat,” shall be drawn to a
scale of not less than one inch to 100 feet and shall show:
   1.   The legal description of the property to be platted.
   2.   Contours with intervals of not more than two feet.
   3.   The location of such surface features as property lines, buildings,
railroads, utilities, tree masses, watercourses, and other existing features
affecting the development; the location and size of such subsurface features as
existing or nearest available public sanitary and storm sewers, water mains,
gas mains, culverts, and drain pipes; the location and size of the nearest
water main, gas main, and public sewers are to be indicated in a general way on
the plat.
   4.   The location and width of proposed and existing streets, alleys, and
lots included in the development. The names of the proposed streets and the
type of proposed surfacing. The plat shall also show how the streets and alleys
in the proposed developments shall connect with existing and proposed streets
and alleys in adjacent subdivisions or undeveloped property to produce the most
advantageous development of the entire neighboring areas.
   5.   The name and location of adjoining subdivisions.
   6.   The proposed location of building lines and easements, if any.
   7.   The title under which the proposed subdivision is to be recorded, with
the name and address of the owner.
   8.   The scale, date, north point, and name of surveyor or engineer.
   9.   The above requirements for the preliminary plat shall conform to the
minimum standards of design and development set forth in Section
175.07 of this chapter.
   10.   Any restrictions proposed to be included in the owner’s declaration of
plat shall accompany the preliminary plat. When the property proposed to be
platted is in the corporate limits of the City, neither the Commission nor the
Council shall require any building restrictions to be included in a plat that
are more restrictive than the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance of the City,
except for the building lines provided in Section
175.05 of this chapter.
   11.   When the plat or subdivision proposed for immediate development is a
part of an overall development of a larger area and in which streets and other
improvements are indicated, such future plat development shall appear on all
plat drawings in dotted lines; the smaller area to be developed immediately as
a plat shall be bounded by a heavy line. When any such extended future
development shall have been accepted by the Council, such plan may be changed
or altered only on the consent of the Council.
   12.   Any plat not containing all the information specified above shall not
be approved by the Commission.
175.03   PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF PRELIMINARY PLAT.
   1.   The Commission shall refer two copies of the preliminary plat to the
Clerk, who shall carefully examine the plat as to its compliance with the laws
and ordinances of the City, the existing street system, the major street plan,
and good engineering practices and shall submit findings in duplicate to the
Commission, together with one copy of the plat received.
   2.   When the Clerk’s report is received by the Commission, it shall then
set forth its recommendations in writing, whether of approval, modification, or
disapproval. In case of modification or disapproval, it shall give its reasons
therefor. The Commission shall forthwith submit the three copies of the
preliminary plat to the Council, together with a signed copy of its
recommendations.
   3.   The Council shall then take action upon the preliminary plat,
certifying its approval or disapproval. In case of disapproval, it shall give
its reasons therefor. Any requirements for improvements or alterations in the
preliminary plat of the Council shall be given to the person who prepared the
plat, in writing. One certified copy shall be filed with the Clerk, one with
the Commission, and the third shall be returned to the owner or subdivider. The
approval of the preliminary plat by the Council does not constitute acceptance
of the subdivision but constitutes approval of all proposals and plans
submitted with the preliminary plat.
175.04   CONSTRUCTION PLANS.
   1.   When the preliminary plat of a subdivision has been approved by the
Council, the owner shall thereupon prepare detailed construction plans for the
improvement and the arrangement for the improvements in accordance with the
standards set forth by the Clerk’s office.
   2.   Three sets of such detailed construction plans, together with an
outline of the order in which the proposed improvements are to be constructed,
are to be submitted to the Clerk for consideration.
   3.   The Clerk shall then submit the detailed construction plans, together
with recommendations to the Council for their approval. Construction of any
type shall not be started within the development until construction plans are
approved by the Council.
175.05   FINAL PLAT; INFORMATION REQUIRED.
   1.   Filing. The final plat shall be filed within 12 months of the date of
the approval of the preliminary plat and shall comply with the provisions of
Section
175.07 of this chapter and shall conform to the preliminary plat as approved or
modified by the Council.
   2.   Information Required. The final plat shall be made from an accurate
survey, drawn to 100 feet to the inch or larger scale by a licensed surveyor
and shall include the following information:
      A.   The boundaries of the property, the lines of all proposed streets
and alleys, with the widths and names and the lines and dimensions of any other
portions intended to be dedicated to the public use.
      B.   All lot lines and an identification system for all lots and blocks
with figures showing their dimensions.
      C.   Building lines and easements for any rights-of-way provided for
public use, services, or utilities, with figures showing their dimensions,
unless the subdivider desires to describe the easements for public use,
services, or utilities in the owner’s declaration of plat.
      D.   All dimensions, both linear and angular, necessary for locating
lots, tracts or parcels of ground, streets, alleys and easements, and the
boundaries of the subdivision; the linear dimensions are to be expressed in
feet and decimals of a foot.
      E.   Radii, arc and chords, points of tangency, central angles, and curve
date for all curvilinear streets, and radii for all rounded corners.
      F.   The description, location, and elevation of all benchmarks.
      G.   The description and location of all permanent monuments set in the
subdivision.
      H.   The name of the subdivision, location and extent of property
subdivided, points of the compass, scale of the plat, date and name of the
engineer platting the tract.
      I.   Certification under seal by a land surveyor, licensed under the laws
of the State, to the effect that the plat represents a survey made by said
surveyor, and that all necessary survey monuments are correctly shown thereon.
      J.   Where private restrictions appear on a separate instrument,
reference to such instrument shall be made on the plat.
   3.   Attachments. The final plat shall have the following attached to it:
      A.   An accurate description of the subdivision land.
      B.   A statement by the proprietors and their spouses, if any, that the
plat is prepared with their free consent and in accordance with their desire,
signed and acknowledged before an officer authorized to take the
acknowledgments of deeds. The statement by the proprietors may also include a
dedication to the public of all lands within the plat that are designated for
streets, alleys, parks, open areas, school property, or other public use, if
the dedication is approved by the Council.
      C.   A statement from the mortgage holders or lienholders, if any, that
the plat is prepared with their free consent and in accordance with their
desire, signed and acknowledged before an officer authorized to take the
acknowledgment of deeds. An affidavit and bond as provided for in Section
354.12 of the Code of Iowa may be recorded in lieu of the consent of the
mortgage or lienholder. When a mortgage or lienholder consents to the
subdivision, a release of mortgage or lien shall be recorded for any areas
conveyed to the City or dedicated to the public.
      D.   An opinion by an attorney-at-law who has examined the abstract of
title of the land being platted. The opinion shall state the names of the
proprietors and holders of mortgages, liens or other encumbrances on the land
being platted and shall note the encumbrances, along with any bonds securing
the encumbrances. Utility easements shall not be construed to be encumbrances
for the purpose of this section.
      E.   A certificate of the County Treasurer that the land is free from
certified taxes and certified special assessments or that the land is free from
certified taxes and that the certified special assessments are secured by bond
in compliance with Section 354.12 of the Code of Iowa.
      F.   A resolution and certificate for approval by the Council and for
signatures of the Mayor and Clerk.

subdivision plat.
      H.   A certificate of dedication of streets and other public property.
      I.   A statement of restrictions of all types that run with the land and
become covenants in the deeds of lots.
175.06   PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF FINAL PLAT.
   Four copies of the final plat of a subdivision shall be submitted to the
Commission. The final plat shall be accompanied by a certificate from the Clerk
that the same is substantially in accord with the preliminary plat as approved
by the Council. When the final plat has been passed upon by the Commission, all
four copies shall forthwith be transmitted to the Council, together with a
certificate showing the action of the Commission. When the final plat has been
approved by the Council, three copies shall be certified, and one copy shall be
delivered to the Commission, one copy delivered to the Clerk, and one copy
delivered to the subdivider for filing with the County Recorder. If such plat
is disapproved by the Council, such disapproval shall point out in writing
wherein the plat is objectionable.
175.07   MINIMUM DESIGN STANDARDS.
   1.   Acreage Subdivisions. Where a parcel of land is subdivided into a
larger tract than ordinarily used for buildings lots, such parcel shall be
divided so as to allow for the opening of major streets and the ultimate
extension of adjacent minor streets. Easements providing for the future
openings and extension of such streets may, at the discretion of the Council,
be made a requirement of the plat.
   2.   Relation to Adjoining Street System. New subdivisions shall make
provisions for the continuation of the principal existing streets in adjoining
additions (or their proper projection where adjoining. property is not
subdivided) insofar as they may be necessary for public requirements.
   3.   Street and Alley Widths.
      A.   Except as hereinafter provided, the street shall be of a width as
great as that of the streets of which they are a continuation or projection,
with a minimum width of 60 feet. However, the Council may in certain cases,
because of topography or general welfare and safety, or for special reasons,
require a street of greater or lesser width.
      B.   When a major street or primary roadway is included in any plat being
developed and offered for approval, the overall width of the surfaced or paved
roadway from back to back of curbs shall be a minimum of 31 feet or more;
unless such street is the continuation of another street of greater width, in
which case the surfaced roadway shall be carried on at the width deemed
reasonable and proper. Street surfacing of all abutting streets and widths
thereof shall be shown on the preliminary plat when submitted for approval.
      C.   When a minor street serves a dead end, a limited access area or
other projected low traffic count area, the street may, with the recommendation
of the Commission, have an overall width of the surfaced or paved roadway from
back to back of curbs of 29 feet. In a subdivision where the lots exceed one
acre in size, the street may be 25 feet curb to curb with no parking on the
right-of-way.
      D.   If a street is designed to have one end permanently closed (cul-de-
sac), the right-of-way shall be not less than 50 feet in width and shall be of
such width at the closed end as will permit a turning radius of not less than
50 feet.
      E.   The minimum width of alleys shall be 16 feet.
      F.   Where alleys are not provided in the plat, easements of not less
than eight feet in width may be required on each side of all rear and side lot
lines where necessary for poles, wires, conduits, sewers, gas, water, and heat
mains.
   4.   Blocks. Where it is desired to subdivide a parcel of land which,
because of its size and location, does not permit a normal street arrangement,
there may be established a “place.” Such “place” may be in the form of a court,
a non-connecting street, or other arrangement; provided, however, proper and
easy access arrangement shall be provided for all lots from a dedicated street
or court.
   5.   Street Names. Streets that are obviously in alignment with others
already existing and named shall bear the name of existing streets, otherwise
names shall not duplicate existing street names and names similar to existing
street names shall not be permitted.
   6.   Building Lines. Building lines shall be shown on all lots whenever the
depth of such building lines is greater than those required by the Zoning
Ordinance. Where the subdivided area is not under zoning control, the Council
may require building lines in accordance with the needs of such subdivision.
Provisions shall be made by owner’s declaration of plat, requiring all enclosed
parts of a building to be set back to such building lines.
   7.   Easements along Streams and Watercourses. Whenever any stream or
surface watercourse is located in an area that is being subdivided, the
subdivider shall, at the subdivider’s own expense, make adequate provisions for
the proper drainage of surface water, and the Council, at its discretion, may
require the dedication to the City of an easement along such stream or
watercourse.
   8.   Improvements. Before the final plat of any subdivision shall be
approved and recorded, the subdivider shall make and install the improvements
described in this subsection. In lieu of final completion of the said minimum
improvements, before the final plat is approved, the subdivider may enter into
a contract with the City to ensure the completion of the improvements within a
specified time. The performance of said contract may be secured by the filing
of a bond to be approved by the Council.
      A.   Street Grading.
         (1)   All streets shall be filled or excavated to the grade approved
by the Council after receiving the recommendation of the Street Department
Superintendent, and the actual construction shall be subject to the supervision
of the Street Superintendent.
         (2)   Streets shall be so arranged that grades shall, so far as
practicable, not exceed six percent for major streets and 10 percent for minor
streets, and no grade shall be less than one-half of one percent.
         (3)   All alleys included in any plat or subdivision shall be brought
to the grade approved by the Council; and when utilities are installed, they
shall be installed therein or at the rear of platted lots if equally feasible
with other methods of installation.
      B.   Sewers. Where a public sanitary sewer is contiguous to said
subdivision, the subdivider shall connect or provide for the connection with
said sewer accessible to each lot. Where any part of said subdivision is within
450 feet from the nearest point of a usable public sewer installation, the
Council may require the subdivision to connect or provide for the connection
with such sewer system to make such sewer accessible to each lot in the
subdivision. When sanitary sewers are installed in the subdivision in the
street, they shall be stubbed in from the main sewer to the property line. The
subdivider shall, upon completion of the sanitary sewer system, file in the
office of the Clerk a plat of said subdivision marked with the location of said
stubs or of any Y’s placed in the main sewer.
      C.   Inaccessible Sewers. Where public water supply is available to the
proposed subdivision but sanitary sewer is inaccessible, lots shall not be less
than 7,500 square feet in area. Where neither public water supply nor sanitary
sewer is accessible to the subdivision, lots shall not be less than 15,000
square feet in area. The above area requirements may be lowered upon
recommendation of the Code Enforcement Officer providing results from
percolation tests indicate that a lesser area will be required for tank
installation. The owner shall furnish to the Commission a report from the
health officer that the soil conditions of the subdivision are suitable for the
installation and maintenance of septic tanks and the proposed lot area is
sufficient for its operation.
      D.   Other Improvements. The Council may also require certain street
improvements including the installation of sidewalks, water mains, curb and
gutter, and street surfacing or paving on any or all streets, in accordance
with the specifications approved by the Council and under the supervision of
the Street Waste Water Foreman. When sewer and water are to be installed in a
plat, all street improvements shall be installed not later than two years
following the date of approval of the final plat. A performance bond running
for not more than two years shall be given a contract entered into by the
subdivider for the completion of the improvements.
175.08   PLATS SITUATED OUTSIDE CORPORATE LIMITS.
   1.   All plats of property situated outside the corporate limits of the City
which require action by the Commission and Council shall comply with all the
foregoing regulations.
   2.   Any lot described as or intended for use as a residential lot and which
is intended to be served either temporarily or permanently by a septic tank
sewage disposal system shall not be less than the area set forth in Section
175.07(8)(C) of this chapter.
175.09   AMENDMENT OR REVISION.
   Any regulations or provisions of this chapter may be changed and amended
from time to time by the Council; provided, however, such changes or amendments
shall not become effective until after a public hearing has been held, public
notice of which shall have been given in a newspaper of general circulation at
least 15 days prior to such hearing.
USE AND MAINTENANCE OF THE
CODE OF ORDINANCES
The following information is provided to assist in the use and proper
maintenance of this Code of Ordinances.
DISTRIBUTION OF COPIES
   1.   OFFICIAL COPY.
   The “OFFICIAL COPY” of the Code of Ordinances must be kept by the City Clerk
and should be identified as the “OFFICIAL COPY.”
   2.   DISTRIBUTION.
   Other copies of the Code of Ordinances should be made available to all
persons having a relatively frequent and continuing need to have access to
ordinances which are in effect in the City as well as reference centers such as
the City Library, County Law Library, and perhaps the schools.
   3.   SALE.
   The sale or distribution of copies in a general fashion is not recommended
as experience indicates that indiscriminate distribution tends to result in
outdated codes being used or misused.
   4.   RECORD OF DISTRIBUTION.
   The City Clerk should be responsible for maintaining an accurate and current
record of persons having a copy of the Code of Ordinances. Each official,
elected or appointed, should return to the City, upon leaving office, all
documents, records and other materials pertaining to the office, including this
Code of Ordinances.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 372.13[4])
NUMBERING OF ORDINANCES
AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
It is recommended that a simple numerical sequence be used in assigning
ordinance numbers to ordinances as they are passed. For example, if the
ordinance adopting the Code of Ordinances is No. 163, we would suggest that the
first ordinance passed changing, adding to, or deleting from the Code be
assigned the number 164, the next ordinance be assigned the number 165, and so
on. We advise against using the Code of Ordinances numbering system for the
numbering of ordinances.
RETENTION OF AMENDING ORDINANCES
Please note that two books should be maintained: (1) the Code of Ordinances.
and (2) an ordinance book. We will assist in the maintenance of the Code of
Ordinances book, per the Supplement Agreement, by revising and returning
appropriate pages for the Code of Ordinances book as required to accommodate
ordinances amending the Code. The City Clerk is responsible for maintaining the
ordinance book and must be sure that an original copy of each ordinance
adopted, bearing the signatures of the Mayor and Clerk, is inserted in the
ordinance book and preserved in a safe place.
SUPPLEMENT RECORD
A record of all supplements prepared for the Code of Ordinances is provided in
the front of the Code. This record will indicate the number and date of the
ordinances adopting the original Code and of each subsequently adopted
ordinance which has been incorporated in the Code. For each supplemented
ordinance, the Supplement Record will list the ordinance number, date, topic,
and chapter or section number of the Code affected by the amending ordinance. A
periodic review of the Supplement Record and ordinances passed will assure that
all ordinances amending the Code have been incorporated therein.
DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPLEMENTS
Supplements containing revised pages for insertion in each Code will be sent to
the Clerk. It is the responsibility of the Clerk to see that each person having
a Code of Ordinances receives each supplement so that each Code may be properly
updated to reflect action of the Council in amending the Code.
AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
The Code of Ordinances contains most of the laws of the City as of the date of
its adoption and is continually subject to amendment to reflect changing
policies of the Council, mandates of the State, or decisions of the Courts.
Amendments to the Code of Ordinances can only be accomplished by the adoption
of an ordinance.
