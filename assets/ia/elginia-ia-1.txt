the leaks and spills of hazardous substances, these regulations are promulgated
to establish responsibility for the treatment, removal, and cleanup of
hazardous substance spills within the City limits.
36.02   DEFINITIONS.
For purposes of this chapter the following terms are defined:
   1.   “Cleanup” means actions necessary to contain, collect, control,
identify, analyze, clean up, treat, disperse, remove, or dispose of a hazardous
substance.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[1])
   2.   “Hazardous condition” means any situation involving the actual,
imminent, or probable spillage, leakage, or release of a hazardous substance
onto the land, into a water of the State, or into the atmosphere which creates
an immediate or potential danger to the public health or safety or to the
environment.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[4])
   3.   “Hazardous substance” means any substance or mixture of substances that
presents a danger to the public health or safety and includes, but is not
limited to, a substance that is toxic, corrosive, or flammable, or that is an
irritant or that generates pressure through decomposition, heat, or other
means. “Hazardous substance” may include any hazardous waste identified or
listed by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection
Agency under the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended by the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, or any toxic pollutant listed under
Section 307 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as amended to January 1,
1977, or any hazardous substance designated under Section 311 of the Federal

operating under a lease, contract, or other agreement with the legal owner of
the hazardous substance.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[7])
36.03   CLEANUP REQUIRED.
Whenever a hazardous condition is created by the deposit, injection, dumping,
spilling, leaking, or placing of a hazardous substance, so that the hazardous
substance or a constituent of the hazardous substance may enter the environment
or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters, including ground
waters, the responsible person shall cause the condition to be remedied by a
cleanup, as defined in the preceding section, as rapidly as feasible to an
acceptable, safe condition. The costs of cleanup shall be borne by the
responsible person. If the responsible person does not cause the cleanup to
begin in a reasonable time in relation to the hazard and circumstances of the
incident, the City may, by an authorized officer, give reasonable notice, based
on the character of the hazardous condition, said notice setting a deadline for
accomplishing the cleanup and stating that the City will proceed to procure
cleanup services and bill the responsible person for all costs associated with
the cleanup if the cleanup is not accomplished within the deadline. In the
event that it is determined that immediate cleanup is necessary as a result of
the present danger to the public health, safety, and welfare, then no notice
shall be required and the City may proceed to procure the cleanup and bill the
responsible person for all costs associated with the cleanup. If the bill for
those services is not paid within 30 days, the City Attorney shall proceed to
obtain payment by all legal means. If the cost of the cleanup is beyond the
capacity of the City to finance it, the authorized officer shall report to the
Council and immediately seek any State or federal funds available for said
cleanup.

evacuate people from the area threatened by a hazardous condition caused by the
person.
   3.   The reasonable damages to the City for the injury to, destruction of,

condition caused by that person, including the costs of assessing the injury,
destruction, or loss.
   4.   The excessive and extraordinary cost incurred by the City or the agents
of the City in responding at and to the scene of a hazardous condition caused
by that person.

   1.   A person manufacturing, storing, handling, transporting, or disposing
of a hazardous substance shall notify the State Department of Natural Resources
and the County Sheriff of the occurrence of a hazardous condition as soon as
possible but not later than six hours after the onset of the hazardous
condition or discovery of the hazardous condition. The County Sheriff shall
immediately notify the Department of Natural Resources.
   2.   Any other person who discovers a hazardous condition shall notify the

46.02 Cigarettes and Tobacco
 
46.01   CURFEW.
The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote the
public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the City and specifically
to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults responsible for
minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors committed after
the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences and criminal
activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.

      A.   “Emergency errand” means, but is not limited to, an errand relating

of life.
      B.   “Knowingly” means knowledge that a responsible adult should
reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that
responsible adult’s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful
or careless adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult
responsibility through an objective test. It is therefore no defense that an
adult responsible for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or
conduct or whereabouts of the minor.
      C.   “Minor” means any unemancipated person under the age of 18 years.
      D.   “Nonsecured custody” means custody in an unlocked multipurpose area,

secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically
accompanied by a law enforcement officer or a person employed by the facility
where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to
providing nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate
juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the person’s
parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but
not for longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or
magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
      E.   “Public place” includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys, and sidewalks dedicated to public use and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises, whether publicly or privately owned,
that are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited
commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is
permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has
access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is
considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.
      F.   “Responsible adult” means a parent, guardian or other adult
specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have
custody or control of a minor.

the minor to violate any of the provisions of this section shall be subject to

ordered by the court.

applicable penalties.

identities and addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders,
notice by one publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area
where the vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of
notice under Subsection 2 of this section. The published notice may contain

abandoned motor vehicle, or any person being the owner of a motor vehicle whose
title certificate is faulty, lost, or destroyed, may dispose of such motor
vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without notification
procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more wheels or
other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable. The police
authority shall give the applicant a certificate of authority. The applicant

93.02 Definitions          93.05 Connection Charge
93.03 Construction by City 93.06 Rights of City
 
93.01   PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a means and method for the extension
of water mains to serve property not served by an existing water line so as to
preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort, and
convenience of the residents of the City.
93.02   DEFINITIONS.
For purposes of this chapter the following terms are defined:
   1.   “Builder” means the owner of land who causes a water main to be
installed under the provisions of this chapter. Such term includes the heirs,
successors or assigns of such owner.
   2.   “Estimated cost” means a cost estimate prepared by a registered
professional engineer or qualified contractor experienced in the installation
of water main pipe and appurtenances. All such estimates are subject to the
approval of the Council and in the event of any disagreement as to the amount
of estimated costs, the materials to be used or installation methods, the
determination of the Council shall be final and conclusive.
93.03   CONSTRUCTION BY CITY.  
An owner of land abutting or adjoining a property or a public street where no
water main has been installed may make application to the Council for the
installation of a water main along such property and in the street for the
purpose of serving the property in accordance with the following:
   1.   Application and Deposit. A written request for such installation, and a
sum equal to the total estimated cost of the installation from the point where
the water main is presently installed and terminates to the point where the
most distant boundary of the owner’s lot abuts an adjoining property or the
public street, shall be submitted to the Council.
   2.   Construction. Upon receipt of the deposit, the City shall construct the
water main for the purpose of serving the property of the applicant (builder),
as soon as such construction can reasonably be accomplished.
   3.   Additional Costs. In the event the actual cost to the City of
installation of the water main is in excess of the estimated cost, the builder
agrees to reimburse the City for the actual additional cost within 30 days
after the presentation of a bill for such additional cost.
   4.   Lien Authorized. In the event of the failure of the builder to
reimburse the City, as specified in Subsection 3 above, the total of the
additional cost shall be certified to the County Treasurer as a special
assessment lien against the builder’s real estate. In the written request for
installation of the water main, the landowner shall waive all objections to
jurisdiction and rights to notice and consent to the entry of such a special
assessment lien against the real estate.
   5.   Maximum Cost. The additional cost of installation, as contemplated in
Subsections 3 and 4 above, shall not exceed 110 percent of the estimated cost.
   6.   Connecting Property. The expense of connecting the property of the
builder to the water main shall be borne by the builder, in addition to the
cost of constructing said water main, but such connection shall be under the
supervision of the City.
93.04   CONSTRUCTION BY OWNER.
In the event an owner of land abutting or adjoining a property or public street
in which no water main has been previously installed desires to construct said
water main at the owner’s own expense, the owner may do so, after making proper
application to the City and receiving a permit to install such a water main, in
accordance with the following:
   1.   City Supervision. The installation of such a water main by a landowner
at the owner’s expense shall be under the strict supervision of the City and
shall, in all ways, conform to the requirements and specifications of the City.
   2.   Surety Bond. When making application to the City for a permit to
install such a water main, the applicant shall post with the City a surety
bond, in an amount to be set by the Council and made a matter of record in the
minutes of the Council, which shall be in an amount equal to but not less than
110 percent of the total estimated cost of the installation for the full
distance from the termination point of the presently existing water main to the
point where the farthest boundary of the applicant’s land abuts the property or
street, and the bond shall guarantee the installation of the water main in as
short a time as reasonably possible and shall further indemnify the City for
the cost of completing the project in the event the applicant fails to complete
the project within a reasonable time, and shall further indemnify the City for
all damages to public property incurred in the installation, and shall further
hold the City harmless for any and all other damages arising from the
installation of the water main.
   3.   Ownership of Water Main. After the water main has been installed, it
shall become the property of the City.
   4.   Cost Approval. For purposes of determining connection charges under
Section 93.05 below, costs incurred by the owner shall be certified by the City
and only so much of said costs as are approved by the City shall be used in
determining connection charges as provided hereafter.
93.05   CONNECTION CHARGE.  
Following the installation of an extension to the water system under the
provisions of this chapter, there shall be paid to the City a connection charge
of $50.00 for a residential hookup or $100.00 for a commercial/industrial
hookup. Prior to making any connection to the water main, a water permit shall
be filled out and returned to the Clerk together with the above stated
connection charge.
93.06   RIGHTS OF CITY.  
All decisions in connection with the manner of installation of any extension
and maintenance thereof shall remain in the exclusive control of the City and
such extension shall be the property of the City and no other person shall have
any right, title or interest therein. The Council shall have the authority to
allow for the extension of water service and maintenance outside the City
limits. Any decisions regarding the extension of water service and maintenance
beyond the City limits shall be on an individual basis after review of an
application made to the Council in the proper form. The charge for water usage
outside the City limits shall be 150 percent of the current rate being charged
under
Chapter 92 of this Code of Ordinances for water usage inside the City limits.

1   Deep and shallow wells, as defined in IAC 567-40.2(455B): A deep well is a
well located and constructed in such a manner that there is a continuous layer
of low permeability soil or rock at least five feet thick located at least 25
feet below the normal ground surface and above the aquifer from which water is
to be drawn. A shallow well is a well located and constructed in such a manner
that there is not a continuous layer of low permeability soil or rock (or
equivalent retarding mechanism acceptable to the department) at least five feet
thick, the top of which is located at least 25 feet below the normal ground
surface and above the aquifer from which water is to be drawn.
2   The separation distances are dependent upon two factors: the type of piping
that is in the existing sewer or drain, as noted in the table, and that the
piping was properly installed in accordance with the standards.
3   Solid wastes are those derived from the treatment of water or wastewater.
Certain types of solid wastes from water treatment processes may be land-
applied within the separation distance on an individual, case-by-case basis.
4   Solid waste means garbage, refuse, rubbish, and other similar discarded
solid or semisolid materials, including but not limited to such materials
resulting from industrial, commercial, agricultural, and domestic activities.

All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from
periodic grab samples.)

of the Council, which shall be in an amount equal to, but not less than, 110
percent of the total estimated cost of the installation for the full distance
from the termination point of the presently existing sewer to the point where
the farthest boundary of the applicant’s land abuts the public street, and the
bond shall guarantee the installation of the sewer in as short a time as
reasonably possible and shall further indemnify the City for the cost of
completing the project in the event the applicant fails to complete the project
within a reasonable time, and shall further indemnify the City for all damages

improvement.

156.01   PURPOSE AND RULE OF INTERPRETATION.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish uniform rules and controls to
ensure public safety and provide efficient delivery of services by the City and
others wishing to utilize streets and other public property for the delivery of
utility or other services, in order to protect public and private investment,
ensure orderly use of public property and ensure the health, safety, and
welfare of the population, to provide for the regulation and administration of
the public streets and other public property and secure the rights of the City
to a return on its investment in public property. This chapter is to be
interpreted in light of these findings for the benefit of the public and users
of the streets and other public property.
156.02   FRANCHISE, LICENSE, OR EASEMENT REQUIRED.
No person or other entity shall use the public right-of-way or other public
property without first obtaining a franchise, license, or easement from the
City. The City shall not enter into or issue any franchise, license, or
easement that grants exclusive rights. (This chapter does not apply to the
State.)
156.03   FEES REQUIRED.
No franchise, license, or easement for the use of public right-of-way or other
public property shall be granted without requiring the grantee thereof to pay a
reasonable and competitively neutral fee for the use of public right-of-way or
other public property. The Council shall determine which form of permit
(franchise, license, or easement) will be necessary to protest the public
interest. Use of public property or right-of-way shall require an annual fee of
50 cents per foot per year. In the event of a franchise for the distribution of
services within the City, the Council may charge an annual fee up to three
percent of the annual revenues of the franchise earned within the City.
156.04   LIMIT ON TERM.
No franchise, license, or easement for use of the public right-of-way or other
public property shall be granted for a term of more than 25 years.
156.05   PLACEMENT OF FACILITIES.
The facilities, fixtures, and equipment of the distribution, transmission or
sale of any utility services, or services provided under license or easement,
shall be placed and maintained so as not to unnecessarily or unreasonably
interfere with the travel on the streets, highways, avenues, alleys, bridges
and public places in the City, nor shall such facilities, fixtures and
equipment unnecessarily or unreasonably interfere with the proper use of the
same, including, but not limited to, ordinary drainage, or the functioning of
the sewers, underground pipe or other property of the City. In the event that
facilities, fixtures, and equipment of any person or other entity located
within a public right-of-way must be relocated because of paving, road
construction or road reconstruction, sewer construction or sewer reconstruction
or the construction or reconstruction of public drainage systems or similar
public works or the construction or reconstruction of the facilities of any
City-owned utility, such relocation, at the written request of the City, shall
be completed by the owner of such facilities at the owner’s cost. The City
shall, upon request of any person or other entity holding a franchise, license
or easement, review any plans for the construction of facilities, fixtures and
equipment within the public right-of-way and advise the person or other entity
of any conflict such construction may have with planned or anticipated public
improvements, but failure of the City to so advise such person or other entity
will not relieve the owner of such facilities of its obligations under this
chapter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City Engineer may require placement
of equipment or facilities belonging to any holder of a franchise, license, or
easement be limited to locations designated by the City Engineer if such
limitation is deemed by the City Engineer to be necessary to protect the
integrity of use of present and future users of the public right-of-way or
other public property.
156.06   INDEMNIFICATION.
The holder of any franchise, license or easement shall indemnify and hold the
City harmless at all times during the term of the franchise, license, or
easement from and against all claims for injury or damage to any person or
property caused by the construction, erection, operation or maintenance of its
facilities, fixtures or equipment, or the negligence of its contractors or its
employees. In case of any suit or action at law being commenced against the
City, upon any claim for damage arising out of any loss, injury or damage
claimed to have been caused by any installation, improvement, obstruction or
excavation in any street, alley, sidewalk, or public place in the City, and
which installation, improvement, obstruction, or excavation was made or left
in, under or upon such street, sidewalk, alley, or public place by the holder
of a franchise, license, or easement, its agents, contractors or employees,
upon being notified in writing by the City of such action or proceeding, the
holder of said franchise, license, or easement shall appear and make proper
defense thereto at the expense of the holder of the franchise, license or
easement; and if any judgment or decree shall in any such case be rendered
against the City therein, the holder of said franchise, license or easement
shall assume, pay and satisfy such judgment or decree, with the costs thereof.
156.07   REGULATION BY THE CITY.
The City reserves the right to make reasonable general regulations for the use
of streets and other public property which unless otherwise specifically
provided shall apply to any holder of a franchise, license, or easement.
156.08   CONSTRUCTION AND EXCAVATION BY HOLDERS.
   1.   A written permit will be obtained from the City whenever it becomes
necessary for the holder of any franchise, license, or easement to excavate in
streets or public grounds of the City. Such permits shall state a particular
part or point of the street where the excavation is to be made and the length
of time in which such permit shall authorize the work to be done. An exception
to a requirement for a permit shall be made in cases of emergency involving
public safety, in which case a permit will be obtained at the earliest
opportunity after the work has started.
   2.   In making excavations in the streets, the holder of any franchise,
license, or easement shall proceed with such work as to cause the least
possible inconvenience to the public. The holder of any franchise, license, or
easement shall properly protect, according to safety standards generally
accepted at the time of placement, as may be determined from time to time by
the City Engineer, all excavations, and obstructions by proper placement of
shoring, surface plates, barricades, warning lights and such other or
additional devices as circumstances may warrant. If, in the opinion of the City
Engineer, such excavation or obstruction is not properly and safely protected,
the Council shall notify such holder of a franchise, license, or easement, who
shall immediately comply with such reasonable instructions.
   3.   Immediately after use, any trenches for excavations which the holder of
a franchise, license, or easement has opened shall be filled. No trench or
excavation in the streets shall be filled or covered without giving the City
the right to inspect the same. All backfilling in streets will be according to
City specifications. Temporary street surfacing will be placed in such
excavations as soon as the same has been backfilled. Pavements, sidewalks,
curbs and gutters or other portions of streets and public places opened,
disturbed, or damaged shall be promptly restored and replaced with like
materials at the expense of the holder of a franchise, license or easement and
left in as good condition as before the opening, disturbance or damage
occurred. In the event like replacement materials are not available, the holder
of the franchise, license or easement shall notify the City Engineer, who must
approve the use of any alternate materials. In the event that the holder of a
franchise, license or easement fails to comply with the provisions of this
section, after having been given reasonable notice, the City may do such work
as may be needed to properly repair such pavements, sidewalks, curbs and
gutters or other portions of streets and public places and the cost thereof
shall be repaired to the City by the holder of the franchise, license or
easement. In cases where a cut or disturbance is made in a section of street
paving or sidewalks, but causes greater disturbance than to simply the area
cut, rather than replace only the area cut, the holder of a franchise, license
or easement shall replace that area as may be ordered by the City Engineer,
which in no event shall exceed the panel or panels disturbed.
156.09   CITY CONSTRUCTION AND PAVING.
Whenever the City shall pave or repave any street or shall change the grade
line of any street or public place or shall construct or reconstruct any
conduit, water main service or water connection, sewer or other City-owned
public works or City-owned utility, it shall be the duty of the holder of any
franchise, license or easement, when so ordered by the City, to relocate its
service lines and other property in the streets or other public places at its
own expense so as to conform to the established grade or line of such street or
public place and so as not to interfere with the public improvements so
constructed or reconstructed. In the case of other public improvements,
including but not limited to, urban renewal projects, the City may require the
holder of a franchise, license, or easement to relocate its poles, service
lines and appurtenances in the streets at the owner’s expense. The City may, at
its discretion, assign personnel for inspection of excavation and related work
being performed by the holder of a franchise, license, or easement. Should the
holder of the franchise, license or easement fail or refuse to do and perform
the things provided in this chapter, the City may, after reasonable notice,
perform the work and charge the expense thereof to the holder of the franchise,
license or easement and the holder of the franchise, license or easement shall
promptly pay said charges.
156.10   DESIGN NOTICE TO CITY.
The holder of a franchise, license or easement shall promptly, upon request,
furnish the City Engineer a detailed map or maps of its distribution system
both within the City limits and the area immediately surrounding the City. The
holder of a franchise, license or easement shall thereafter update the map or
maps upon request, but not more often than every year, showing all subsequent
additions or deletions to the distribution system. Prior to any excavation by
the City or its agents, a representative must contact the holder of any
franchise, license, or easement regarding current information on the location
of underground lines or facilities in the area concerned. The obligation to
contact the holder of a franchise, license or easement under this section shall
be satisfied if contact is made with the corporation organized pursuant to
Chapter 480 of the Code of Iowa or an entity with a similar function utilized
by both the City and the Company, currently the Iowa One Call System.
156.11   ASSIGNMENT.
No sale, assignment or lease of any franchise, license, or easement for the use
of the public right-of-way or other public property shall be effective until it
is approved by the Council and until the holder thereof has filed in the office
of the Clerk written notice of the proposed sale, transfer, disposition or
assignment, such notice to clearly summarize the proposed procedure and the
terms and conditions thereof. Such approval by the City shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The proposed vendee, assignee or lessee shall similarly
file an instrument, duly executed, reciting such proposal, accepting the terms
of the franchise, license, or easement, and agreeing to perform all of the
conditions thereof.
156.12   FORFEITURE.
The violation of any material portion of a franchise, license, or easement by
the holder thereof or its successors or assigns or its failure promptly to
perform any of the provisions of this chapter shall be cause for forfeiture of
said franchise, license, or easement and the termination of all rights
thereunder. Such forfeiture shall be accomplished by ordinance of the City
after written notice to the holder thereof and a continuation of the violation,
failure or default specified on the notice for at least 30 days from the date
the notice was served.
156.13   APPLICATION.
This chapter applies to all franchises, licenses, and easements granted by the
City, including all existing franchises, licenses, and easements.
156.14   HOME RULE.
This chapter is intended to be and shall be construed as consistent with the
reservation of local authority contained in the 25th Amendment to the Iowa
Constitution granting cities Home Rule powers. To such end, any limitation on
the power of the City contained herein is to be strictly construed and the City
reserves to itself the right to exercise all power and authority to regulate
and control its local affairs and all ordinances and regulations of the City
shall be enforceable against the holder of any franchise, license, or easement.
156.15   NEW TECHNOLOGIES.
Should, within the term of any franchise, license, or easement, developments
within the field for which the grant was made offer to the holder thereof the
opportunity to more effectively, efficiently, and economically serve its
customers through use of a substance or material other than those for which the
grant was originally made, then the holder of the franchise, license, or
easement may petition the Council, which, with such requirements or limitations
as it deems necessary to protect public health, safety, and welfare, may allow
the use of such substances under the terms and conditions of the franchise,
license, or easement.

impacts. Applicants for tower sites shall be required to provide information on
the projected power density of the facility and how this meets the FCC
standards.
157.10   PLACEMENT OF FACILITIES AND RELATED LEASE FEES.
The placement and maintenance of communications antennas or towers on City-
owned sites, such as water towers and parks, will be allowed when the following
additional requirements are met.
   1.   Water Tower or Reservoir Sites. The City’s water tower and reservoir
represent a large public investment in water pressure stabilization and peak
capacity reserves. Therefore, its protection is of prime importance. As access
to the City’s water storage system increases, so does the potential for
contamination of the public water supply. For these reasons, the placement of
communications towers or antennas on water towers or reservoir sites will be
allowed only when the following requirements are met:
      A.   The applicant must have written approval from the public works
director each time access to the facility is desired. This will minimize the
risk of contamination to the water supply.
      B.   There is sufficient room on the structure and/or the grounds to
accommodate the applicant’s facility.
      C.   The presence of the facility will not increase the water tower or
reservoir maintenance cost to the City.
      D.   The presence of the facility will not be harmful to the health or
safety of the workers maintaining the water tower or reservoir.
The following fees will be assessed for placing facilities on a City water
tower: to be determined by the Council.
   2.   Parks. The presence of certain communications antennas or towers
represents a potential conflict with the purpose of certain City-owned parks
and recreational facilities. Towers shall be prohibited in conservation areas.
Communications antennas or towers will be considered only in the following
parks after approval of the Council.
      A.   Public parks of a sufficient scale and character that are adjacent
to an existing commercial or industrial use.
      B.   Commercial recreational areas and major ball fields.
      C.   Park maintenance facilities.
Fees for placing facilities on park property: to be determined by the Council.
157.11   ABANDONMENT.
In the event the use of any communications tower has been discontinued for a
period of 180 consecutive days, the tower shall be deemed to be abandoned.
Determination of the date of abandonment shall be made by the Clerk who shall
have the right to request documentation or affidavits from the communications
tower owner or operator regarding the issue of tower usage. Upon such
abandonment, the owner/operator of the tower shall have an additional 180 days
within which to:
   1.   Reactivate the use of the tower or transfer the tower to another owner/
operator who makes actual use of the tower, or
   2.   Dismantle and Remove the Tower. At the earliest, 180 days from the date
of abandonment, without reactivating or upon completion of dismantling and
removal, any special exception or variance approval for the tower shall
automatically expire.
157.12   TERMINATION.
The Council may terminate any lease if it is determined that any one of the
following conditions exist.
   1.   A potential user with a higher priority cannot find another adequate
location and the potential use would be incompatible with the existing use.
   2.   A user’s frequency broadcast unreasonably interferes with other users
of higher priority, regardless of whether or not this interference was
adequately predicted in the technical analysis.
   3.   A user violates any of the standards in this chapter or the conditions
attached to the City’s lease agreement.
Before taking action, the City will provide notice to the user of the intended
termination and the reasons for it, and provide an opportunity for a hearing
before the Council regarding the proposed action. This procedure need not be
followed in emergency situations.
157.13   HOME RULE.
This chapter is intended to be and shall be construed as consistent with the
reservation of local authority contained in the 25th Amendment to the Iowa
Constitution granting cities Home Rule powers. To such end, any limitation on
the power of the City contained herein is to be strictly construed and the City
reserves to itself the right to exercise all power and authority to regulate
and control its local affairs and all ordinances and regulations of the City
shall be enforced against the holders of any lease.
157.14   NEW TECHNOLOGIES.
Should, within the term of any lease, developments within the field for which
the grant was made to the holder of the lease present the opportunity to the
holder of the lease to be more effective, efficient and economical through the
use of a substance or material other than those for which the lease was
originally made, the holder of the lease may petition the Council which, with
such requirements or limitations as it deems necessary to protect public
health, safety and welfare, may allow the use of such substances under the
terms and conditions of the lease.

of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure
either: (i) before the start of construction of the improvement; or (ii) if the
structure has been substantially damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred.
      The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a
structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or
safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living
conditions. The term also does not include any alteration of a historic
structure, provided the alteration will not preclude the structure’s
designation as a historic structure.
      B.   Any addition which increases the original floor area of a building
by 25 percent or more. All additions constructed after the effective date of
the first floodplain management regulations adopted by the community shall be
added to any proposed addition in determining whether the total increase in
original floor space would exceed 25 percent.
   35.   “Variance” means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of

160.02   STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSE.
   1.   The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 364, Code of Iowa,
as amended, delegated the power to cities to exercise any power and perform any
function it deems appropriate to protect and preserve the rights, privileges,
and property of the City or of its residents, and to preserve and improve the
peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort, and convenience of its residents.
   2.   Findings of Fact.
      A.   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community.
      B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by: (i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
      C.   This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
   3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Paragraph 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
      A.   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows
so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
      B.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
      C.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
      D.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
      E.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   1.   Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter shall
apply to all lands and development which have significant flood hazards. The
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Fayette County and Incorporated Areas, City
of Elgin, Panels 19065C0209F and 0228F, dated March 13, 2024, which were
prepared as part of the Fayette County Flood Insurance Study, shall be used to
identify such flood hazard areas and all areas shown thereon to be within the
boundaries of the base flood shall be considered as having significant flood
hazards. The Flood Insurance Study for the County of Fayette County is hereby
adopted by reference and is made a part of this chapter for the purpose of
administering floodplain management regulations.
   2.   Rules for Interpretation of Flood Hazard Boundaries. The boundaries of
the Special Flood Hazard areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the
official Flood Insurance Rate Map. When an interpretation is needed as to the
exact location of a boundary, the Administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation. The Council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged
that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by
the Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   3.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no
structure shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without
full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
   4.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
   5.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
   6.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated special flood hazard areas will be
free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on
the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
   7.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.

      C.   Action on Permit Application. The Administrator shall, within a
reasonable time, make a determination as to whether the proposed floodplain
development meets the applicable standards of this chapter and shall approve or
disapprove the application. For disapprovals, the applicant shall be informed,
in writing, of the specific reasons therefor. The Administrator shall not issue
permits for variances except as directed by the Council.
      D.   Construction and Use to Be as Provided in Application and Plans.
Floodplain Development Permits based on the basis of approved plans and
applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in
such approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement or
construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. The applicant shall be
required to submit certification by a professional engineer or land surveyor,
as appropriate, registered in the State, that the finished fill, structure
floor elevations, floodproofing, or other flood protection measures were
accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to the
use or occupancy of any structure.
160.05   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT STANDARDS.
All development must be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and
meet the following applicable performance standards. Where base flood elevation
has not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources shall be contacted to determine: (i) whether the land
involved is either wholly or partly within the floodway or floodway fringe; and
(ii) the base flood elevation. Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no
development may increase the base flood elevation more than one foot. The
applicant will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources
with sufficient technical information to make such determination. Review by the
Iowa Department of Natural Resources is not required for the proposed
construction of new or replacement bridges or culverts where: (i) the bridge or
culvert is located on a stream that drains less than two square miles; and (ii)
the bridge or culvert is not associated with a channel modification that
constitutes a channel change as specified in 567 IAC 71.2(2).
   1.   All Development. All development within the special flood hazard areas
shall:
      A.   Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement.
      B.   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
      C.   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
      D.   Obtain all other necessary permits from federal, State, and local
governmental agencies including approval when required from the Iowa Department
of Natural Resources.
   2.   Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the base flood elevation. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed subject to favorable
consideration by the Council, where existing topography, street grades, or
other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods used must
be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various forces
and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential structures located in
areas that would become isolated due to flooding of surrounding ground shall be
provided with a means of access that will be passable by wheeled vehicles
during the base flood. However, this criterion shall not apply where the
Administrator determines there is sufficient flood warning time for the
protection of life and property. When estimating flood warning time,
consideration shall be given to the criteria listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa
Administrative Code.
   3.   Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be flood proofed to such a level. When
floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State of
Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and
other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the
base flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
   4.   All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
      A.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
         (1)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
         (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
         (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access and
low damage potential storage.
      B.   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
      C.   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
electric meter, electrical service panel box, hot water heater, heating, air
conditioning, ventilation equipment (including ductwork), and other similar
machinery and equipment elevated (or in the case of non-residential structures,
optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation.
      D.   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
plumbing, gas lines, water meters, gas meters, and other similar service
utilities either elevated (or in the case of non-residential structures,
optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation or designed to be watertight and withstand inundation to such a
level.
   5.   Factory-Built Homes.
      A.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the structure
is a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation.
      B.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame
ties to ground anchors. Anchorage systems may include, but are not limited to,
use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors as required by the State
Building Code.
   6.   Utility and Sanitary Systems.
      A.   On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located or
designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
      B.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system as well as
the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment facilities
(other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood protection
equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood elevation.
      C.   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water
supply treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with
a level of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood
elevation.
      D.   Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
   7.   Storage of Materials and Equipment. Storage of equipment and materials
that are flammable, explosive, or injurious to human, animal or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or:
(i) not subject to major flood damage and be anchored to prevent movement due
to flood waters; or (ii) readily removable from the area within the time
available after flood warning.
   8.   Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as
levees, flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the base
flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for
adequate interior drainage. In addition, structural flood control works shall
be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
   9.   Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must be
designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations must be
approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
   10.   Subdivisions. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and
subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the base flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50 lots
(whichever is less) shall include base flood elevation data for those areas
located within the Special Flood Hazard Area.
   11.   Accessory Structures to Residential Uses. Detached garages, sheds, and
similar structures that are incidental to a residential use are exempt from the
base flood elevation requirements where the following criteria are satisfied.
      A.   The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage potential.
Its size shall not exceed 600 square feet in size. Those portions of the
structure located less than one foot above the BFE must be constructed of
flood-resistant materials.
      B.   The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage potential
purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure shall not
be used for human habitation.
      C.   The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building site
so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
      D.   The structure shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement.
      E.   The structure’s service facilities such as electrical and heating
equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above the base
flood elevation.
      F.   The structure’s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of Subsection 4(A) of this section.
Exemption from the base flood elevation requirements for such a structure may
result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of the structure
and its contents.
   12.   Recreational Vehicles.
      A.   Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of Subsection
5 of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built homes when
the following criteria are satisfied.
         (1)   The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less
than 180 consecutive days; and
         (2)   The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
      B.   Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than 180
consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements of
Subsection 5 of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built
homes.
   13.   Pipeline Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be
buried in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to
prevent rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
   14.   Maximum Damage Potential Development. All new or substantially
improved maximum damage potential development shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated a minimum of one foot above the elevation of the
500-year flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be
floodproofed to such a level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional
engineer registered in the State shall certify that the floodproofing methods
used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact
and uplift forces and other factors associated with the base flood; and that
the structure, below the base flood elevation is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water. A record of the
certification indicating the specific elevation (in relation to North American
Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are flood proofed shall be
maintained by the Administrator. Where 0.2 percent chance flood elevation data
has not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The applicant will
be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with
sufficient technical information to make such determinations.
   15.   Special Floodway Provisions. In addition to the General Floodplain
Standards, development within the floodway must meet the following applicable
standards. The floodway is that portion of the floodplain which must be
protected from developmental encroachment to allow the free flow of flood
waters. Where floodway data has been provided in the Flood Insurance Study,
such data shall be used to define the floodway. Where no floodway data has been
provided, the Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to provide a
floodway delineation. The applicant will be responsible for providing the
Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make
such determination.
      A.   No development shall be permitted in the floodway that would result
in any increase in the base flood elevation. Consideration of the effects of
any development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption that an
equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly situated lands.
      B.   All development within the floodway shall:
         (1)   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
         (2)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
         (3)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are
resistant to flood damage.
      C.   No development shall affect the capacity or conveyance of the
channel or floodway of any tributary to the main stream, drainage ditch, or any
other drainage facility or system.
      D.   Structures, buildings, recreational vehicles, and sanitary and
utility systems, if permitted, shall meet the applicable General Floodplain
standards, and shall be constructed or aligned to present the minimum possible
resistance to flood flows.
      E.   Structures, if permitted, shall have a low flood damage potential
and shall not be for human habitation.
      F.   Storage of materials or equipment that are buoyant, flammable,
explosive, or injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. Storage
of other material may be allowed if readily removable from the floodway within
the time available after flood warning.
      G.   Watercourse alterations or relocations (channel changes and
modifications) must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within
the altered or relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations
must be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
      H.   Any fill allowed in the floodway must be shown to have some
beneficial purpose and shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary.
      I.   Pipeline river or stream crossings shall be buried in the streambed
and banks or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due to channel
degradation and meandering or due to the action of flood flows.
160.06   ESTABLISHMENT OF VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   1.   The Council may authorize upon request in specific cases such variances
from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the public interest
where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of
this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances granted must meet
the following applicable standards.
      A.   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
      B.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
      C.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      D.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for structures than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance
coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
      E.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
   2.   Factors upon Which the Decision of the Council Shall Be Based. In
passing upon applications for variances, the Council shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
      A.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
      B.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
      C.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
      D.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      E.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the City.
      F.   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
      G.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
      H.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
      I.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for the area.
      J.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      K.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood water expected at the site.
      L.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
      M.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
chapter.
   3.   Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the Council may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such
conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
      A.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
      B.   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
      C.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
      D.   Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this chapter.
      E.   Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the flood
protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration, rate
of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated with
the regulatory flood. The Council shall require that the applicant submit a
plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
160.07   NONCONFORMING USES.
   1.   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful
before the passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but
which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be
continued subject to the following conditions:
      A.   If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any future
use of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
      B.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
      C.   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless
it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary, building or safety codes or regulations or the
cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
designation.
   2.   Except as provided in Section 160.07(1)(B), any use which has been
permitted as a variance shall be considered a conforming use.
160.08   PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
the requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this
chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction
thereof be fined not more than $500.00. Nothing herein contained shall prevent
the City from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy violation.
160.09   AMENDMENTS.
The regulations and standards set forth in this chapter may from time to time
be amended, supplemented, changed, or repealed. No amendment, supplement,
change, or modification shall be undertaken without prior approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.

170.01   PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum standards for the design,
development and improvement of all new subdivisions and resubdivisions so that
existing developments will be protected and so that adequate provisions are
made for public services and to promote the health, safety, and general
welfare.
170.02   DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this chapter the following terms are
defined:
   1.   “Building line” means a line between which and an abutting street or
public alley no buildings or structure may be erected.
   2.   “Metes and bounds” means the method used to describe a tract of land
intended to be used for dwelling or other purposes, so that it can be recorded
in the County Recorder’s office, as contrasted with the description of a part
of a properly approved and recorded subdivision plat by the lot and block
number.
   3.   “Plat” means a map, drawing, or chart of a subdivision.
   4.   “Subdivision” means the division of a lot, tract, or parcel of land
into three or more lots, plots, sites, or other divisions of land, for the
purpose of either immediate or future sale or of building development. It also
includes resubdivision of land or lots.
170.03   PLAT APPROVAL AND ACCEPTANCE. Procedures for plat approval and
acceptance are as follows:
   1.   Preliminary Plat. Whenever the owner of any tract or parcel of land is
required by law to secure the approval of the Council to any plat or
subdivision, said owner shall file said preliminary plat in triplicate,
together with any other required information, with the Clerk. Two copies of
said plat and other information shall be referred by the Clerk to the City
Engineer for preliminary study and approval. Such preliminary plat shall
contain such information and data as outlined in Section
170.04(1).
   2.   Study of Preliminary Plat by the Engineer. The Engineer shall carefully
examine said preliminary plat and other information submitted as to compliance
with the laws and regulations of the City, the existing street system, and good

duplicate to the Council, together with one copy of the plat received.
   3.   Action by Council. The Council shall, upon receiving the report of the
City Engineer, as soon as possible, but not more than 30 days thereafter,
consider said report, negotiate with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable
and the kind and extent of improvements to be made by the subdivider, and pass
upon the preliminary plat as originally submitted or modified. If the Council
does not act within 60 days, the preliminary plat shall be deemed to be
approved; provided, however, the subdivider may agree to an extension of the
time for a period not to exceed an additional 60 days.
   4.   Final Plat of Subdivision. The subdivider shall also file with the
Clerk for submission to the Council, for final approval or rejection, the final
plat and plan of the subdivision which shall contain the data and information
outlined in Section
170.04(2) of this chapter.
   5.   Filing in Office of Clerk. After approval of the final plat and plan by
the Council, two copies of such final plat and plan shall be filed in the
office of the Clerk.
170.04   INFORMATION REQUIRED ON PLATS.
Plat information requirements are as follows:
   1.   Preliminary Plat. The preliminary plat shall be drawn to scale and
shall show the proposed location and width of streets, lot lines, building
lines, and areas of each proposed lot. The plat shall also show surrounding
streets, lots, water courses, sewers and water mains. The scale of such
preliminary plat shall not be less than one inch to 100 feet. Wherever the land
is so rolling or rugged that the preliminary location and grades of streets and
sewers cannot be properly considered without the aid of a topographical map,
the Council may require the developer to provide a topographical map of the
property showing contour intervals of not less than five feet. Any plat not
containing all information specified above shall not be considered. A filing
fee of $100.00 shall be required to cover processing costs.

prints thereof shall be submitted. It shall show:
      A.   The boundaries of the property.
      B.   The lines of all proposed streets and alleys, with their widths and
names, and any other areas intended to be dedicated to public use; the names of
the streets shall be a continuation of the existing method of naming streets in
the City.
      C.   The lines of adjoining streets and alleys, with their widths and
names.
      D.   All lot lines, building lines, and easements, with figures showing
their dimensions.
      E.   All dimensions, both linear and angular, necessary for locating
boundaries of the subdivided area or of the lots, streets, alleys, easements,
and building line setbacks, and any other similar public or private uses. The
linear dimensions shall be expressed in feet and decimals of a foot.
      F.   Radii, arcs, and chords, points of tangency, central angles for all
circulinear streets, and radii for all rounded corners.
      G.   All monuments, together with their descriptions.

      I.   Profiles may be required of any streets.
      J.   Any private restrictions shall be shown on the plat or reference
made to them thereon; and plats shall contain proper acknowledgments of owners
and mortgagees accepting said platting and restrictions.
170.05   ATTACHMENTS TO PLATS.
Final plats shall be accompanied by the following documents:
   1.   A statement by the proprietors and their spouses, if any, that the plat
is prepared with their free consent and in accordance with their desire, signed
and acknowledged before an officer authorized to take the acknowledgments of
deeds. The statement by the proprietors may also include a dedication to the
public of all lands within the plat that are designated for streets, alleys,
parks, open areas, school property, or other public use, if the dedication is
approved by the Council.
   2.   A statement from the mortgage holders or lienholders, if any, that the
plat is prepared with their free consent and in accordance with their desire,
signed and acknowledged before an officer authorized to take the acknowledgment
of deeds. An affidavit and bond as provided for in Section 354.12 of the Code
of Iowa may be recorded in lieu of the consent of the mortgage or lienholder.
When a mortgage or lienholder consents to the subdivision, a release of
mortgage or lien shall be recorded for any areas conveyed to the City or
dedicated to the public.
   3.   An opinion by an attorney-at-law who has examined the abstract of title
of the land being platted. The opinion shall state the names of the proprietors
and holders of mortgages, liens or other encumbrances on the land being platted
and shall note the encumbrances, along with any bonds securing the
encumbrances. Utility easements shall not be construed to be encumbrances for
the purpose of this section.
   4.   A certificate of the County Treasurer that the land is free from
certified taxes and certified special assessments or that the land is free from
certified taxes and that the certified special assessments are secured by bond
in compliance with Section 354.12 of the Code of Iowa.
   5.   A resolution and certificate for approval by the Council and for
signatures of the Mayor and Clerk.
170.06   MINIMUM STANDARDS OF DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT.
No preliminary or final plat of a subdivision shall be approved by the Council
unless it conforms to the minimum standards and requirements contained in this
chapter.
   1.   Acre Subdivision. Whenever the area is divided into lots containing one
or more acres and there are indications that such lots will eventually be
subdivided into small building plots, consideration must be given to the street
and lot arrangement of the original subdivision so that additional streets can
be opened which will permit a logical arrangement of smaller lots.
   2.   Relation to Adjoining Street System. The arrangement of streets in new
subdivisions shall make provisions for the continuation of the principal
existing streets in adjoining additions (or their proper projection where
adjoining property is not subdivided) insofar as they may be necessary for
public requirements. The width of such streets in new subdivisions shall not be
less than the minimum street widths established herein. The street and alley
arrangement must also be such as to cause no hardship to owners of adjoining
property when they plat their own land and seek to provide for convenient
access to it. Whenever there exists a dedicated or platted half-street or alley
adjacent to the tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street or alley
shall be platted.
   3.   Streets in Relation to Railroads. When the area to be subdivided
adjoins a railroad right-of-way, no street shall be dedicated which is parallel
or approximately parallel to the railroad, unless it is 100 feet or more from
the line of the railroad right-of-way.
   4.   Street Right-of-way Width. The minimum width of street rights-of-way
shall be 60 feet.
   5.   Street Width. The minimum width of streets shall be 20 feet, except in
those cases where topographical conditions, existing streets, or special
conditions make a street of less width more suitable. Under these conditions
the Council may waive the minimum requirements.
   6.   Street Jogs at Intersections. At street intersections, street jogs with
centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be prohibited, except where
topographic or other physical conditions make such jogs unavoidable.
   7.   Street Angles at Intersections. Streets shall intersect as nearly at
right angles as possible, and no street shall intersect any other street at an
angle less than 60 degrees.
   8.   Dead-end Streets. Dead-end streets are prohibited except where a street
is planned to continue past the subdivider’s property. A dead-end street shall
terminate in a temporary circular right-of-way with a minimum diameter of 90
feet, unless the Council approves an equally safe and convenient space. No
dead-end street shall be longer than 600 feet. Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed 600
feet in length and shall be provided with a turn-around with a minimum right-
of-way diameter of 120 feet. The length of the cul-de-sac shall be measured
along its centerline from the turn-around to the intersecting point.
   9.   Alleys. The minimum width of an alley in a residential block shall be
15 feet (alleys are not recommended for residential districts except under
unusual conditions). Alleys will be required in the rear of all business lots
and shall be at least 20 feet wide.
   10.   Easements Where There Are No Alleys. Where alleys are not provided,
easements of not less than five feet in width shall be provided on each side of
all rear lot lines and on those side lines where necessary for poles, wires,
conduits, storm and sanitary sewers, gas, water, and heat mains. Easements of
greater width may be required along lines or across lots where necessary for
the extension of main sewers and similar utilities.
   11.   Length of Blocks. No blocks shall be longer than 1,000 feet between
street lines. Blocks over 750 feet in length shall provide a cross walk near
the center of the block. The right-of-way through such blocks shall not be less
than 10 feet in width.
   12.   Width of Blocks. The width of blocks shall not be less than 200 feet
and not more than 300 feet, except that when such requirement would entail
unusual and substantial difficulties or hardship or when it is desired to
provide a development containing large residential lots, the Council may modify
such requirements and allow the subdivider to plat blocks of other widths.
   13.   Lot Lines. All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to straight
street lines or radial to curved street lines, unless a variation of this rule
will give a better street and lot plan. Lots with double frontage shall be
avoided.
   14.   Size and Shape of Lots. The minimum dimensions for lots shall be 66
feet for width and 100 feet for depth, and in no case shall a lot that is to be
used for residential purposes contain less area than is required by the lot
area regulation of the zoning district in which the property is located. In
laying out an arrangement of lots, the subdivider should, whenever possible,
arrange for wide, shallow lots and avoid long, narrow lots.
   15.   Corner Lots. All corner lots shall have extra width sufficient to
permit the maintenance of building lines on both the front end and side streets
as required by any applicable zoning regulations.
   16.   Building Lines. Building lines shall be shown on all lots intended for
residential use of any character, and on commercial lots immediately adjoining
residential areas. Such building lines shall not be less than required by any
applicable zoning regulations.
   17.   Character of Development. The Council shall confer with the subdivider
regarding the type and character of development that will be permitted in the
subdivision, and may require that certain minimum deed restrictions be placed
upon the property, which restrictions would prevent such construction which
would clearly depreciate the character and value of adjoining property. The
Council may also require that the deed restrictions provide for the creation of
a property owners’ association which would be responsible for the enforcement
of the restrictions and for the protection and improvement of the general
welfare of the subdivision.
   18.   Improvements. Before any final plat of any subdivision is finally
approved for recording, the subdivider shall make and install improvements as
required in paragraphs A-G of this subsection throughout the area to be
platted. In lieu of final completion of the minimum improvements before the
plat is finally approved, the subdivider may post a bond (approved by the
Council) with the City or make other provisions which will insure to the City
that the improvements will be completed by the subdivider within one year (or
other time period if so defined) after final approval of the plat. The amount
of the bond shall be not less than the estimated cost of the improvements, and
the amount of the estimate must be approved by the City. If the improvements
are not completed within the specified time, the Council may use the bond or
any necessary portion thereof to complete the same.
      A.   Grading and Improving Streets. The subdivider shall grade and
improve all streets and alleys contained within the subdivision. The surfacing
of such streets and alleys shall be of such character as is suitable for the
expected traffic and in harmony with similar improvements in the surrounding
areas, but in no case shall it consist of less than either six and one-half
inches of Portland Cement over a four-inch base of drainage rock or four and
one-half inches of Asphaltic Cement over an eight-inch base of rock. If the
Asphaltic Cement surface is used, minimum 30-inch wide Portland Cement curb and
gutter is required for each side of the surfacing. The street design shall be
certified by a registered professional engineer.
      B.   Tile Drainage. Edges of new streets that do not have storm sewer
adjacent to them are to be drained with drainage tile with a minimum diameter
of five inches. The tile is to be designed to drain the base rock of the street
and provide a discharge for sump pumps from homes in the new subdivision. Drain
tiles should normally be designed for a depth of approximately four and one-
half feet, but depth may have to be adjusted in design to accommodate other
drain line considerations. Generally, the drain lines shall be located just
outside the back of curb.
      C.   Grading and Improving Lots. The subdivider shall, whenever
necessary, grade any portion of the property subdivided into lots so that each
lot that is to be offered for sale will be usable and suitable for the erection
of residential or other structure thereon.
      D.   Sanitary Sewers. The subdivider shall install sanitary sewer mains
and provide a service connection to each lot. Such installations shall be in
accordance with the requirements of the City, County, and the Iowa Department
of Natural Resources. The sewer improvements shall be designed by a registered
engineer to provide adequate capacity for installation. If area beyond the
subdivision is to be drained through the mains in the future, the subdivider’s
engineer is to discuss the design with the City. Any costs to the City for up-
sizing the lines beyond requirements of the subdivision to allow for future
flows shall be resolved before the lines are constructed. As a minimum, the
mains shall be constructed using PVC SDR-35 pipe between precast manholes
equipped with steps. Tees, wyes, or saddles shall be used for the connection of
each service line to the mains. Service lines shall be made of PVC and their
locations marked by use of a marker wire buried along the service line. A
service connection permit must be obtained from the City before each connection
is constructed, and the connection must be inspected by the City before the
trench is backfilled. Service lines to single family buildings shall be, as a
minimum, Schedule 40 PVC pipe, 4 inches in diameter. Service lines to multi-
family buildings shall be, as a minimum, Schedule 40 PVC pipe, six inches in
diameter.
      E.   Potable Water. The subdivider shall install water mains, valves, and
fire hydrants in the subdivision area. Such installations shall be in
accordance with the standards, guidelines and specifications of the City and
State Department of Natural Resources. Fire hydrant locations shall meet with
the approval of the City Water Department and the City Fire Chief. As a
minimum, the water mains shall be 6-inch diameter PVC DR-18 or DIP pipe, with
mechanical joint cast or ductile iron fittings. If PVC mains are used, a tracer
wire is to be installed with the pipe, and a proper saddle shall be used at
each service connection to the main. Corporations are to be installed on each
service at the main, and curb stop and box are to be installed at the right-of-
way/lot line. Only copper service line is to be used from the main to a
distance of at least 18 inches past the curb stop. For new construction, copper
service line is to run to the house. If the service line exists as plastic, a
tracer tape and wire are to be installed 12 inches below ground level over the
line from the house to the curb stop. If the City desires a water main to be
up-sized from the minimum six-inch main, it will cover up-sizing costs. Service
connection permits must be obtained from the City before each is constructed,
and the City is to inspect each connection before the trench is backfilled. All
gate valves shall be resilient wedge, Mueller Model A-2360-20 with mechanical
joint ends. All valves deeper than six and one half foot bury shall have pinned
extension operators. All fire hydrants shall be Mueller Centurion Model A-423
with six-inch mechanical joint inlet. Hydrants shall include two two and one-
half-inch hose nozzles and one four and one-half-inch pumper nozzle. Nozzle
threads shall match common existing City hydrant threads. Unit shall have a
break-away traffic flange at ground level.
      F.   Stormwater Drainage. Where deemed necessary by the Council, the
developer shall install a stormwater detention/drainage system adequate to
serve the platted area. The system shall control runoff from the platted area
so as to limit discharge flows from a 100-year frequency storm after
development to no greater flow rate than the five-year frequency storm before
the development. Design of the storm water detention/drainage system shall be
certified by a registered engineer. As a minimum, reinforced concrete pipe
shall be used under either present or future street surface areas.
      G.   Other Improvements. It may also be desirable to install other
improvements such as sidewalks, electric lines, streetlights, gas mains and
similar facilities in any subdivision. Whenever the Council deems it necessary,
they may require that such improvements shall be installed before the plat is
approved.
170.07   ENFORCEMENT. Enforcement provisions are as follows:
   1.   Filing of Plat. No plat of any subdivision shall be entitled to record
in the County Recorder’s office or have any validity until it shall have been
approved in the manner prescribed herein.
   2.   Building Permits. The Administrative Officer shall not issue building
or repair permits for any structure located on a lot in any subdivision, the
plat of which has been prepared after the date of the adoption of the 2006 Code
of Ordinances but which has not been approved in accordance with the provisions
contained herein. An original tract may be divided into two lots or tracts and
not be subject to the provisions of this section. If an original tract shall be
divided into more than two lots or tracts after the date of the adoption of the
2006 Code of Ordinances, no building or repair permits shall be issued for any
structure located or proposed to be located on any of such tracts or lots,
unless or until a plat as required by this chapter has been fully approved by
the Council.
   3.   Public Improvements. The Council shall not permit any public
improvement over which it has any control to be made or any money expended for
improvements in any area that has been subdivided or upon any street that has
been platted after the date of the adoption of the 2006 Code of Ordinances
unless such subdivision or street has been approved in accordance with the
provisions contained therein.
170.08   VARIATIONS.
Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape or is
surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict
application of the subdivision improvements would result in real difficulties
and substantial hardships, the Council may vary or modify such requirements so
that the subdivider is allowed to develop the property in a reasonable manner,
but at the same time the public welfare and interests of the City are protected
and the general intent and spirit of this chapter are preserved.
