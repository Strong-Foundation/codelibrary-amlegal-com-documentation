the improvement, its cost, and other information deemed necessary by the
Director of Revenue.
8.07   APPROVAL.
   A person may submit a proposal to the Council to receive prior approval for
eligibility for a tax exemption on new construction. If the Council resolves to
consider such proposal, it shall publish notice and hold a public hearing
thereon. Thereafter, at least 30 days after such hearing, the Council, by
ordinance, may give its prior approval of a tax exemption for new construction
if the new construction is in conformance with City zoning. Such prior approval
shall not entitle the owner to exemption from taxation until the new
construction has been completed and found to be qualified real estate.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 427B.4)
8.08   EXEMPTION REPEALED.
   When in the opinion of the Council continuation of the exemption granted by

sheltering, harboring, or keeping such dangerous animal or vicious dog remove
such animal from the City or destroy it. The decision and order shall
immediately be served upon the person against whom rendered in the same manner

is not appealed and is not complied with within three days of its issuance, the
animal control officer is authorized to seize and impound such dangerous or
vicious animal. An animal so seized shall be impounded for a period of seven
days. If, at the end of the impoundment period, the person against whom the
decision and order of the committee was issued has not petitioned the District
Court for a review of said order, the City shall cause the animal to be
disposed of by sale or destroy such animal in a humane manner. Failure to
comply with an order of the City issued pursuant hereto constitutes a

expiration of the 10-day reclaiming period.
   7.   If it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the
identities and addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders,
notice by one publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area
where the vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of
notice under Subsection 2 of this section. The published notice may contain
multiple listings of abandoned vehicles, but shall be published within the same
time requirements and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed
notice in Subsection 2 of this section.

notification procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more
wheels or other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable.
The police authority shall give the applicant a certificate of authority. The
applicant shall then apply to the County Treasurer for a junking certificate
and shall surrender the certificate of authority in lieu of the certificate of
title.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.90(2)(e))
80.07   PROCEEDS FROM SALES.
   Proceeds from the sale of any abandoned vehicle shall be applied to the
expense of auction, cost of towing, preserving, storing, and notification
required, in accordance with State law. Any balance shall be held for the owner
of the motor vehicle or entitled lienholder for 90 days, and then shall be

period, a one-month surcharge shall be imposed in an amount equal to 50 percent
of the previous month’s water bill and, in addition, the utility shall
interrupt water service to that customer at the premises at which the violation
occurred. Service shall not be restored until the customer has paid the
reconnection fee and has provided reasonable assurance that future violations
of Water Warning or Water Emergency use restrictions will not occur.
Any customer charged with a violation of the Water Warning or Water Emergency
use restrictions may request a hearing before the Water Appeal Board. The Water
Appeal Board may conclude that a violation did not occur or that the
circumstances under which the violation occurred warrant a complete or partial
mitigation of the penalty.
94.13   MUNICIPAL INFRACTION.
   A second or subsequent violation of the Water Warning or Water Emergency use
restrictions by any person within a 12-month period constitutes a municipal
infraction. Any person who, in making application to the Water Appeal Board for
adjustment of the base allocation or premium charges, intentionally provides
false or incorrect statements or information commits a municipal infraction.
94.14   REDUCTION IN FLOW OF WATER TO ANY PERSON.
   The Superintendent is authorized, after giving notice and opportunity for
hearing before the Water Appeal Board, to reduce the flow of water to any
person determined to be using water in any manner not in accordance with this

97.05   POWERS OF THE CITY.
   If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to
the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in Section
97.01,
97.03, and
97.04 of this chapter or which are in violation of the standards for
pretreatment provided in Chapter 1, EPA Rules and Regulations, Subchapter D,
Water Programs Part 128 - Pretreatment Standards, Federal Register Volume 38,
No. 215, Thursday, November 8, 1973, and any amendments thereto, and which in
the judgment of the authorized City representative, may have a deleterious
effect upon the sewage system and wastewater treatment works, processes,
equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or
constitute a public nuisance, the authorized City representative may:
   1.   Rejection. Reject the wastes;
   2.   Pretreatment. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for
discharge to the public sewers;
   3.   Controlled Discharge. Require control over the quantities and rates of
discharge;

shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the
owner at their expense.
97.08   CONTROL MANHOLES REQUIRED.
   Each industry shall be required to install a control manhole and, when
required by the authorized City representative, the owner of any property
serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a
suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and
measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required shall be accessibly and
safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the authorized City representative. The manhole shall be installed by the
owner, at the owner’s expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be
safe and accessible at all times.
97.09   MEASUREMENT AND TESTS REQUIRED.
   The owner of any property served by a building sewer carrying industrial
wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests, and analyses of waters and
wastes to illustrate compliance with these chapters and any special conditions
for discharge established by the City or regulatory agencies having
jurisdiction over the discharge. The number, type, and frequency of laboratory
analyses to be performed by the owner shall be as stipulated by the City, but
not less than once per year, the industry must supply a complete analysis of
the constituents of the wastewater discharge to assure that compliance with the
federal, State, and local standards are being met. The owner shall report the
results of such measurements and laboratory analyses to the City at such times
and in such manner as prescribed by the City. The owner shall bear the expense
of all measurements, analyses, and reporting required by the City. At such
times as deemed necessary, the City reserves the right to take measurements and
samples for analyses by an outside laboratory service.
97.10   METHOD OF TESTING AND MEASUREMENT.
   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods and shall be determined
at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control
manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control
manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public
sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be
carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of
constituents upon the sewerage system and wastewater treatment works and to
determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular
analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of
a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from
24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from periodic
grab samples).
97.11   SPECIAL AGREEMENTS.
   No statement in this chapter shall be construed as preventing a special
agreement or arrangement between the City and any industrial concern whereby an
industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the City
for treatment, subject to payment therefore, in accordance with any resolution
establishing special rates and charges by the Council, provided such payments
are in accordance with federal and State guidelines for user charge system.

continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Community Service Director may serve upon the user a written
notice of violation. Within 48 hours of receipt of this notice, an explanation
of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof, to include
specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Community
Service Director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Community
Service Director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
97.14   CONSENT ORDER.
   The Community Service Director is hereby empowered to enter into consent
orders, including more frequent testing as determined by the Community Service
Director, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with the user responsible for the noncompliance. Such
orders will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the
noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order.
97.15   SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   The Community Service Director may order any user which has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, to appear before the Community Service Director and show cause why
a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on
the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user
show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice
of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) at least five business days prior to the hearing.
Such notice may be served on the authorized representative of the user. A show
cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
97.16   CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   1.   When the Community Service Director finds that a user is in significant
non-compliance and has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user’s past violations are
likely to recur, the Community Service Director may issue an order to the user
directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
      A.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      B.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventative actions as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease-and-desist
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
   2.   The term “significant non-compliance” is defined as follows:
      A.   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant
parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily
maximum limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (one point four for BOD,
TSS, oil and grease, and one point two for all other pollutants except pH);
      B.   Any other discharge violation that the City believes has caused,
alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through
(including endangering the health of City personnel or the general public);
      C.   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the City’s exercise of its
emergency authority to halt or prevent such as discharge;
      D.   Failure to meet, within 90 days after the scheduled date, a
compliance milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement
order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final
compliance;
      E.   Failure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports,
periodic self-monitoring report, and report on compliance with compliance
schedules;
      F.   Failure to accurately report non-compliance;
      G.   Any other violation(s) which the City determines will adversely
affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
97.17   SUSPENSION OF WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT.
   The Community Service Director may suspend a wastewater discharge permit for
good cause including, but not limited to, the following reasons:
   1.   Misrepresentation or failure to accurately report all relevant facts of
wastewater discharge;
   2.   Failure of the user to provide prior notification to the Community
Service Director of significantly changed conditions that would negatively
impact the operation of the City wastewater treatment facility;
   3.   Tampering with monitoring equipment;
   4.   Refusing to allow the Community Service Director timely access to the
facility premises and records;
   5.   Failure to meet effluent limitations and who is in significant non-
compliance;
   6.   Failure to report a significant upset, failure, or bypass of user’s
pretreatment facilities that would negatively impact the operation of the City
wastewater treatment facility;
   7.   Failure to pay fines, fees, or sewer user charges;
   8.   Failure to follow enforcement orders or meet compliance schedules;
   9.   Failure to correct a condition that impedes or alters the POTW’s
ability to monitor the user’s discharge or has the potential to cause
interference or pass through;
   10.   Falsifying self-monitoring reports;
   11.   Failure to complete a wastewater survey;
   12.   Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of business
ownership of a permitted facility;

the wastewater discharge permit or this chapter; or
   14.   Failure to cease discharging a waste with physical or chemical
characteristics which potentially cause interference or pass through.
Wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon cessation of operation or
transfer of business ownership. All wastewater discharge permits issued to a
particular user are void upon issuance of a new wastewater discharge permit to
that user.
97.18   INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
   When the Community Service Director finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provisions of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Community Service Director may request the Iowa District Court
for issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which
restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge
permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of
the user. The Community Service Director may also seek such other action as is
appropriate for legal or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user
to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall
not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a
user.
97.19   OTHER REMEDIES FOR VIOLATIONS.
   1.   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be
liable to the City for any damage, loss, cost, or expense occasioned by reason
of such violation.
   2.   For a violation of any of the provisions of this chapter, after
informal notice, the Community Service Director may:
      A.   Take necessary measures to correct and abate such violation, and the
Community Service Director is authorized to enter on private property to do so;
      B.   Order the service to the premises involved discontinued and
authorize the disconnection of any tapping or connection made to the wastewater
system of the City. In the event a violation of the provisions of this chapter
creates an immediate hazard to the wastewater facilities or to the operation
thereof, or to the health and safety of any person or to the preservation and
protection of any property, the Community Service Director is authorized and
directed to perform all necessary acts, without prior notice or hearing, to
correct and abate such violations and may enter on private property to do so.
   3.   The cost of any corrective measures required under the provisions of
this section shall be a lien on the property served by the wastewater
facilities in connection with which such violation has occurred and shall be
levied and collected by the Council as ordinary taxes.
   4.   In addition to any other remedies provided for in this chapter, the
City may bring suit to collect any sums due it, including user charges and cost
recovery charges, from the person or persons incurring the liability for the
payment of such charges.
97.20   EMERGENCY SUSPENSION.
   The Community Service Director may immediately suspend a user’s discharge
after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to
stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or
cause imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons.
The Community Service Director may also immediately suspend a user’s discharge,
after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the
operation of the Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW), or which presents, or
may present, an endangerment to the environment.
   1.   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Community Service
Director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance
of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize significant damage that would
negatively impact the operation of the City wastewater treatment facility, its
receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Community Service
Director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Community Service Director that the
period of endangerment has passed, unless termination proceedings are initiated
against the user.
   2.   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and measures taken to prevent
any future occurrence, to the Community Service Director prior to the date of
any show cause or termination hearing. Nothing in this section shall be
interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this
section.
97.21   TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE.
   In addition to the provisions in Section
97.14, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge
termination:
   1.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
   2.   Failure to report significant changes in operation or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
   3.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose of
inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
   4.   Violation of the pretreatment standards.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be
offered an opportunity to show cause why the proposed action should not be
taken. Exercise of this option by the Community Service Director shall not be a
bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
97.22   CIVIL PENALTIES.
   Any user who violates any provisions of this chapter or any order or permit
issued hereunder, shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than
$1,000.00 for each violation plus actual damages incurred by the Publicly Owned
Treatment Works (POTW) per violation per day for as long as the violation
continues. Each day in which such violation shall continue shall be deemed a
separate offense. In addition to the above-described penalty and damages, the
Community Service Director may recover reasonable attorney’s fees, court costs,
and other expenses associated with the enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses.
97.23   CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   1.   Any user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this
chapter or any orders or permits issued hereunder shall be in violation of this
Code of Ordinances, and each day in which any such violation continues shall be
deemed a separate offense.
   2.   Any user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or
certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other document
files or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter, or wastewater
discharge permit, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders
inaccurate, any monitoring device or method required under this chapter shall
be in violation of this Code of Ordinances, and each day in which any such
violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense.
97.24   REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE.
   The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The Community
Service Director may take any, all, or any combination of the actions against a
noncompliant user. However, the Community Service Director may take further
action against any user when circumstances warrant. Further, the Community
Service Director is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against
any noncompliant user.

98.01   BASIS FOR CHARGES.
   The wastewater service charge for the use of and for service supplied by the
wastewater facilities of the City shall consist of a basic user charge for
operation and maintenance plus replacement and local capital financing charge
and a surcharge, if applicable. The user charge shall be based on water usage
as recorded by water meters or sewage meters for wastes having the following
normal domestic wastewater concentrations: (i) average day, 20ºC biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD) of 200 mg/l; (ii) a suspended solids (SS) content of 240
mg/l; (iii) an ammonia-nitrogen (NH 3 N) content of 40 mg/l; (iv) an oil and
grease content of 100 mg/l; and (v) a sulfate content of 1,500 mg/l. It shall
consist of operation and maintenance costs plus replacement and shall be
computed as follows:
   1.   Estimate wastewater characteristics by volume, pounds of SS, pounds of
BOD, pounds of NH 3 N and pounds of oil and grease to be treated, and customer
bills to be sent.
   2.   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and maintain
the wastewater facilities including a replacement fund for the year, for all
works categories.
   3.   Proportion the estimated costs to wastewater facility categories by
volume, SS, BOD, ammonia-nitrogen (NH 3 N), oil and grease, and customer.
   4.   Develop unit rates for volume, BOD, SS, and NH 3 N, and oil and grease
by dividing estimated costs in the Subsection 3 by estimated wastewater
characteristics in Subsection 1.
   5.   Compute costs per 1,000 gallons for normal domestic wastewater.
   6.   Compute surcharge factor for multiplying time costs per 1,000 gallons
for BOD, SS, NH 3 N, and oil and grease in excess of normal domestic
wastewater. A surcharge will also be assessed for heavy metals or toxics that
exceed acceptable limits. The charge will be determined according to the toxic
or heavy metals involved.
98.02   CONNECTION CHARGE.
   A sewer connect charge shall be assessed for each new, replaced, or altered
building sewer that is connected to the public sanitary sewer system. The
connection fee shall be charged to all making new connections, reconnections,
or alterations to the public sewer system for new development or redevelopment.
This does not apply to repairs, alterations, or reconnections that do not
change use, location, or volume discharged to the public sanitary sewer system.
98.03   SURCHARGE FACTOR.
   A surcharge factor shall be levied for the following customers whose
wastewaters exceed normal domestic wastewater:
 
CUSTOMER TYPE                                                  SURCHARGE FACTOR
Laundry, including industrial laundries, commercial laundries, 1.2

98.04   CONNECTION FEE.
   The connection fee shall be a minimum of the number of units times the
Single-Family Equivalent (SFE) times $300.00, or according to a formula
developed by the City based on a proportions charge such as cost per acre, cost
per lot, or flow requirement.
98.05   CONNECTION FEE FOR SINGLE-FAMILY EQUIVALENT.
   The connection fee for each Single-Family Equivalent connection will be
$300.00.
98.06   SINGLE-FAMILY EQUIVALENT.
   The Single-Family Equivalent for each type of use shall be as follows:
USE SINGLE-FAMILY EQUIVALENT (SFE)
USE                                SINGLE-FAMILY EQUIVALENT (SFE)

For any proposed use not listed in the above table the Single-Family Equivalent
(SFE) shall be determined by the City Engineer from documented water usage for
similar uses divided by 350 gallons per day per each Single-Family Equivalent.
98.07   ANNUAL REVIEW.
   The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be reviewed annually by
the City. The wastewater service charge shall be revised periodically to
reflect a change in debt service and other local capital financing costs or a
change in operation and maintenance costs including replacement costs.
98.08   MEASUREMENT OF FLOW.
   The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges and local capital
financing charges shall be the metered water consumption read to the lowest
even increment of 1,000 gallons.
   1.   If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures any
part, or all, of said person’s water from sources other than the Municipal
Water Department, all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers,
the person shall install and maintain, at said person’s expense, water meters
of a type approved by the authorized City representative for the purposes of
determining the volume of water obtained from these other sources.
   2.   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required by
the authorized City representative if these volumes cannot otherwise be
determined from the metered water consumption records.
   3.   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned, and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is canceled,
without the consent of the authorized City representative.
98.09   CHARGES HEREIN TO TAKE PRECEDENCE.
   The wastewater service charges established herein shall take precedence over
any terms or conditions of agreements or contracts between the City and users
which are inconsistent with the requirements of Section 204(b)(1)(a) of the
Federal Act and the corresponding regulations.
98.10   RATE.
   The wastewater service charge for all customers will be $10.98 per 1,000
gallons, and a service base rate of $5.50.
98.11   PAYMENT OF BILLS.
   All sewer service charges are due and payable under the same terms and
conditions provided for payment of a combined service account as contained in
Section 92.04. Sewer service may be discontinued or disconnected in accordance
with the provisions contained in Section 92.05 if the combined service account
becomes delinquent, and the provisions continued in Section 92.08 relating to
lien notices shall also apply in the event of a delinquent account.
98.12   LIEN FOR NONPAYMENT.
   Except as provided for in Section
92.07, the owner of the premises served and any lessee or tenant thereof shall
be jointly and severally liable for sewer service charges to the premises.
Sewer service charges remaining unpaid and delinquent shall constitute a lien
upon the property or premises served and shall be certified by the Clerk to the
County Treasurer for collection in the same manner as property taxes.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
98.13   FORECLOSURE OF LIEN.
   Property subject to a lien for unpaid charges shall be sold for nonpayment
of the same, and the proceeds of the sale shall be applied to pay the charges,
after deducting costs, as is the case in the foreclosure of statutory liens.
Such foreclosure shall be by bill-in-equity in the name of the City. The City
is hereby authorized and directed to institute such proceedings in any court
having jurisdiction over such matters against any property for which the bill
has remained unpaid.
98.14   REVENUES.
   All revenues and moneys derived from the operation of the sewerage system
and wastewater treatment works shall be deposited in the wastewater account of
the wastewater fund. All such revenues and moneys shall be held by the Clerk
separate and apart from private funds and separate and apart from all other
funds of the City and all of said sum, without any deductions whatever, shall
be delivered to the Clerk not more than 10 days after receipt of the same, or
at such more frequent intervals as may, from time to time, be directed by the
Council. The Clerk shall receive all revenues from the sewerage system and
wastewater treatment works and all other funds and moneys incident to the
operation of such system as the same may be delivered to the Clerk and deposit
the same in the account of the fund designated as the “Sanitation Fund of the
City.” The Clerk shall administer such fund in every respect in the manner
provided by statute of the Iowa Administrative Code.
98.15   ACCOUNTS.

made of all transactions relative to the sewerage system and wastewater
treatment works, and at regular annual intervals shall cause to be made an
audit by an independent auditing concern of the books to show the receipts and
disbursements of the sewerage system. In addition to the customary operating
statements, the annual audit report shall also reflect the revenues and
operating expenses of the wastewater facilities, including a replacement cost,
to indicate that the wastewater service charges do in fact meet these
regulations. In addition to the proper system of accounts established for the
transactions relating to the sewerage system and wastewater treatment works a
Sewer Replacement Fund shall be established specifically for direct costs
related to replacement of capital equipment. The City shall deposit into the
Sewer Replacement Fund on an annual basis a minimum of $62,500.00, or an amount
to be calculated by the staff and approved by the Council.

Connection Fee District
 
99.01   PURPOSE.
   The City has determined the necessity of establishing a policy and a
procedure to be utilized to recover the cost of design and construction of
major sanitary sewer facilities in those instances in which a significant
number of the properties to be benefited by such facilities are not
sufficiently developed to permit the recovery of those costs through the
special assessment process as provided in Chapter 384, Division IV of the Code
of Iowa. The City hereby declares its intent to utilize connection fees, as
herein provided, to recover the costs for design and construction of such major
sanitary sewer facilities from property owners who connect to such facilities
subsequent to their construction.
99.02   INTENT.
   It is the intent of this chapter to set forth the method of recovery of
proportional cost shares from those property owners who connect their
properties to major sanitary sewer facilities subsequent to their construction,
so that in the event that all property, other than street and road right-of-
way, which lies within the benefited district is connected to the major
sanitary sewer facilities during their expected useful life, then those
properties shall bear, in the aggregate, up to 100 percent of the cost for
design and construction of such facilities, including legal, administrative,
and interest expenses associated therewith.
99.03   PROCEDURE.
   1.   In the event the Council determines the necessity for construction of a
major sanitary sewer facility, and determines that the utilization of a
connection fee is the most equitable manner in which to recover the City’s
costs associated therewith, the Council shall cause a “Notice of Public Hearing
on the Proposed Adoption of an Ordinance to Establish a Benefited District and
a Connection Fee Schedule” to be published in a newspaper of general
circulation within the City as hereafter provided. In addition to indicating
the date, time, and place of the public hearing, the notice shall:
      A.   Indicate the nature and extent of the major sanitary sewer facility
or facilities under consideration for construction, as well as the estimated
cost or costs for the design and construction of same;
      B.   Identify by general description the proposed benefited district to
be served by the major sanitary sewer facility or facilities; and
      C.   Set forth the proposed yearly schedule of connection fees to be paid
by property owners within the benefited district who connect to said
facilities, expressed in dollars per acre of land area served.
   The notice shall also state that the proposed connection fee ordinance is on
file, along with a service area map of the area to be served, and both are
available for public inspection in the office of the Clerk. The notice shall be
published not more than 45 days and not less than 20 days prior to the
scheduled date of the public hearing, and shall be mailed to each property
owner within the benefited district as shown by the records of the County
Auditor.
   2.   At the public hearing, the owners of property within the proposed
benefited district shall be heard and may offer comments or objections as to:
      A.   The necessity for the project;
      B.   The calculation of the area benefited by the proposed major sanitary
sewer facilities;
      C.   The estimated cost of the proposed facilities;
      D.   The proposed per acre connection fee; and
      E.   The graduated yearly connection fee schedule.
   3.   Upon concluding the hearing, the Council shall rule upon the objections
presented during the hearing and may consider the adoption of the proposed
connection fee ordinance. Upon consideration of the proposed connection fee
ordinance, the Council may:
      A.   Adopt the ordinance as proposed;
      B.   Delete elements or portions of the proposed major sanitary sewer
facilities from the proposed project and the properties served thereby from the
benefited district proposed; or
      C.   Amend the ordinance to revise the connection fee schedule.
   4.   The connection fee ordinance may provide, at the Council’s discretion,
that single-family residences within the benefited district, in existence or
under construction upon the effective date of the ordinance, and located within
the corporate limits of the City, are eligible for connection to the major
sanitary sewer facility. In that event, the ordinance shall include the
following provisions:
      A.   That the owners of residences on parcels of less than one acre in
size located within the City may connect such residences to the major sanitary
sewer facility upon approval of their application for connection, payment of
the connection fee for the parcel, and construction, at the owner’s expense, of
appropriate connection structures, as determined necessary by the Public Works
Director.
      B.   That the owners of residences on parcels in excess of one acre in
size located within the City may connect such residences to the major sanitary
sewer facility upon approval of their application for connection, subdivision
of said parcel into a residence parcel and an outlot, payment of the connection
fee for the residence parcel, and construction, at the owner’s expense, of
appropriate connection structures, as determined necessary by the Public Works
Director.
      C.   The connection fee ordinance may also provide, at the Council’s
discretion, that sanitary sewer service can be provided to recreational and
park facilities in the same manner and under the same procedures set forth in
this section for single-family residences within the benefited district.
   All other property located within the corporate limits of the City and
within a benefited district shall be eligible for connection to the major
sanitary sewer facility upon approval of an application for connection by the
owner thereof, as hereafter provided, and payment of the connection fee for
such property, provided such property has been appropriately subdivided for
development, and, where applicable, all sanitary sewer improvements necessary
to serve said property have been constructed, at the owner’s expense, and
accepted by the City.
   5.   After adoption, publication, and recording by the Clerk of a connection
fee ordinance for a benefited district, all owners of those properties within
the benefited district whose properties are eligible for connection, and who
propose to connect such properties directly or indirectly to the major sanitary
sewer facility, shall make application to the City for such connection. The
submittal of construction plans to the City for sanitary sewer improvements on
property being subdivided for development shall constitute an application to
the City for purposes of this chapter. The sewer connection fee shall be due
and payable at the time application is made to the City for connection to the
major sanitary sewer facility. No connection shall be made to a major sanitary
sewer facility until such application has been approved and until the required
connection fee has been paid. The sewer connection fee shall be paid before the
City will approve the final plat of property subject to the sewer connection
fee.
   6.   The sewer connection fee shall be in an amount equal to the maximum
acre area of contiguous property, or fraction thereof, within the benefited
district under common ownership which can be lawfully served through such
proposed connection, multiplied by the per acre connection fee established in
the connection fee ordinance for that benefited district. The connection fee
ordinance may provide for a graduated connection fee, with annual interest
adjustments, such that property owners who connect in later years pay interest
on the connection fee for their property. The rate of interest applicable to
the connection fee established in each benefited district shall not exceed the
rate of interest applicable to special assessments pursuant to Chapter 74A and
Section 384.60(3) of the Code of Iowa in effect on the date that the connection
fee was established for that district by enactment of a connection fee
ordinance.
   7.   The sewer connection fee required by this chapter shall be due and
payable to the Clerk and is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other fees
for connection required under the plumbing code or other provisions of this
Code of Ordinances.
   8.   In the event any property owner connects their property within a
benefited district to a major sanitary sewer facility without having made
application therefor or without having received approval thereof or without
having paid the required connection fee established by a connection fee
ordinance, the City shall be entitled to disconnect such private sewer
connection until such time as the property owner has made and received approval
of their application, or has paid the required connection fee.
99.04   WEST SIDE SANITARY SEWER CONNECTION FEE DISTRICT.
   1.   The West Side Sanitary Sewer Connection Fee District is hereby
established, consisting of a tract of land in Sections 10, 14, 15, 22, 23, 24,

Connections Required
101.05 Approved Removal Procedure  
 
101.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to eliminate footing drain connections to the
sanitary sewer system by the establishment of procedures of notification and
procedures of removal for sanitary sewer system customers to disconnect the
footing drain from the sanitary sewer system within a specified period of time,
and to establish monthly surcharge payments for sanitary sewer system customers
with previous notification that fail to disconnect footing drains within a
specified period of time following the notification.
101.02   APPLICABILITY.
   This chapter shall be applicable to all properties located within the
corporate boundaries of the City that are not currently connected to a public
storm sewer system or public footing drain collection system.
101.03   NOTIFICATION PROCEDURE.
   The Community Services Director shall notify, by certified mail or other
method as approved by the Council, sanitary sewer system customers that
directly or indirectly connect footing drains, foundation drains, roof
downspouts, sump pumps, sump pits, or similar systems or devices to the
sanitary sewer system. The notification shall mandate that disconnection from
the sanitary sewer system is required within the specified period of time and
installation of a sump pump pit, sump pump, discharge line, and connection to a
public storm sewer system or public footing drain collection system is
required.
101.04   REMOVAL OF FOOTING DRAIN CONNECTIONS REQUIRED.
   All direct or indirect connections of a footing drain, foundation drain,
roof downspouts, sump pump, sump pit, or similar system or device intended to
collect and convey groundwater along, adjacent to, beside or under the footing,
foundation, or basement of any building shall be disconnected from the sanitary
sewer system within 180 days after the notification by the Community Services
Director. Disconnection shall mean removal of any direct or indirect connection
to the sanitary sewer system, including direct connections to the sanitary
sewer service, connections to a sanitary sewer floor drain or similar plumbing
fixture that would allow footing drain flow to enter the sanitary sewer system.
101.05   APPROVED REMOVAL PROCEDURE.
   The approved removal procedure for a direct or indirect footing drain
connection to the sanitary sewer system under this chapter must fully comply
with the following:
   1.   Prior Inspection. Prior to any work on the removal or disconnection of
the footing drain connection, the existing connection must be inspected by the
City. The sanitary sewer system customer shall be responsible to schedule the
inspection.
   2.   Approved System. An approved system for the removal of footing drain
connections must be used. The approved system shall consist of a sump pump and
sump pit with a discharge to an approved storm sewer connection, an approved
footing drain collection connection, or an approved yard location.
   3.   Plugging of Existing Connection. Any direct or indirect connection
between the footing drain and the sanitary sewer system of the building shall
be permanently plugged.
   4.   Construction Inspection. Upon installation of the sump pump pit, sump
pump, and plumbing connections, and prior to installation of the concrete
floor, the sanitary sewer customer shall be responsible to schedule a City
inspection of the completed work.
   5.   Floor Drain Connection Prohibited. The new system shall be installed in
such a manner that direct or indirect flow from the footing drain to a floor
drain shall not be possible.
   6.   Post-Construction Inspection. The installation of the sump pump and
associated facilities work shall be inspected by the City. The sanitary sewer
customer shall be responsible to schedule the post-construction inspection.
101.06   NON-COMPLIANCE FEE FOR FOOTING DRAIN CONNECTION.
   Any sanitary sewer customer with a direct or indirect footing drain
connection to the sanitary sewer system, being properly notified as described
under Section
101.03, and remaining in place 180 days after said notification, shall be
subject to a monthly surcharge of $100.00 for potential un-metered flow
contributed to the sanitary sewer system. The payment will be in addition to
all other sanitary sewer user charges.
101.07   REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION.
   There is a presumption that all sanitary sewer customers receiving
notification have a footing drain connection to the sanitary sewer system as
prohibited under this chapter. Effective 180 days after notification that
properties that have not completed an approved removal procedure or other
equivalent removal procedure inspected and documented by the City shall be
presumed to have a footing drain connection for purposes of this chapter.
101.08   REFUND OF NON-COMPLIANCE FEE.
   Any property owner subject to the non-compliance fee under this chapter may
request the City to inspect the sanitary sewer service. If the City determines
there was no direct or indirect footing drain connection as of the date of non-
compliance, the City shall refund all un-metered flow payments collected. In
the event the City determines a footing drain disconnection was completed and
the footing drain connection no longer exists, the City shall discontinue the
imposition of the un-metered flow charges for that sanitary sewer customer and
shall refund previous non-compliance fee payments. Such refund shall be limited
to the number of monthly payments made or three months, whichever is smaller.
101.09   INSPECTION AND NOTICE.
   The City may conduct periodic inspections of properties to confirm there are
no direct or indirect connections of the footing drain to the sanitary sewer
system. If during an inspection the City determines there is a direct or
indirect connection as a result of a modification of the system to allow for a
direct or indirect connection, failure to maintain or replace a failed sump
pump that would allow an indirect or direct connection to the sanitary sewer
system, or such other cause as may allow a direct or indirect connection, the
City shall provide the property owner a written notice. The property owner
shall be provided 30 days to cure the defect and to arrange for a re-inspection
by the City. If at the end of 30 days the direct or indirect connection has not
been inspected and determined to have been removed, the property shall be
subject to the un-metered flow charge provisions under this chapter. The
payment shall continue until such time as the City determines, through
inspection, the direct or indirect footing drain connection no longer exists.

cause the relocation of the Company installations or would minimize the cost or
expense of relocation of Company installations, the City and Company shall work
together to consider said alternative route, or construction method. The City
shall, in the extension or modification of streets and roads, make provision
for the placement of Company service lines and facilities on City-owned right-
of-way without charge to Company. In planning for the extension or modification
of streets, the City shall, to the extent practicable, design such changes to
limit the need for the relocation of Company facilities. The City shall be
responsible for surveying and staking the right-of-way for City projects that
require the Company to relocate Company facilities. If requested, the City
shall provide, at no cost to the Company, copies of the relocation plan and
profile and cross-section drawings. If tree or vegetation removals must be
completed by the City as part of the City’s project and are necessary whether
or not utility facilities must be relocated, the City, at its own cost, shall
be responsible for said removals. If the timing of said removals does not
coincide with Company’s facilities relocation schedule and the Company must
remove those materials that are included in the City’s portion of the project,
the City shall either remove the trees or vegetation or reimburse the Company
for the expenses incurred to remove them. If project funds from a source other
than the City are available to pay for the relocation of utility facilities,
the City shall attempt to secure said funds and provide them to the Company to
compensate the Company for the costs of relocation.
110.04   EXCAVATIONS.
   In making excavations in any streets, avenues, alleys, and public places for
the installation, maintenance, or repair of gas pipes, mains, conduit,
fixtures, accessories, or other appliances, the Company shall not unreasonably
obstruct the use of the streets. The Company in making such excavations shall,
if required by ordinance, obtain a City permit therefore and shall not
unnecessarily obstruct the use of streets, avenues, or alleys, shall provide
the City with 24 hours’ notice prior to the actual commencement of the work,
and shall comply with all provisions and requirements of the City in its
regulation of the use of City right-of-way in performing such work. In
emergencies which require immediate excavation, the Company may proceed with
the work without first applying for or obtaining the permit, provided, however,
that the Company shall apply for and obtain the excavation permit as soon as
possible after commencing such emergency work. The Company shall comply with
all provisions and requirements of the City in its regulation of the use of
City right-of-way in performing such work. To the extent not inconsistent with
this franchise, the Company shall comply with all City ordinances regarding
paving cuts, placement of facilities, and restoration of pavement and other
public infrastructure. The Company shall replace the surface, restoring the
condition as existed prior to the Company’s excavation, but shall not be

complete all repairs in a timely and prompt manner. Company agrees any
replacement of road surface shall conform to current City ordinances regarding
its depth and composition.

shall not deprive the Company of its right to operate and maintain existing
facilities and their replacements on, below, above, or beneath the vacated
property. Prior to the City abandoning or vacating any street, avenue, alley,
right-of-way, or public ground where the Company has installed gas lines,
mains, or facilities, the City shall grant the Company a utility easement for
said facilities.
110.06   RELOCATION NOT REQUIRED.

   Pursuant to relocation of Company facilities as may be required by Sections
100.04, 100.05, and 100.06, if the City orders or requests the Company to
relocate its existing facilities or equipment in order to directly facilitate
the project of a commercial or private developer or other non-public entity,
the City shall require the developer or non-public entity to reimburse the
Company for the cost of such relocation as a precondition to relocation of its
existing facilities or equipment. The Company shall not be required to relocate
in order to facilitate such private project at its expense.
110.08   CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Upon reasonable request, the Company shall provide the City, on a project
specific basis, information indicating the horizontal location, relative to
boundaries of the right-of-way, of all equipment which it owns or over which it
has control that is located in City right-of-way, including documents, maps,
and other information in paper or electronic or other forms (“Information”).
The Company and City recognize the Information may, in whole or part, be
considered a confidential record under State or federal law or both. Therefore,
the City shall not release any information without prior consent of the Company
and shall return the Information to Company upon request. City recognizes that
Company claims the Information may constitute a trade secret or is otherwise
protected from public disclosure by State or federal law on other grounds and
agrees to retain the Information in its non-public files. Furthermore, the City
agrees that no documents, maps, or information provided to the City by the
Company shall be made available to the public or other entities if such
documents or information are exempt from disclosure under the provisions of the
Freedom of Information Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Critical
Energy Infrastructure requirements pursuant to 18 CPR 388.112 and 388.113, or
Chapter 22 of the Code of Iowa, as such statutes and regulations may be amended
from time to time. In the event any action at law, in equity or administrative
is brought against the City regarding disclosure of any document which the
Company has designated as a trade secret or as otherwise protected from
disclosure, the City shall promptly notify the Company. The Company shall have
the right to assume, upon request of the City, the defense of said action. The
Company shall reimburse the City any and all cost, including attorney fees and
penalties to the extent allowed by law, which may result from any said action.
110.09   BRUSH AND TREES.
   The Company is granted the right to remove brush and trees from the right-
of-way or other locations where gas pipe or mains are located consistent with
the requirements of State or federal regulations.
110.10   INDEMNIFICATION.
   The Company shall indemnify, save, and hold harmless the City from any and
all claims, suits, losses, damages, costs, or expenses, including attorneys’
fees, on account of injury or damage to any person or property, to the extent
caused or occasioned, in whole or part, by the Company’s negligence in
construction, reconstruction, excavation, operation, or maintenance of the
natural gas distribution system authorized by this franchise; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be obligated to defend, indemnify, and save
harmless the City for any costs or damages to the extent arising, in whole or
part, from the negligence of the City, its officers, employees, or agents.
110.11   FRANCHISE FEE.

revenue generated from sales of natural and mixed gas by the Company within the
corporate limits of the City. The franchise fee shall be remitted by the
Company to the City on or before the last business day of the calendar quarter
following the close of the calendar quarter in which the franchise fee is
charged.
110.12   FEE REFUNDS.
   The Company shall not, under any circumstances, be required to return or
refund any franchise fees that have been collected from customers and remitted
to the City. In the event the Company is required to provide data or
information in defense of the City’s imposition of franchise fees or the
Company is required to assist the City in identifying customers or calculating
any franchise fee refunds for groups of or individual customers, the City shall
reimburse the Company for the expenses incurred by the Company to provide such
data or information.
110.13   BINDING FRANCHISE.
   This franchise shall apply to and bind the City and the Company and their
successors and assigns.
110.14   TERMINATION.
   Either City or Company (“party”) may terminate this franchise if the other
party shall be materially in breach of its provisions. Upon the occurrence of a
material breach, the non-breaching party shall provide the breaching party with
notification by certified mail specifying the alleged breach. The breaching
party shall have 60 days to cure the breach, unless it notifies the non-
breaching party, and the parties agree upon a longer period for cure. If the
breach is not cured within the cure period, the non-breaching party may
terminate this franchise. A party shall not be considered to be in breach of
this franchise if it has operated in compliance with State or federal law. A
party shall not be considered to have breached this franchise if the alleged
breach is the result of the actions of a third party or the other party.
110.15   SEVERABILITY.
   If any of the provisions of this franchise chapter are for any reason
declared to be illegal or void, the lawful provisions of this franchise
chapter, which are severable from said unlawful provisions, shall be and remain

111.01   FRANCHISE GRANTED.
   There is hereby granted to MidAmerican Energy Company, a State corporation,
hereinafter called the “Company,” and its successors and assigns, the right and
non-exclusive franchise to acquire, construct, erect, maintain, and operate in
the City of Altoona, Iowa, hereinafter called the “City,” a system for the
transmission and distribution of electric energy and communications signals
along, under, over, and upon the streets, avenues, alleys, and public places to
serve customers within and without the City, and to furnish and sell electric
energy to the City and its inhabitants. For the term of this franchise, the
Company is granted the right of eminent domain, the exercise of which is
subject to Council approval upon application by the Company. This franchise
shall be effective for a 25-year period from and after the effective date of
the ordinance codified by this chapter, however, that either the City or the
Company may, during the first 90 days following the tenth, fifteenth, and
twentieth anniversaries of the effective date of the franchise, provide written
notice to the other party of its desire to amend the franchise. The parties
shall negotiate these amendments in good faith for a period of up to 90 days
following receipt of notice. If, at the conclusion of the negotiation period,
the City determines in good faith that the franchise, if continued without
amendment, will have a material or significant adverse impact on the City or
the Company’s electric customers located within the corporate limits of the
City, the City may terminate the franchise. The City shall have the burden to
objectively demonstrate the material or significant adverse impact. Failure to
amend the franchise at the first option does not render invalid the City’s
second option to amend the franchise. † 7

   The rights and privileges hereby granted are subject to the restrictions and
limitations of Chapter 364 of the Code of Iowa 2011, or as subsequently amended

111.03   POLES AND WIRES.
   The Company shall have the right to erect all necessary poles and to place
thereon the necessary wires, fixtures, and accessories as well as excavate and
bury conductors for the distribution of electric energy and communications
signals in and through the City, but all said conduits and poles shall be
placed as not to unreasonably interfere with the construction of any water
pipes, drain or sewer, or the flow of water there from, which have been or may
hereafter be located by authority of the City.
111.04   TRIMMING TREES.
   The Company is authorized and empowered to prune or remove, at Company
expense, any tree extending into any street, alley, or public grounds to
maintain electric reliability, safety, to restore utility service and to

facilities of the Company. The pruning and removal of trees shall be done in
accordance with current nationally accepted safety and utility industry
standards and federal and State law, rules, and regulations.
111.05   CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE.
   The Company shall, excluding facilities located in private easements
(whether titled in Company exclusively or in Company and other entities), in
accordance with State law including Company’s tariff on file with and made
effective by the Iowa Utilities Board as may subsequently be amended
(“Tariff”), at its cost and expense, locate and relocate its existing
facilities or equipment in, on, over, or under any public street or alley in
the City in such a manner as the City may reasonably require for the purposes
of facilitating the construction, reconstruction, maintenance, or repair of the
street or alley of such street or alley. The City and the Company shall work
together to develop a suitable alternative route or construction method so as
to eliminate or minimize the cost and expense to the Company of relocation of
Company installations. The City shall be responsible for surveying and staking
the right-of-way for City projects that require the Company to relocate Company
facilities. If requested, the City shall provide, at no cost to the Company,
copies of the relocation plan and profile and cross-section drawings. If tree
removals must be completed by the City as part of the City’s project and are
necessary whether or not utility facilities must be relocated, the City, at its
own cost, shall be responsible for said removals. If the timing of the tree
removals does not coincide with the Company facilities relocation schedule and
the Company must remove trees that are included in the City’s portion of the
project, the City shall either remove the trees or reimburse the Company for
the expenses incurred to remove said trees. If project funds from a source
other than the City are available to pay for the relocation of utility
facilities, the City shall attempt to secure said funds and provide them to the
Company to compensate the Company for the costs of relocation.
111.06   EXCAVATIONS.
   In making excavations in any streets, avenues, alleys, and public places for
the installation, maintenance, or repair of conductor, conduits, or the
erection of poles and wires or other appliances, the Company shall not
unreasonably obstruct the use of the streets, and shall replace the surface,
restoring the condition as existed prior to the Company excavation. The Company
shall not be required to restore or modify public right-of-way, sidewalks, or
other areas in or adjacent to the Company project to a condition superior to
its immediate previously existing condition or to a condition required for the
City to comply with City, State, or federal rules, regulations, or law. Company
agrees any replacement of road surface shall conform to current Code of
Ordinances regarding its depth and composition.
111.07   UTILITY EASEMENTS.
   Vacating a street, avenue, alley, public ground, or public right-of-way
shall not deprive the Company of its right to operate and maintain existing
facilities on, below, above, or beneath the vacated property. Prior to the City
abandoning or vacating any street, avenue, alley, or public ground where the
Company has electric facilities in the vicinity, the City shall provide Company
with not less than 60 days’ advance notice of the City’s proposed action and,
upon request, grant the Company a utility easement covering existing and future
facilities and activities. If the City fails to grant the Company a utility
easement for said facilities prior to abandoning or vacating a street, avenue,
alley, or public ground, the City shall, at its cost and expense, obtain
easements for existing Company facilities.
111.08   RELOCATION NOT REQUIRED.
   The Company shall not be required to relocate, at its cost and expense,
Company facilities in the public right-of-way that have been relocated at
Company expense at the direction of the City in the previous five years.

   Pursuant to relocation of Company facilities as may be required by Sections
111.03,
111.05,
111.06,
111.07, and
111.08, if the City orders or requests the Company to relocate its existing
facilities or equipment in order to facilitate the project of a commercial or
private developer or other non-public entity, the City shall reimburse, or the
City shall require the developer or non-public entity to reimburse, the Company
for the cost of such relocation as a precondition to relocation of its existing
facilities or equipment. The Company shall not be required to relocate in order
to facilitate such private project at its expense.
111.10   INDEMNIFICATION.
   The Company shall indemnify and save harmless the City from any and all
claims, suits, losses, damages, costs or expenses, on account of injury or
damage to any person or property, to the extent caused or occasioned by the
Company’s negligence in construction, reconstruction, excavation, operation, or
maintenance of the electric facilities authorized by this franchise; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be obligated to defend, indemnify, and save
harmless the City for any costs or damages to the extent arising from the
negligence of the City, its officers, employees, or agents.
111.11   INFORMATION.
   Upon reasonable request, the Company shall provide the City, on a project
specific basis, information indicating the horizontal location, relative to
boundaries of the right-of-way, of all equipment which it owns or over which it
has control that is located in City right-of-way. The Company and City
recognize the information provided will, under current State law, constitute
public records, but that nonetheless, some information provided will be
confidential under State or federal law, or both. Therefore, the City shall not
release any information with respect to the location or type of equipment which
the Company owns or controls in the right-of-way which may constitute a trade
secret, or which may otherwise be protected from public disclosure by State or
federal law. Furthermore, the City agrees that no documents, maps, or
information provided to the City by the Company shall be made available to the
public or other entities if such documents or information are exempt from
disclosure under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission Critical Energy Infrastructure requirements
pursuant to 18 CFR 388.112 and 388.113, or Chapter 22 of the Code of Iowa, as
such statutes and regulations may be amended from time to time.

accordance with the applicable regulations of the Iowa Utilities Board ,or its
successors, and State law.

applicable regulations of the Iowa Utilities Board, the Company’s tariff and
made effective by the Iowa Utilities Board, or its successors, and State law.
111.14   FRANCHISE FEE.
   There is hereby imposed upon and shall be collected from the retail electric
customers of the Company receiving service, pursuant to the Tariff, located
within the corporate limits of the City and remitted by the Company to the
City, a franchise fee from each customer class as set forth below of the gross
receipts, minus uncollectable amounts, derived by the Company from the delivery

City.
   1.   Residential Customers   five percent.
   2.   Non-Residential Customers   five percent.
111.15   FEE EXEMPTIONS.
   The City may, as allowed by State law, exempt customer classes of sales from
imposition of the franchise fee, or modify, decrease, or eliminate the
franchise fee. The City reserves the right to cancel any or all the franchise
fee exemptions and also reserves the right to grant exemptions to customer
classes in compliance with State law and Section
111.16 of this chapter. The City does therefore exempt the customer classes or
customer groups shown below franchise fees.
   1.   Customer classes initially exempted by the City.
111.16   MODIFYING FEES.
   The City agrees to modify the level of franchise fees imposed only once in
any 24-month period. Any such ordinance exempting classes of customers,
increasing, decreasing, modifying, or eliminating the franchise fee shall
become effective, and billings reflecting the change shall commence on an
agreed upon date which is not less than 60 days following written notice to the
Company by certified mail. The Company shall not be required to implement such
new ordinance unless and until it determines that it has received appropriate
official documentation of final action by the Council.
111.17   COLLECTION OF FEES.
   The City recognizes the administrative burden collecting franchise fees
imposes upon the Company and the Company requires lead time to commence
collecting said franchise fees. The Company will commence collecting franchise
fees on or before the first Company billing cycle of the first calendar month
following 90 days of receipt of information required of the City to implement
the franchise fee, including the City’s documentation of customer classes
subject to or exempted from City-imposed franchise fee. The City shall provide
the information and data required in a form and format acceptable to the
Company. The Company will, if requested by the City, provide the City with a
list of premises considered by the Company to be within the corporate limits of
the City.
111.18   IDENTIFYING CUSTOMERS.
   The City shall be solely responsible for identifying customer classes
subject to or exempt from paying the City imposed franchise fee. The City shall
be solely responsible for notifying Company of its corporate limits, including,
over time, annexations or other alterations thereto, and customer classes that
it wishes to subject to, or to the extent permitted by law, exempt from paying
the franchise fee. The City shall provide to the Company, by certified mail,
copies of annexation ordinances in a timely manner to ensure appropriate
franchise fee collection from customers within the corporate limits of the
City. The Company shall have no obligation to collect franchise fees from
customers in annexed areas until and unless such ordinances have been provided
to the Company by certified mail. The Company shall commence collecting
franchise fees in the annexed areas no sooner than 60 days after receiving
annexation ordinances from the City.
111.19   FRANCHISE FEE INDEMNIFICATION.

different level of franchise fees, or being exempt from the imposition of
franchise fees.
111.20   FEE REMITTANCE.
   The Company shall remit franchise fee revenues to the City no more
frequently than on or before the last business day of the month following each
quarter as follows.

   4.   October, November, and December.
MidAmerican shall provide City with notice at least 30 days in advance of any
changes made in this collection schedule, including any alterations in the
calendar quarters or any other changes in the remittance periods.
111.21   FEE ADMINISTRATION.
   The City recognizes that the costs of franchise fee administration are not
charged directly to the City and agrees it shall, if required by the Company,
reimburse the Company for any initial or ongoing costs incurred by the Company
in collecting franchise fees that Company deemed by negotiations by the City
and the Company to be in excess of typical costs of franchise fee
administration.
111.22   FEE REFUNDS.
   The Company shall not, under any circumstances, be required to return or
refund any franchise fees that have been collected from City customers and
remitted to the City. In the event the Company is required to provide data or
information in defense of the City’s imposition of franchise fees or the
Company is required to assist the City in identifying customers or calculating
any franchise fee refunds for groups of or individual customers, the City shall
reimburse the Company for the expenses incurred by the Company to provide such
data or information.
111.23   OBLIGATION TO COLLECT.
   The obligation to collect and remit the fee imposed by this chapter is
modified or repealed if:
   1.   Any other person is authorized to sell electricity at retail to City
consumers and the City imposes a franchise fee or its lawful equivalent at zero
or a lesser rate than provided in this chapter, in which case the obligation of
Company to collect and remit franchise fee shall be modified to zero or the
lesser rate;
   2.   The City adds additional territory by annexation or consolidation and
is unable or unwilling to impose the franchise fee upon all persons selling
electricity at retail to consumers within the additional territory, in which
case the franchise fee imposed on the revenue from sales by Company in the
additional territory shall be zero or equal to that of the lowest fee being
paid by any other retail seller of electricity within the City; or
   3.   Legislation is enacted by the Iowa General Assembly, or the Supreme
Court of Iowa issues a final ruling regarding franchise fees, or the Iowa
Utilities Board issues a final nonappealable order (collectively, “final
franchise fee action”) that modifies, but does not repeal, the ability of the
City to impose a franchise fee or the ability of Company to collect from City
customers and remit franchise fees to City. Within 60 days of final franchise
fee action, the City shall notify Company and the parties shall meet to
determine whether this ordinance can be revised, and, if so, how to revise the
franchise fee on a continuing basis to meet revised legal requirements. After
final franchise fee action and until passage by the City of revisions to the
franchise fee ordinance, Company may temporarily discontinue collection and
remittance of the franchise fee if, in its sole opinion, it believes it is
required to do so in order to comply with revised legal requirements.
111.24   OBLIGATION RELIEVED.
   The other provisions of this chapter, to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Company shall be completely relieved of its obligation to collect and remit to
the City the franchise fee as, effective as the date specified below with no
liability therefore under each of any of the following circumstances as
determined to exist in the sole discretion of Company:
   1.   Any of the imposition, collection, or remittance of a franchise fee is
ruled to be unlawful by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date of
such ruling or as may be specified by that Court.
   2.   The Iowa General Assembly enacts legislation making imposition,
collection, or remittance of a franchise fee unlawful, effective as of the date
lawfully specified by the General Assembly.
   3.   The Iowa Utilities Board, or its successor agency, denies the Company
the right to impose, collect, or remit a franchise fee provided such denial is
affirmed by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date of the final
agency order from which the appeal is taken.
111.25   TERMINATION.
   Either City or Company (“party”) may terminate this franchise if the other
party shall be materially in breach of its provisions. Upon the occurrence of a
material breach, the non-breaching party shall provide the breaching party with
notification by certified mail specifying the alleged breach. The breaching
party shall have 60 days to cure the breach, unless it notifies the non-
breaching party, and the parties agree upon a longer period for cure. If the
breach is not cured within the cure period, the non-breaching party may
terminate this franchise. A party shall not be considered to be in breach of
this franchise if it has operated in compliance with State or federal law. A
party shall not be considered to have breached this franchise if the alleged
breach is the result of the actions of a third party or the other party.

dealer are permitted by and are proposed to be conducted in compliance with all
zoning ordinances then in effect, and whether or not said premises meet all
other requirements of this chapter, this Code of Ordinances, and State law.
   3.   The Building Official, after examination of the premises, shall submit
an inspection report to the Clerk indicating whether or not the premises
inspected are approved. If the premises are disapproved, the Building Official
shall set forth in the report the reasons for disapproval. If the premises are

124.07   LICENSE ISSUANCE AND TERMS.
   1.   After approval of said application by the Building Official and receipt

dealer’s license and the Clerk shall also notify the Police Chief, Fire Chief,
and Building Official of the issuance of the license, the person to whom the

substantially screens the area in which junk is stored or deposited. The fence
must be kept in good repair and shall not be used for advertising displays or
signs. Suitable gates, likewise opaque, are required, which shall be closed and
locked after business hours or when the junkyard is unattended. A portion of

stacked higher than the fence within 30 feet of the fence. The Building
Official shall inspect the fences and gates of all junkyards on an annual
basis.
   2.   Variations from the requirements of this section may be granted as
follows:
      A.   If the perimeter of the junkyard is effectively blocked from public
view by natural terrain features or is substantially lower in elevation than
the surrounding terrain in a manner which renders thereby the opacity
requirements hereof ineffective, the Building Official may, upon application,
allow the substitution of a suitable fence in place of the solid opaque fence
required herein.
      B.   If two or more junkyards which otherwise meet the standards of this
chapter abut each other and are located on lots adjoining each other, the
fencing requirement of this chapter shall be waived by the Building Official
for such common boundary so long as the common boundary continues to exist.
      C.   If the junkyard that is the subject of the application abuts against
an opaque fence which meets the fencing requirements, or an opaque structure
which is not less than six feet high, the fencing requirement of this section
shall be waived by the Building Official for such common boundary.
124.09   GENERAL OPERATING REQUIREMENTS.
   The following general operating requirements shall apply to all junk dealers
in the City limits:
   1.   The junkyard, and all things kept therein, shall be maintained in a

article the dealer has reason to believe has been stolen, or which is adversely

125.01   PURPOSE.
   State licensed massage therapists and businesses offering massage therapy
services perform an important service in addressing the health and wellbeing of
our citizens. Unfortunately, there are businesses that advertise they provide
massage therapy or other therapeutic services, but they are engaged in various
illegal activities which may include prostitution or human trafficking. This
chapter is not intended to discourage a legitimately licensed massage therapist
or massage therapy business from providing their services in the City. The
purpose of this chapter is to identify and address businesses that engage in
the practice of massage therapy without a license or are involved in illegal
activities which may include prostitution or human trafficking. Businesses
providing massage therapy yet conducting various types of illegal activity are
harmful to the City and the image of the massage therapy profession. Unlike
massage therapy, the State does not license reflexologists and reflexology
businesses in Section 152C of the Code of Iowa. Legitimate reflexologists and
businesses offering reflexology services perform an important service in
addressing the health and wellbeing of the City’s residents. Unfortunately,
there are businesses that advertise they provide reflexology services, but
actually engage in various illegal activities. This chapter is not intended to
discourage legitimate reflexologists or reflexology businesses from providing
their services in the City. The purpose of this chapter is to identify and
address businesses that engage in the practice of reflexology without a license
or are involved in illegal activities. Businesses providing reflexology yet
conducting various types of illegal activity are harmful to the City community
and the reflexology profession. The implementation of this chapter will better
enable the City to proactively screen, monitor, and remove businesses that are
engaged in illegal activity.
125.02   DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following words and phrases have the
meanings herein set forth, unless it is apparent from the context that a
different meaning is intended.
   1.   “License” means permission granted by competent authority to exercise a
certain privilege that, without such authorization, would constitute an illegal
act. The document that confers permission to a person to engage in massage
therapy shall be issued by the Iowa Board of Massage Therapy for the State;
massage therapy business licenses shall be issued by the City.
   2.   “Massage therapy business” means any place of business wherein any of
the treatments, techniques, or methods of treatment referred to in Subsection 5
are administered, practiced, used, given, or applied.
   3.   “Massage therapist” means a person licensed to practice the health care
service of the healing art of massage therapy under Chapter 152C of the Code of
Iowa.
   4.   “Massage patron” means any person who receives, or pays to receive, a
massage or massage services from a massage therapist for value.
   5.   “Massage therapy” means performance for compensation of massage,
myotherapy, massotherapy, bodywork, bodywork therapy, or therapeutic massage,
including hydrotherapy, superficial hot and cold applications, vibration and
topical applications, or other therapy which involves manipulation of the

the muscle tonus system for the purpose of enhancing health, muscle relaxation,
increasing range of motion, reducing stress, relieving pain, or improving
circulation.
   6.   “Reflexology business” means a place of business where only
“reflexology” is practiced or administered. Reflexology business does not mean
a massage therapy business where licensed massage therapists perform or
administer reflexology.

reflexology services from a reflexologist for value.

which is restricted to the hands, feet, or ears, performed by persons who do

therapy.

either exclusively or in connection with another business, without being
licensed by the City as provided in this chapter.
   2.   If a business is operating as a massage therapy business as defined in
this chapter and reflexology services are being provided by a licensed massage
therapist, the business falls under the provisions of a massage therapy
business under this chapter, and does not have to obtain a separate reflexology
business license.

136.03   REMOVAL OF SNOW, ICE, AND ACCUMULATIONS.
   1.   It is the responsibility of the abutting property owner to remove snow,
ice, and accumulations from the entire width and length of sidewalk located
between the back of the public street curb, or, in the absence of a curb, the
edge of the public street pavement, to the property owner’s actual property
line or in an area on private property that is dedicated, as indicated on the
plat of record, for the use of pedestrian traffic, excluding bike paths within
24 hours following the cessation of the weather event by which they were
deposited, as defined by the National Weather Service or other event by which
they were deposited, provided, however, that in extraordinary weather
circumstances the Public Works Director may extend the period of time provided
herein. In those situations the Public Works Director will deliver to
representative news media a statement indicating the amount of additional time
the property owners shall have to remove accumulations from sidewalks. The
abutting property owner may be liable for damages caused by failure to remove
snow, ice, and accumulations promptly from the sidewalk.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12(2)(b) and (e))
   2.   In instances where a property owner has a sidewalk adjacent to both the
front and rear of the property and the rear sidewalk is shared by adjoining
property owners, the owner with two sidewalks is only responsible for the
removal of snow, ice, and accumulations in the front area. The owner who has
adjoining property, in this situation, would be responsible for removal of
snow, ice, and accumulations on the sidewalks in the rear area.
   3.   If both properties have both a front area and a rear area sidewalk,
both adjoining property owners are mutually responsible for removal of snow,
ice, and accumulations on the sidewalk in the rear area.
   4.   When accumulations have formed upon any sidewalk so that it cannot be
reasonably removed, such as ice or packed down snow, the abutting property
owner shall keep and maintain such accumulations sprinkled with fine cinders,
sand, or deicing chemicals in such a manner as to provide traction and prevent
the sidewalk from being dangerous to persons using the same for the entire
width and length. This subsection is not to be construed as a substitute for
the removal of accumulations and only applies when accumulations cannot be
reasonably removed; however, all accumulations shall be removed as soon as
practical.
   5.   The Public Works Director or any peace officer shall enforce the
provisions of this section. If any snow, ice, or accumulations are not removed
as required above, including any extraordinary weather circumstances, within
the time designated by the Public Works Director, the Public Works Director or
any peace officer is authorized to issue a citation or may post notice to such
owner by placing written notice on the main entrance to the principle
structure, requiring the owner to remove snow, ice, and accumulations within 12
hours and, if such action is not completed within the time stated in the
notice, the Public Works Director may cause the work to be done and assess the
costs thereof as a special tax against the abutting property and collect the
same according to law.
136.04   PROPERTY OWNER’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAINTENANCE.
   It is the responsibility of the abutting property owners to repair, replace,
or reconstruct, or cause to be repaired, replaced, or reconstructed, all broken
or defective sidewalks and to maintain in a safe and hazard-free condition any
sidewalk outside the lot and property lines and inside the curb lines or
traveled portion of the public street. In instances where a property owner has
a sidewalk in both the front and rear yard and the rear sidewalk is shared by
adjoining property owners, the resident with two sidewalks is only responsible
to repair, replace or reconstruct, or cause to be repaired, replaced or
reconstructed, all broken or defective sidewalks in the front yard. The
resident who has the adjoining property, in this situation, would be
responsible for repairing, replacing or reconstructing, or cause to be
repaired, replaced, or reconstructed, all broken or defective sidewalks in the
rear yard.
136.05   CITY MAY ORDER REPAIRS.
   If the abutting property owner does not maintain sidewalks as required, the
Council may serve notice on such owner, by certified mail, requiring the owner
to repair, replace, or reconstruct sidewalks within a reasonable time and if
such action is not completed within the time stated in the notice, the Council
may require the work to be done and assess the costs against the abutting
property for collection in the same manner as a property tax.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12(2)(d) and (e))
136.06   SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION ORDERED.
   The Council may order the construction of permanent sidewalks upon any
street or court in the City and may specially assess the cost of such
improvement to abutting property owners in accordance with the provisions of
Chapter 384 of the Code of Iowa. The Council may waive required sidewalks on
property that does not extend to or connect with any other sidewalks in the
areas where development is not likely to occur. If development should occur,
the provisions of Chapter 384 of the Code of Iowa will be in effect upon
completion.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.38)
136.07   PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No person shall remove, reconstruct, or install a sidewalk unless such
person has obtained a permit from the City and has agreed in writing that said
removal, reconstruction, or installation will comply with all ordinances and
requirements of the City for such work.
136.08   SIDEWALK STANDARDS.
   Sidewalks repaired, replaced, or constructed under the provisions of this
chapter shall be of the following construction and meet the following
standards:

repair sidewalks.
   2.   Construction. Sidewalks shall be of one-course construction.
   3.   Sidewalk Base. Concrete may be placed directly on compact and well-

determined by the City.
   4.   Sidewalk Bed. The sidewalk bed shall be so graded that the constructed
sidewalk will be at an established grade.

   6.   Location. Residential sidewalks shall be located with the inner edge
(edge nearest the abutting private property) one foot from the property line,
unless the Council establishes a different distance due to special
circumstances.
   7.   Grade. Curb tops shall be on level with the centerline of the street,
which is the established grade.
   8.   Elevations. The street edge of a sidewalk shall be at an elevation even
with the curb at the curb or not less than one-half inch above the curb for
each foot between the curb and the sidewalk.
   9.   Slope. All sidewalks shall slope one-fourth inch per foot toward the
curb.
   10.   Finish. All sidewalks shall be finished with a broom finish or wood
float finish.
   11.   Curb Ramps and Sloped Areas for Persons with Disabilities. If a
street, road, or highway is newly built or reconstructed, a curb ramp or sloped
area shall be constructed or installed at each intersection of the street,
road, or highway with a sidewalk or path. If a sidewalk or path is newly built
or reconstructed, a curb ramp or sloped area shall be constructed or installed
at each intersection of the sidewalk or path with a street, highway, or road.
Curb ramps and sloped areas that are required pursuant to this subsection shall
be constructed or installed in compliance with applicable federal requirements
adopted in accordance with the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act,
including (but not limited to) the guidelines issued by the Federal
Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 216C.9)
136.09   BARRICADES AND WARNING LIGHTS.
   Whenever any material of any kind is deposited on any street, avenue,
highway, passageway, or alley when sidewalk improvements are being made or when
any sidewalk is in a dangerous condition, it shall be the duty of all persons
having an interest therein, either as the contractor or the owner, agent, or
lessee of the property in front of or along which such material may be
deposited, or such dangerous condition exists, to put in conspicuous places at
each end of such sidewalk and at each end of any pile of material deposited in
the street, a sufficient number of approved warning lights or flares, and to
keep them lighted during the entire night and to erect sufficient barricades
both at night and in the daytime to secure the same. The party or parties using
the street for any of the purposes specified in this chapter shall be liable
for all injuries or damage to persons or property arising from any wrongful act
or negligence of the party or parties, or their agents or employees or for any
misuse of the privileges conferred by this chapter or of any failure to comply
with provisions hereof.
136.10   FAILURE TO REPAIR OR BARRICADE.
   It is the duty of the owner of the property abutting the sidewalk, or the
owner’s contractor or agent, to notify the City immediately in the event of
failure or inability to make necessary sidewalk improvements or to install or
erect necessary barricades as required by this chapter.
136.11   INTERFERENCE WITH SIDEWALK IMPROVEMENTS.

137.03 Specifications 137.07 Grades
137.04 Costs          137.08 Damaged Culverts
 
137.01   PERMIT.
   It is illegal for any person to break out or remove a corporate curb along
any paved street, or to construct a private drive from an unpaved street,
without first obtaining a permit from the Clerk or Building Department. No such
permit shall have any force or effect unless approval shall be endorsed of the
fact on said permit by the Building Inspector.
137.02   PERMIT FEE.
   Before any permit is issued, the person who makes the application shall pay
a fee to the Clerk based upon the schedule of fees adopted by resolution of the
Council.
137.03   SPECIFICATIONS.
   1.   For lots less than 100 feet wide at the right-of-way line, no
automobile driveway for a single-family residential property shall be designed,
constructed, or maintained in the City that is more than 24 feet in width at
the sidewalk. For lots 100 feet wide or greater at the right-of-way line, a
single-family residential property automobile driveway may have a maximum width
of 12 feet per garage stall up to a total maximum width of 36 feet, except when
located on a cul-de-sac bulb where the maximum width remains 24 feet at the
sidewalk. No automobile driveway for a single-family residential property shall
be designed, constructed, or maintained in the City that is within four feet of
the throat of an intake to any sewer, unless otherwise approved by the City’s
engineering staff. For single-family residential lots 100 feet wide or greater
at the right-of-way line, a maximum of two driveways leading to the same lot,
or serving the same property will be allowed, but they shall be at least 20
feet apart. Between such driveways, the sidewalk zone shall be limited to the
use of pedestrians only.
   2.   In all cases where said permit has been granted, the concrete curb
shall be ground in accordance with the latest published versions of the Urban
Design Standards for Public Improvements and the Urban Standard Specifications
for Public Improvements and the driveway shall be paved by concrete extending
from the curb to the inside of the existing sidewalk line within 30 days from
the removal of the curb with not less than six inches of concrete. If it is
shown to the satisfaction of the Public Works Director that the existing
sidewalk has substantially the same strength as six inches of concrete, said
paving need only extend to the outside of the sidewalk line. All work is to be
done in a workmanlike manner, inspected and approved by the Public Works
Director. All driveway approaches shall be paved from the street to the
sidewalk according to the latest published versions of the Urban Design
Standards for Public Improvements and the Urban Standard Specifications for
Public Improvements. If there is no sidewalk, the approach shall extend to the
property line. The approach shall be inspected by the City.
137.04   COSTS.
   If, after 30 days after the concrete curb has been ground, the person so
doing fails or refuses to pave the driveway, as provided herein, the City shall
have the right to do so without notice, and assess the cost thereof, as a
special tax against the abutting property and collect the same according to
law.
137.05   DRIVEWAYS ON UNPAVED STREETS.
   When a permit has been granted to construct a private driveway from an
unpaved street, the person receiving said permit shall perform the necessary
grading and install a culvert, if required, constructed of either corrugated
iron or concrete with a minimum diameter of 15 inches and a maximum length of
24 feet, the permit holder to bear the cost of said culvert.
137.06   CULVERT REMOVAL.
   The Public Works Director is hereby empowered to order existing culverts
replaced which do not meet the requirements of Section 137.05 when the Public
Works Director deems the existing culvert will not satisfactorily carry away
run-off water.
137.07   GRADES.
   All culverts erected or replaced shall conform to the established ditch
grade, as determined by the engineer or Public Works Director.
137.08   DAMAGED CULVERTS.
   If the Public Works Director finds it necessary to replace damaged or
unsatisfactory culverts, the property owner shall be charged with the costs of
the same, and if not paid within 90 days from the date of completion of said
replacement, said cost shall be assessed as a special tax against the abutting
property and collected according to law.

Council within 30 days after the date the proposed vacation is referred to the
Commission.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 392.1)
138.03   NOTICE OF VACATION HEARING.

unless the Council finds that:
   1.   Public Use. The street, alley, portion thereof, or any public ground
proposed to be vacated is not needed for the use of the public, and therefore,
its maintenance at public expense is no longer justified.

CHAPTER 141
RIGHT-OF-WAY MANAGEMENT
 
141.01 Purpose              141.04 Franchise or License for Private or
                            Commercial Use
141.02 Administration       141.05 Appeal
141.03 Right-of-Way Permits  
 
141.01   PURPOSE.
   The City’s street and alley rights-of-way are owned or held by the City
primarily for the purpose of pedestrian and vehicular passage and for the
City’s provision of essential public safety services, including police, fire,
and emergency medical response services; and public health services, including
sanitary sewer, water, and storm drainage services. The City recognizes that it
holds the rights-of-way within its geographical boundaries as an asset in trust
for its citizens. The City has invested millions of dollars in public funds to
acquire, build, and maintain the right-of-way. Some organizations, by placing
their equipment in the right-of-way and charging the citizens of the City for
goods and services, are using for private gain this property held by the City
for the public good. Although such services are often necessary or convenient
for the citizens, such persons receive revenue or profit through their use of
public property. This chapter provides for the recovery of out-of-pocket and
projected costs from persons using the public rights-of-way. Finally, this
chapter provides for uniform procedures and standards for the franchising and
licensing of rights-of-way for private or commercial use.
141.02   ADMINISTRATION.
   The City Engineer shall be the principal City official responsible for the
administration of the rights-of-way; of right-of-way permits; of the
franchising and licensing of the use of rights-of-way; and of all sections of
this Code and related City ordinances. The City Engineer may delegate any or
all of their duties under this chapter.
141.03   RIGHT-OF-WAY PERMITS.
   1.   When working in public rights-of-way, permittees under this section
shall not unreasonably interfere with the safety, health, and convenience of
the public in the public’s use thereof for ordinary travel, nor shall they
interfere with public safety or public health services provided by the City to
its residents by means of the public rights-of-way.
   2.   Permittees shall acquire no right or interest in the right-of-way
allowing the continued use of the right-of-way for such purpose.
   3.   Permits Required.
      A.   Excavation Permit. An excavation permit shall be required for every
person who excavates in the right-of-way.
      B.   Obstruction Permit. An obstruction permit shall be required for
every person who undertakes activities in the right-of-way which will result in
the obstruction of vehicular or pedestrian traffic.
      C.   Irrigation System Permit. Underground irrigation systems are allowed
in right-of-way with the understanding that it is at the abutting property
owner’s risk and any repair of the irrigation system caused by maintenance of
utilities will be the responsibility of and at the abutting property owner’s
expense.
   4.   No person may excavate or obstruct the right-of-way beyond the date
specified in the permit unless they have been issued a new permit.
   5.   Permit Applications. Before any permit required by this chapter shall
be issued, an application shall be made to the City Engineer. A permit
application will be accepted only if all of the following conditions have been
met and the permit applicant has:

including the identity of and location in the right-of-way at which any
excavation is to be made.
            b.   The time when the work is to be commenced and the time it is

shall be in sufficient detail to identify the exact type of equipment to be
constructed or installed in the right-of-way, and the horizontal and vertical
location of such equipment within the right-of-way, with respect to right-of-
way or property lines and established monuments. Detailed plans and
specifications shall not be required for individual excavations, such as
individual water, sewer, gas, electric, or telephone connections to a building.
A simple sketch on the application form provided by the City, including the
dimensions of the proposed excavation in reference to permanent landmarks,
shall be provided for individual excavations.
   7.   Insurance Certificate. Applications for obstruction and excavation
permits shall be accompanied by an insurance certificate or to have one on file

permits, and obstruction permits shall be accompanied by a surety or
performance and maintenance bond, unless such bond has been previously filed
with the department and is still in effect.
   8.   Indemnification. All applications for a permit under this chapter shall
contain a stipulation that the applicant shall indemnify and hold harmless the
City from any and all costs, expenses, or liability for damages or injuries to
persons or property or liability of any kind whatsoever arising from or growing
out of any excavation or trench or surface restoration for which the permit is
issued.

be paid in full within 30 days of the issuance of the notice.
   10.   Permit Fees.
      A.   Schedule of Fees. To recover the costs incurred by the department in
managing the right-of-way, a schedule of fees shall be developed. The permit
fees to be paid in each instance shall be determined by the City Engineer,
shall be updated as needed prior to each construction season, and shall be
approved by the Council by resolution.
      B.   Fees Accumulated in Separate Fund. All fees collected under this
chapter shall be accumulated in a separate fund.
      C.   Fees Doubled During Probation. All permit fees shall be doubled
during a probationary period.
      D.   Refund after Revocation of Permit. Permit fees, which were paid in
connection with a permit which the City Engineer has revoked for a breach, are
not refundable.
   11.   Refusal to Issue Permit. The City Engineer may refuse to issue the
permits provided for in this chapter to any former permit holder who has
intentionally violated the sections of this Code relating to excavations in or
obstruction of any public right-of-way or who has failed to conform to the
requirements of any previously issued permit or who has violated the orders or
instructions of City officials issued pursuant to this chapter.
   12.   On-Site Exhibit of Permit; Contractor Identification Signage.
      A.   One copy of the permit required by this chapter shall be kept and
exhibited at every work site for which an excavation permit has been issued for
a period of five days or more.
      B.   Persons performing work pursuant to an excavation permit shall
display their name and telephone number on all motor vehicles and equipment,
including tractors, trailers, and wheeled equipment capable of being driven or
towed on the street. This shall not apply to personal or privately owned
vehicles used solely to transport workers to a job site or to rental vehicles
or equipment utilized in performing the work, if the name and telephone number
of the rental company appears on the vehicles or equipment. This information
shall be exhibited in at least two locations on the vehicle and shall be either
a temporary magnetic or permanent decal or painted lettering of a type and
size, and with a contrasting color, rendering it legible from a distance of not
less than 50 feet.
   13.   Restoration Required. The work to be done under an excavation permit
issued pursuant to this chapter and the restoration of the right-of-way as
required in this section must be completed within the dates specified in the
permit. In addition to its own work, the permittee must restore or pay for the
restoration of the general area of the work, and the surrounding areas,
including the paving, its foundations and any special features, to its proper
and required condition in accordance with the City’s utility accommodation and
street restoration specifications, unless the City Engineer deems other or
additional specifications must be utilized in order to secure proper
restoration. Further, the permittee shall inspect the area of the work and use
reasonable care to maintain the same condition for 48 months thereafter. If
special features in the right-of-way at a proposed excavation site, including,
but not limited to, special sidewalk surfaces, heated sidewalks, underground
vaults, areaways, and landscaping, cannot be preserved or protected, the City
must be notified prior to the applicant beginning work.
   14.   Performance and Maintenance Bond.
      A.   An applicant for an excavation permit shall, at the time of
application for an excavation permit, post a performance bond in an amount
determined by the City Engineer to be sufficient to cover the cost of restoring
the right-of-way to its proper and required condition pursuant to the City’s
utility accommodation and street restoration specifications and in accordance
with the current restoration cost schedule established by resolution of the
Council. If, at the conclusion of the 48-month period after completion of the
restoration of the right-of-way, the department determines that the right-of-
way has been properly restored, the surety on the performance bond shall be
released.
      B.   Bond Condition. The bond shall be conditioned upon:
         (1)   The faithful performance of the right-of-way restoration work
required under this chapter, or payment of the restoration costs incurred by
the City; and
         (2)   The faithful performance of the terms of the permit, the
provisions of this chapter, and any other requirements provided by law.
   If the applicant fails or neglects to properly restore the right-of-way to
its proper condition within the time for completion set forth in the permit, or
within a reasonable time after notice by the City Engineer of such failure or
neglect, or fails to pay the restoration costs incurred by the City or fails or
neglects to properly maintain the right-of-way to its proper condition within a
reasonable time after notice by the City Engineer of such failure or neglect,
or fails to pay the maintenance costs incurred by the City, the right-of-way
shall be restored or maintained by the City and the costs thereof, as certified
by the City Engineer, shall be promptly paid by the applicant or bonding
company as the case may be.
      C.   Bond for Obstruction Permit. If the City Engineer determines, in
their sole discretion, that an obstruction permit applicant’s proposed use of
the right-of-way poses a risk of damage to the right-of-way, the City Engineer
may require such applicant to post a surety bond before the obstruction permit
is issued. Such bond, if required, shall be placed on file with and approved by
the City Engineer; shall be in the minimum amount of $5,000.00 or such other
amount determined by the City Engineer to be sufficient to cover the
anticipated cost of damage to the right-of-way; and shall be conditioned to
ensure removal of the obstruction and restoration of the right-of-way and all
public improvements thereon by or before the expiration date of such
obstruction permit or such extended time as may be granted by the City
Engineer.
   15.   Permittee’s Other Obligations.
      A.   Except in an emergency and with the approval of the City Engineer,
no right-of-way obstruction or excavation may be performed when seasonally
prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work.
      B.   A permittee shall not so obstruct a right-of-way that the natural
free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be
interfered with.
      C.   Work under a permit shall be conducted within the permit area, and
work vehicles, equipment, and materials shall be stored within the permit area.
The loading or unloading of trucks adjacent to a permit area is prohibited
unless specifically authorized by the permit.
      D.   Contractor shall notify property owner(s) abutting the right-of-way
in the area designated in the permit at least 24-hours in advance of the start
of the work notifying them of the projected start date, type of work, who the
work is for, and the contractor business name and phone number.
   16.   Denial of Permit.
      A.   Mandatory Denial. Except in an emergency, no right-of-way permit
will be issued:
         (1)   To any person who is not in full compliance with the
requirements of this chapter;
         (2)   To any person who has outstanding debt owed to the City;
         (3)   To any person as to whom there exists grounds for the revocation
of a permit; and
         (4)   If the issuance of a permit for the particular date or time
would cause a conflict or interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival,
or any other event.
      B.   Permissive Denial. The City Engineer may deny a permit in order to
protect the public health, safety, and welfare; to prevent interference with
the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the right-of-way; or when
necessary to protect the right-of-way and its users.
      C.   No person shall leave or keep open any excavation or vault on, in,
or under any right-of-way. All excavations and vaults shall be protected in
accordance with the City’s utility accommodation and street restoration
specifications.
   17.   Inspection.
      A.   When the work under any permit issued pursuant to this chapter is
completed, the permittee shall notify the City Engineer.
      B.   The permittee shall make the work site available to the department
inspector and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the work.
      C.   At the time of inspection, the department inspector may order the
immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life,
health, safety, or well-being of the public.
   18.   Work Done Without Permit.
      A.   Emergency Situations. Each registrant under this chapter shall
immediately notify the City Engineer of any event regarding its equipment which
it considers to be an emergency. The registrant may proceed to take whatever
actions are necessary in order to respond to the emergency. Within two business
days after the occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply for the
necessary right-of-way permits, and pay the fees associated therewith. If a
storm, flood, or other City-wide emergency event causes system-wide damages to
the equipment of a utility service company, requiring emergency repairs without
obtaining the necessary right-of-way permits, the Council may, upon request by
the company sustaining such damage, waive or modify the requirement that
permits be obtained after the making of emergency repairs in response to such
event. If the City Engineer becomes aware of an emergency regarding a
registrant’s equipment, the department may attempt to contact the local
representative of each registrant affected or potentially affected by the
emergency. In any event, the department may take whatever action it deems
necessary in order to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be
borne by the registrant whose equipment occasioned the emergency.
      B.   Nonemergency Situations. Except in an emergency, any person who
obstructs or excavates a right-of-way without a permit must subsequently obtain
a permit, pay double the normal fee for such permit, pay double all the other
fees required by this Code, deposit with the department the fees necessary to
correct any damage to the right-of-way.
   19.   Revocation.
      A.   Permittees hold right-of-way permits as a privilege and not as a
right. The City reserves the right, as provided in this section, to revoke any
right-of-way permit, without fee refund, for a substantial breach of the terms
and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule, or regulation or any condition
of the permit. A substantial breach by the permittee shall include, but shall
not be limited to, the following:
         (1)   The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way
permit;
         (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the
right-of-way permit or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or
deceit upon the City or its citizens;
         (3)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit;
         (4)   The failure to maintain the required bonds or insurance;
         (5)   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner; or
         (6)   The failure to correct a condition indicated as directed by the
inspector.
      B.   If the City Engineer determines that the permittee has committed a
substantial breach of a term of condition of any statute, ordinance, rule,
regulation, or any condition of the permit, the City Engineer shall make a
written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit.
Further, a substantial breach, as stated in this subsection, will allow the
City Engineer, at their discretion, to place additional or revised conditions
on the permit.
      C.   Within 24 hours of receiving notification of the breach, the
permittee shall contact the City Engineer with a plan, acceptable to the City
Engineer, for its correction. The permittee’s failure to so contact the City
Engineer or the permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable plan or the
permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan shall be cause
for immediate revocation of the permit. Further, the permittee’s failure to so
contact the City Engineer, or the permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable
plan, or permittee’s failure to implement the approved plan shall automatically
place the permittee on probation for one full year. From time to time, the City
Engineer may establish a list of permit conditions which, if breached, will
automatically place the permittee on probation for one full year, such as, but
not limited to, working out of the allotted time period or working on right-of-
way grossly outside of the permit.
      D.   If a permittee, while on probation, commits a breach as outlined in
this section, the permittee’s permit will automatically be revoked, and the
permittee will not be allowed further permits for one full year, except for
emergency repairs.
      E.   If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the City
for the City’s reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of
collection and reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred in connection with such
revocation.
   20.   Traffic Control Devices, Lighting,and Plating.
      A.   The public shall be protected at all excavations or trenches or open
vaults in the right-of-way by the placement of proper traffic control devices,
lighting, and plating as specified in the State Manual On Uniform Traffic
Control Devices and Applicable Provisions of SUDAS.
      B.   Every person making such an excavation or trench shall maintain any
and all protection required under Paragraph A until the trench or excavation
has been refilled and the street, pavement, sidewalk, or curb has been restored
to its proper condition as provided in the City’s utility accommodation and
street restoration specifications.
141.04   FRANCHISE OR LICENSE FOR PRIVATE OR COMMERCIAL USE.
   1.   Franchise or License Required.
      A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no person shall occupy
or use public right-of-way on a City-wide basis for the purpose of providing
utility services to private customers without first obtaining a franchise from
the City as provided and required by Section 364.2 of the Code of Iowa, unless
such utility service is provided by a governmental entity having jurisdiction
and authority to provide such service within the City.
      B.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no person shall occupy
or use any portion of the right-of-way for the purpose of operating or
conducting a private business, on other than a temporary basis as provided in

license that grants or allows exclusive use or occupancy of the right-of-way.
Any person seeking a franchise or license for use of City right-of-way shall
make application for a franchise or license with the City Engineer.

right-of-way shall be filed with the City Engineer on a form provided by the
City and shall include all registration information required to be submitted.

and conditions of a franchise shall be subject to negotiation between the
franchise applicant and the City and shall be incorporated into the form of an

ultimately require authorization to utilize any and all street and alley
rights-of-way within the City or within a given part thereof for the purpose of
providing such service; and
         (5)   The franchise applicant has obtained a certificate of public
convenience and necessity from the State Utilities Board for the provision of
that service, if required, and has met all other legal requirements to provide
the utility service.

         (1)   A person who, on the effective date of the ordinance from which
this section derives, provides or proposes to provide utility services to all
residents within the City or to all residents within a given part thereof but

of-way constituting only a small portion of the street or alley rights-of-way
within the City or within that part of the City; or
         (2)   A person who the City determines can provide such service by
utilizing only certain street or alley rights-of-way constituting only a small
portion of the street or alley rights-of-way within the City or within a given
part of the City.
         (3)   The owner of two or more properties which abut a street or alley
right-of-way on either side thereof and which properties are zoned for multi-
family, commercial, or industrial use, who desires to use such street or alley
right-of-way to provide a private service connection between two or more
buildings or facilities located on such properties.
         (4)   The owner of two or more properties within the boundaries of the
City, which properties are used collectively as a campus for residential,
business, or educational purposes, who desires to use the streets or alleys
connecting said properties to provide a private service connection not to
exceed a four-block radius or 10,000 equivalent linear feet between two or more
buildings or facilities located on such properties.
         (5)   A person who provides or proposes to provide wholesale services
or support to its customers or clients who use the person’s equipment and
facilities within the City right-of-way. Upon request by such person for
license, or for license renewal or license amendment increasing the equivalent
linear footage of the person’s equipment within the right-of-way existing on
the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives by 10
percent or greater, the City Engineer shall review the then-anticipated cost of
relocation and removal of the person’s proposed equipment and restoration of
the City right-of-way due to said relocation or removal, and prior to issuing
such license, renewal, or amendment, the City Engineer may, in their sole
discretion, require such person to make payment to the City of an upfront
deposit payment or to post a performance and maintenance bond in the amount.
Nothing set forth herein relieves such person of their obligation to
additionally pay applicable fees, or to remove or relocate its equipment
following its license term or renewals thereof following City Engineer order,
or to otherwise comply with all provisions of this Code applicable to such
person’s use of the City right-of-way.
         (6)   A person who provides or proposes to provide a private service
connection that does not cross a street or alley right-of-way between two or
more buildings or facilities on either side thereof in accordance with
Paragraph A(3), or that exceeds a four-block radius or 10,000 equivalent linear
feet, and who, in the discretion of the City Engineer, fulfills all of the
following criteria:
            a.   Owns a minimum of one property used for non-residential
purposes within the boundaries of the City, as determined by the records of the
County Assessor or Auditor within which county the property is located, for the
duration of the initial license term and renewals thereof; and
            b.   Provides a broad-based public benefit to the City and its
residents in the form of economic activity, or job creation, or the promotion
of the health, safety, or welfare of the City’s residents; and
            c.   Does or will own the proposed equipment within the right-of-
way, and whose proposed use of the right-of-way has a minimal current impact
and minimal anticipated future impact on such right-of-way, and of the use
thereof by the City or other parties allowed by the City pursuant to this
chapter.
      B.   Appeals of the City Engineer’s decisions regarding eligibility for
the issuance of a license for the use of the right-of-way may be made pursuant
to this Code.
   4.   Authority to Issue License; Form of License and Term.
      A.   Licenses required by this section shall be issued by the City
Engineer. The City Engineer shall review each application and shall issue each
license which they determine to be in compliance with the requirements of this
section and any other applicable legal requirements. In issuing a license, the
City Engineer may require a change in the proposed location of the licensee’s
equipment where necessary to avoid interference with other equipment placed
within the public right-of-way.
      B.   Licenses issued pursuant to this section shall be in writing, shall
be executed by the licensee, and shall not take effect until approved by the
City Attorney. The form of licenses to be issued pursuant to this section shall
be uniform, but shall be subject to periodic review and modification.
   5.   Limit on Term of Franchises; Limit on Initial or Renewal Term of
Licenses.
      A.   No franchise for use of the public right-of-way shall be granted for
a term in excess of 25 years.
      B.   No license for use of the public right-of-way issued by the City
Engineer shall be issued or renewed for a term in excess of five years.
   6.   Compensation Required; Franchise and License Fees.
      A.   All new franchises granted by the City shall allow for the
collection of an annual franchise fee.
      B.   A license fee shall, to the extent allowed by the constitution and
laws of the State, be assessed on all new licenses for use or occupancy of the
right-of-way upon and after the Council’s approval by resolution of a schedule
of license fees for use of City rights-of-way. The schedule of fees for use of
City rights-of-way shall reflect the diminution in the functional utility of
the right-of-way for use by the City and shall be based upon such factors as
the value or rental value of private property abutting the right-of-way to be
used and the licensee’s avoided cost in using the City right-of-way as opposed
to establishing a private right-of-way for the licensed use upon abutting
private property. The schedule of fees for use of City rights-of-way shall
establish such fees in terms of per-linear-foot charges for the right-of-way
used, and assuming a use width of not more than 10 feet, with the schedule
reflecting the per-foot value of such right-of-way in identified segments of
the City.
      C.   In addition to being required to pay franchise or license fees,
franchisees and licensees may, to the extent allowed by Section 480A.1 of the
Code of Iowa, et seq., be required to provide in-kind services as compensation
for such use, including, but not limited to:
         (1)   The installation by the franchisee or licensee of City equipment
in the trenches excavated by or in the duct banks constructed by the franchisee
or licensee; or
         (2)   Access to such trenches or ducts so that the City can install
its equipment therein.
   Franchisees and licensees who provide such services as utility services, as
defined in this chapter, may, to the extent allowed by Section 480A.1 of the
Code of Iowa, et seq., also be required to provide access at no cost to the
services provided by the franchisee or licensee at a location to be designated
by the City, or the equivalent value of the service to be provided at such
location.
      D.   Franchise and license fees shall be paid at the Clerk’s office. The
acceptance of any such fee payment by the City shall not be construed as an
acknowledgment that the amount paid is the correct amount due, nor shall such
acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim which the City may
have for additional sums due and payable.
      E.   The licensee or lessee shall pay interest at the rate of 10 percent
per year on any overdue license fee calculated from the due date of the fee.
      F.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the liability of
a franchisee or licensee for all applicable federal, State, and local taxes.
      G.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the Council
from exercising the right of the City to change the amount of any of the fees
required by this section.
   7.   Application for Issuance of a License. A person desiring to obtain a
license as required in this section shall make application for a license for
such use and occupancy as provided in this chapter, and shall pay an
application fee for initial issuance of the license. The application fee for
initial issuance of a license and any future changes thereto shall be effective
upon its inclusion in a schedule of fees adopted by the Council by resolution.
The application for initial issuance of a license shall be filed with the City
Engineer not less than 60 days prior to the proposed effective date of the
license and shall be filed upon a form provided by the City for that purpose.
The application shall include, at a minimum, the following information:
      A.   The name, address, and telephone number of the applicant.
      B.   The name, address, and telephone number of a responsible person whom
the City may notify or contact at any time or in case of emergency concerning
the equipment or utility system.
      C.   A statement of the purpose for the equipment or system proposed for
installation in the public right-of-way, the type of service it will provide,
and the intended customers which it will serve.
      D.   Any additional information which the City Engineer, in their
discretion, may require.
   8.   Issuance and Renewal of Licenses; License Revocation and Cancellation.
      A.   Prior to the initial issuance of a license for use or occupancy of
public right-of-way, the City Engineer shall conduct a review of the licensee’s
background to determine the licensee’s ability to meet the requirements stated
in this section. If, on the basis of such review, the City Engineer determines
that it would not be appropriate to issue the license, the City Engineer shall
give notice of intent not to issue the license as provided in this section.
      B.   To obtain renewal of a license, the licensee shall file an
application with the City Engineer on the form provided by the City and pay an
application fee for renewal of the license. The application fee and any future
changes thereto shall be effective upon its inclusion in a schedule of fees
adopted by the Council by resolution. The renewal application shall be filed
with the City Engineer not less than 180 days prior to the expiration of the
existing license or any renewal term of the license. Upon receipt of the
application, the City Engineer shall conduct a review of the licensee and the
licensee’s prior use of the public right-of-way to determine the licensee’s
continued compliance with the requirements. If, on the basis of such review,
the City Engineer determines that the licensee and the licensee’s prior use of
the public right-of-way comply with all requirements stated in this section,
the City Engineer may renew the license for an additional term of up to five
years. If on the basis of such review the City Engineer determines that the
licensee and the licensee’s use of public right-of-way do not comply with one
or more of the requirements stated in this section, the City Engineer shall
give notice of intent not to renew the license as provided in this section. If
a licensee holds multiple licenses for use or occupancy of various rights-of-
way within the City for the same or similar purpose, the licensee shall be
required to renew all such licenses under a single license at such time as the
earliest issued license expires.
      C.   In determining the length of the term of a license, the City
Engineer shall take into consideration the likelihood that the City will
require the use of the licensed right-of-way for municipal purposes or that
such use of the licensed right-of-way will unduly burden the City or the public
in its use of the licensed right-of-way during the proposed term of the
license. A license shall not be issued or renewed if the City Engineer
determines that any of the following conditions exist in the right-of-way
proposed for licensing:
         (1)   There is insufficient space in the right-of-way to accommodate
the proposed use, given the other existing uses thereof;
         (2)   The proposed private utility service connection would interfere
with or conflict with existing or planned City equipment or utility equipment
located or to be located in the right-of-way;
         (3)   Such use is incompatible with adjacent public or private uses of
that right-of-way;
         (4)   Such use would involve an unacceptably high frequency of repair
or maintenance to the private utility service equipment thereby requiring
excessive excavation in or obstruction of the right-of-way; or
         (5)   The construction or installation of such private utility service
equipment would interfere with a public improvement undertaken or to be
undertaken by the City or with an economic development project in which the
City has an interest or investment.
      D.   If, during the term of any license, the City Engineer determines
that the license should be revoked due to the licensee's failure to comply with
any of the requirements stated in this section, the City Engineer shall give
notice of intent to revoke such license.
      E.   The following shall constitute grounds for refusal to issue or renew
a license, or for revocation of a license for use or occupancy of public right-
of-way. The licensee’s failure to observe or comply with any of the following:
         (1)   The licensee’s use or prior use of public right-of-way has been
conducted in full and timely compliance with all laws and regulations
applicable thereto, and the licensee has complied fully and in a timely manner
with the requirements of any previously issued license, and with the orders or
instructions of City officials issued pursuant to this chapter; or
         (2)   The licensee is current in the payment of license fees, if
applicable, and the licensee has made such payments fully and when due.
         (3)   The licensee has made a misleading statement or a material
misrepresentation in connection with an application for initial issuance or
renewal of a license, in connection with its use of public right-of-way.
      F.   The City Engineer shall give notice of intent to cancel such license
as provided in this section if, during the term of any license, the City
Engineer determines that:
         (1)   The licensee’s continued use of the public right-of-way will
unduly burden the City or the public in its use of that property;
         (2)   The public right-of-way for which the license was issued will be
required for municipal purposes during the term of the license;
         (3)   The licensee’s equipment, at a particular location, will
interfere with:
            a.   A present or future City use of the right-of-way;
            b.   A public improvement undertaken or to be undertaken by the
City;
            c.   An economic development project in which the City has an
interest or investment; or
            d.   The public’s safety or convenience in using the right-of-way
for ordinary travel.
         (4)   The public health, safety, and welfare requires it; or
         (5)   The continued existence of the license is not in the City’s best
interests.
      G.   Notice of intent not to issue a license for use of the public right-
of-way shall be given to the applicant, either by certified mail, return
receipt requested, or by actual service or delivery thereof, which notice shall
be given not more than 30 days after submission of the application. Notice of
intent not to renew a license for use of the public right-of-way shall be given
to the licensee, either by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by
actual service or delivery thereof, which notice shall be given not more than
90 days after submission of the application. Notice of intent to revoke or
cancel a license shall also be given to the licensee. The notice shall set
forth the grounds for refusal to issue or renew or for revocation or
cancellation and shall inform the applicant or licensee of the right to an
appeal hearing upon request. At the hearing, the applicant or licensee shall
have the burden of establishing that the grounds asserted in the notice do not
exist.
      H.   Upon the effective date of revocation or cancellation as provided in
the City Engineer’s notice thereof, or upon the effective date specified in the
City Engineer’s written decision upon the licensee’s appeal, the licensee shall
be required to cease its use and occupancy of the right-of-way or to remove or
relocate its equipment therefrom, as provided in the notice or decision.
Equipment not removed or relocated from the right-of-way as required in such
notice or order shall be considered a nuisance and may be removed, relocated,
or taken possession of by the City, at the licensee’s expense. Except in
emergency circumstances, the requirement to relocate, remove, or cease use of
equipment shall be suspended during the pendency of any appeal taken by a
licensee.
      I.   If a license is refused or cancelled upon the basis that the City
property licensed or proposed for licensing is or will be required for
municipal purposes, the applicant or licensee shall not be entitled to appeal.
However, in that event, the licensee shall be entitled to a partial refund of
the annual fee already paid, such refund to be computed on the basis of 1/12 of
the required annual fee multiplied by the number of unexpired whole months of
the year remaining in the license term. In all other cases where a license is
not issued or renewed or is revoked, no refund of any portion of the required
annual fee shall be paid to the licensee.
      J.   Notwithstanding the notice and hearing requirements of this section,
the City Engineer may, in emergency circumstances, order the immediate
relocation or removal of equipment from the right-of-way and may, upon the
licensee’s failure to comply with such order, immediately remove, relocate, or
take possession of such equipment at the licensee’s expense.
   9.   Failure to Secure, Renew or Comply.
      A.   Any person who fails to secure a franchise or license required under
this section or any franchisee or licensee who fails to comply with the
requirements of this section shall, upon notification of such violation by the
City Engineer, immediately act either to abate the violation or to cease its
use and occupancy of the right-of-way and remove its equipment or system from
the right-of-way.
      B.   The City reserves the right either to remove or to disconnect and
render inoperative any equipment or system in the right-of-way under franchise
or license which is used or maintained contrary to this chapter; provided,
however, that the City will give written notice of its intent to take such
action, including the date upon which such action will be taken, to the
affected franchisee or licensee not less than seven days prior to taking such
action.
   10.   Amendment to License. If a licensee with a current license issued
pursuant to this section proposes to expand, reduce, relocate, or modify any
portion of its equipment or system within public right-of-way, the licensee
shall file an application for an amendment to the current license with the City
Engineer, shall pay the administrative application fee and pay a deposit or
post a bond, if required. An application for an amendment to a current license
shall include relevant new information of the type required in connection with
the initial application for a license. If approved, the amended license shall
be issued by the City Engineer in the same manner as the original license.
   11.   Duties of Licensee.
      A.   No license required under this section or amendment to such license
shall be issued for any equipment or system until the required fees have been
paid and until a complete application has been filed with and approved by the
City Engineer.
      B.   The licensee’s equipment or system shall be installed or constructed
in accordance with applicable industry standards, the City’s utility
accommodation and street restoration specifications, and the terms and
conditions imposed by the City.
      C.   If it becomes necessary to excavate or obstruct any public right-of-
way in connection with the installation, construction, reconstruction, repair,
operation, disconnection, or removal of a licensee’s equipment or system, the
licensee shall first obtain a permit from the City.
      D.   The licensee shall maintain its equipment and all parts of its
system in good condition, order, and repair.
      E.   The licensee shall be responsible for repairing or reimbursing other
licensed or franchised utilities or other persons or entities lawfully using
the right-of-way for any damage to their property caused by negligence of the
licensee or its agents, employees, or contractors in connection with the
installation, construction, reconstruction, repair, operation, disconnection,
or removal of the licensee’s equipment or system.
      F.   No license required under this section shall be issued to authorize
placement of a utility system in any space which is required for public use.
   12.   Relocation or Removal of Equipment; Payment of City Costs Due to
Improper Location of Equipment.
      A.   Under this chapter, the City Engineer shall order the removal or
relocation of equipment, as they deem appropriate, if the City Engineer
determines at any time that:
         (1)   A registrant’s or permittee’s continued use of the public right-
of-way will unduly burden the City or the public in its use of that property;
         (2)   The public right-of-way which the registrant or permittee is
using or occupying will be required for municipal purposes;
         (3)   The registrant’s or permittee’s equipment at a particular
location will interfere with:
            a.   A present or future City use of the right-of-way;
            b.   A public improvement undertaken or to be undertaken by the
City;
            c.   An economic development project in which the City has an
interest or investment; or
            d.   The public’s safety or convenience in using the right-of-way
for ordinary travel; or
         (4)   The public health, safety, and welfare requires it.
      B.   Franchisees and licensees under this chapter shall promptly and, at
their own expense, with due regard for seasonal working conditions, permanently
remove their equipment, or relocate their equipment within the right-of-way,
whenever the City Engineer orders such removal or relocation, and shall, at
their sole expense, restore the right-of-way to its proper and required
condition.
   13.   Damage to Other Equipment.
      A.   When any City department performs work in the right-of-way and finds
it necessary to maintain, support, or move a permittee’s, franchisee’s, or
licensee’s equipment in order to protect it, the costs associated therewith
will be billed to that person and must be paid within 30 days from the date of
billing. In such event, the City Engineer or City department performing such
work shall notify the affected registrant, permittee, franchisee, licensee, or
lessee, informing such person of the action it intends to take with respect to
such equipment and affording such person the opportunity to review and comment
on the action proposed to be taken. If circumstances permit it, the City
Engineer or City department performing the work may allow the affected
registrant, permittee, franchisee, or licensee to take the action necessary to
maintain, support, or move its equipment.
      B.   Each registrant, permittee, franchisee, or licensee shall be
responsible for the cost of repairing any equipment in the right-of-way which
it or its equipment damages. Each registrant, permittee, franchisee, or
licensee shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the
equipment of another registrant, permittee, franchisee, or licensee occurring
during the City’s response to an emergency occasioned by that registrant’s
equipment.
   14.   Abandoned and Unused Equipment.
      A.   Under this chapter, a franchisee or licensee who has determined to
discontinue its operations in the City, in whole or in part, or who has
discontinued use of part or all of its equipment in the right-of-way, must
either:
         (1)   Provide information satisfactory to the City Engineer that its
obligations for its equipment in the right-of-way have been lawfully assumed by
another franchisee or licensee; or
         (2)   Submit to the City Engineer a proposal and instruments for
transferring ownership of its equipment to the City. If a franchisee or
licensee proceeds under this subsection, the City may, at its option:
            a.   Assume ownership of and responsibility for the equipment; or
            b.   Refuse transfer of ownership to the City and require the
registrant, at its own expense, to remove the equipment.
      B.   A registrant, franchisee, or licensee who fails to comply with this
section and whose equipment remains unused for a period of two years shall be
deemed to have abandoned such equipment and the equipment shall be deemed to be
abandoned. Abandoned equipment is deemed to be a nuisance. The City may, with
respect to abandoned equipment which is deemed a nuisance, exercise any
remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to:
         (1)   Bringing an action for nuisance abatement in which the City may
seek the abatement of the nuisance or authority to take possession of the
equipment; or
         (2)   Requiring removal of the equipment by the registrant,
franchisee, or licensee.
      C.   Any franchisee or licensee who has unused equipment in any right-of-
way shall remove it from the right-of-way during the next scheduled excavation,
unless this requirement is waived by the City Engineer.
      D.   A franchisee or licensee who abandons or ceases use of its equipment
as provided in this section and whose proposal to transfer such equipment to
the City is accepted by the City shall, nonetheless, be allowed to remove wires
or cables from underground conduits and to remove movable equipment from
underground vaults or handholes, if the City Engineer determines that such
removal can be accomplished without damaging such conduits or vaults, and
provided such removal can be accomplished without extensive excavation or long-
term obstruction of the right-of-way. Such removal shall be accomplished
pursuant to appropriate right-of-way permits, which may include conditions
regarding the manner of removal and schedule for removal.
   15.   Reservation of Regulatory and Police Powers. The City, by issuing of a
right-of-way permit, franchise, or a license under this chapter, does not
surrender or to any extent lose, waive, impair, or lessen the lawful powers and
rights which it has or which may be vested in the City under the State
constitution, State law, and the City Charter to regulate the use of the right-
of-way by such persons. All such persons, by acceptance of a right-of-way
permit, franchise, or license are deemed and shall be held to agree that all
lawful powers and rights, regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise as
are or may be from time to time vested in or reserved to the City, shall be in
full force and effect and subject to the exercise thereof by the City at any
time. All such persons are further deemed to acknowledge that their rights are
subject to the regulatory and police powers of the City to adopt and enforce
general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public and are
deemed to have agreed to comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances
enacted by the City pursuant to such powers.
   16.   Existing Franchises. If a conflict of language occurs between the
provisions of this chapter and an existing franchise agreement, the conflict
shall be resolved by honoring the terms of the franchise until it expires.
   17.   Construction of Chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as
an acquiescence in or ratification of the occupancy or use of any public right-
of-way in the City by any person occupying the right-of-way without legal
right, nor shall this chapter be construed as conferring the right to occupy or
use any public right-of-way within the City upon any such person illegally or
without authority occupying the right-of-way.
141.05   APPEAL.
   Administrative decisions by City staff and enforcement actions of the
enforcement officer may be appealed by the applicant to the Council pursuant to
the following rules:
   1.   The appeal must be filed in writing with the City Administrator within
20 business days of the decision or enforcement action.
   2.   The written appeal shall specify in detail the action appealed from,
the errors allegedly made by the enforcement officer giving rise to the appeal,
a written summary of all oral and written testimony the applicant intends to
introduce at the hearing, including the names and addresses of all witnesses
the applicant intends to call, copies of all documents the applicant intends to
introduce at the hearing, and the relief requested.
   3.   The enforcement officer shall specify, in writing, the reasons for the
enforcement action, a written summary of all oral and written testimony the
enforcement officer intends to introduce at the hearing, including the names
and addresses of all witnesses the enforcement officer intends to call, and
copies of all documents the enforcement officer intends to introduce at the
hearing.
   4.   The City Administrator shall notify the applicant and the enforcement
officer by ordinary mail, and shall give public notice in accordance with
Chapter 21 of the Code of Iowa, of the date, time, and place for the regular or
special meeting of the Council at which the hearing on the appeal shall occur.
The hearing shall be scheduled for a date not less than four or more than 20
days after the filing of the appeal. The rules of evidence and procedure, and
the standard of proof to be applied, shall be the same as provided by Chapter
17A of the Code of Iowa. The applicant may be represented by counsel at the
applicant’s expense. The enforcement officer may be represented by the City
Attorney or by an attorney designated by the Council at City expense. The
decision of the Council shall be rendered in writing and may be appealed to the
Iowa District Court.
CHAPTER 143
STORMWATER UTILITY
 
143.01 Purpose                                         143.05 Prohibited Acts
143.02 Definitions                                     143.06 Right of Entry
143.03 Scope and Responsibility for Stormwater Utility 143.07 Enforcement
143.04 Public Utilities Superintendent                  
 
143.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish a stormwater utility which shall
be responsible for stormwater management within the corporate boundaries of the
City and shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation,
use, and enhancement of stormwater management systems and facilities.
143.02   DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter, the following terms are defined:
   1.   “Commercial” or “Industrial” means any developed land whereon
commercial, retail, and office, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage
buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots,
public and private school buildings, churches, hospitals, and convalescent
centers have been constructed.
   2.   “Customers of the stormwater utility” means and includes all persons,
properties, and entities served by or benefiting from the utility’s
acquisition, management, maintenance, extension, and improvement of the public
stormwater management system and facilities.
   3.   “Developed land” means land that has been altered from its natural
state by construction or installation of more than 500 square feet of
“impervious surface area” as defined in this section.
   4.   “Duplex dwelling” means a building containing only two dwelling units
and designed for and occupied exclusively by not more than two families. In the
application of stormwater service charge rates, duplex dwelling properties
shall be treated as two single-family dwellings.
   5.   “Dwelling unit” means a singular unit or apartment providing complete,
independent living facilities for one or more persons including permanent
provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation.
   6.   “Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU)” means the average impervious
coverage of a detached dwelling unit property in the City as determined by the
City, and shall be used as the basis for determining stormwater service
charges. Four thousand square feet of impervious surface area shall be one
equivalent unit.
   7.   “Impervious surface area” means those areas which prevent or impede the
infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it enters in natural conditions
prior to development. Common impervious surface areas include, but are not
limited to, rooftops, sidewalks, driveways, patios, parking lots, storage
areas, compacted gravel surfaces, and other surfaces which prevent or impede
the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to
development.
   8.   “Multiple-family dwelling” means a building or portion thereof
containing three or more dwelling units designed for or occupied by three or
more families. In the application of stormwater service charge rates, each
multiple-family dwelling unit shall be treated as one single-family dwelling.
   9.   “Pollutant” means anything that causes or contributes to pollution.
Pollutants may include, but are not limited to: paints, varnishes and solvents;

be located not more than 100 feet from any vehicle space. Containers shall be
provided in sufficient number and capacity to properly store all refuse. Refuse
collection stands shall be provided for all refuse containers. Such container
stands shall be so designed as to prevent containers from being tipped, to
minimize spillage and container deterioration and facilitate cleaning around
them. All refuse and garbage shall be collected at least once daily, using
available municipal, or private agencies.
145.11   FUEL SUPPLY AND STORAGE.
   Fuel supply and storage shall be limited to containers, tanks, and cylinders
mounted and used on individual recreational vehicles. Fuel supply to service
buildings shall be public utility gas or electricity, or if such is not
available, a special permit may be allowed for L.P. gas.
145.12   FIRE PROTECTION.
   The recreational vehicle park shall be subject to the rules and regulations
of the Fire Department. Recreational vehicle parks shall be kept free of
litter, rubbish, and other flammable materials. Portable fire extinguishers of
a type approved by the Fire Department shall be kept in service buildings and
at all locations designated by the Fire Department, and shall be maintained in
good operating condition. Fires shall be made only in stoves and other

CHAPTER 146
STORMWATER CONTROL
 
146.01 Purpose         146.05 Constructions
146.02 Applicability   146.06 Maintenance
146.03 Definitions     146.07 Easements
146.04 Design Criteria 146.08 Procedure
 
146.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures to control the flow
of stormwater from developing areas so as to maintain the rate of the flow in
natural or manmade channels equal to the rate of flow from those areas in their
undeveloped state, so as to provide for the safety, health, and well-being of
those living within the developing area as well as those downstream who will be
affected by its development.
146.02   APPLICABILITY.
   The provisions of this chapter are applicable to:
   1.   All new residential, commercial, and industrial developments one acre
or larger.
   2.   Any new development, less than one acre, where the percentage of the
impervious area of the lot is 50 percent or greater.
   3.   Any new development, less than one acre, which, in the opinion of the
City Engineer, lacks an adequate outlet for the passage of stormwaters.
146.03   DEFINITIONS.
   When used in this chapter, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise,
the following words and phrases shall have the meanings ascribed to them in
this section.
   1.   “By-pass channel” means a channel formed in the topography of the
earth’s surface to carry stormwater runoff through a specific area.
   2.   “Control structure” means a structure designed to control the flow of
stormwater runoff that passes through it during a specific length of time.
   3.   “Development” means the improvement of the land from its natural state
to one providing for residential, industrial, or commercial use.
   4.   “Dry bottom stormwater storage area” means a facility designed to be
normally dry and contain water only when excess stormwater runoff occurs.
   5.   “Excess stormwater” means that portion of stormwater runoff which
exceeds the transportation capacity of storm sewers or natural drainage
channels serving a specific watershed.
   6.   “Natural drainage” means channels formed by the existing surface
topography prior to changes made by unnatural causes.
   7.   “Safe storm drainage capacity” means the flow of stormwater runoff that
can be transported by a channel or conduit without causing a rise of the water
surface over the conduit or adjacent to the channel.
   8.   “Stormwater runoff” means the flow of water resulting from
precipitation which is not absorbed by the soil or plant material.
   9.   “Stormwater runoff release rate” means the rate at which stormwater
runoff is released from dominant to subservient land.
   10.   “Stormwater storage areas” means areas designed to store excess
stormwater.
   11.   “Tributary watershed” means all of the area that contributes
stormwater runoff to a given point.
   12.   “Wet bottom stormwater storage area” means a facility designed to be
maintained as a pond or free water surface and which has the capacity to
contain excess stormwater runoff.
   13.   “‘X’-year storm” means the average recurrence intervals within which a
rainfall of given intensity and duration will be equaled or exceeded only once.
A 100-year storm would have an intensity of rainfall which would, on the
average, be equaled or exceeded only once in 100 years. This does not imply
that it will occur in 100 years, or having occurred, will not happen again for
100 years.
146.04   DESIGN CRITERIA.
   1.   Preparation and Certification. The design of stormwater control or
detention facilities shall be prepared and certified by a Registered Engineer,
Architect, or Landscape Architect familiar with stormwater control or
detention. Design calculations shall be made available to the City Engineer.
   2.   Release Rate. The release rate of stormwater from any detention basin
required under this chapter shall not exceed the stormwater runoff rate from
the drainage area as a totally grassed site during a five-year frequency storm.
Applicants may claim a higher natural rate of runoff if documented by detailed
computations to show that higher capacity exists in the natural outlets serving
the area. However, only the “safe storm drainage capacity” of the conduit or
channel may be included in these calculations. Design of the floodway system
shall also take into consideration control of stormwater velocity to prevent
erosion or other damage to the facility which will restrict its primary use.
Depths of flow shall be consistent with the “safe storm drainage capacity” of
the facility and detention or channel configurations shall be totally under
City control.
   3.   Detention Requirements. The required volume of stormwater detention
shall be that necessary to handle the runoff of a 100-year rainfall, for any
and all durations from the drainage area tributary to the stormwater storage
area based on full development of said tributary area, less the volume
discharge during the same duration at the approved release rate. The stormwater
release rate shall be considered when calculating the stormwater storage
capacity and the control structure shall be designed to maintain a relatively
uniform rate regardless of the depth of stormwater in the storm area. Thus, the
“Required Detention Storage” (RDS) will be that found to be the most critical
resulting from the inflow from the runoff of a fully developed tributary area
from a 100-year storm and outflow of the five-year storm with the same area in
its urbanized or natural state, totally grassed. Also, see Section
146.04(2), Release Rate. Detention storage may be provided as a “dry bottom” or
“wet bottom” storm area.
      A.   Dry bottom stormwater storage areas shall be designed to serve a
secondary purpose for recreation, open space, or other types of uses that will
not be adversely affected by intermittent flooding.
         (1)   A method of carrying the low flow through these areas shall be
provided in addition to a system of drains to prevent soggy areas. Both shall
be provided with an outlet to a natural channel or storm sewer with adequate
capacity as described in Section
146.04(4), By-Pass Channel. Dry bottom stormwater storage areas should be
designed to drain completely within 24 hours after a storm.
         (2)   Outlet control structures shall be designed as simply as
possible and shall require little or no attention for proper operation. Each
stormwater storage area shall be provided with a method of emergency overflow
in the event that a storm in excess of the 100-year frequency storm occurs.
This emergency overflow facility shall be designed to function without
attention and shall become part of the “natural” or surface channel system
described in Section
146.04(4). Hydraulic calculations shall be submitted to substantiate all design
features.
         (3)   Both outlet control structure and emergency overflow facilities
shall be designed and constructed to fully protect the public health, safety,
and welfare. Existing downstream hazards (garages, houses) must be considered.
Stormwater runoff velocities shall be kept at a minimum and turbulent
conditions at an outlet control structure will not be permitted without
complete protection for the public safety. The use of fences shall be kept to a
minimum and used only as a last resort when no other method is feasible. All
impounding structures within the City designed to be over 10 feet in height or
designed to store more than five ac-ft. must be approved by the Department of
Natural Resources (DNR). Complete engineering plans must be submitted to DNR
for their review.
         (4)   Paved surfaces that are to serve as stormwater storage areas and
rooftop storage shall be designed and permanent-type control inlets and
retaining or parapet walls to contain runoff on the surface. Emergency overflow
areas shall be provided.
      B.   Wet bottom stormwater storage areas shall be designed with all of
the items required for dry bottom stormwater storage areas, except that the
provisions of Section
146.04(3)(A)(1) shall not be required. However, the following additional
conditions shall be complied with:
         (1)   Water surface area shall not exceed 1/15 of the tributary
drainage area.
         (2)   Facilities shall be provided to lower the pond elevation by
gravity flow for cleaning purposes and shoreline maintenance. Shoreline
protection shall be provided to prevent erosion from wave action.
         (3)   Minimum normal water depth shall be four feet. If fish are to be
maintained, some portion of the pond area should be a minimum of 10 feet deep.
         (4)   Control structures for stormwater release shall be designed to
operate at full capacity with only a minor increase in water surface level.
Hydraulic calculations shall be submitted to the City Engineer to substantiate
all design features.
         (5)   Only that portion of the detention area above the normal water
level shall be used in calculating the storage capacity. Wet bottom stormwater
storage areas shall be designed to provide a storage duration not exceeding 24
hours after a storm.
   4.   By-Pass Channel. A “natural” or surface channel system shall be
designed with adequate capacity to convey through the development the
stormwater runoff from all tributary upstream areas. This “by-pass” channel
shall be designed to carry the peak rate of runoff from a 100-year storm,
assuming all storm sewers are blocked and the upstream areas fully developed.
146.05   CONSTRUCTIONS.
   1.   Where development of a property presents the threat of flooding or
damage by flash runoff to downstream residents, the facilities for stormwater
runoff control shall be construed as a part of the first phase of construction
of that project.
   2.   The construction of the stormwater control system shall be accomplished
as part of the cost of land development. If the amount of storage capacity can
be increased to provide benefit to the City, negotiations for public
participation in the cost of development shall be initiated.
   3.   All flood control items such as earthen embankments, conduits, outlet
structures, flood control structures, spillways, by-pass channels, etc., shall
be built as permanent facilities and all materials and their manner of
construction shall be assembled to accomplish as much permanency as is
possible.
   4.   Detention ponds shall be designed and landscaped to enhance the overall
site design whenever possible. Underground detention may be required on sites
that are being intensely developed or have unique site constraints. Large
ditches or ponds in the front of the site shall be discouraged and approved
only as a last resort. All detention facilities shall be shown on the site
plan.
146.06   MAINTENANCE.
   All plans submitted for stormwater detention systems shall describe an
adequate procedure of normal maintenance for the detention system. Any failure
of the stormwater detention system, due to inadequate normal or capital
maintenance, shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property on which
the detention system is located. It shall also be the property owner’s
responsibility to remedy any negligence in maintenance that resulted in the
failure of the system. The submittal of plans for such a system or the purchase
of property on which such system is located shall be deemed as acceptance of
responsibility for normal and capital maintenance of the system.
146.07   EASEMENTS.
   Drainage easements shall be provided for all conduits and those by-pass
channels where the 100-year runoff exceeds one cubic foot per second.
146.08   PROCEDURE.
   1.   Plans, specifications, and all calculations for stormwater runoff
control shall be submitted for review and approval prior to the approval of a
final plat (in the case of a subdivision or planned unit development) or prior
to approval of a site plan (in case of commercial or industrial construction).
   2.   No Certificate of Occupancy for any building in the development will be
issued until the storm detention facilities are constructed, inspected, and
approved.

147.01   FINDINGS.
   1.   The U.S. EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
Permit Program (Program) administered by the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources (IDNR) requires that cities meeting certain demographic and
environmental impact criteria obtain from the IDNR an NPDES permit for the
discharge of stormwater from a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) (MS4
Permit). The City is subject to the Program and is required to obtain, and has
obtained, an MS4 Permit; the City’s MS4 Permit is on file at the office of the
Clerk and is available for public inspection during regular office hours.
   2.   As a condition of the City’s MS4 Permit, the City is obliged to adopt
and enforce an Illicit Discharge To Storm Sewer System Ordinance.
   3.   No State or federal funds have been made available to assist the City
in administering and enforcing the Program. Accordingly, the City shall fund
its operations under this chapter entirely by charges imposed on the owners of
properties which are made subject to the Program by virtue of State and federal
law, or other sources of funding established by a separate ordinance.
   4.   Terms used in this chapter shall have the meanings specified in the
Program.
147.02   ILLICIT DISCHARGES PROHIBITED.
   1.   For purposes of this chapter, a “responsible party” is one or more
persons that control or are in possession of or own property. Responsible
parties shall be jointly and severally responsible for compliance with this
chapter and jointly and severally liable for any illicit discharge from the
property controlled, possessed, or owned. For purposes of this chapter,
“property” includes, but is not limited to, real estate, fixtures, facilities,
and premises of any kind located upon, under, or above the real estate.
   2.   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to relieve a responsible party
subject to an IDNR-issued Industrial Discharge Permit or any other federal,
State, or City permit, statute, ordinance, or rule from any obligation imposed
by such permit, statute, ordinance, or rule if any such obligation is greater
than any obligation imposed by this chapter.
   3.   Any discharge into the City’s storm sewer system prohibited by the
City’s MS4 Permit, the terms of which are hereby incorporated by reference,
shall be deemed an “illicit discharge” in violation of this chapter.
   4.   Sediment pollution originating from excessive erosion rates on a
construction site not otherwise subject to the City’s COSESCO ordinance or
sediment pollution entering a municipal storm sewer that causes a water quality
violation as determined by the IDNR shall be deemed an illicit discharge in
violation of this chapter.
147.03   ILLICIT CONNECTIONS PROHIBITED.
   1.   For purposes of this chapter, an “illicit connection” to the City’s
storm sewer system is any physical connection or other topographical or other
condition, natural or artificial, which is not specifically authorized by
ordinance or written rule of the City, which causes or facilitates, directly or
indirectly, an illicit discharge.
   2.   The construction, use, maintenance, or continued existence of any
illicit connection shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
   3.   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
147.04   INDUSTRIAL DISCHARGES.
   1.   Any responsible party subject an industrial NPDES discharge permit
issued by the IDNR shall comply with all provisions of such permit.
   2.   Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the enforcement officer prior to discharges to the storm sewer
system authorized by said permit.
147.05   ILLICIT DISCHARGE DETECTION AND REPORTING; COST RECOVERY.
   1.   All detection activities permitted under this chapter shall be
conducted by the Utility Director hereinbefore and after referred to as the
“enforcement officer.”
   2.   The City shall not be responsible for the direct or indirect
consequences to persons or property of an illicit discharge, or circumstances
which may cause an illicit discharge, undetected by the City.
   3.   Every responsible party has an absolute duty to monitor conditions on
property owned or controlled by them, to prevent all illicit discharges, and to
report to the enforcement officer illicit discharges which the responsible
party knows or should have known to have occurred. Failure to comply with any
provision of this chapter is a violation of this chapter.
      A.   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any
responsible party has information of any known or suspected illicit discharge,
the responsible party shall immediately take all necessary steps to ensure the
discovery, containment, and cleanup of such discharge at the responsible
party’s sole cost.
      B.   If the illicit discharge consists of hazardous materials, the
responsible party shall also immediately notify emergency response agencies of
the occurrence via emergency dispatch services.
      C.   If the illicit discharge emanates from a commercial or industrial
establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an
on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its
recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.
      D.   A report of an illicit discharge shall be made in person or by phone
or facsimile or email to the enforcement officer immediately but, in any event,
within 24 hours of the illicit discharge; notifications in person or by phone
shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed or emailed to the
enforcement officer within 24 hours of the personal or phone notice.
   4.   Any person or entity shall also report to the City any illicit
discharge or circumstances which such person or entity reasonably believes pose
a risk of an illicit discharge.
   5.   Upon receiving a report pursuant to the previous subsections, or
otherwise coming into possession of information indicating an actual or
imminent illicit discharge, the enforcement officer shall conduct an inspection
of the site as soon as reasonably possible and thereafter shall provide to the
responsible party, and any third-party reporter, a written report of the
conditions which may cause or which have already caused an illicit discharge.
The responsible party shall immediately commence corrective action or
remediation and shall complete such corrective action or remediation within 24
hours.
   6.   The enforcement officer shall be permitted to enter and inspect
property subject to regulation under this section as often as is necessary to
determine compliance with this section. If a responsible party has security
measures that require identification and clearance before entry to its property
or premises, the responsible party shall make the necessary arrangements to
allow access by the enforcement officer. By way of specification but not
limitation:
      A.   A responsible party shall allow the enforcement officer ready access
to all parts of the property for purposes of inspection, sampling, examination,
and copying of records related to a suspected, actual, or imminent illicit
discharge, and for the performance of any additional duties as defined by State
and federal law.
      B.   The enforcement officer shall have the right to set up on any
property such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the enforcement
officer to conduct monitoring or sampling related to a suspected, actual, or
imminent illicit discharge.
      C.   The enforcement officer shall have the right to require any
responsible party, at responsible party’s sole expense, to install monitoring
equipment and deliver monitoring data or reports to the enforcement officer as
the enforcement officer directs. The sampling and monitoring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the
responsible party at responsible party’s sole expense. All devices shall be
calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
      D.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
property to be inspected or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
responsible party at the written or oral order of the enforcement officer and
shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
responsible party.
      E.   An unreasonable delay in allowing the enforcement officer access to
a property is a violation of this chapter.
      F.   If the enforcement officer has been refused access to any part of
the property from an illicit connection or illicit discharge to a municipal
storm sewer is occurring, suspected, or imminent, and is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or
that there is a need to inspect or sample as part of a routine inspection and
sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order
issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare
of the community, then the enforcement officer may seek issuance of a search
warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
   7.   If it is determined that an illicit discharge is imminent or has
occurred, the actual administrative costs incurred by the City in the
enforcement of this chapter shall be recovered from the responsible party. The
enforcement officer shall submit an invoice to the responsible party reflecting
the actual costs and wages and expenses incurred by the City for the
enforcement activities undertaken. Failure to pay charges invoiced under this
chapter within 30 days of billing shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
147.06   SUSPENSION OF ACCESS TO THE CITY’S STORM SEWER SYSTEM.
   1.   Emergency Suspension. The enforcement officer may, without prior
notice, suspend storm sewer system access to a property when such emergency
suspension is necessary to stop an ongoing or imminent illicit discharge. If
the responsible party fails to immediately comply with an emergency suspension
order, the enforcement officer shall take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize the illicit discharge. All costs of such action shall be
recovered from the responsible party for the property identified as the source
of the illicit discharge.
   2.   Non-emergency Suspension. If the enforcement officer detects or is
informed of circumstances which could cause an illicit discharge but such
illicit discharge is not ongoing or imminent, and if the suspension of storm
sewer system access would reasonably be expected to prevent or reduce the
potential illicit discharge, the enforcement officer shall notify the
responsible party of the proposed suspension of storm sewer system access and
the time and date of such suspension. Notice to one responsible party for the
property shall be sufficient notice to all. Remediation of the circumstances
shall avoid a violation of this chapter, provided that no illicit discharge
occurs. In the alternative, the responsible party may request a meeting with
the enforcement officer for the purpose of presenting information which the
responsible party believes will show that remediation is unnecessary, and if
the enforcement officer finds such information is satisfactory, the enforcement
officer may rescind or modify the notice of suspension. If the enforcement
officer finds such information unsatisfactory, the enforcement officer shall
issue a final written order of suspension including the date and time of
suspension and such order may be appealed as provided herein. Any physical
action to reinstate storm sewer system access to property subject to such order
prior to obtaining a court order of relief shall be deemed a violation of this
chapter. An order of suspension shall not preclude charging the responsible
party with a municipal infraction as provided herein or taking any other
enforcement action permitted by statute or ordinance.
147.07   WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property below the elevation of the 100-year flood free of trash, debris,
grass clippings, or other organic wastes and other obstacles that would
pollute, contaminate, or significantly alter the quality of water flowing
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse.
147.08   ENFORCEMENT.
   1.   Violation of any provision of this chapter may be enforced by civil
action including an action for injunctive relief. In any civil enforcement
action, administrative or judicial, the City shall be entitled to recover its
attorneys’ fees and costs from a person who is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to have violated this chapter.
   2.   Violation of any provision of this chapter may also be enforced as a
municipal infraction within the meaning of Section 364.22 of the Code of Iowa,
pursuant to the City’s municipal infraction ordinance.
   3.   Enforcement pursuant to this section shall be undertaken by the
enforcement officer upon the advice and consent of the City Attorney.
147.09   APPEAL.
   Administrative decisions by City staff and enforcement actions of the
enforcement officer may be appealed by the applicant to the Council pursuant to
the following rules:
   1.   The appeal must be filed in writing with the Clerk within five business
days of the decision or enforcement action.
   2.   The written appeal shall specify in detail the action appealed from,
the errors allegedly made by the enforcement officer giving rise to the appeal,
a written summary of all oral and written testimony the applicant intends to
introduce at the hearing, including the names and addresses of all witnesses
the applicant intends to call, copies of all documents the applicant intends to
introduce at the hearing, and the relief requested.
   3.   The enforcement officer shall specify, in writing, the reasons for the
enforcement action, a written summary of all oral and written testimony the
enforcement officer intends to introduce at the hearing, including the names
and addresses of all witnesses the enforcement officer intends to call, and
copies of all documents the enforcement officer intends to introduce at the
hearing.
   4.   The Clerk shall notify the applicant and the enforcement officer by
ordinary mail, and shall give public notice in accordance with Chapter 21 of
the Code of Iowa, of the date, time, and place for the regular or special
meeting of the Council at which the hearing on the appeal shall occur. The
hearing shall be scheduled for a date not less than four or more than 20 days
after the filing of the appeal. The rules of evidence and procedure, and the
standard of proof to be applied, shall be the same as provided by Chapter 17A
of the Code of Iowa. The applicant may be represented by counsel at the
applicant’s expense. The enforcement officer may be represented by the City
Attorney or by an attorney designated by the Council at City expense. The
decision of the Council shall be rendered in writing and may be appealed to the
Iowa District Court.

148.03 Inspection Procedures 148.07 Performance Bond
148.04 Stop Work Order       148.08 Appeal
 
148.01   FINDINGS.
   1.   The U.S. EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
permit program (Program) administered by the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources (IDNR) requires that cities meeting certain demographic and
environmental impact criteria obtain from the IDNR an NPDES permit for the
discharge of stormwater from a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) (MS4
Permit). The City is subject to the Program and is required to obtain, and has
obtained, an MS4 Permit; the City’s MS4 Permit is on file at the office of the
Clerk and is available for public inspection during regular office hours.
   2.   The Program requires certain individuals engaged in construction
activities (applicant or applicants) to submit an application to the IDNR for a
State NPDES General Permit #2. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter,
every applicant bears final and complete responsibility for compliance with a
State NPDES General Permit #2 and a City COSESCO Permit and any other
requirement of State or federal law or administrative rule.
   3.   As a condition of the City’s MS4 Permit, the City is obliged to
undertake responsibility for administration and enforcement of the Program by
adopting a Construction Site Erosion and Sediment Control (COSESCO) Ordinance
designed to achieve the following objectives:
      A.   Any person, firm, sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation,
State agency, or political subdivision (“applicant”) required by law or
administrative rule to apply to the IDNR for a State NPDES General Permit #2
shall also be required to obtain from the City a Construction Site Erosion and
Sediment Control Permit (City COSESCO Permit) in addition to and not in lieu of
the State NPDES General Permit #2; and
      B.   The City shall have responsibility for inspection, monitoring, and
enforcement procedures to promote applicants’ compliance with State NPDES
General Permits #2 and City COSESCO Permits.
   4.   No State or federal funds have been made available to assist the City
in administering and enforcing the Program. Accordingly, the City shall fund
its application, inspection, monitoring, and enforcement responsibilities
entirely by fees imposed on the owners of properties which are made subject to
the Program by virtue of State and federal law, or other sources of funding
established by a separate ordinance.
   5.   Terms used in this chapter shall have the meanings specified in the
Program.
148.02   APPLICATION PROCEDURE.
   1.   All persons required by law or administrative rule to obtain a State

149.01   TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the “City of Altoona Post Construction
Stormwater Management Ordinance,” may be cited as such, and will be referred to
herein as “this chapter.”
149.02   PURPOSE.
   1.   The U.S. EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
permit program (Program) administered by the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources (IDNR) requires that cities meeting certain demographic and
environmental impact criteria obtain from the IDNR and NPDES permit for the
discharge of stormwater from a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) (MS4
Permit). The City is subject to the Program and is required to obtain, and has
obtained, an MS4 Permit. The City’s MS4 Permit is on file at the office of the
Clerk and is available for public inspection during regular office hours.
   2.   The purpose of this chapter is to comply with the MS4 Permit
requirements and establish a set of water quality and quantity policies
applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for the
regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water
resources from degradation. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from
land development and other construction activities in order to control and
minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream
channel erosion, and non-point source pollution associated with stormwater
runoff, is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and
safety.
149.03   WARNING.
   No person shall place reliance upon this chapter, any inspections performed,
or certificates issued pursuant to this chapter, as indicating the safety of or
quality of construction of any particular premises. Neither this chapter nor
inspections made pursuant thereto nor certificates issued are intended to
assume the duty of any person to adequately construct and maintain a premises
or provide a safe premises or to, in any way, indicate a decrease in the risk
associated with the use or occupancy of any premises. A certification that a
premises has been inspected pursuant to this chapter shall not in any way,

   1.   Every property owner or applicant required to have coverage under NPDES
General Permit #2, shall design, install, and maintain Post Construction
Stormwater Management Plan (PCSWMP) facilities as approved by the Council
during the Site Plan, Construction Drawing, or Platting process.
   2.   A State licensed professional engineer or landscape architect shall
design PCSWMP facilities in conformance with the guidelines established in the
Iowa Stormwater Management Manual and SUDAS. PCSWMP facilities shall be
designed with appropriate BMPs, such as detention and retention basins, grass
swales, buffer strips, bio-retention, and other similar types of infiltration
basins and riparian areas, that will convey drainage through the property to
one or more treatment areas such that no development shall cause downstream
property owners, water courses, channels, or conduits to receive stormwater
runoff from the proposed development site at a peak flow rate greater than that
allowed by the standards in effect at the time of approval of the development.
   3.   In order to ensure that the PCSWMP facilities are constructed in
accordance with the approved design, the property owner or applicant shall
provide to the City an as-built plan detailing dimensions and elevations as
well as certification that the approved facilities were installed and working
properly. The as-built plan shall be completed by a State licensed professional
engineer or landscape architect and submitted to the City prior to the
acceptance of any public improvements or issuance of any Certificate of
Occupancy.
   4.   At the discretion of the City, the property owner or applicant may
satisfy the PCSWMP requirements by ensuring the conveyance of stormwater
discharge from the property to a regional detention facility.
149.07   MAINTENANCE.
   It shall be the property owner’s duty to ensure that the site is
periodically inspected and maintained in accordance with the approved PCSWMP.

with the approved PCSWMP.
   Additionally, the City may request that a property owner verify, through the
preparation of an as-built plan completed by a State licensed professional
engineer or landscape architect, that the PCSWMP facilities contain appropriate
capacities and operational characteristics as originally designed and approved.
   3.   In the event that a site is found not to be in compliance with the
PCSWMP, the City will communicate, in writing, with the property owner a list
of deficiencies that identifies the area or incident of noncompliance. The
property owner shall have 14 days from the date of notice to provide a written
response outlining the steps and implementation timelines for corrective
action. The property owner shall have 30 days from the date of notice to
complete the corrective action necessary to bring the site back into compliance
with the approved PCSWMP.
   4.   Following the review of the property owner’s written response, if
extenuating circumstances exist which makes implementation of the necessary
corrective action difficult to complete within the specified time period, the
City may grant, at its sole discretion, a reasonable extension of time to
complete the corrective action. Failure of the property owner to allow access
to the property, provide a written response or undertake corrective action
shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
149.09   CORRECTIVE ACTION BY CITY.
   If the property owner fails to take corrective action, following notice
prescribed for the service of civil process by the Iowa Rules of Civil
Procedure, the City may do so by its own crews or by persons under its hire and
assess against the property owner the City’s cost therefore. Said costs shall
include the salaries and benefits earned by City employees during such
corrective action, a charge for City machinery used and such other costs and
expenses as the City actually incurred. To the extent allowed by State law,
such costs and expenses may be assessed against the property owner and
collected in the same manner as a property tax.
149.10   RESPONSIBILITY.
   The failure of City officials to observe or foresee hazardous or unsightly
conditions, or to impose other or additional conditions or requirements, or to
deny or revoke permits or approvals, or to stop work in violation of this
chapter shall not relieve the property owners of the consequences of their
actions or inactions or result in the City, its officers, or agents being
liable therefore or on account thereof. Notwithstanding any provision of this
chapter, every applicant bears final and complete responsibility for compliance
with the NPDES General Permit #2 and any other requirements of State or federal
law or administrative rule.

   Violation of any provision of this chapter may be enforced by civil action
including an action for injunctive relief. In any civil enforcement action,
administrative or judicial, the City shall be entitled to recover its
attorneys’ fees and costs from a person who is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to have violated this chapter. Violation of any
provision of this chapter may also be enforced as a municipal infraction within

      6.   Fees. Section 109 of the IBC, Section 108 of the IEBC, and Section

      Fees
         1.   Permit Fees:
            A.   A fee for each Building Permit shall be paid to the Building
Official in the amount set forth in the Schedule of Fees as adopted by the
Council. Building Permit fees are figured on valuation. Valuation is figured by
totaling square footage according to type of building or value of project. The
amounts used to determine the valuation shall be set by the Building Official
as determined necessary but not to exceed more than once in 12-month period,
typically beginning in January or February of each year. No Building Permits
shall be issued to any person who has fees outstanding as required by this Code
or any other laws or ordinances of the City.
            B.   The determination of value or valuation under any of the
provisions of the Building Code shall be made by the Building Official. The
valuation to be used in computing the permit and plan-check fees shall be the
total value of all construction work for which the permit is issued, as well as
all finish work, painting, roofing, electrical, plumbing, heating, air
conditioning, elevators, fire extinguishing systems, and any other permanent
work or permanent equipment. A fee for each Building Permit shall be paid to
the Building Official in the amount set forth in the Schedule of Fees as
adopted by the Council.
            C.   If a permit is issued for a specific amount of work and, upon
inspection, it is determined that more work was performed than was authorized
by the permit, the permittee shall amend the permit or obtain another permit to
include all additional work and shall pay a new base fee and any unit fees as
described in Paragraph A above.
            D.   Permits and Fees for mechanical, plumbing, and electrical work
shall meet the requirements of Chapters 156, 157, or 158 respectively.
         2.   Additional permit fees are as follows:
            A.   Plan Check Fees. Plan Check Fees shall be in the amount set
forth in the Schedule of Fees as adopted by the Council.
            B.   Sidewalks and Approaches. Sidewalks and approaches shall be
constructed with all new buildings. All approaches must be minimum six inches
thick concrete from street to property line. Fees for sidewalks and approaches
shall be in the amount set forth in the Schedule of Fees as adopted by the
Council.
            C.   Foundations. The fee for a permit to construct only a
foundation shall be 150 percent of the fee in the amount set forth in the
Schedule of Fees as adopted by the Council. For purposes of this determination,
the valuation of the foundation shall be considered to be 10 percent of the
total building valuation.
            D.   Accessibility Review Fee. A fee in the amount set forth in the
Schedule of Fees as adopted by the Council shall be charged for the review of
plans in accordance with Sec 661-16.303 of the Iowa Administrative Code and
Chapter 11 of the IBC for handicap accessibility provisions. The review fee
shall not be required for construction for and associated with one- and two-
family dwellings and for projects with an assessed value of construction of
less than $2,000.00.
            E.   Thermal Efficiency Standards. In addition to other fees
required in this section, a fee in the amount set forth in the Schedule of Fees
as adopted by the Council shall be paid to the Building Official for the review
of plans and inspection of construction for compliance with the thermal
efficiency standards of the State Building Code.
            F.   Double Fee. Except in emergency situations, as determined by
the Building Official, where work for which a Building Permit is required by
this Code is started or proceeded with by any person prior to obtaining a
required permit, the fees in the amount set forth in the Schedule of Fees as
adopted by the Council shall be doubled. The payment of such double fee shall
not relieve any person from fully complying with the requirements of this Code
in the execution of the work or from any other penalties prescribed herein. No
additional permits of any type shall be issued to any person who owes the City
the double fee described in this subsection. However, no double fee shall be
imposed upon any person who starts without a permit if:
            The work is started on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, or during
any other day when the Building Department is not normally open for business,
and the person secures the proper permit on the next Building Department
working day.
            G.   Refunds. If, within 30 days of the date of issuance, the
holder of a Building Permit decides not to commence the work described in said
permit, said person may, upon application to the Building Official, be refunded
that portion of the permit fee which is in excess of the permit refund fee in
as set forth in the Schedule of Fees as adopted by the Council.
            H.   Fees for Permit Renewals. Shall be based on the percentage of
valuation of remaining work to be performed provided the plans are not changed.
If the plans are changed enough to warrant a review, then the permit fee shall
be half the cost of the original fee, plus any fees as set forth in
Subparagraph J.
            *Exception. Or the hourly cost to the jurisdiction, whichever is
greater. This cost shall include supervision, overhead, hourly wages, and
fringe benefits of the employees involved.
            I.   Reinspections. A reinspection fee may be assessed for each
inspection or reinspection when such portion of work for which inspection is
called is not complete or when corrections called for are not made. This
section is not to be interpreted as requiring reinspection fees the first time
a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of this Code, but
as controlling the practice of calling for inspections before the job is ready
for such inspection or reinspection. Reinspection fees may be assessed when the
approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure to
provide access on the date for which inspection is requested, or for deviating
from plans requiring the approval of the Building Official. To obtain a
reinspection, the applicant shall pay the reinspection fee as set forth in the
Schedule of Fees as adopted by the Council. In instances where reinspection
fees have been assessed, no additional inspection of the work will be performed
until the required fees have been paid.
            J.   Other Inspections and Fees. See the schedule of fees as
adopted by Council.
      Persons performing work for the federal Government, the State, the
County, or City may obtain permits for such work without paying the permit fees
described herein; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be

155.07   DEMOLITION OF BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
   1.   Permit Required; Expiration.
      A.   No person shall commence the work of demolishing any building or
structure until a permit authorizing such work has been obtained from the
Building Official. Every demolition permit issued under the provisions of this
Code shall expire by limitation and become null and void if the work authorized
by such permit is not commenced within seven calendar days from the date of
issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is not completed within 30
calendar days of the date of issuance, unless, because of the extensiveness of
the project, the Building Official deems at the time of issuance, a longer
period for either commencement or completion should be granted.
      B.   Any permittee holding an unexpired demolition permit may request in
writing an extension of time within which the demolition work may be commenced
or completed. If such request contains good and satisfactory reasons showing
that circumstances beyond the control of the permittee have prevented timely
commencement or completion of the work, the Building Official may extend the
applicable expiration date.
      C.   The fee for such permit shall be at the same rate as the original
permit.
      D.   If a demolition permit to remove an unsafe building, or a building
that is the subject of a public nuisance action has expired, the Building
Official shall order the prompt removal of such structure, in accordance with
all requirements of this chapter. All of the costs attendant to this action,
including administrative costs, shall be either assessed against the property
or collected from the owner unless otherwise directed by the Council.
   2.   Application for Permit. Application for a permit to demolish a building
or structure shall be made to the Building Official. The applicant shall
provide the following information:
      A.   In the case of demolition by explosives, the applicant shall furnish
the information required in this subsection and shall furnish information
regarding the person who will be conducting the demolition by explosives and
shall furnish plans showing how the building or structure will be prepared for
demolition, the type and amount of explosives to be used; and a detailed plan
showing what safety precautions will be taken to protect persons and property.
      B.   A permit for the demolition of a building or structure by the use of
explosives may be issued by the Council subject to the following:
         (1)   The applicant for a permit must demonstrate to the Council the
need for demolition by explosives rather than demolition by conventional means
and must demonstrate that demolition by explosives can be safely conducted at
the specific location requested.
         (2)   The Building Official, Fire Chief, and Police Chief shall review
the application and submit their opinions to the Council concerning whether or
not the demolition can be safely conducted together with any recommendations
they may have.
         (3)   The applicant shall provide a certificate of liability insurance
for personal injuries, death, and for property damage in an amount not less
than $1,000,000.00 naming the City as an additional named insured party. The
certificate shall provide that the coverage shall not be canceled or changed
without 10 days’ prior written notice to the City. The Council may require
additional insurance coverage in instances where the hazard appears greater
than normally expected and may also in such instances require the posting of a
bond acceptable to the City in an amount commensurate with the severity of the
hazard. The bond shall provide that the applicant shall well and satisfactorily
perform the demolition. The bond shall be for the benefit of the City and any
person who is injured or damaged by the failure of the applicant to
satisfactorily perform the demolition.
         (4)   The applicant shall agree to indemnify and hold harmless the
City from all losses resulting from damages or injuries caused by the applicant
or the applicant’s employees, servants, or agents arising out of the use of
explosives in demolition.
         (5)   The applicant shall pay the City in advance for reasonable
expenses that will be incurred by the City in furnishing necessary security and
police protection in the vicinity of the demolition site.
         (6)   The applicant shall observe all applicable federal, State, and
local laws in the course of the demolition including but not limited to the
following:
            a.   The applicable provisions of the Fire Prevention Code relating
to the storage, transportation, and use of explosives.
            b.   The rules and regulations of the United States Environmental
Protection Agency relating to the demolition of buildings or structures
containing asbestos materials or other hazardous air pollutants.
         (7)   The applicant shall meet all other requirements of this chapter
relating to the demolition of structures or buildings, provided, however, that
should a conflict exist between the provisions of this paragraph and other
provisions of the Code of Ordinances, the provisions of the paragraph shall be
deemed controlling.
         (8)   The applicant need not obtain an obstruction permit as provided
in Section 155.08 of this chapter to block off portions of the public property
within an appropriate distance of the demolition site provided that the
obstruction is for less than a 24-hour period and provided that the obstruction
is for security purposes in connection with the use of explosives. However, the
applicant shall be required to obtain an obstruction permit to use public
property in the cleanup operations following the detonation of explosives.
         (9)   The Council shall at any time have the authority to impose
additional requirements and safety precautions in the interest of the public
health, safety, and welfare.
   3.   Permit - Issuance, Validity, Expiration, Revocation, Fees.
      A.   Except as otherwise provided in this section, the issuance,

   5.   Permit - Bond Required.
      A.   Before a permit is issued to remove a building which has been
ordered removed as a public nuisance pursuant to the provisions of the
International Building Code and International Residential Code, and which
period of time granted by the courts for removal or other remedial action by
the applicants or other party of interest has expired, the applicant may be
required to post a cash bond equal to the estimated costs of the removal of the
building and the disconnection of the existing utility services. If the
building is not removed by the applicant at the time the permit expires at a
time specified by the Building Official, such bond shall be forfeited and used
toward the costs of the City to remove it.
      B.   If the building is removed by the applicant prior to the time the
permit expires, such bond shall be returned to the applicant. A return of the
bond does not exempt the applicant from further assessments to the real estate
for costs which have occurred prior to the issuance of the permit.
   6.   General Requirements.
      A.   The Building Official shall have the authority to impose at any time
reasonable requirements and safety precautions in the interest of public
health, safety, and welfare which, in the opinion of the Building Official, are
commensurate with the severity of hazard, either demonstrated or anticipated,
provided that such requirements may be appealed to, and reviewed by, the Board
of Appeals at the request of the affected party.
      B.   In addition, the following provisions shall be met:
         (1)   The discharging, loading, or dumping of building materials from
any building shall be accomplished in such manner as to minimize the creation
of dust and scattering of debris. Materials shall not be dropped by gravity to
any point lying outside the building walls except through an enclosed chute,
unless such materials are dust free and the height of drop is at least equal to
the horizontal distance to the nearest property or barricade line. Where such
horizontal distance is not available and practical necessity dictates the
dropping of relatively large masses of materials, the Building Official may
approve appropriate protective measures designed to provide protection from
danger equivalent to that afforded by the otherwise required horizontal
setback, provided however, that in all cases, such materials shall be handled
in a manner approved by the Air Pollution Control Division of the County Health
Department.
         (2)   When necessary to protect the public health, safety, or welfare,
every demolition project shall be barricaded, fenced, lighted, and signed with
warning or directional signs in a manner approved by the Building Official. The
Building Official may also require the presence of approved security guards or
flagmen. Such barricades, fences, lights, and signs as may be deemed necessary
by the Building Official for protection of the public shall be maintained after
completion of the demolition work until such time as the site is cleaned of all
debris and all excavations, basements, and depressions in the ground are
restored to grade and rendered harmless.
         (3)   Adequate precautions shall be taken to insure that procedures or
conditions relating to the demolition work do not constitute a fire hazard. If,
in the opinion of the Fire Chief, a fire hazard exists, or is likely to exist,
the Fire Chief may order the cessation of work or require that appropriate
protective measures, approved by the Fire Chief, be taken.
         (4)   All streets, alleys, and public ways adjacent to the demolition
site shall be kept free and clear of any rubbish, refuse, and loose materials
resulting from the demolition work unless an obstruction permit for such space
has been obtained.
Upon completion of the demolition work, the site shall be left in a clean,
smooth condition. Inorganic building rubble, sand, clean earth, or other
approved fill material may be used to fill excavations, basements, and
depressions, provided that the top 12 inches shall be clean earth or its
equivalent in terms of surface smoothness, freedom from dust, and cleanliness.
If the surface is to be used for the parking of vehicles, it shall be
constructed as required in the Zoning Code.
155.08   OBSTRUCTION PERMIT; BOND AND INSURANCE.
   Obstruction permits shall meet the requirements of Chapter 141. Building
permits shall be obtained for work performed in the public right-of-way in

exterior wall to be so constructed, the owner of the building shall furnish the
Building Official with either:
      A.   A copy of an easement or covenant running with the land applicable
throughout the existence of the proposed building in which those with interests
in the property abutting the side of the property on which said exterior wall
is to be constructed agree not to construct a wall set forth in said Sections
602, 705, or R302 which would require said exterior wall and said building on
such abutting property to have the opening protection of said Sections 602,
705, or R302 which copy shall show the book and page where such document has
been filed of record in the office of the County Recorder; or
      B.   An agreement, in a form capable of being filed of record in the
office of the County Recorder, for the benefit of those with interest in the
abutting property, by which the owner of the building and the owner of the
property on which said building is to be built, jointly and severally agree, on
behalf of themselves and their successors and assigns for so long as said
building is in existence, that, in consideration for being permitted to
building an exterior wall on said building without complying with said Sections
602, 705, or R302 at such time as a building is erected on the abutting
property within the distances to said exterior wall contained is said Sections
602, 705, or R302 then they shall modify or rebuild said exterior wall to
conform at least to the requirements of said Sections 602 and 705 applicable to
the actual separations of the building; said agreement shall be recorded at the
expense of the applicant for the building permit.
   2.   Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 602 or 705 of the IBC and
Section R302 of the IRC, an exterior wall may be constructed with openings
adjacent to a public street or alley right-of-way without complying with the
requirements of such sections related to opening protection, provided the
following conditions are each satisfied:
      A.   The setback between the exterior wall and the far side of the
adjoining public right-of-way must conform at least to the requirements of such
Sections 602, 705, or R302 applicable to the actual separation of building.
      B.   The Council has by resolution declared an intent to permanently
maintain the adjoining right-of-way as a public street or alley, and to never
permit a structure to be constructed or placed upon the right-of-way within the
required separation from the exterior wall. The resolution shall specifically
describe the affected right-of-way and shall be in a form that can be recorded
and indexed into the records of the County Recorder.
      C.   The owner of the building has furnished a copy of the Council
resolution described above, which copy shall show the book and page where such
document has been filed of record in the office of the County Recorder.
155.10   PERMANENT OCCUPANCY OF PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   1.   No part of any structure or any appendage thereto, except signs, shall
project beyond the property line of the building site, except as specified in
this Code, provided, however, that a structure or appendage thereto may project

has provided proof of employment by said licensed mechanical contractor. Any
permit required by the provisions of this Code may be revoked by the Building
Official upon the violation of any provision of this Code.
         2.   A State licensed mechanical contractor shall be allowed only to
secure permits for themselves, or for a single firm or corporation. When a
State licensed mechanical contractor has secured such a permit, only the
employees of such contractor when meeting the provisions of Chapter 105 of the
Code of Iowa shall perform the work for which the permit was obtained.
         3.   For purposes of this section, an “employee” shall be one employed
by the contractor, firm, or corporation for a wage or salary. A contractor may
be required by the Building Official to show positive evidence as to the
employee status of workers on the job. Such evidence shall be in the form of
payroll and time records, canceled checks, or other such documents.
         4.   The contractor may also be required to show the agreement or
contract pertaining to the work being questioned as evidence that said
contractor is, in fact, the actual contractor for such work. Failure or refusal
by the contractor to make available such employee or contractual records within
24 hours from demand therefor shall be grounds for immediate revocation of any
permit for the work in question.
      6.   Expiration. Section 106.4.3 of the IMC and Section 106.5.3 of the
IFGC shall be amended by deleting said sections and replacing with the
following:
      Every permit, issued by the Building Official under the provision of the
Mechanical Code shall expire under any one of the following conditions:
         1.   Failure to begin work authorized within 180 days after issuance
of the permit.
         2.   Suspension or abandonment of work for 120 days after commencement
of the work. Time of occurrence of suspension or abandonment of work shall be
computed from the date of the most recent inspection since which no progress
has been made.
         3.   Failure to complete work on a structure designed for residential
uses within one year after issuance of a permit.
         4.   Failure to complete work on a structure designed for commercial
or industrial uses within two years after issuance of a permit. For permits
with a building valuation exceeding $10,000,000.00, work shall be completed
within three years after issuance of a permit.
      Any permittee holding an unexpired permit may apply for an extension of
the time within which they may commence or continue work. The Building Official
is authorized to grant, in writing, for periods not more than 180 days each,
two extensions. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable
cause demonstrated. Any of the extensions may be further extended by action of
the Council. In all cases, when a renewal is granted, the structure for which
the permit is required shall comply with Code requirements in effect at the
time the permit is renewed.
      7.   Permit Fees. Section 106.5 of the IMC and Section 106.6 of the IFGC
shall be amended by deleting said sections and replacing with the following:
         1.   Permit Fees.
            A.   A fee for each mechanical permit shall be paid to the Building
Official in the amount set in the Schedule of Fees adopted by the Council. No
mechanical permits shall be issued to any person who has fees outstanding as
required by this Code or any other laws or ordinances of the City.
            B.   If a permit is issued for a specific amount of work and, upon
inspection, it is determined that more work was performed than was authorized
by the permit, the permittee shall amend the permit or obtain another permit to
include all additional work and shall pay a new base fee and any unit fees as
described in Paragraph A.
         2.   Additional permit fees are as follows:
            A.   Double Fee. Except in emergency situations, as determined by
the Building Official, where work for which a Mechanical Permit is required by
this Code is started or proceeded with by any person prior to obtaining a
required permit, the fees specified as set forth in the amount set in the
Schedule of Fees as adopted by the Council shall be doubled. The payment of
such double fee shall not relieve any person from fully complying with the
requirements of this Code in the execution of the work or from any other
penalties prescribed herein. No additional permits of any type shall be issued
to any person who owes the City the double fee described in this subsection.
However, no double fee shall be imposed upon any person who starts without a
permit if:
               (1)   The work is started on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, or
during any other day when the Building Department is not normally open for
business; and
               (2)   The person secures the proper permit on the next Building
Department working day.
            B.   Refunds. If, within 30 days of the date of issuance, the
holder of a Mechanical Permit decides not to commence the work described in
said permit, said person may, upon application to the Building Official, be
refunded that portion of the permit fee which is in excess of the permit refund
fee set in the Schedule of Fees adopted by the Council.
            C.   Fees for permit renewals shall be based on the amount of
remaining work to be completed. If the plans are changed enough to warrant a
review, then the permit fee shall be ½ the cost of the original fee plus any
fees as set forth in Paragraph E.
      *Or the hourly cost to the jurisdiction, whichever is greater. This cost
shall include supervision, overhead, hourly wages, and fringe benefits of the
employees involved.
            D.   Reinspections. A reinspection fee may be assessed for each
inspection or reinspection when such portion of work for which inspection is
called is not complete or when corrections called for are not made. This
section is not to be interpreted as requiring reinspection fees the first time
a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of this Code, but
as controlling the practice of calling for inspections before the job is ready
for such inspection or reinspection. Reinspection fees may be assessed when the
approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure to
provide access on the date for which inspection is requested, or for deviating
from plans requiring the approval of the Building Official. To obtain a
reinspection, the applicant shall pay the reinspection fee in accordance with
the Schedule of Fees as adopted by Council. In instances where reinspection
fees have been assessed, no additional inspection of the work will be performed
until the required fees have been paid.
            E.   Other Inspections and Fees. See the Schedule of Fees as
adopted by the Council by resolution.
      Persons performing work for the federal government, the State, the
County, or City may obtain permits for such work without paying the permit fees
described herein; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be
construed to exempt payment of permit fees by persons performing work under the
direction of the City in connection with the abatement of any public law. An
expired permit may not be reissued without a permit fee, except by resolution
of the Council.
      8.   Stop Work Orders. Section 108.5 of the IMC and IFGC shall be amended
by deleting the last sentence and replacing with the following:
      Any person who shall continue any work on the system after having been
served with a stop work order, except such work as that person is directed to
perform to remove a violation or unsafe condition, shall be subject to civil
penalties as defined in Chapter 3 Municipal Infractions of this Code of
Ordinances.
      9.   Ductless Mini-Split System Traps. Section 307.2.4.1 shall be amended
by adding the following to the end of the last sentence: or according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations.
      10.   Copper Tubing Joints. Section 1107.5.4 shall be amended by adding
the following to the end of the section: All press-connect fittings must be
listed and labeled for refrigerant piping and installed per manufacturer’s
instructions.
156.04   LICENSING FOR ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING, AND MECHANICAL CONTRACTORS AND
INSTALLERS.
   The provisions of Chapter 160 shall be applicable for any work performed in
regards to electrical, plumbing, and mechanical systems.
156.05   BOARD OF APPEALS.
   In order to hear and decide appeals of orders, decisions, or determinations
made by the Building Official relative to the application and interpretation of
this Code, there shall be and hereby created a Board of Appeals, consisting of
five members. Board members shall be chosen and appointed based on diversity
and building construction knowledge, all of whom shall be residents of the
City. One member of said Board of Appeals at a minimum shall be a private
citizen. The Building Official shall be an ex-officio member without a vote and
shall act as secretary of the Board. The appointment of members shall be for
four-year terms, expiring on December 31, with not more than three members’
terms expiring any one year. The Building Board of Appeals shall be appointed
by the Mayor, subject to Council approval, and shall serve without
compensation. The Board shall adopt reasonable rules and regulations for
conducting its investigations and shall render all decisions and findings in
writing to the Building Official with a duplicate copy to the appellant, and
may recommend to the Council such new legislation as is consistent therewith.
The Building Board of Appeals shall meet at will and when there are appeals or
business on file for a hearing. Nominal appeal fee to the Building Board of
Appeals shall be paid as set forth in Section 156.03, Permit Fees. The appeal
shall be valid for one year from the date of the Building Board of Appeals
approval to the commencement of work and to the completion of work undertaken
pursuant to the approval.

deleting the section and replacing with the following: “There is hereby
established in the City the Department of Plumbing Inspections, which shall be
under the direction and supervision of the Building and Zoning Official. The
Building Official shall be responsible to the Community Development Director
for the enforcement of the Plumbing Codes, and such other ordinances as shall
assign the Building Official that function, and shall perform such other duties
as may be required by the Community Development Director or by any
classification plan adopted by the City. Additional responsibilities of the
Building Official shall be assigned as required per Chapter 155 of the City of
Altoona, Code of Ordinances.”
      2.   Permit Issuance. Section 106.5 shall be added to the end of the
section to state as follows:
         1.   Permits Are Not Transferable. Plumbing work performed under the
provisions of this chapter must be done by a contractor meeting the licensing
provisions as set forth by the State Plumbing and Mechanical Systems Board in
accordance with Chapter 105 of the Code of Iowa, unless the provisions of
Section 155.13 of the Municipal Code are met. A plumbing contractor licensee by
the State Plumbing and Mechanical Systems Board as a “Master” may sign and
obtain a permit for the contractor for which they are employed only when said
“Master” has provided proof of employment by said licensed plumbing contractor.
Any permit required by the provisions of this Code may be revoked by the
Building Official upon the violation of any provision of this Code.
         2.   A State licensed plumbing contractor shall be allowed only to
secure permits for themselves, or for a single firm or corporation. When a
State licensed plumbing contractor has secured such a permit, only the
employees of such contractor, when meeting the provisions of Chapter 105 of the
Code of Iowa, shall perform the work for which the permit was obtained.
         3.   For purposes of this section, an “employee” shall be one employed
by the contractor, firm, or corporation for a wage or salary. A contractor may
be required by the Building Official to show positive evidence as to the
employee status of workers on the job. Such evidence shall be in the form of
payroll and time records, canceled checks, or other such documents.
         4.   The contractor may also be required to show the agreement or
contract pertaining to the work being questioned as evidence that said
contractor is, in fact, the actual contractor for such work. Failure or refusal
by the contractor to make available such employee or contractual records within
24 hours from demand therefor shall be grounds for immediate revocation of any
permit for the work in question.
      3.   Expiration. Section 106.5.3 shall be amended by deleting the section
and replacing with the following:
         106.5.3 Expiration. Every permit, issued by the Building Official
under the provision of the Plumbing Code shall expire under any one of the
following conditions:
         1.   Failure to begin work authorized within 180 days after issuance
of the permit.
         2.   Suspension or abandonment of work for 120 days after commencement
of the work. Time of occurrence of suspension or abandonment of work shall be
computed from the date of the most recent inspection since which no progress
has been made.
         3.   Failure to complete work on a structure designed for residential
uses within one year after issuance of a permit.
         4.   Failure to complete work on a structure designed for commercial
or industrial uses within two years after issuance of a permit. For permits
with a building valuation exceeding $10,000,000.00 work shall be completed
within three years after issuance of a permit.
      Any permittee holding an unexpired permit may apply for an extension of
the time within which they may commence or continue work. The Building Official
is authorized to grant, in writing, for periods not more than 180 days each,
two extensions. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable
cause demonstrated. Any of the extensions may be further extended by action of
the Council. In all cases, when a renewal is granted, the structure for which
the permit is required shall comply with code requirements in effect at the
time the permit is renewed.
      4.   Permit Fees. Section 106.6 shall be amended by deleting the section
and replacing with the following:
         1.   Permit Fees:
            A.   A fee for each plumbing permit shall be paid to the Building
Official in the amount set in the Schedule of Fees adopted by the Council. No
plumbing permits shall be issued to any person who has fees outstanding as
required by this Code or any other laws or ordinances of the City.
            B.   If a permit is issued for a specific amount of work and, upon
inspection, it is determined that more work was performed than was authorized
by the permit, the permittee shall amend the permit or obtain another permit to
include all additional work and shall pay a new base fee and any unit fees as
described in Paragraph A.
         2.   Additional permit fees are as follows:
            A.   Double Fee. Except in emergency situations, as determined by
the Building Official, where work for which a plumbing permit is required by
this Code is started or proceeded with by any person prior to obtaining a
required permit, the fees specified as set forth in the amount set in the
Schedule of Fees as adopted by the Council shall be doubled. The payment of
such double fee shall not relieve any person from fully complying with the
requirements of this Code in the execution of the work or from any other
penalties prescribed herein. No additional permits of any type shall be issued
to any person who owes the City the double fee described in this subsection.
However, no double fee shall be imposed upon any person who starts without a
permit if:
               (1)   The work is started on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, or
during any other day when the Building Department is not normally open for
business; and
               (2)   The person secures the proper permit on the next Building
Department working day.
            B.   Refunds. If, within 30 days of the date of issuance, the
holder of a plumbing permit decides not to commence the work described in said
permit, said person may, upon application to the Building Official, be refunded
that portion of the permit fee which is in excess of the permit refund fee as
set forth in the Schedule of Fees as adopted by the Council.
            C.   Fees for Permit Renewals shall be based on the amount of
remaining work to be completed. If the plans are changed enough to warrant a
review then the permit fee shall be half the cost of the original fee plus any
fees as set forth in Paragraph E.
      *Or the hourly cost to the jurisdiction, whichever is greater. This cost
shall include supervision, overhead, hourly wages, and fringe benefits of the
employees involved.
            D.   Reinspections. A reinspection fee may be assessed for each
inspection or reinspection when such portion of work for which inspection is
called is not complete or when corrections called for are not made. This
section is not to be interpreted as requiring reinspection fees the first time
a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of this Code, but
as controlling the practice of calling for inspections before the job is ready
for such inspection or reinspection. Reinspection fees may be assessed when the
approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure to
provide access on the date for which inspection is requested, or for deviating
from plans requiring the approval of the Building Official. To obtain a
reinspection, the applicant shall pay the reinspection fee in accordance with
the Schedule of Fees as set forth in the Schedule of Fees as adopted by the
Council. In instances where reinspection fees have been assessed, no additional
inspection of the work will be performed until the required fees have been
paid.
            E.   Other Inspections and Fees. See the Schedule of Fees as
adopted by the Council.
      Persons performing work for the federal government, the State, the
County, or City may obtain permits for such work without paying the permit fees
described herein; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be
construed to exempt payment of permit fees by persons performing work under the
direction of the City in connection with the abatement of any public law.
      An expired permit may not be reissued without a permit fee, except by
resolution of the Council.
      5.   Stop Work Orders. Section 108.5 shall be amended by deleting the
last sentence and replacing with the following: “Any person who shall continue
any work on the system after having been served with a stop work order, except
such work as that person is directed to perform to remove a violation or unsafe
condition, shall be subject to civil penalties as defined in Chapter 3.
      6.   Freezing. Section 305.4 shall be amended by deleting “Exterior water
supply system piping shall be installed not less than six inches below the
frost line and not less than 12 inches below grade.” and replacing with
“Exterior water supply system piping shall, whenever feasible, be no less than
five feet below the surface of the ground.”
      7.   Drainage and Vent Air Test. Section 312.3 shall be amended by
deleting the first sentence in the paragraph.
      8.   Minimum Number of Required Plumbing Fixtures. Table 403.1 shall be
amended by deleting footnote e and replacing with the following footnote e:
         e.   For business and mercantile occupancies with an occupant load of
30 or fewer, service sinks shall not be required.
      9.   Small Occupancies. Section 410.2 shall be amended by deleting the
section and replacing with the following:
         410.2 Small Occupancies. Drinking fountains are not required for an
occupant load of 50 or fewer; however, a bottled water dispenser shall be
provided for occupancies with an occupant load between 16 and 49. For
occupancies less than 100, individual water bottles that are readily available,
offered continuously without fee, and displayed with approved signage within
the public area shall be allowed in place of drinking fountains or water
dispensers.
      10.   Floor Drains. Section 413.3 shall be amended by adding the

157.06   SEWER SERVICE LINES MAINTENANCE.
   All costs and expenses incident to the installation, connection, and
maintenance of the building sewer as well as the storm sewer service line (the
service line being the pipe from the storm sewer main to the structure) shall
be borne by the property owner. The owner shall indemnify the City from any
loss or damage that may, directly or indirectly, be occasioned by the
installation or maintenance of the building sewer as well as the storm sewer
service line.
157.07   SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE.
   The provisions of Section
157.08, which relate to subsurface drainage, shall apply to all subsurface
drainage from buildings whether new or existing. In the event such drainage
would discharge to a point upon or so adjacent to a public sidewalk or street
as to permit the water so discharged to drain upon a public sidewalk or street
during periods of community emergency generated by extra ordinarily high levels
of precipitation is permissible upon approval.
157.08   SECONDARY STORM SEWER.
   No building permits shall be issued for any structure in the City until
provisions have been made to provide for secondary storm sewers to drain all
subsurface and foundation drains in compliance with the following:
   1.   Sanitary Sewers - Prohibited Discharge. No person shall discharge or
cause to be discharged any stormwater runoff, surface or groundwater, roof
runoff, or subsurface drainage by a direct or indirect connection into the
sanitary sewer system for any new construction within the area served by the
City. Prohibited subsurface drainage shall include both interior and exterior
foundation drains into the sanitary sewer system.
   2.   Foundation Drain Discharge - Alternative Methods. All foundation drains
shall be disposed of in one of the two following alternative methods:
      A.   Sump Pump. A sump pump shall meet the provisions of the
International Residential Code, when applicable, or the International Plumbing
Code. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 901.2.1 of the International
Plumbing Code, in single-family dwellings, sumps of approved construction to
which no fixtures except one floor drain are connected, and which receive only
laundry wastes or basement drainage, need not be vented.
      B.   Alternative Method. Upon submission of plans and specifications to
the City Engineer or Building Official by any developer for an alternate method
of disposing of said waters which can be shown to be as effective as the above,
then said proposed method shall be allowed by the City Engineer or Building
Official.
   3.   Secondary Storm Sewer Details. Secondary storm sewers shall be
constructed in accordance with the following:
      A.   Design and Materials. Discharge from footing drains and sump pumps
must be discharged into a secondary storm sewer system or alternative drainage
way as approved by the City Engineer or the Building Official. Piping for
secondary storm sewer system shall be PVC pipe with thickness of SDR Series 35,
or thicker, with joints capable of pressure loadings for periods when all sump
pumps may be operating simultaneously. The secondary storm sewer system shall
be located in the same manner as the normal storm sewer location unless it can
otherwise be shown that a different location is advantageous and acceptable. It
shall be equipped with an approved flap valve at the discharge end and shall
have a sealed lid manhole at the upper terminus.
      B.   Capacity. The line shall be so designed as to accommodate the
required flows based upon the assumption that:
         (1)   With one-half of the sump pumps pumping at 20 GPM (average 10
GPM per residence), the secondary storm sewer will handle all flows by gravity
with pipe flowing full with velocity of minimum two FPS;
         (2)   With all sump pumps pumping (each at 20 GPM), the velocity in
the secondary storm sewer system shall not exceed 10 feet per second and the
friction loss shall not exceed five feet per 100 feet of pipe; and
         (3)   That the minimum size shall not be less than four inches;
         (4)   House connections shall be a minimum one- and one-half inches
Schedule 40 PVC water pipe.
      C.   Flow Design Standards. The conditions of flow design for both
gravity flow and pressurized flow shall be as per the following chart entitled
“Friction Loss Characteristics of Water Flow Through Rigid Plastic Pipe.”
Typical results are as follows:

Sump pump should deliver 20 GPM against operating head of 35 feet (or 15 psi)
based upon a 50- foot long discharge line and 450 feet of secondary sanitary
sewer, figuring 25 feet of line loss, five feet of lift, and five feet of loss
through valves and fittings.
 
   4.   Elevation and Material to be Used for Footing Drains. Drain materials
and elevation of piping shall meet the provisions of the International
Residential Code, when applicable, or the International Plumbing Code. Such
piping shall be placed with two inches of bedding underneath and twelve (12)
inches of washed gravel or crushed rock over with an approved filter membrane
and shall be acceptable to the Building Official and subject to review by the
Building Official.
   5.   Method of Installing Secondary Storm Sewers and Service Lines. With
respect to installation of PVC SDR 35, or thicker, secondary storm sewer
systems, all regulations that apply to the laying of PVC water main and service
lines shall also apply to the laying of PVC secondary storm sewer and service
lines, including depth and cover.
   6.   Installation of Footing Drain Service Lines Into Standard Storm Sewer.
In instances where standard storm sewer is available for the connection of one-
and one-half inches PVC Schedule 40 service lines, the Schedule 40 service
lines shall be connected to the storm sewer by drilling a hole in the concrete
storm sewer pipe of a diameter only slightly larger than the outside diameter
of the service pipe, then place the service pipe through the storm sewer
extending the end of the service pipe to, but not past, the interior wall of
the storm sewer. The storm sewer shall be entered in its mid-point or above
with these footing drain service lines. The ditch shall be filled under,
around, and over the PVC storm service pipe with stone or gravel to form a firm
base under the PVC in the open ditch between where the PVC pipe comes out of
unexcavated natural ground and the wall of the storm sewer pipe; all in a
manner acceptable to the engineer.
   7.   Occupancy Permit. No occupancy permit shall be issued for any building
or structure within the City that is not in compliance with this section.
   8.   Site Plan Detail. All site plans must provide details showing
compliance with this section for the proposed system of secondary storm sewer.
   9.   Illegal Acts. It shall be unlawful for any person to cause a violation
of this section. A person who is the owner of any building or structure shall
be responsible to cause that building or structure to be in compliance with
this section. Any inhabitant or occupant of any building or structure shall be
responsible to cause that building or structure to be in compliance with this
section.
   10.   Continuing Violation. Each day that a violation of this section occurs
shall be deemed to be a separate violation.
   11.   Mandatory Connection. At such time as the Community Services Director
decides there is adequate storm sewer or secondary storm sewer capacity
available for the property owner to connect to, the Community Services Director
shall inform the property owner in writing and allow said property owner 90
days to install and connect a sump pump to the lines. If the property owner

158.05   DEPARTMENT OF ELECTRICAL INSPECTION.
   There is hereby established in the City the Department of Electrical
Inspections, which shall be under the direction and supervision of the Building
and Zoning Official. The Building Official shall be responsible to the
Community Development Director for the enforcement of the Building Codes, and
such other ordinances as shall assign the Building Official that function, and
shall perform such other duties as may be required by the Community Development
Director or by any classification plan adopted by the City. Additional
responsibilities of the Building Official shall be assigned as required in
Chapter 155.
158.06   POWERS AND DUTIES OF ELECTRICAL INSPECTORS.
   1.   The Building Official shall have the authority to cause the
disconnection of any wiring or equipment if it is dangerous to life or property
or may interfere with the work of the Fire Department. They shall perform other
duties as may be required by the Community Services Director or by any
classification plan adopted by the City.
   2.   The Building Official has reasonable cause to believe that there exists
in a structure or upon a premises a condition which is contrary to or in
violation of this Code which makes the structure or premises unsafe, dangerous,
or hazardous, the Building Official is authorized to enter the structure or
premises at reasonable times to inspect or to perform the duties imposed by
this Code, provided, if such structure or premises be occupied, that
credentials be presented to the occupant and entry requested. If such structure
or premises be unoccupied, the Building Official shall make reasonable effort
to locate the owner or other person having charge or control of the structure
or premises and request entry. If entry is refused, the Building Official shall
have recourse to the remedies provided by law to secure entry.
   3.   The Building Official is hereby authorized, directed, and empowered to
inspect all electrical installations within the City, to condemn and order
removed or remodeled and put in proper and safe condition for the prevention of
fire and the safety of life, all electrical heating and lighting apparatus,
power generators, motors, machinery, fixtures, and connections, electrical
equipment used in the supply, distribution, or utilization of electrical
current for light, heat, or power purposed and to control the disposition and
arrangements of the same so that persons and property shall not be in danger
therefrom.
   4.   The Building Official shall administer and enforce the provisions of
this chapter. They shall keep records of each ruling or determination made
under its provisions, and notify, in writing, all persons involved. They shall
keep complete records of all permits issued, inspections made, and other
official work performed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
   5.   The Building Official and their assistants shall not engage in the
business of the sale, installation, or maintenance of electrical equipment
either directly or indirectly, and they shall have no financial interest in any
firm engaged in such business in the City at any time while holding office.
158.07   LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES.
   1.   The City or any employee of the City is not liable for damages to a
person or property as a result of any act or failure to act in the enforcement
of this Code, unless the act of enforcement constitutes false arrest.
   2.   This Code shall not be construed to relieve from or lessen the
responsibility of any person owning, operating, or controlling any equipment or
structure regulated herein for damages to a person or property caused by its
defects, nor shall the City or any City employee be held as assuming any such
liability by reason of the inspections authorized by this Code, or any
approvals issued under this Code.
158.08   PERMITS NOT REQUIRED.
   The following items do not require a permit:
   1.   Replacement of lighting fixtures, receptacles, switches, overcurrent
protection devices of the same volt and amperage.
   2.   The repair or replacement of flexible cords of same volt and amperage.
   3.   The process of manufacturing, testing, servicing, or repairing of
electrical equipment or apparatus.
   4.   Minor repair and adjustment where the total cost of the work does not
exceed $100.00.
   5.   No permit or inspections are required for electrical wiring of 50 volts
or less.
158.09   PERMIT ISSUANCE.
   1.   Permits Are Not Transferable. Electrical work performed under the
provisions of this chapter must be done by a contractor meeting the licensing
provisions as set forth by the State Electrical Examining Board in accordance
with Chapter 103 of the Code of Iowa unless the provisions of Section
155.13 or Section
158.15 are met. An electrician licensed by the State Electrical Examining board
as a “Master A or B” may sign and obtain a permit for the contractor for which
they are employed only when said “Master A or B” has provided proof of
employment by said licensed contractor. Any permit required by the provisions
of this Code may be revoked by the Building Official upon the violation of any
provision of this Code.
   2.   A State licensed electrical contractor shall be allowed only to secure
permits for themselves, or for a single firm or corporation. When a State
licensed electrical contractor has secured such a permit, only the employees of
such contractor, when meeting the provisions of Chapter 103 of the Code of
Iowa, shall perform the work for which the permit was obtained.
   3.   For purposes of this section, an “employee” shall be one employed by
the contractor, firm, or corporation for a wage or salary. A contractor may be
required by the Building Official to show positive evidence as to the employee
status of workers on the job. Such evidence shall be in the form of payroll and
time records, canceled checks, or other such documents.
   4.   The contractor may also be required to show the agreement or contract
pertaining to the work being questioned as evidence that said contractor is, in
fact, the actual contractor for such work. Failure or refusal by the contractor
to make available such employee or contractual records within 24 hours from
demand therefor shall be grounds for immediate revocation of any permit for the
work in question.
158.10   PERMIT FEES.
   1.   Permit Fees:
      A.   A fee for each electrical permit shall be paid to the Building
Official in the amount set in the Schedule of Fees adopted by the Council. No
electrical permits shall be issued to any person who has fees outstanding as
required by this Code or any other laws or ordinances of the City. Fees for
repairs to items listed shall be the same as for new construction. Any permit
required by the provisions of this Code may be revoked by the Building Official
upon the violation of any provision of this Code.
      B.   If a permit is issued for a specific amount of work and, upon
inspection, it is determined that more work was performed than was authorized
by the permit, the permittee shall amend the permit or obtain another permit to
include all additional work and shall pay a new base fee and any unit fees as
described in Paragraph A.
   2.   Additional permit fees are as follows:
      A.   Double Fee. Except in emergency situations, as determined by the
Building Official, where work for which a electrical permit is required by this
Code is started or proceeded with by any person prior to obtaining a required
permit, the fees specified as set forth in the amount set in the Schedule of
Fees as adopted by the Council shall be doubled. The payment of such double fee
shall not relieve any person from fully complying with the requirements of this
Code in the execution of the work or from any other penalties prescribed
herein. No additional permits of any type shall be issued to any person who
owes the City the double fee described in this subsection. However, no double
fee shall be imposed upon any person who starts without a permit if:
         (1)   The work is started on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, or during
any other day when the Building Department is not normally open for business;
and
         (2)   The person secures the proper permit on the next Building
Department working day.
         (3)   No plan review is required prior to issuance of the permit.
      B.   Refunds. If, within 30 days of the date of issuance, the holder of a
electrical permit decides not to commence the work described in said permit,
said person may, upon application to the Building Official, be refunded that
portion of the permit fee which is in excess of the permit refund fee set in
the Schedule of Fees adopted by the Council.
      C.   Fees for permit renewals shall be based on the amount of remaining
work to be completed. If the plans are changed enough to warrant a review, then
the permit fee shall be half the cost of the original fee plus any fees as set
forth in Paragraph E.
   *Or the hourly cost to the jurisdiction, whichever is greater. This cost
shall include supervision, overhead, hourly wages, and fringe benefits of the
employees involved.
      D.   Reinspections. A reinspection fee may be assessed for each
inspection or reinspection when such portion of work for which inspection is
called is not complete or when corrections called for are not made. This
section is not to be interpreted as requiring reinspection fees the first time
a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of this Code, but
as controlling the practice of calling for inspections before the job is ready
for such inspection or reinspection. Reinspection fees may be assessed when the
approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure to
provide access on the date for which inspection is requested, or for deviating
from plans requiring the approval of the Building Official. To obtain a
reinspection, the applicant shall pay the reinspection fee in accordance with
the Schedule of Fees as adopted by Council. In instances where reinspection
fees have been assessed, no additional inspection of the work will be performed
until the required fees have been paid.
      E.   Other Inspections and Fees. See the schedule of fees as adopted by
City Council.
         Persons performing work for the federal government, the State, the
County, or City may obtain permits for such work without paying the permit fees
described herein; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be
construed to exempt payment of permit fees by persons performing work under the
direction of the City in connection with the abatement of any public law. An
expired permit may not be reissued without a permit fee except by resolution of
the Council.
158.11   EXPIRATION.
   Every permit issued by the Building Official under the provision of the
Electrical Code shall expire under any one of the following conditions:
   1.   Failure to begin work authorized within 180 days after issuance of the
permit.
   2.   Suspension or abandonment of work for 120 days after commencement of
the work. Time of occurrence of suspension or abandonment of work shall be
computed from the date of the most recent inspection since which no progress
has been made.
   3.   Failure to complete work on a structure designed for residential uses
within one year after issuance of a permit.
   4.   Failure to complete work on a structure designed for commercial or
industrial uses within two years after issuance of a permit. For permits with a
building valuation exceeding $10,000,000.00, work shall be completed within
three years after issuance of a permit.
   Any permittee holding an unexpired permit may apply for an extension of the
time within which they may commence or continue work. The Building Official is
authorized to grant, in writing, for periods not more than 180 days each, two
extensions. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause
demonstrated. Any of the extensions may be further extended by action of the
Council. In all cases, when a renewal is granted, the structure for which the
permit is required shall comply with Code requirements in effect at the time
the permit is renewed.
158.12   LICENSING FOR ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING, AND MECHANICAL CONTRACTORS AND
INSTALLERS.
   The provisions of Chapter 160 shall be applicable for any work performed in
regards to electrical, plumbing, and mechanical systems.
158.13   BOARD OF APPEALS.
   In order to hear and decide appeals of orders, decisions, or determinations
made by the Building Official relative to the application and interpretation of
this Code, there shall be and hereby created a Board of Appeals, consisting of
five members. Board of Appeals members shall be chosen and appointed based on
diversity and building construction knowledge, all of whom shall be residents
of the City. One member of said Board of Appeals, at a minimum, shall be a
private citizen. The Building Official shall be an ex-officio member without a
vote and shall act as secretary of the Board of Appeals. The appointment of
members shall be for four-year terms, expiring on December 31, with not more
than three members’ terms expiring any one year. The Building Board of Appeals
shall be appointed by the Mayor, subject to Council approval, and shall serve
without compensation. The Board shall adopt reasonable rules and regulations
for conducting its investigations and shall render all decisions and findings
in writing to the Building Official with a duplicate copy to the appellant, and
may recommend to the Council such new legislation as is consistent therewith.
The Board shall meet at will and when there are appeals or business on file for
a hearing. Nominal appeal fee to the Building Board of Appeals shall be paid as
set forth in Section 158.10, Permit Fees. The appeal shall be valid for one
year from the date of the Board of Appeals approval to the commencement of work
and to the completion of work undertaken pursuant to the approval.
158.14   CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS.
   The Building Official shall require construction documents, computations,
and specifications to be prepared by a registered design professional licensed
by the State to practice such.
   1.   Construction documents, engineering calculations, diagrams, and other
data shall be submitted in two or more sets with each application for a permit.
   2.   Construction documents shall be drawn to scale and shall be of
sufficient clarity to indicate the location, nature, and extent of the work
proposed and show in detail that the work conforms to the provisions of this
Code.
   3.   Construction documents shall indicate location and clear space of
electrical equipment, and the material and methods for maintaining required
structural safety, fire-resistance rating, and fire-blocking.
   4.   Exceptions.
      A.   The Building Official shall have the authority to waive the
submission of construction documents, calculations, or other data if the nature
of the work applied for is such that reviewing of construction documents is not
necessary to determine compliance with this Code.
      B.   In the case of one- and two-family dwellings.
      C.   In the case of minor construction and repair.
      D.   In the case of accessory buildings when related to one- and two-
family dwellings.
158.15   EXEMPTION TO REQUIREMENTS OF STATE CONTRACTORS LICENSE.
   In accordance with Section 103.22 of the Code of Iowa, a subdivision may
provide licensure for those who perform business within the corporate limits of
the subdivision. The following criteria must be met in order to obtain an
electrical permit without being licensed by the State Electrical Examining
Board as a licensed electrical contractor:
   1.   An employee having received a “Masters A or B” license as issued by the
State Electrical Examining Board must sign the permit.
      A.   Exception. An employee tasked with performing electrical work as
indicated in their job description, which must be on file with the Department,
may continue to obtain an electrical permit until December 31, 2014, after
which said employee must have received a State issued master license or one be
employed by the firm or business.
   2.   The signatory of the permit must be an employee of a firm or business
based within the community and approved by the Department of Building.

   5.   The installation to be performed does not, in any way, involve work
within a new switchboard or panelboard with a voltage in excess of 480 volt.
   6.   The scope of work shall be limited to alterations of existing interior
space of 5,000 square feet or less, not defined as a hazardous location
pursuant to the adopted Electrical Code, and for any new or existing accessory
structures of not more than 1,000 square feet in floor area, that meet
Subsection 5 listed above and not defined as a hazardous location.
158.16   SERVICE ENTRANCE WIRES.
   All electrical lines not exceeding 15,000 volts and all telephone and
cablevision service lines, as well as other utility lines serving any new
building or structure, including signs and billboards, requiring permanent
electrical service shall be placed underground unless a waiver from such is
approved by the Building and Engineering Departments. The provisions of this
section shall not apply to existing buildings or additions to such buildings
(unless said addition requires the utility service provider to upgrade the
entire system from the transformer to the structure). Nothing in this section
shall be deemed to apply to temporary service when defined as such by the
utility provider.
158.17   INSPECTIONS.
   1.   The person doing electrical work, for which a permit is required, shall
notify the Building Official that the work is ready for inspection. The
Building Official shall, without undue delay, perform the required inspection
and, if the work complies with the provision of this Code, the Building
Official shall issue a notice of approval. If the work does not comply with the
provisions of this Code, the Building Official shall post a notice in a
conspicuous place on or near the work. The notice shall contain the date and
results of the inspection, and when requested, note specific violations. Work
that has no notice attached shall be considered unapproved. No notices shall be
removed by any person other than the Building Official.
   2.   When the electrical work is completed, the person doing it shall notify
the Building Official that the work is ready for final inspection.
   3.   Whenever it shall be ascertained by inspection that any electrical
installation or part thereof in any building is so defective as to render the
same dangerous to person or property, the Building Official shall at once cause
notice to be served upon the owner or person in charge, or the occupant of the
same, to remedy the defects within a reasonable time, to be stated in the
notice. If defects are not remedied within the time fixed by the notice, the
Building Official may cause the electric current to be disconnected from the
building. The electric current shall not again be turned on until all defects
or improper conditions have been removed, or repaired in conformance with the
provisions of this Code.

   The Building Official shall have the authority to remove or cause the
removal of lath, plaster, boarding, or other obstruction which may prevent the
proper inspection of wires or electrical equipment.
158.20   CORRECTING DEFECTIVE WORK.
   When any person is notified, that defects exist in their electrical work,

   “Temporary electrical work” means that work which is obviously installed for
the convenience of a person during construction. This work shall be the
complete responsibility of the person who installs it and shall not require the
inspector’s approval prior to being used, provided that the inspector may
require corrections in the wiring to eliminate any hazardous or unsafe
conditions. All such work shall be removed before final approval of permanent
electrical work. Temporary electrical work shall not be permitted to remain in
use in excess of six months, except by written permission of the electrical
inspector.

power in the City shall connect its system or furnish current for electrical
purposes to any building or premises which has not been inspected and approved
by the Building Official. Any person or corporation shall, upon written notice
from the Building Official to do so, immediately disconnect such building or
premises from its source of current.

159.04   COMPUTATIONS.
   The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign
height:
   1.   Computation of Area of Individual Signs. The area of sign face (which
is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be
computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or
combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing,
representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color
forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to
differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is
placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative
fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets zoning regulations and is
clearly incidental to the display itself.
   2.   Computation of Area of Multifaced Signs. The sign area from a sign with
more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign
faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are placed
back-to-back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same
time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not
more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement
of one of the faces.
   3.   Computation of Height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the
distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest
attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower
of
      A.   Existing grade prior to construction, or
      B.   The newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any
filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating
the sign.
   In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign
height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal
grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of
the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance
to the principal structure on the zone lot, whichever is lower.
   4.   Computation of Maximum Total Permitted Sign Area for a Zone Lot. The
permitted sum of the area of all individual signs on a zone lot shall be
computed by applying the formula contained in Table 159.05B, Maximum Total Sign
Area, to the frontage, building frontage or wall area, as appropriate, for the
zoning district in which the lot is located.
   5.   Lots fronting on two or more streets are allowed the permitted sign
area for each street frontage. However, the total sign area that is oriented
toward a particular street may not exceed the portion of the lot’s total sign
area allocation that is derived from the lot, building, or wall area frontage
on that street.
159.05   SIGNS ALLOWED ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH AND WITHOUT PERMITS.
   Signs are allowed on private property in the City in accordance with, and
only in accordance with, Table 159.05A.
   If the letter “P” appears for a sign type in a column, such sign is allowed
without prior permit approval in the zoning district represented by that
column. If the letter “S” appears for a sign type in a column, such sign is
allowed only with prior permit approval in the zoning district represented by
that column. Special conditions may apply in some cases. If the letter “N”
appears for a sign type in a column, such a sign is not allowed in the zoning
district represented by that column under any circumstances. Although permitted
under this section, a sign designated by an “S” or “P” in Table 159.05A shall
be allowed only if:
   1.   The sum of the area of all building and freestanding signs of the zone
lot conforms with the maximum permitted sign area as determined by the formula
for the zoning district in which the lot is located as specified in Table
159.05B;
   2.   The size, location, and number of signs on the lot conform with the
requirements of Tables 159.05C and 159.05D, which establish permitted sign
dimensions by sign type, and with any additional limitations listed in Table
159.05A;
   3.   The characteristics of the sign conform with the limitations of Table
159.05E, Permitted Sign Characteristics, and with any additional limitations on
characteristics listed on Table 159.05A.

the application conform in every respect with the requirements of this chapter
and of the applicable Master or Common Signage Plan; or
      B.   Reject the sign permit if the sign or signs that are the subject of
the application fail in any way to conform with the requirements of this

159.14   PERMITS TO CONSTRUCT OR MODIFY SIGNS.
   Signs identified as “P” or “S” on Table 159.05A shall be erected, installed,
or created only in accordance with a duly issued and valid sign construction
permit from the Zoning Administrator. Such permits shall be issued only in
accordance with the following requirements and procedures:
   1.   Permit for New Sign or for Sign Modifications. An application for
construction, creation, or installation of a new sign or for modification of an
existing sign shall be accompanied by detailed drawings to show the dimensions,
design, structure, and location of each particular sign, to the extent that

multiple signs on the same zone lot.
   2.   Inspection. The Zoning Administrator shall cause an inspection of the
zone lot for which such permit for a new sign or for modification of an
existing sign is issued during the sixth month after the issuance of such
permit or at such earlier date as the owner may request. If the construction is
not substantially complete at the time of inspection, the permit shall lapse
and become void. If the construction is complete and in full compliance with
this chapter and with the building and electrical codes, the Zoning
Administrator shall affix to the premises a permanent symbol identifying the

construction is substantially complete but not in full compliance with this
chapter and applicable codes, the Zoning Administrator shall give the owner or
applicant notice of the deficiencies and shall allow an additional 30 days
after the date of inspection for the deficiencies to be corrected. If the
deficiencies are not corrected by such date, the permit shall lapse. If the

this chapter or for which there is no current and valid sign permit shall be
obligated to remove such sign or, in the case of a nonconforming sign, to bring
into conformity with the requirements of this chapter.
   1.   Signs Existing on Effective Date. For any sign existing in the City on

Zoning Administrator before January 1, 1996. For any sign on property annexed
at a later date, applications for sign permits shall be submitted within six
months after the effective date of the annexation or within such period as may
be established in an annexation agreement between the City and the landowner.
Signs that are subject of applications received after the applicable date set
forth in this section shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of
this chapter and shall not be entitled to the protection of Subsection 2.
Applications for permits for existing signs submitted before January 1, 1996,
shall be exempt from the initial fees adopted under authority of this chapter,
but not from renewal and subsequent fees.
   2.   Nonconforming Existing Signs, Permits, and Terms. A sign that would be
permitted under this chapter only with a sign permit, but which was in
existence on August 10, 1995, or on a later date when the property is annexed

other applicable laws in effect on the date of its construction, but which, by
reason of its size, height, location, design, or construction, is not in
conformity with the requirements of this chapter, shall be issued a
Nonconforming Sign Permit if an application in accordance with Subsection 1 is
filed in a timely manner. Such permit shall allow the signs subject to such
permit, which were made nonconforming by the adoption of this chapter, to
remain in place and be maintained for a period ending no later than January 1,
1997, provided that no action is taken which increases the degree or extent of
the nonconformity. Such signs are also subject to the provisions of Subsection
3. A change in the information on the face of an existing nonconforming sign is
allowed. However, any nonconforming sign shall either be eliminated or made to
conform with the requirements of this chapter when any proposed change, repair,
or maintenance would constitute an expense of more than 25 percent of the
lesser of the original value or replacement value of the sign.
   3.   Lapse of Nonconforming Sign Permit. A Nonconforming Sign Permit shall
lapse and become void under the same circumstances as those under which any
other sign permit may lapse and become void.
   4.   Sign Removal Required. A sign that was constructed, painted, installed,
or maintained in conformance with a permit under this chapter, but for which
the permit has lapsed or not been renewed or for which the time allowed for the

provision of the fire code shall expire under any one of the following
conditions:
         1.   Failure to begin work authorized within 180 days after issuance
of the permit.

      Any permittee holding an unexpired permit may apply for an extension of
the time within which they may commence or continue work. The fire official is
authorized to grant, in writing, for periods not more than 180 days each, two
extensions. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause
demonstrated. Any of the extensions may be further extended by action of the
Council. In all cases, when a renewal is granted, the structure for which the
permit is required shall comply with Code requirements in effect at the time
the permit is renewed.
      5.   Permit Fees. Section 106 shall be deleted and replaced with the
following:
         106.1 Permit Fees. A permit shall not be issued until the fees have
been paid, nor shall an amendment to a permit be released until the additional
fee, if any, has been paid:
         A.   A fee for each construction permit shall be paid to the Fire
Chief in the amount set forth in the Schedule of Fees as adopted by the
Council.
         B.   If a permit is issued for a specific amount of work and, upon
inspection, it is determined that more work was performed than was authorized
by the permit, the permittee shall amend the permit or obtain another permit to
include all additional work and shall pay a new base fee and any unit fees as
described in Paragraph A above.
         C.   Permits and fees for mechanical, plumbing, and electrical work
shall meet the requirements of Ordinances 156, 157, or 158 respectively.
         106.2 Additional Permit Fees:
         A.   Plan Check Fees: Plan Check Fees shall be in the amount set forth
in the Schedule of Fees as adopted by the Council.
         B.   Double Fee. Except in emergency situations, as determined by the
Fire Chief, where work for which a building permit is required by this Code is
started or proceeded with by any person prior to obtaining a required permit,
the fees in the amount set forth in the Schedule of Fees as adopted by the
Council shall be doubled. The payment of such double fee shall not relieve any
person from fully complying with the requirements of this Code in the execution
of the work or from any other penalties prescribed herein. No additional
permits of any type shall be issued to any person who owes the City the double
fee described in this subsection. However, no double fee shall be imposed upon
any person who starts without a permit if:
            (1)   The work is started on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, or
during any other day when the Building Department is not normally open for
business; and
            (2)   The person secures the proper permit on the next Fire
Department working day.
         106.3 Refunds. If, within 30 days of the date of issuance, the holder
of a construction permit decides not to commence the work described in said
permit, said person may, upon application to the Fire Chief, be refunded that
portion of the permit fee which is in excess of the permit refund fee as set
forth in the Schedule of Fees as adopted by the Council.
         106.4 Renewals. Fees for Permit Renewals shall be based on the
percentage of valuation of remaining work to be performed provided the plans
are not changed. If the plans are changed enough to warrant a review, then the
permit fee shall be half the cost of the original fee plus any fees as set
forth in Section 106.6 of this Code section.
      * Or the hourly cost to the jurisdiction, whichever is greater. This cost
shall include supervision, overhead, hourly wages, and fringe benefits of the
employees involved.
         106.5 Reinspections. A reinspection fee may be assessed for each
inspection or reinspection when such portion of work for which inspection is
called is not complete or when corrections called for are not made. This
section is not to be interpreted as requiring reinspection fees the first time
a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of this Code, but
as controlling the practice of calling for inspections before the job is ready
for such inspection or reinspection. Reinspection fees may be assessed when the
inspection record card is not posted or otherwise available on the work site,
the approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure to
provide access on the date for which inspection is requested, or for deviating
from plans requiring the approval of the Building Official. To obtain a
reinspection, the applicant shall pay the reinspection fee as set forth in the
Schedule of Fees as adopted by the Council. In instances where reinspection
fees have been assessed, no additional inspection of the work will be performed
until the required fees have been paid.
         106.6 Other Inspections and Fees. See the schedule of fees as adopted
by Council.
      Persons performing work for the federal government, the State, the
County, or City may obtain permits for such work without paying the permit fees
described herein; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be
construed to exempt payment of permit fees by persons performing work under the
direction of the City in connection with the abatement of any public law.
      An expired permit may not be reissued without a permit fee except by
resolution of the Council.

private road and the building address cannot be viewed from the public way, a
monument, pole, or other approved sign or means shall be used to identify the
structure. Address identification shall be maintained.
      11.   Key Boxes. Section 506.1 of the International Fire Code shall be
amended by adding the following to the end of the section:
         “Key boxes shall be located at the front of the building typically
adjacent to the main front doors at a maximum height of six feet above grade or
at a location as directed by the Fire Code Official.”

false alarms have occurred at the same location within one calendar year, and
the location is within the response jurisdiction area of the City, the Fire
Department shall notify the fire alarm user by letter, citing the location and
date of each alarm activation. The letter shall recommend that appropriate
action be taken on the part of the fire alarm user to alleviate the causes of
such false alarms and shall include a statement that an accumulation of more

within the same calendar year shall be invoiced an additional fee. In the event
that payment of the fee is not made within 30 days of billing, an
administrative charge for collection shall be assessed. All fees shall be
established by resolution of the Council, as adopted. The fee hereby
established affords only partial recovery of the expenses incurred in
responding to the false alarms.
      D.   Whenever fire department personnel respond to a fire alarm that has

the incident shall determine if the response resulted from failure to make the
proper notification to the alarm system monitor center and the County
Communication Dispatch Center and shall so indicate on the incident report.
Notwithstanding anything contained in any other section of the ordinance
codified in this chapter, if a fire alarm is activated due to testing and
maintenance and the County Communication Dispatch Center was not given proper
notification, a user fee established by resolution will be imposed upon each
false alarm. The responsible party will be the agency, testing, or maintenance
company representative, or individual that initiated the alarm testing or
maintenance.

fee to the Council. A false alarm activation user, or their designee, shall
appeal in writing and such appeal shall be made to the Fire Chief within 10
days of the date of notification of the fee.

unless expressly stated to the contrary, shall be under the direction and
supervision of an Enforcement Officer, who may appoint or designate other
public officers or employees to perform duties as may be necessary to enforce

Officers are hereby authorized to abate such violations in accordance with the
procedures of this Code and to serve notice to abate same, whether upon the
owner or other responsible party for a premise(s) upon which a violation is
being maintained, or upon the person or persons causing or maintaining the
violation.
      B.   If a violation is found to exist on an owner-occupied premises and
the owners demonstrate that the cost of remedying such violation would exceed
the household’s annual disposable income and thereby cause a financial
hardship, enforcement shall be held in temporary abeyance until a means of
financing or assistance can be identified.
      C.   The objective of this Code being the abatement of violations,
persons violating this Code shall be allowed a reasonable amount of time to
voluntarily remedy the violation before action to assess costs or penalties for
a violation is undertaken. Consideration will be given to evidence of a good
faith effort to correct the violation; whether an imminent health or safety
hazard exists; whether the person has previously been notified of or charged
with violations of a similar nature; and other factors.
      D.   Violations which are not voluntarily remedied may be abated by an
administrative abatement process; the municipal infraction process; by court
proceedings; or by City abatement and assessment of costs therefor against the
responsible party, at the discretion of the City.
      E.   It is further provided by this Code that if the City judges that an
emergency exists which creates a dangerous and imminent health or safety hazard
to persons, property, or the general public which requires immediate action,
the City may order such action as may be necessary to meet the emergency. Any
orders issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be effective immediately or in
the time and manner prescribed in the order itself.
      F.   The Enforcement Officer may, but shall not be required to, give
notice to abate prior to issuance of a civil citation for a repeat offense
involving the same property and occurring within one year of a prior violation
and notice to abate.
   2.   Notice. When service of a notice to abate is required, the following
methods of service shall be deemed adequate:
      A.   By personal service upon the owner or other responsible party of the
property upon which the nuisance exists, or upon the person or persons causing
or maintaining the violation; or
      B.   Sending the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested to
the last known address; or
      C.   Publishing the notice once a week for two consecutive weeks in a
newspaper of general circulation in the City; or
      D.   By posting the notice in a conspicuous place on the property or
building deemed a nuisance.
   3.   Appeal. Any person affected by any notice to abate a violation of this
Code may request a hearing on the matter before the Board of Appeals, provided
that a written appeal shall be filed with the Enforcement Officer within 10
days after the notice to abate was served. The appeal shall be filed on a form
provided by the City for that purpose, and shall state the particular section
of the chapter or interpretation thereof being appealed, and a brief statement
of the grounds upon which such appeal is taken. Failure to file a timely appeal
as prescribed herein shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing, and
the notice shall become final. The Board of Appeals determination and order
shall be appealable to the County District Court by writ of certiorari. Such
appeal shall be filed within 30 days from the date of the Board of Appeals
decision. The Board of Appeals order shall not be carried out until the time
for filing the writ of certiorari has expired.
   4.   Abatement Remedies and Penalties.
      A.   In the event that the violation is not abated as ordered and within
the time specified, the City may abate such violation by any of the following
means:
         (1)   By undertaking such abatement and assessing the costs therefore
against the property.
         (2)   By issuance of a civil citation charging the owner or
responsible party with a municipal infraction.
      B.   Abatement may include, but is not limited to, repair, removal,
cleaning, extermination, cutting, mowing, grading, sewer repairs, draining,
securing, barricading or fencing, demolition of dangerous or abandoned
structures, or portions thereof, and elimination of nuisances. Abatement costs
may include the cost of removing or eliminating the violation; the cost of
investigation, such as title searches, inspection, and testing; the cost of
notification; filing costs; and other related administrative costs. Inoperable
or obsolete vehicles which have been impounded may be sold in accordance with
state law. If an inoperable or obsolete vehicle is not sold or if the proceeds
of such sale or redemption are not sufficient to pay the costs of abatement,
storage, and sale of said inoperable or obsolete vehicle, such cost or the
balance of such cost may be assessed against the premises in the same manner as
a property tax.
      C.   Before the assessment of any charges for work done or caused to be
done by the City, the owner of the property proposed to be assessed shall be
provided notice and opportunity for hearing before the Council. The notice
shall set forth the amount proposed to be assessed, and include a statement of
the time, place, and date of hearing.
      D.   The court may order any one or more of the following:
         (1)   Place a judgment against the person or property of defendant for
the costs of abatement.
         (2)   Order abatement of the violation in any manner.
         (3)   Assess costs of abatement against the premises.
   5.   Emergency Abatement Procedure. If an Enforcement Officer determines
that a violation exists and constitutes an imminent, clear, and compelling
danger to health, safety, or welfare of persons or property, the Enforcement
Officer is authorized to abate the violation or have it abated without prior
notice and opportunity for hearing. The costs of such action may be assessed
against the premises. However, prior to such assessment, the City shall give a
property owner notice and the opportunity for a hearing before the Council in
accordance with Section 50.07. An appeal shall not stay the effect of a notice
or order under the emergency provisions of this chapter, unless so ordered by
the Board of Appeals.
163.11   BOARD OF APPEALS.
   1.   Authority. The Board is hereby empowered to hold hearings on appeals
from the regulations of this Code.
   2.   Procedure. Upon receipt of a timely-filed appeal, the Enforcement
Officer shall set a time and place for the Board to hear such appeal and shall
publish notice thereof. The hearing shall be open to the public and shall be
recorded either electronically or manually. All parties shall be afforded an
opportunity to respond and present evidence and argument. If the appellant
fails to appear at such hearing, the Board of Appeals may proceed with the
hearing and made a decision in the absence of the appellant.
   3.   Decision of the Board of Appeals. No hearing shall be valid unless a
majority of the Board of Appeals is present, and no appeal shall be granted
unless reached by a majority of all members of the Board of Appeals. The Board
of Appeals shall render a decision based upon the record, at the conclusion of
the hearing or within a reasonable time thereafter. The Board of Appeals may
affirm, modify, or reverse any action, interpretation, notice, or order which
has been issued in connection with the enforcement of this Code. Following the
decision of the Board of Appeals, all parties shall be notified of the decision
personally or by general mail service delivered to the address provided by the
party. Any party to the hearing, including the City, may seek judicial review
by filing a petition in the County District Court within 30 days after the
issuance of the decision by the Board.

Notes
   †  EDITOR’S NOTE: The semi-detached dwelling is part of a two-family structure with
9  the dwelling units side by side as opposed to one on top of the other. The semi-
   detached dwelling also could be the end unit of a townhouse row or a duplex.
   †  EDITOR’S NOTE: A porch becomes a room when the space enclosed is heated or air
10 conditioned and, if glazed, when the percentage of window area to wall area is less
   than 50 percent.
11 †  EDITOR’S NOTE: Where the setback is narrow, as in an urban area, even steps may
   be required to be behind the setback.
12 †  EDITOR’S NOTE: By this definition, all buildings are structures, however, not
   all structures are buildings.

of Iowa, changes are made in district boundaries or other matters portrayed on
the Official Zoning Map, copies of such changes shall be filed with the
Official Zoning Map promptly after the amendment has been approved by the

due to a number of boundary changes, or to correct drafting errors or
omissions; provided, however, any such adoption shall not have the effect of

165.04   RULES FOR INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   In cases where the exact location of a district boundary is not clear as
shown on the Official Zoning Map, the following rules shall be used in
determining location of said boundary:
   1.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of
streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow such centerlines.
   2.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall
be construed as following such lot lines.
   3.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following City limits shall be
construed as following City limits.
   4.   Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed to
be midway between the main tracks.
   5.   Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to
follow such shorelines, and in the event of change in the shoreline shall be
construed as moving with the actual shoreline; boundaries indicated as
approximately following the centerlines of streams, rivers, canals, lakes, or
other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such centerlines.
   6.   Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated
in Subsections 1 through 5 above shall be so construed. Distances not
specifically indicated on the Official Zoning Map shall be determined by the
scale of the map.
   7.   Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at
variance with those shown on the Official Zoning Map, or in other circumstances
not covered by Subsections 1 through 6 above, the Board of Adjustment shall
interpret the district boundaries.
165.05   APPLICATION OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS.
   The regulations set by this Zoning Code within each district shall be
minimum regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of
structure or land, throughout each district, but the regulations in one
district may differ from those in other districts. In addition:
   1.   No building, structure, or land shall hereafter be used or occupied,
and no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected,
constructed, reconstructed, or structurally altered unless in conformity with
all of the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is
located. It is unlawful for any person to erect, construct, enlarge, alter,
repair, move, improve, remove, convert, or demolish any building or structure
regulated by this Zoning Code, or cause the same to be done without first
obtaining a separate permit for each building or structure from the
Administrative Official. (See Section

   2.   No building or other structure shall hereafter be erected or altered:
      A.   To exceed the height;
      B.   To accommodate or house a greater number of families;
      C.   To occupy a greater percentage of lot area; or
      D.   To have narrower or smaller rear yards, front yards, side yards, or
other open spaces than herein required, or in any other manner contrary to the
provisions of this Zoning Code.
   3.   No part of a yard, or other open space, or off-street parking or
loading space required about or in connection with any building for the purpose
of complying with the Zoning Code shall be included as part of a yard, open
space, or off-street parking or loading space similarly required for any other
building.
   4.   No yard or lot existing at the time of passage of the ordinance
codified herein shall be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum

ZONING CODE - NONCONFORMING USES
 
166.01 Intent                          166.05 Repairs and Maintenance
166.02 Nonconforming Lots of Record    166.06 Special Exemptions

166.04 Nonconforming Use of Structures  
166.01   INTENT.
   Within the districts established by the Zoning Code or amendments that may
later be adopted, there exist lots, structures, and uses of land and structures
which were lawful before the Zoning Code was adopted or amended, but which
would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of the Zoning
Code or future amendment. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these
nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their
survival. It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall
not be enlarged upon, expanded, or extended, or be used as grounds for adding
other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. To avoid
undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require change in
the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual
construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or
amendment of the Zoning Code and upon which actual building construction has
been diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby defined to include
the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a
permanent manner; except that where demolition or removal of an existing
building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such
demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that
such work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building
involved.
166.02   NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of the Zoning Code, a
single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any
single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the
Zoning Code. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the
requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the
district.
166.03   NONCONFORMING USE OF LAND.
   Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the Zoning Code,
lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of
the Zoning Code as enacted or amended, such use may be continued subject to the
following provisions:
   1.   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased or extended to
occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of the
adoption or amendment of the Zoning Code.
   2.   No such nonconforming use shall be moved, in whole or in part, to any
other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date
of the adoption or amendment of the Zoning Code.
   3.   If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than six months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform
to the regulations specified by the Zoning Code for the district in which such
land is located.
166.04   NONCONFORMING USE OF STRUCTURES.
   If a lawful use of a structure, or of structure and premises in combination,
exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the Zoning Code that
would not be allowed in the district under the terms of the Zoning Code, the
lawful use may be continued subject to the following provisions:
   1.   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by the Zoning Code
in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, or structurally altered except in changing the use
of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
   2.   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any of the parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of the Zoning Code, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building.
   3.   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to a more restricted
classification.
   4.   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six months, the structure, or
structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in
conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
   5.   Where nonconforming use status applied to a structure and premises in
combination, removal, or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
166.05   REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   On any building devoted, in whole or in part, to any nonconforming use, work
may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of non-bearing
walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, provided that the cubic content of the
building as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of the Zoning Code
shall not be increased. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof
declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public
safety, upon order of such official.
166.06   SPECIAL EXEMPTIONS.
   Any use for which a special exception is permitted as provided in Section
167.07 shall not be deemed a nonconforming use, but shall, without further
action, be deemed a conforming use in such district.
166.07   REGISTRATION OF NONCONFORMING USES.
   No nonconforming structure or use shall be maintained, renewed, changed or
extended until a certificate of zoning compliance shall have been issued
pursuant to Section
169.04 hereof.

   2.   No fence or wall in any rear yard shall exceed six feet in height in a
residential district, or 10 feet in height in a commercial or industrial
district unless otherwise approved by the Board of Adjustment.
   3.   Every fence hereafter erected shall be done in the following manner:

subdivision or plat of survey recorded after February 7, 2003 (but not corner
lots), no fence shall be closer than 15 feet from the major street or highway
right-of-way. The yard between the major street or highway right-of-way and the
15-foot setback shall include one hardwood deciduous tree (Ash: “Autumn
Purple,” Green [seedless]; Maple: Crimson King, Norway, Sugar; Oak: Burr,
English, Northern Red) and three shrubs for every 25 linear feet, or major
fraction thereof, of lot width along the major street or highway. The trees
shall be at least one and one-half inch caliper and the shrubs shall be at
least 18 to 24 inches in height. The property owner is required to maintain the
plantings and replace them as necessary with approved materials from the list

incorporated into the overall design. This section does not replace the
screening requirements for commercial and industrial properties. (See
Figure L).

   7.   The following streets are considered major streets or highways used in
correlation with Subsections 1 and 6:
      A.   Adventureland Drive NE and NW.
      B.   8 th Street SE and SW.
      C.   Edwin W. Skinner Parkway SE and SW.
      D.   36 th Street SE and SW.
      E.   1 st Avenue North and South.
      F.   14 th Avenue SE and NE.
      G.   17 th Avenue SW and NW.
      H.   34 th Avenue SW and NW.
167.03   STREET FRONTAGE REQUIRED.
   No lot shall contain any building used, in whole or in part, for residence
purposes unless such lot abuts for at least 40 feet on at least one street, and
there shall be not more than one single-family dwelling for such frontage. The
Council may also allow, at its own discretion, the construction of a building
to be used, in whole or in part, for residence purposes on a lot which has an
exclusive unobstructed private easement of access at least 20 feet wide to a
street, for one single-family dwelling, if the Council determines that such
construction is not in conflict with the intent of the Zoning Code.
167.04   ACCESSORY BUILDINGS.
   No accessory building shall be erected in any required court or in any yard
other than a rear yard (for corner lots, see
Figure M). Only one detached garage and one yard shed shall be allowed in a
rear yard (this is not to be construed as not allowing gazebos, greenhouses,
shelters, and “children’s playhouses,” as long as the total aggregate building
area does not exceed 30 percent of the rear yard). In A-1, R-1, R-2, and R-
4 Zoned Districts and for one- and two-family dwelling lots in an R-3 and R-
5 Zoning District, accessory garages shall be no larger than 1,000 square feet
and yard sheds shall not be larger than 160 square feet. Accessory buildings
shall be distant at least three feet from alley lines, or lot lines of
adjoining lots. However, in no case shall any eave or overhang extend closer
than 12 inches to a rear or side yard line and no accessory structures, except
those permitted pursuant to the provisions of Section 167.02 shall be permitted
to be constructed, placed, located, or built in or on any easement. On “through
lots,” also known as “double frontage lots,” within a subdivision plat or plat
of survey recorded after February 7, 2003 (but not corner lots), no accessory
buildings shall be closer than 18 feet from the major street or highway right-
of-way. (See
Figure L). Accessory buildings must be erected separately from and six feet
distant (into rear yard) from the principle structure except in R-4 Districts
where accessory building shall be no closer than four feet to the principal
structure providing they meet all applicable fire and building codes as
adopted. Any building so connected to the principal building shall be
considered a part of the principal building and must meet the space
requirements thereof. Accessory buildings shall not occupy more than 30 percent
of the rear yard and shall not exceed 14 feet in height in any R District. This
regulation shall not be interpreted to prohibit the construction of a minimum
440-square foot, detached garage on a rear yard. No accessory building shall be
constructed upon a lot until the construction of the principal building has
been actually commenced, and no accessory building shall be used unless the
principal building on the lot is also being used. Accessory buildings exceeding
160 square feet in area shall be constructed of materials that are the same or
similar to the principal building. Accessory buildings may be connected to the
principal building by a breezeway with setbacks for the principal structure. An
addition may be made to an existing principal structure which extends past the
front of an existing legally established detached accessory structure, provided
no connection or attachment is made between the existing detached structure and
the addition unless setbacks can be met as required for a principal structure.
Exception: Those properties located along the east side of 26 th Avenue SW
between 10 th Street SW and 17 th Street SW shall be allowed to place accessory
structures in the easements (recorded Bk 5099 Page 518 and Book 2246 page 409)
located in the rear yard, if all of the following conditions are being met:
   1.   The property owner has obtained an encroachment agreement from the
owner of the easement, and
   2.   The property owner provides a copy of the encroachment agreement to the
City, and
   3.   The accessory structure is located as indicated on the encroachment
agreement, and
   4.   The accessory structure meets all of the other provisions listed within
this section
167.05   CORNER LOTS; SIDE YARDS.
   For corner lots platted after the effective date of the Zoning Code, the
street side yard shall be equal in width to the setback regulations of the lots
to the rear having frontage on the intersecting street.
167.06   BUILDING LINES ON APPROVED PLATS.
   Whenever the plat of a land subdivision approved by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and on record in the office of the County Recorder shows a building
line along any frontage for the purpose of creating a front yard or side street
yard line, the building line thus shown shall apply along such frontage in
place of any other yard line required in the Zoning Code unless specific yard
requirements in the Zoning Code require a greater setback.
167.07   EXCEPTIONS, MODIFICATIONS, AND INTERPRETATIONS.
   1.   Structures Permitted Above Height Limit. No permit will be issued for
any structure above height limits, except as specifically approved by the Board
of Adjustment.
   2.   Double Frontage Lots. Buildings on through lots and extending through
from street to street shall provide the required front yard on both streets.
   3.   Rear and Side Yards Adjacent to Alleys - How Computed. In computing the
depth of a rear yard or the width of a side yard where the rear or side yard
opens on an alley, one-half of the alley width may be included as a portion of
the rear or side yard as the case may be.
   4.   Other Exceptions to Yard Requirements. Every part of a required yard
shall be open to the sky unobstructed with any building or structure, except
for a permitted accessory building in a rear yard, and except for the
following:
      A.   Projections not exceeding 24 inches except for:
         (1)   Yards with a five-foot setback requirement no projection shall
be permitted except for a roof overhang not exceeding 24 inches. This includes
decks and stairs that are not considered accessory structures.
      B.   Decks that serve the principle structure; not constructed per the
requirements for accessory structures and that have a walking surface over 36
inches above grade shall be permitted to encroach into the rear yard a maximum
distance of 10 feet on properties with a platted rear yard of 25 feet or more.
      C.   Structures built over a deck or patio in a rear yard that have at
least 65 percent of the space between roof joists that are clear, open, and
unobstructed to the sky may encroach a maximum distance of 10 feet on
properties with a platted rear yard of 25 feet or more. If openings are less
than 65 percent of the space between roof joists, then the structure shall be
considered a roof and must meet the setback distances of that for the primary
structure. A membrane covered frame structure, meaning a building or structure
that is non-pressurized, movable, and not permanently secured and is comprised
of a rigid framework to support a tensioned membrane which provides a weather
barrier, is exempt from this requirement.
Notwithstanding the provisions noted above, no part of any structure or
building shall encroach into a recorded easement.
   5.   Billboards. No permit will be issued for any billboards except as
specifically approved by the Council.
   6.   Front Yard Exceptions. In areas where some lots are developed with a
front yard that is less than the minimum required for the district by this
Zoning Code or where some lots have been developed with a front yard greater
than required by the Zoning Code, the following rule shall apply. Any new
building or addition in front thereof shall not be closer to the street right-
of-way than the average of the front yard of the first building on each side
within a distance of 200 feet measured from building to building, except as
follows:
      A.   Buildings located entirely on the rear half of a lot shall not be
counted.
      B.   No residential dwelling shall be required to have a front yard
greater than 50 feet.
      C.   If no building exists on one side of a lot within 200 feet of the
lot in question, the minimum front yard shall be the same as the building on
the other side.
   7.   Zoning of Annexed Areas. Any land annexed to the City after the
effective date of the Zoning Code shall be zoned A-1 Agricultural until the
Planning and Zoning Commission and Council shall have studied the area and
adopted a final zoning plan for the area. Said final zoning plan shall be
adopted within six months of the date of annexation.
   8.   Single-family, Semi-attached. Single-family, semi-attached dwellings
are permitted only under the following terms and conditions:
      A.   A single-family, semi-attached dwelling is a building designed for
or occupied by one family only and which is erected on a separate lot and is
joined to another such residence on one side only by a wall located on the lot
line and has yards on the remaining sides. The joining wall must be a party
wall and must be a fire wall.
      B.   Must have an R-2 or R-3 zoning.
      C.   The lot width requirement where approved by plat approval by the
Council shall be 40 feet.

use, whether such use is existing or proposed, shall meet all of the required
development standards set forth in this section:
   1.   No part of any parking space shall be closer than three feet to any
established street right-of-way or alley line. In case the parking lot adjoins
an R District, it shall be set back at least 15 feet from the R District
boundary and shall be effectively screen planted by any one or approved

conversion system which has a nameplate rated capacity of up 15 kilowatts for
residential uses and districts and up to 100 kilowatts for commercial, and
industrial districts and which is incidental and subordinate to a principal use
on the same parcel. A system is considered a SWECS only if it supplies
electrical power solely for use by the owner on the site, except that when a
parcel on which the system is installed also receives electrical power supplied
by a utility company, excess electrical power generated and not presently
needed by the owner for on-site use may be used by the utility company in
accordance with Section 199, Chapter 15.11(5) of the Iowa Administrative Code,
as amended from time to time.
      F.   “Small Wind Energy Conversion System, Building Mounted” means a
SWECS which is securely fastened to any portion of a principal building in

determined that the SWECS is causing electromagnetic interference, the owner or
operator shall take the necessary corrective action to eliminate this
interference, including relocation or removal of the facilities, subject to the
approval of the appropriate City authority. A permit granting a SWECS may be
revoked if electromagnetic interference from the SWECS becomes evident.
      T.   Wind Access Easements. The enactment of this section does not
constitute the granting of an easement by the City. The SWECS owner or operator
shall have the sole responsibility to acquire any covenants, easements, or
similar documentation to assure or protect access to sufficient wind as may or
may not be necessary to operate the SWECS.
      U.   Insurance. The owner or operator of a SWECS must demonstrate and
maintain liability insurance of not less than $1,000,000.00 coverage.

continuous period of six months, the system shall be deemed to be abandoned.
The SWECS owner or operator shall remove the abandoned system at their expense.
Removal of the system includes the entire structure, transmission equipment,
and fencing from the property excluding foundations. Non-function or lack of
operation may be proven by reports from the interconnected utility. For off-
grid systems, the City shall have the right to enter the property, at its sole
discretion, to determine if the off-grid system is generating power. Such
generation may be proven by use of an amp meter. The SWECS owner or operator,
and successors, shall make available to the Director of Community Development
all reports to and from the purchaser of energy from the SWECS if requested. If
removal of towers and appurtenant facilities is required, the Director of
Community Development shall notify the SWECS owner or operator. Removal shall
be completed within 90 days of written notice to remove being provided to the
owner or operator by the City.
      Y.   Right of Entrance. As a condition of approval of a Conditional Use
Permit an applicant seeking to install SWECS shall be required to sign a
petition and waiver agreement which shall be recorded and run with the land
granting permission to the City to enter the property to remove the SWECS
pursuant to the terms of approval and to assure compliance with the other
conditions set forth in the permit. Removal shall be at the expense of the
owner or operator and the cost may be assessed against the property.
      Z.   Feasibility Study. It is highly recommended that a feasibility study
be made of any site prior to installing a wind turbine. The feasibility study
should include measuring actual wind speeds at the proposed turbine site for at
least three months.

   These regulations are intended to prescribe the conditions under which
limited duration locally grown agricultural and existing on-site commercial
activities (e.g. truck gardens, Farmers Market, sidewalk sales, etc.) may be
conducted. The intent is to allow the display and marketing of merchandise on a
seasonal basis in an attractive manner to serve the desires of the general
public, but prevent creation of any nuisance or annoyance to the occupants of
adjacent buildings, premises or property, and the general public. It is also
the intent to establish minimum standards for the operation of temporary uses
in a manner that will provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the
patrons, employees, the general public, etc., that may utilize or be affected
by the establishment of the temporary use.
   1.   Application and Permit Processing. A Temporary Use Permit shall be

Use Permit application. Applications for said Temporary Use Permit shall be
secured from the Director of Community Development in the manner prescribed by
this section, who shall cause the application to be directed to all concerned
City departments and divisions. Affected departments or divisions shall comment
on the application. Temporary uses may be subject to additional permits, or
inspections as required by any applicable law or regulation.

will not adversely affect the surrounding neighborhood by means of odor, noise,
dust, or other nuisance.
      B.   The additional parking required by the temporary use will be
provided on-site, if applicable, or adequate street parking is available in the
immediate area.
      C.   Increased traffic caused by the temporary use will not adversely
affect the surrounding neighborhood or City at large.
      D.   The proposed temporary use is consistent with all Comprehensive
Plan, Municipal Code, and City and State regulations.
   3.   Uses Permitted with a Temporary Use Permit.
      A.   The following uses are eligible for a Temporary Use Permit, provided
they meet the following criteria:

clearance sales used for the temporary extension of existing on-site sales.
         (2)   Truck gardens and stands used for the sale of locally grown
agricultural products.
         (3)   Farmers Market.
      B.   Garage sales are exempt from these provisions, provided they do not
occur any more frequently than one three-day event four times per calendar
year. Garage sales occurring more frequently shall be considered a commercial

“short-term” use shall be defined as those uses with a maximum duration of four
consecutive days or less. A “long-term” use shall be defined as those uses with
a duration of more than four consecutive days.

the location of such additional parking spaces, for the temporary activity
shall be determined by the Director of Community Development. The number of
permanent parking spaces allowed to be used under the short-term Temporary Use
Permit shall be reviewed and determined by the Director of Community
Development.
         (2)   The maximum number of permanent parking spaces allowed to be
used for the operation of a long-term temporary use shall not exceed 20 percent
of the parking on a site plan that was approved by the City to be counted
toward the allowable size of the activity or 20 percent of the site area,
whichever is more restrictive.
      B.   All unimproved parking areas and main walk areas shall be kept damp
or shall be covered with a material to prevent rising of dust.

Figure K
   5.   Parking. A minimum of two off-street car spaces directly accessible to
the private street for each mobile home lot shall be provided. Garage stalls
shall not count toward the minimum off-street parking requirements. These
required parking spaces, or parking areas, shall be so located as to provide
convenient access to the mobile homes, but shall not exceed a distance of 200
feet from the mobile home that it is intended to serve. All parking areas shall
be constructed with a concrete or asphaltic concrete surface. Parking stalls
shall be a minimum of nine and one-half feet in width by 20 feet in length.
   6.   Streets. The entrance road connecting the park streets with a public
street shall have a minimum road pavement width of 31 feet, measured back to
back of curbs. All interior streets shall be not less than 26 feet in width,
measured back to back of curbs. All streets shall be constructed in accordance
with appropriate ordinances and specifications of the City.
   7.   Anchoring and Skirting.
      A.   Tie-downs or anchors shall be provided on every mobile home stand.
Each tie-down or anchor must be able to sustain a minimum tensile strength of
2,800 pounds.
      B.   Skirting of a permanent type material and construction shall be
installed within 90 days to enclose the open space between the bottom of a
mobile home floor and the grade level of the mobile home stand. This skirting
shall be maintained in an attractive manner consistent with the exterior of the
mobile home and to preserve the appearance of the mobile home park.
   8.   Utilities. Sewer and water facilities shall be provided for each mobile
home lot in accordance with the requirements of the Iowa State Department of
Health. All units shall be individually metered in accordance with City
regulations. All mobile home developments must be connected to the municipal
sanitary sewer system and the municipal water system. All electrical and
telephone lines shall be placed underground. All gas lines shall be black
steel, 120#. Each unit shall have an accessible water shut-off valve as
approved by the Water Department.
   9.   Storm Shelters. Mobile homes are extremely vulnerable to tornadoes and
other high wind conditions. The greatest number of casualties in tornadoes
generally come from mobile home developments. This is primarily due to the fact
that the mobile home is usually not anchored to as firm of a foundation as a
regularly constructed building and cannot take the impact of the extremely high
winds and the accompanying flying debris. Tie-downs do not greatly increase the
stability in extremely high wind or tornado type conditions, though may be
fully adequate for lesser wind and thunderstorm conditions. Another concern in
mobile home developments is the closeness of the units which causes additional
damage. When one home is destroyed by the winds, the debris is forced into the
next subsequent unit and thereby weakening them in a domino type effect,
increasing both the loss to property and the residents. Every mobile home park
of 10 or more lots which is constructed after March 15, 1999, shall be provided
with above or below-grade storm shelters that conform to the following
requirements:
      A.   A minimum floor area of 12 square feet shall be provided for each
lot located in the mobile home park.
      B.   Shelters shall be centrally located to provide a minimum travel
distance of not more than 600 feet from any mobile home space. It may be
necessary to provide more than one shelter.
      C.   Shelters shall not be located in flood prone areas.
      D.   Shelters shall be designed and constructed to meet all applicable
requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
      E.   Shelters shall be designed by a licensed structural engineer or
architect and built in accordance with plans sealed by said structural engineer
or architect.
      F.   A shelter may be utilized for other purposes which are allowed as
accessory uses in this district; with the exception that the required minimum
floor area shall not be infringed, nor shall the function of the structure as a
storm shelter be limited in any way.
      G.   Shelters shall remain accessible at all hours.
      H.   For any addition of 10 or more lots to any existing mobile home
park, a storm shelter which complies with the general requirements of this
chapter shall be provided to serve such additional lots. For any addition of
fewer than 10 lots to an existing mobile home park which otherwise complies
with the requirements of this section, there is no requirement that an
additional shelter be provided to serve such additional lots. Provided,
however, that when two or more such additions occur, which result in a
cumulative addition of 10 or more lots, a storm shelter shall be provided to
serve such additional lots.
168.06   R-5 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (P.U.D.).
   The R-5 District is intended and designed to provide a means for the
development of large tracts of ground on a unit basis, allowing greater
flexibility and diversification of land uses and building locations than the
conventional single lot method provided in other sections of this Zoning Code.
It is the intent of this section that the basic principles of good land use
planning, including an orderly and graded relationship between various types of
uses, be maintained and that the sound zoning standards as set forth in this
Zoning Code and statutes concerning population density, adequate light and air,
recreation and open space, and building coverage be preserved. Planned Unit
Developments shall be permitted on any five acre or larger tract of land that
has been zoned or rezoned for P.U.D. purposes by the Council.
   1.   Principal Permitted Uses. Buildings and permitted conditional uses
shall be used only for residential purposes; occupant garages, occupant storage
space, and similar accessory uses; non-commercial recreational facilities, and
community activities, including churches and schools, with the following
exception; on a tract of land in excess of 80 acres or more, up to five percent
of the total net area may be developed for commercial uses such as those found
in the C-1 classification district. The following is a description of permitted
uses:
      A.   One-family dwellings, to include manufactured homes in accordance
with the following definition: Manufactured home, provided it is located and
installed according to the same standards for a foundation system, setback, and
minimum square footage which would apply to a site-built, single-family
dwelling on the same lot. Manufactured home means a structure built according
to construction standards promulgated by the United States Department of
Housing and Urban Development under authority of 42 U.S.C. Sec. 5403.
      B.   Two-family dwellings.
      C.   Multiple-family dwellings, including row housing cooperative
apartment houses and condominium units.
      D.   Churches, cathedrals, temples, and similar places of worship,
provided that all principal buildings be set back a minimum of 50 feet from all
property lines.
      E.   Museums, libraries, parks and playgrounds, community centers, and
similar uses operated by the City.
      F.   Golf courses, country clubs, tennis courts, and similar recreational
uses, provided that any such use not be operated primarily for commercial gain.
      G.   Public and parochial schools, elementary and secondary, and other
educational institutions having established current curriculum the same as
ordinarily given in the Southeast Polk Public School System, but excluding
boarding schools, nursery schools, and childcare centers, provided that all
principal buildings are set back a minimum of 50 feet from all property lines.
      H.   Any use that is approved and made a part of the Development Plan,
subject to any conditions attached thereto, shall be permitted.
   2.   Permitted Accessory Uses.
      A.   Uses of land or structures customarily incidental and subordinate to
one of the principal permitted uses, unless otherwise excluded.
      B.   Temporary buildings for uses incidental to construction work, which
buildings shall be removed upon the completion or abandonment of the
construction work.
      C.   Swimming pools when enclosed by a non-climbable barrier at least six
feet in height, and residential swimming pools when enclosed by a non-climbable
barrier at least four feet in height.
      D.   TV dish antennas in accordance with Chapter
167.11.
   3.   Permitted Conditional Uses.
      A.   Home Occupations. A Conditional Use Permit must be applied for and
received from the Board of Adjustment for a home occupation which does not meet
the requirements set forth in Section
167.15.
      B.   Communication towers (freestanding type), see Section
167.12.
      C.   Communication towers of the building-supported type, see Section
167.13.
      D.   Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECS), see Section
167.14.
      E.   Model Home. Shall not be operated at any time, other than between
the hours of 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Monday through Saturday and 12:00 p.m.
to 5:00 p.m. on Sunday. These hours may be reduced by the Board of Adjustment
as a condition of an approved Conditional Use Permit. This use does not include
offices for contractors, which are not allowed in residential zoning districts.
A model home Certificate of Occupancy is required for the term of the
conditional use. A Conditional Use Permit for a model home may be allowed for
up to an 18-month period.
   4.   Bulk Regulations. Although a P.U.D. is intended to promote and permit
flexibility of design and thereby may involve modifications of conventional
regulations or standards, certain requirements which are set forth below shall
be applied to ensure that the development is compatible with the intent of this
chapter. Height, setback, bulk, and other requirements set out in the
Development Plan shall constitute the basis for and become the zoning
requirement for that particular P.U.D., provided that refinements may be made
through final plan approval, if not defined as a substantial modification. In
addition, the following minimum requirements shall be observed.
      A.   The minimum lot and yard requirements of the original zoning
designation of the development need not apply. The Council may require open
space or screenings be located along all or a portion of the development
boundaries.
      B.   The height requirements of the zoning district directly adjacent to
the development boundary shall apply within 125 feet of the development
boundary and land.
      C.   All public streets, water mains, sanitary sewer, and storm sewer
facilities shall comply with appropriate ordinances and specifications of the
City.
      D.   “Common land”, as referred to in this section, refers to the land
retained in private ownership for the use of all residents of the development,
or to land dedicated to the general public.
      E.   Any land gained within the development because of the reduction in
lot sizes below minimum Zoning Code requirements shall be placed in common land
to be dedicated to the City or retained in private ownership to be managed by a
homeowner’s association.
      F.   The requirements of this Zoning Code relating to off-street parking
and loading shall apply to all R-5 Districts.
      G.   The final plan shall comply with the density requirements set forth
in the Development Plan, but shall in no case exceed 20 units per acre.
      H.   Project phases shall be substantially and functionally self-
contained and self-sustaining with regard to access, parking, utilities,
required open space, screening, and transitional elements and other support
features, and be capable of supporting required operation and maintenance
activities; temporary provisions, such as turnarounds or access easements, may
be required for this purpose; the initial phases generally should not be
comprised of the most intensive portions of the P.U.D., unless the City concurs
this is the most feasible means of developing the property in terms of access,
sewer service, or similar physical constraints, or will permit earlier
development of common amenities.
      I.   Attention shall be given to mitigation of existing or potential land
use conflicts through proper orientation, open space, setbacks, landscaping and
screening, grading, traffic circulation, and architectural compatibility. It is
the intent of this chapter to recognize that appropriate use of the design
techniques will provide the require mitigation, and thereby eliminate the need
for certain conventional regulations or standards. As examples and not
requirements: orienting views, access, and principal activities away from the
land use needing protection, placing those least compatible activities farthest
from the common boundary and those most compatible nearest, can create an
effective buffer; setbacks in conjunction with landscaping can mitigate
conflicts by providing a visual buffer, controlling pedestrian access,
softening visual contrast by subduing the differences in architecture and mass,
and reducing heat, and dense landscaping can reduce the width of physical
separation needed for such purposes; proper grading will control drainage, can
alter views and subdue sound, and channel access; fences, walls, and berms will
channel access and control visual, sound, and light pollution; proper
architectural use of color, bulk, materials, and shape will enhance
compatibility and reduce contrast, although details added to the building for
aesthetic purpose without consideration to form and surroundings may be
detrimental rather than helpful; and proper design of pedestrian ways, streets,
and points of congestion and safety hazards, and help prevent introduction of
noise, pollutants, and other conflicts into areas with less intensive land use.
Other techniques may also be used.
      J.   There shall be a minimum setback of 20 feet for any garage whose
opening faces the street.
      K.   Permanent care and maintenance of open space, recreation amenities,
and other common elements shall be provided in a legally binding form. Any of
these items, not dedicated to the City or held in single ownership, will
require the submittal of proposed bylaws of a homeowner’s association fully
defining the functions, responsibilities, and operating procedures of the
association. The applicant shall file the proposed documents governing the
association for review by legal counsel for compliance with the following
requirements at the time the final plat or site plan is filed;
         (1)   Membership shall be mandatory for each home buyer and any
successive buyer.
         (2)   The open space restrictions shall be in perpetuity, or
automatically renewable, and shall not terminate except by approval of both the
homeowners’ association and the City.
         (3)   The homeowners’ association shall be responsible for liability
insurance, local taxes, and the maintenance of recreational and other
facilities.
         (4)   Homeowners shall pay their pro rata share of the cost or the
assessment levied by the association shall become a lien on the property.
         (5)   The association shall be able to adjust the assessment to meet
changes as needed.
         (6)   No change in open space use or dissolution of homeowners’
association shall occur without approval by the City.
         (7)   Additionally, the proposed bylaws shall include, but not be
limited to, the following provisions:
            a.   Automatically extending membership in the association to all
owners of dwelling units within the development;
            b.   Limiting the uses of the common property to those permitted by
the final development;
            c.   Granting to each owner of a dwelling unit within the
development the right to use and enjoyment of the common property;
            d.   Giving every owner of a dwelling unit voting rights in the
association; and
            e.   If the development will combine rental and for-sale dwelling
units, stating the relationship between the renters and the homeowner’s
association and the rights renters shall have to the use of the common land.
      L.   Private open space shall be provided adjacent and accessible to each
dwelling consisting of balconies, deck, or yard. Required open space on the
ground level shall generally have a minimum dimension of 15 feet and minimum
area of 400 square feet, and one-half of the required area shall not exceed a
slope of five percent. Private open space for dwelling units located entirely
above the ground floor shall generally have a minimum dimension of six feet and
minimum area of 60 square feet.
      M.   Performance bonds may be required to ensure completion of
recreational amenities provided in lieu of public facilities, or for mitigating
elements such as screening or public improvements.
      N.   Except where the City agrees to other arrangements, a P.U.D. shall
be comprised of a single owner, or a group of owners acting as a partnership or
corporation with each agreeing in advance to be bound by the conditions which
will be effective in the P.U.D.
      O.   Covenants to run with the land, in favor of the City and all persons
having a proprietary interest in any portion of the development premises,
verifying that the owner of the land, or successors in interest, will maintain
all interior streets, parking areas, sidewalks, common land, parks, and
plantings which have not been dedicated to the City in compliance with City
ordinances.
      P.   Any additional agreements required by the Council at the time of
Development Plan approval.
      Q.   A final plat shall be submitted for each phase of the final plan.
The subdivider shall also submit a site plan for that part of the final plan
that is multi-family or commercial, per the Site Plan Ordinance. (See Chapter
171).
      R.   Signs in accordance with Chapter 159.
   5.   Procedure.
      A.   Pre-application Conferences. In order to eliminate unnecessary
expenditures of time and money, the developer shall first schedule a pre-
application conference with the Community Development Director, who shall
involve representatives of other departments as deemed appropriate. The
Community Development Director may require submittal of a generalized sketch
plan providing such information as follows:
         (1)   Location and size of the overall site, and of the individual
types of development of uses proposed within the site.
         (2)   Existing topography, indicating major earth-work areas,
stormwater runoff and detention considerations, floodplains, and any problem
areas.
         (3)   Existing tree masses and other geological and environmentally
important characteristics.
         (4)   Generalized vehicular and pedestrian systems and parking areas.
         (5)   Generalized building locations.
         (6)   Approximate gross density, and number and types of dwelling
units in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan; approximate gross floor areas
of commercial land uses, where permitted.
         (7)   Generalized utility line considerations with sanitary sewer
capacity limitations so noted.
         (8)   Generalized public and private ownership boundaries, including
common ownership areas, if any.
         (9)   Generalized building locations for small P.U.D. proposals.
   The Department of Community Development shall have 15 days in which to
review and comment on the pre-application sketch plan. Following the
Department’s review, the developer may request an informal consideration of the
proposal by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Said consideration shall be
non-binding on either party.
      B.   Rezoning or Development Plan Application. Following the pre-
application conference, the applicant shall submit a petition for rezoning in
accordance with standard City procedures for rezonings, accompanied by a
Development Plan and related documents, as described in Subsection 6.
         (1)   The petition and Development Plan shall be referred to the
Planning and Zoning Commission for study and report, and for public hearing as
required by this chapter for rezonings. The Planning and Zoning Commission
shall review the Development Plan for conformity to the standards of this
section, and may approve the Development Plan as submitted; require the
petitioner to modify, alter, adjust, or amend the Development Plan as deemed
necessary to preserve the intent and purpose of this section to promote public
health, safety, morals, and general welfare; or recommend that it be denied.
The action of the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be reported to the
Council, where upon the Council may approve or disapprove the petition and
Development Plan as reported or may require such changes thereto as deemed
necessary to effectuate the intent and purpose of this chapter.
         (2)   The Department of Community Development shall schedule all
required public hearings as soon as possible after all required information has
been submitted. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall report their findings
to the Council in a timely manner. In the event they fail to take action within
60 days after the date of public hearing, the petitioner or anyone located
within the notification area as defined for rezonings may request in writing
that the Planning and Zoning Commission complete their considerations. The
Planning and Zoning Commission shall then take action within the next 30 days
and report their findings to the Council for consideration by the Council,
unless the Council expressly grants the Planning and Zoning Commission
additional time to complete negotiations, studies, or other items as necessary.
      C.   Final Plans. Final plans for the Planned Unit Development shall be
comprised of site plans or preliminary and final subdivision plats as
appropriate to the situation due to requirements of the site planning and
subdivision ordinances or specific provisions of the Development Plan. Such
site plans and plats shall contain all information and be processed in the
manner set forth in said ordinances, in addition to complying with any specific
provisions of the Development Plan, and shall generally comply with the
development concepts outlined in the Development Plan. No public notice or
hearing shall be required for Final Plans unless required by the Development
Plan or caused to be required by the Planning and Zoning Commission or Council
as deemed appropriate. Provided that deviation from the Development Plan may be
permitted as refinements to the design and planning if not defined by this
chapter as substantial modification requiring amendment to the Development
Plan. Substantial modifications shall be submitted for approval by the Planning
and Zoning Commission and Council.
         (1)   Final plans may cover all or part of the Planned Unit
Development, provided that a final plan covering only a part of a P.U.D. is
hereby defined as a phase irrespective of contrary provisions by the
Development Plan and shall demonstrate the ability to be self-sustaining in
terms of access, services, utilities, open space, economic viability, and other
major consideration.
         (2)   If it is the desire of the petitioner, preliminary plat or final
Site Plan approval may be obtained at the time of Development Plan approval by
expressly declaring such intent and filing all information required by the
subdivision and site planning ordinances. Final Site Plan approval shall not be
granted for an unplatted parcel unless an accurate property survey is also
filed as part of the preliminary plat, if a plat is required, or as a certified
property survey in the event a plat is not required.
         (3)   The final plan shall include proposed housing, types of housing,
locations, density, building clearances, and documents, per the bulk
requirements section of this chapter, so that the Planning and Zoning
Commission and Council can adequately review all aspects of the proposed P.U.D.
         (4)   Upon approval of final plans, building permits shall be issued
in the same manner as for building permits generally. In any event where
platting is required, no building permits shall be issued until the final plat
is approved and recorded and all other requirements complied with. Final plans
shall be binding on the petitioner, and any and all successors in title, so
long as P.U.D. zoning applies to the land, unless amended in accordance with
the procedures set forth.
      D.   Amendments or Modifications. Substantial modifications to the Master
Plan shall be processed in the same manner as a rezoning and additionally shall
comply with the application process for a P.U.D. as set forth in this chapter.
Notice and public hearing requirements, and the effect of a denial shall be the
same as for rezoning, provided that the notification area shall be those
property owners proximate to the parcel covered by the amendment, as opposed to
the entire P.U.D.
   Further provided that, in the event a requested amendment for a portion of
the entire P.U.D. is denied, such action shall not create any limitations under
rezoning procedure on the filling of an amendment to another portion of the
P.U.D. having a substantially different notification area. Any ambiguities or
disputes between this section and procedures for rezonings shall be resolved in
favor of the more restrictive requirements.
         (1)   Substantial modifications are hereby defined to include, but are
not limited to, the following: increased density; intensification of use by
changing to a higher classification, with conventional single-family being the
lowest classification and progressing to attached single-family, multiple-
family, public facilities or uses, approved conditional uses, commercial (where
permitted); addition of uses, or elimination of conditions or restrictions on a
use or uses; increased floor area ratios, or other modifications considered
probable to generate increased traffic, sewage, waste consumption, or other
detrimental conditions; significant modifications to peripheral buffering or
screening, setbacks, height, location of buildings, drives, or other
improvements, which were intended for protection of proximate properties,
provided that substitution of equivalent screening materials shall not be
considered a substantial modification; modifications to the street pattern,
such as that of major streets or continuations of existing streets which will
have a demonstrable impact on traffic flow such as to effectively change the
functional classification of the street; modifications to access which may lead
to increased congestion, or to additional commercial or industrial traffic on a
local residential street; or other changes deemed substantial by the Director
of Community Development.
         (2)   Modifications to final plans shall follow the procedures of the
site planning or subdivision ordinances, as appropriate, except in the case of
a substantial modification as defined above.
   6.   Information Required on the Development Plan Application. The following
information, plans, and maps shall be submitted as part of the application for
a Planned Unit Development:
      A.   Names, addresses, and telephone numbers of owners, developer, and
designer; name of development, date, north point, and scale;
      B.   Legal description of the P.U.D., and map of the boundary of the
proposed P.U.D. as well as interior boundaries of proposed development phases,
and of any existing separate ownerships;
      C.   Sufficient information on adjacent properties to indicate
relationships to the proposed development, including such information as land
divisions, land use, pedestrian and vehicular circulation, significant natural
features or physical improvements, and drainage pattern;
      D.   Existing site conditions including contours at intervals sufficient
to indicate topographic conditions (generally two feet), drainage ways and 100
year floodplains, floodways, heavy woods, or other significant natural areas,
and existing structures;
      E.   General locations of proposed lots and attached residential,
multiple family, commercial (where permitted), recreational facilities; further
delineating areas with different uses or building types, and gross density per
acre;
      F.   General location and size of areas to be dedicated or reserved for
common open space, park, schools, recreation area, and similar uses, and how
any private facilities are proposed to be maintained;
      G.   Existing and proposed general circulation systems, including
streets, pedestrian ways, major off-street parking and loading areas, and major
points of access;
      H.   Existing and proposed general sanitary and storm sewer systems,
water mains, and drainageways;
      I.   Proposed development standards, including uses, density, floor area
ratios for non-residential developments, lot areas and widths, setbacks, and
exceptions or variances from general requirements of zoning and other
ordinances;
      J.   Sewer usage computations in accordance with the criteria of the
sewer district;
      K.   Treatment of transitional zones around the perimeter of the project
for protection of adjoining properties, including setbacks and buffer areas,
landscaping, fences, or other screening, height limitations, or other
provisions;
      L.   A narrative or graphic explanation of the planning and design
concepts and objectives the owner intends to follow in implementing the
proposed development, including a description of the character of the proposed
development; the rationale behind the assumptions and choices made; the
compatibility with the surrounding area; and design considerations for
architecture, engineering, landscaping, open space, and so forth;
      M.   A statement of intent with regard to selling or leasing all or
portions of the proposed development;
      N.   Proposed energy conservation methods, such as siting or design of
structures; and
      O.   Proposed phasing timetable.
   The Director may require any additional information which may be needed to
evaluate the proposed P.U.D. on the basis of special or unforeseen
circumstances, or may waive any of the above requirements if it is found that
such information is unnecessary to properly evaluate the proposed P.U.D.
   The above information should be shown in a clear and logical manner in a
legible scale. Sheet size should not exceed 36 inches by 48 inches. Generally,
existing conditions should be illustrated on a separate sheet for the sake of
clarity, although existing topography, access, utility, and sewer lines and
other items that are appropriate for understanding the proposal should also
appear on the proposed Development Plan. It is strongly recommended that an
architect, landscape architect, and civil engineer be employed to prepare the
plans.
   7.   Referral to Council. The Final Plan and required documents shall be
reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission for compliance with the R-
5 District standards and substantial compliance with the Development Plan. The
Planning and Zoning Commission’s recommendations and report on the Final Plan
shall be referred to the Council for final approval. The Final Plan, consisting
of a final subdivision plat or site plan shall be approved by the Council
before any building permit is issued.
   8.   Contingent Approval. The Council may make the approval of the
Development Plan contingent upon the completion of construction and
improvements within a reasonable period of time; provided, however, that in the
determination of such period, the Council shall consider the scope and
magnitude of the development project and any schedule of construction and
improvements submitted by the developer. Failure to complete all construction
and improvements within said period of time shall be deemed sufficient cause
for the Council to rezone the unimproved property to the classification
effective at the time of original submission of the Development Plan, unless an
extension as recommended by the Planning and Zoning Commission and approved by
the Council for due cause is shown. Any proposed change in the Development
Plan, after approval by the Counci,l shall be resubmitted and considered in the
same manner as the original proposal. The term “unimproved” property shall mean
all property situated within a stage or stages of the final development plan
upon which the installation of improvements has not been commenced.
   9.   Continuing to Second and Subsequent Stages. In no event shall the
installation of any infrastructure improvements be commenced in the second or
subsequent stages of the final Development Plan until such time as 90 percent
of all improvements have been completed and approved by the City for any prior
stage. In the event the first development phase has not commenced within two
years after the date of rezoning, or if subsequent phases are delayed more than
two years beyond the indicated development schedule, the developer shall file
appropriate information detailing the reasons for the delay with the Department
of Community Development. The Director shall review the circumstances and
prepare report recommending appropriate action to be taken concerning the
P.U.D.
   The Planning and Zoning Commission and Council shall review the matter, and
may continue the P.U.D. zoning with revised time limits; require that
appropriate amendments be made or action taken, such amendments to comply with
the procedures of this section if deemed substantial; continue the P.U.D.
zoning for part of the area, with or without revised time limits, and initiate
rezoning or the remainder to an appropriate district; or initiate rezoning of
the entire parcel to an appropriate district, provided that the rezoning shall
not be to a zone more restrictive than that applied immediately prior to the
rezoning to P.U.D. except after comprehensive planning analysis. The Planning
and Zoning Commission and Council may schedule such public hearings as deemed
appropriate. Approval of a final Site Plan or preliminary plat shall be deemed
to commence development, provided that the permanent placement of construction
materials shall have started and be proceeding without delay within two years
after the date of Site Plan approval, and a Final Plat approved within one year
after the date of preliminary plat approval in the event a Site Plan is not
required. Failure to comply with this provision shall void the Site Plan and
preliminary plat approvals, and make the P.U.D. subject to review as provided
above. It shall be the responsibility of the developer to comply with all
prescribed time limits without notice from the City.
   10.   Zoning Density of R-5 Districts. The zoning density of R-5 Districts
shall be determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission recommendation as
approved, or amended, or finally passed by the Council; and the density shall
be established and interpreted by the administration of the Zoning Code upon
the basis of the plan for the overall development of the tract as the plan is
approved and filed with the Council on final passage. In determining the
density of the R-5 District, it shall be considered what the zoning is of
adjoining property and the use of adjoining property and density of adjoining
property; however, this policy shall not be binding on the Council in setting
the final density for the R-5 District zoned properties. In no case shall an
average density be approved which exceeds 20 dwelling units per acre. Each
parcel of real estate that is zoned R-5 District must have its density
determined on the merits of each case. Any real estate zoned R-5 District prior
to the enactment of the ordinance codified herein shall be bound by the density
that is shown in the plans as accepted and approved by the Council for the
development of said real estate.
168.07   C-1 TRANSITIONAL COMMERCIAL.
   The C-1 District is intended and designed to provide space for limited
professional, retail, and service activities which serve adjacent residential
areas with reasonable proximity for the satisfaction of daily consumer needs.

168.09   C-3 PLANNED COMMERCIAL.
   The C-3 District is intended to provide for the development of shopping
centers. For the purposes of this section, the term “shopping center” means a
planned retail and service area under single ownership, management, or control
characterized by a concentrated grouping of stores and compatible uses, with
various facilities designed to be used in common, such as ingress and egress
roads, extensive parking accommodations, etc. Since shopping center
developments, whether large or small, have a significant effect upon the
comprehensive plan for the development of the City, extensive authority over
their development is retained by the Council and the Planning and Zoning
Commission. Many matters relating to the shopping center’s design, its
potential for success or failure, and its effect upon surrounding neighborhoods
must be considered by the Council and Planning and Zoning Commission in order
to be reasonably assured that the area will not eventually become blighted. It
is further intended that, in the event of an applicant’s failure to construct a
shopping center in accordance with a reasonable time schedule, the Council
shall enact the necessary legislation to reclassify the area to another
classification consistent with the surrounding neighborhood. Such action would
also, because of the reduction in commercial zoning in a given area, provide
conditions whereby it could be reasonable for the Council to classify other
areas in the vicinity for shopping center use.
   1.   Procedures. The owner or owners of any tract of land comprising an area
of not less than five acres may submit to the Council a petition requesting a
change to the C-3 zoning district classification. The petition shall be
accompanied by a plan for the commercial use and development of the tract for
the purposes of meeting the requirements of this section and by evidence of the
feasibility of the project and its effects on surrounding property, including
each of the following:
      A.   A site plan defining the areas to be developed for buildings, the
areas to be developed for parking, the location of sidewalks and driveways and
the points of ingress and egress, including access streets where required, the
location and height of walls, existing and proposed grades, the location and
type of landscaping and the location, size and number of signs, type or style
of architecture, building material, color, or other significant feature.
      B.   An analysis of market conditions in the area to be served, including
types and amount of service needed and general economic justification.
      C.   A traffic analysis of the vicinity indicating the effect of the
proposed shopping center on the adjacent streets.
      D.   A statement of financial responsibility to assure construction of
the shopping center, including landscaping, in accordance with the plan and the
requirements of this section.
   The Development Plan shall be referred to the Planning and Zoning Commission
for study and report. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review the
conformity of the proposed development with the standards of the Comprehensive
Plan, and with recognized principles of civic design, land use planning, and
landscape architecture. The Planning and Zoning Commission may approve the plan
as submitted or, before approval, may require that the applicant modify, alter,
adjust, or amend the plan as the Planning and Zoning Commission deems necessary
to the end that it preserve the intent and purpose of this Zoning Code to
promote public health, safety, morals, and general welfare. The Development
Plan as approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission shall then be reported
to the Council, whereupon the Council may approve or disapprove said plan as
reported or may require such changes thereto as it deems necessary to
effectuate the intent and purpose of this Zoning Code.

   The C-7 District is intended to provide aesthetically pleasing and
harmoniously designed developments that serve a larger regional trade area that
extends well beyond the City. Importance and detail is to be given as to the
developments layout, architecture, streetscapes, landscaping, and public
spaces. The C-7 District, as designated on the Comprehensive Plan land use map,
provide commercial establishments that offer a variety of goods and services to
consumers. The C-7 District is primarily intended for establishments that have
a large customer draw (e.g. regional pull), generate significant traffic and
parking need, and require close access to arterial (or higher functional class)
streets. High intensity uses that include large structures and sites are
encouraged, as is redevelopment and infill. The C-7 District is oriented
primarily to automobile traffic, although the design shall also include
adequate facilities for pedestrians, bicyclists, and public transit. The C-
7 District is a Planned Unit Development Commercial District. A Development
Plan shall be reviewed and approved by the Council. The Development Plan shall
be characterized by a planned or concentrated grouping of buildings and
compatible uses, with various facilities designed to be used in common, such as
ingress and egress roads, extensive parking accommodations, etc. Since regional
commercial developments, whether large or small, have a significant effect upon
the development of the City, extensive authority over their development is
retained by the Council and the Planning and Zoning Commission. Many matters
relating to the areas design, its potential for success or failure, and its
effect upon surrounding neighborhoods must be considered by the Council and
Planning and Zoning Commission in order to be reasonably assured that the area
will not eventually become blighted.
   1.   Procedures. The owner or owners of any tract of land comprising an area
of not less than 100 acres initially may submit to the Council a petition
requesting a change to the C-7 District classification. Amendments may be
allowed in as little as five-acre increments. The massing and clustering of
similar and compatible uses shall be done to maximize and maintain synergy for
maximum customer draw. The petition shall be accompanied by a plan for the
commercial use and development of the tract for the purposes of meeting the
requirements of this section and by evidence of the feasibility of the project
and its effects on surrounding property, including each of the following:
      A.   A Development Plan (also known as a Design Criteria Manual) defining
the areas to be developed for buildings, the areas to be developed for parking,
the design and location of sidewalks and driveways and the points of ingress
and egress, including access streets where required, the location and height of
walls, existing and proposed grades, the location and type of landscaping and
the location, size and number of signs, site and street lighting, type or style
of architecture, building material, color, or other significant feature.
      B.   An analysis of market conditions in the area to be served, including
types and amount of service needed and general economic justification.
      C.   A traffic analysis of the vicinity indicating the effect of the
proposed shopping center on the adjacent streets.

the shopping center, including landscaping, in accordance with the plan and the
requirements of this section.
      E.   A plan for phasing of the development is desired and necessary due
to size.
   The Development Plan shall be referred to the Planning and Zoning Commission
for study and report. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review the
conformity of the proposed development with the standards of the Comprehensive
Plan, and with recognized principles of civic design, land use planning, and
landscape architecture. The Planning and Zoning Commission may approve the plan
as submitted or, before approval, may require that the applicant modify, alter,
adjust, or amend the plan as the Planning and Zoning Commission deems necessary
to the end that it preserve the intent and purpose of this Zoning Code to
promote public health, safety, morals, and general welfare. The Development
Plan, as either recommended for approval or denial by the Planning and Zoning
Commission, shall then be reported to the Council, whereupon the Council may
approve or disapprove said plan as reported or may require such changes thereto
as it deems necessary to effectuate the intent and purpose of this Zoning Code.

existing, if any; and the location and dimensions of the proposed building or
alteration. The application shall include such other information as lawfully
may be required by the Administrative Official, including existing or proposed
building or alteration; existing or proposed uses of the building and land; the
number of families, housekeeping units, or rental units the building is

conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Code.
   4.   A temporary Certificate of Zoning Compliance may be issued by the
Administrative Official for a period not exceeding six months during
alterations or partial occupancy of a building pending its completion, provided

will protect the safety of the occupants and the public. The Administrative
Official shall maintain a record of all Certificates of Zoning Compliance and
copies shall be furnished upon request to any person.

for uses permitted in the district;
         (4)   That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, or necessary
facilities have been or are being provided;
         (5)   That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide
ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public
streets;
         (6)   That the conditional use shall, in all other respects, conform
to the applicable regulations of the district in which it is located; and
         (7)   That the proposed use shall be consistent with the comprehensive
plan.
   3.   In granting any conditional use, the Board of Adjustment may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Zoning Code.
Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the conditional use is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this
Zoning Code and punishable under Section
171.05. The Board of Adjustment may prescribe a time limit within which the
action for which the conditional use is required shall be begun or completed,
or both. Failure to begin or complete, or both, such action within the time
limit set shall void the conditional use.
170.07   POWERS; VARIANCES.
   The Board of Adjustment shall have the power to authorize, upon appeal in
specific cases, such variances from the terms of this Zoning Code as will not
be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a
literal enforcement of the provisions of this Zoning Code would result in
unnecessary hardship. A variance from the terms of this Zoning Code shall not
be granted by the Board of Adjustment unless and until:
   1.   A written application for a variance is submitted demonstrating:
      A.   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar
to the land, structure, or building involved, and which are not applicable to
other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district;
      B.   That literal interpretation of the provisions of this Zoning Code
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this Zoning Code;
      C.   That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant;
      D.   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Zoning Code to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
   No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the
same district, and no permitted use of land, structures, or buildings in other
districts shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance.
   2.   Notice of public hearing shall be given in advance of public hearing.
The owner of the property for which the variance is sought, or any agent, and
any other affected property owners shall be notified by mail.
   3.   The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person,
agent, or by attorney.
   4.   The Board of Adjustment shall make findings that the requirements of
this section have been met by the applicant for a variance.
   5.   The Board of Adjustment shall further make a finding that the reasons
set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance, and that the
variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of
the land, building, or structure.
   6.   The Board of Adjustment shall further make a finding that the granting
of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this
Zoning Code, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise
detrimental to public welfare.
   In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Zoning Code. Violation of
such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the
variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Zoning Code and
punishable under Section
171.05. Under no circumstances shall the Board of Adjustment grant a variance
to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this Zoning Code in the
district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the
terms of this Zoning Code in said district.
170.08   DECISIONS OF THE BOARD.
   In exercising the above mentioned powers, the Board of Adjustment may, so
long as such action is in conformity with the terms of this Zoning Code,
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirements,
decision, or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement,
decision, or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have
powers of the administrative officials from whom the appeal is taken. The
concurring vote of three members of the Board of Adjustment shall be necessary
to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of the
Administrative Official or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter
upon which it is required to pass under this Zoning Code, or to effect any
variation in this Zoning Code.
170.09   APPEALS FROM DECISION OF THE BOARD.
   Any taxpayer, or any officer, department, board, or bureau of the City, or
any person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of the
Board of Adjustment, may present to a court of record a petition, duly
verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part,
specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be presented to
the court within 30 days after the filing of the decision in the office of the
Board of Adjustment. The court may reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or may
modify the decision brought up for review.
170.10   EXCEPTIONS TO PROHIBITED USES.
   The Board of Adjustment may, by special permit after public hearing
authorize the location of any of the following buildings or uses in any
district from which they are prohibited by this Zoning Code. Notice of time and
place of hearing shall be given to all affected property owners at least 10
days in advance by placing notices in the United States mail:

   5.   Public cemetery.
170.11   DUTIES ON MATTERS OF APPEAL.
   It is the intent of this Zoning Code that all questions of interpretation
and enforcement shall be first presented to the Administrative Official, and
that such questions shall be presented to the Board of Adjustment only on
appeal from the decision of the Administrative Official, and that recourse from
the decisions of the Board of Adjustment shall be to the courts as provided by
law and particularly by statute. It is further the intent of this Zoning Code
that the duties of the Council in connection with this Zoning Code shall not
include hearing and deciding questions of interpretation and enforcement that
may arise. The procedure for deciding such questions shall be as stated in this
section and this Zoning Code. Under the Zoning Code, the Council shall have
only the duties of:

171.01   SITE PLANS.
   To assure that the design and location of commercial and industrial areas
will be in conformance with the zoning standards of this Zoning Code and are
properly related to and in harmony with the existing and future business and
industrial development of the City, including generally accepted principles of
commercial, industrial and civic design, a detailed Site Plan shall be
submitted showing the proposed use and development of all commercial and
industrial sites for recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission to
the Council for their approval.
   1.   Procedure.
      A.   A Site Plan Review is required whenever a person or other group
wishes to develop any tract or parcel of land within all zoning districts,
except for:
         (1)   Any detached single-family residence and two-family residences
including any accessory structure thereto;
         (2)   Agriculturally zoned property;
         (3)   New construction of non-residential accessory buildings less
than 1,000 square feet in gross floor area;
         (4)   Additions to existing non-residential buildings when the
addition is less than 10 percent of the existing building’s gross floor area or
the addition does not exceed 1,000 square feet, whichever is more restrictive;
         (5)   Changes to a project that has already obtained Site Plan
approval where such change is identified by the Council’s Site Plan approval as
an allowed change requiring only administrative review by the planning staff;
         (6)   Also where no new curb cuts are required; and
         (7)   Where new construction does not reduce existing parking or
significantly modify existing on-site circulation as determined by the City
Engineer.
   Said person shall cause to be prepared a Site Plan of such development and
shall submit 14 copies of said Site Plan to the Clerk. The provisions of this
section shall be applicable to the redevelopment, enlargement, or extension of
any commercial or industrial uses or structures existing at the time of
adoption of the ordinance codified herein.† 14  The Site Plan shall contain
such information and data as outlined here.
      B.   The Clerk shall refer a copy of the Site Plan to the City Engineer,
or such other person as shall be designated, from time to time, by the Council,
who shall review said Site Plan as to its compliance with the ordinances of the
City, its effect upon public utilities and the public street system, and submit
findings as soon as possible to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      C.   The Clerk shall also forward a copy of the Site Plan to each member
of the Planning and Zoning Commission. The Planning and Zoning Commission
shall, after receiving the engineer’s report, review the Site Plan for
conformity with the regulations and design standards contained herein, and may
confer with the developer on changes deemed advisable in such Site Plan.
      D.   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall forward its recommendation
of action to the Clerk within 45 days of the date of submission of the Site
Plan. If the Planning and Zoning Commission does not act within 45 days, the
Site Plan shall be deemed to be approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission,
unless the developer agrees to an extension of time.
      E.   The Planning and Zoning Commission may, in its discretion, hold a
public hearing on the Site Plan of the proposed development and prescribe the
notice thereof and to whom such notice shall be given.
      F.   The Council shall, upon receipt of the recommendation of the
Planning and Zoning Commission, either approve or disapprove the Site Plan of
the proposed development.
      G.   No Building Permit or Certificate of Occupancy for any structure
within any distance within which a Site Plan is required shall be issued until
the Site Plan has been approved as provided herein.
      H.   Upon final action by the Planning and Zoning Commission on any Site
Plan, a copy of said Site Plan, with the action of the Planning and Zoning
Commission noted thereon and signed by the chairman of the Planning and Zoning
Commission, shall be filed with the Clerk.
      I.   If the Administrative Official finds that any construction or
proposed construction or occupancy of a development on a tract of land for
which a Site Plan has been approved will not substantially comply with the Site
Plan as approved, or if the Administrative Official finds that the construction
and development of the tract is not being carried out in accordance with the
development schedule filed with the Site Plan, the Administrative Official
shall suspend all Building Permits for the development and order all
construction stopped until such time as the owner of the project or any
successors in interest shall have provided the Administrative Official with
proof satisfactory to said Administrative Official that the Site Plan will be
complied with. The Administrative Official shall not issue a Certificate of
Occupancy for any structure within the development while the Building Permit
for the development has been suspended pursuant to this paragraph. Any person
aggrieved by any decision or action of the Administrative Official under this
paragraph may appeal such action or decision to the Board of Adjustment.
      J.   If the owner or developer of a tract of land for which a Site Plan
has been approved determines that an extension of time is necessary or that a
modification of the Site Plan would provide for a more appropriate or more
practicable development of the site, the owner or developer may apply for an
amendment of the Site Plan. The Planning and Zoning Commission may grant an
extension of time or a modification of a previously approved Site Plan if it
determines that such modification of the Site Plan would provide for a more
appropriate development of the site.
      K.   Pre-application Conference. Whenever any person, partnership,
corporation, or any other group, public or private, proposed to develop any
tract or parcel of land or modify any existing development which requires a
Site Plan submittal, a request shall be made to the Department of Community
Development for a Pre-Application Conference. The Pre-Application Conference
shall include the applicant or representative, the Director of Community
Development, the City Engineer, City Building Inspector, and the Public Works
Director. The purpose of the conference shall be to acquaint the City staff
with proposed development and to acquaint the applicant or representative with
the procedures and with any special problems that might relate to the
development. The applicant shall furnish a legal description of the property to
be developed at the time of requesting the Pre-Application Conference, and the
Pre-Application Conference shall be held within 15 days of such request.
   2.   Design Standards. The standards of design are intended as minimum
requirements so that the general arrangement and layout of the development
requiring the Site Plan may be adjusted to a wide variety of circumstances.
      A.   All proposed developments for which Site Plans are required shall
conform to the Comprehensive Plan of the City; the provisions of this Zoning
Code, the Subdivision Regulations, if applicable; and all other applicable City
ordinances and statutes and regulations of the State.
      B.   The proposed development shall have such entrances and exits upon
public streets as are necessary for safety and the general welfare and shall
have such interior drives as are necessary for free movement of emergency
vehicles; and shall have such pedestrian walkways as are necessary for safety
and general welfare. The proposed development shall have such entrances and
exits upon adjacent streets and such internal traffic circulation pattern as
will not unduly increase congestion on adjacent or surrounding public streets
or create undue hazards to traffic safety.
      C.   The proposed development shall be designed with a proper regard to
topography, surface drainage, natural drains and streams, wooded areas, and
other natural features which will lend themselves to proper, harmonious, and
attractive development of the site. The design of the proposed improvements
shall make adequate provisions for surface and subsurface drainage, for
connections to water and sanitary sewer lines, each so designed as to neither
overload existing public utility lines nor increase the danger of erosion,
flooding, landslide, or other endangerment of adjoining or surrounding
property.
      D.   The proposed development shall be designed with adequate water
mains, provisions for sanitary sewage facilities, storm sewers (storm sewers to
be designed for five-year storm calculations) and drains and flood control, in
accordance with the ordinances and regulations of the City and statutes and
regulations of the State and good engineering practice to protect the public
health and welfare and not overload any existing public utilities. Surface
drainage shall be directed to storm sewers wherever practical, including the
requirement to extend public storm sewer, if deemed necessary.
      E.   The proposed development shall be designed and the buildings and
improvements located in such a manner as not to unduly diminish or impair the
use and enjoyment of adjoining or surrounding property and to such end shall
have such buffers, screen fences, and landscaping as may be proper and shall
minimize the adverse effects on such adjoining property from automobile
headlights, illuminations of required perimeter yards, refuse containers, and
impairment of light and air. For the purpose of this section, the term “use and
enjoyment of adjoining property” means the use and enjoyment presently being
made of such adjoining property, unless such property is vacant. If vacant, the
term “use and enjoyment of adjoining property” means those uses permitted under
the zoning districts in which such adjoining property is located.
      F.   The proposed development shall not unduly increase the public danger
of fire or diminish the public safety, and shall be designed to adequately
safeguard the health, safety, and general welfare of the public and of persons
residing and working in the development and in the adjoining or surrounding
property.
      G.   The proposed development and all structures therein shall be
designed in such a manner as to create a quality environment and to such end
shall be architecturally and aesthetically harmonious and attractive.
      H.   To such end as may be necessary and proper to accomplish the Design
Standards of this section, a landscaping plan prepared by a registered
landscape architect, nursery person, or such other knowledgeable person shall
be provided, along with plans which address erosion control and other
applicable requirements of this chapter and other City regulations.
      I.   Building Orientation. The orientation of any proposed building shall
be carefully scrutinized so as to mitigate the visual and audible impact of
service areas, loading docks, loading areas, or similar operations on the
adjoining properties and general public.
         (1)   Buildings shall not be designed or oriented to expose loading
docks, service areas, or nonresidential overhead doors to the public rights-of-
way.
         (2)   Buildings proposed in commercial districts that are adjacent to
residential developments shall not be designed or oriented to expose loading
docks, service areas, or similar operations toward the adjacent residential
developments.
         (3)   If it is not feasible to design or orient the loading docks,
service areas, or similar operations away from the residential developments,
additional landscape buffering, screening walls, fences, and setbacks may be
approved by the Council.
      J.   Architectural Elements. In order to reduce the negative aesthetic
impacts of large buildings, additional architectural elements shall be
incorporated into the overall building design.
         (1)   Non-single-family buildings proposed in residential districts
shall incorporate residential design elements such as pitched roofs, dormers,
cupolas, or other similar roof elements into the building design in order to
minimize the aesthetic impact of the differing uses.
         (2)   Buildings proposed in commercial districts that are adjacent to
residential developments are recommended to include an articulated roofline,
giving emphasis to architectural elements that will help divide the mass of a
large building into smaller, identifiable pieces. Flat roof buildings shall
only be approved by the Council.
         (3)   Commercial buildings shall incorporate architectural design
elements, materials, and colors into the side and rear building elevations
similar to those used in the front building elevation.
         (4)   Commercial buildings shall incorporate façade modulation in all
building elevations in order to preserve building scale and reduce the
aesthetic impact of long, large expansive wall surfaces. The variation in wall
surfaces can be accomplished either by physical offsets or by the use of color,
pattern, or texture.
         (5)   Roof-mounted mechanical units, satellite dishes, or other
similar equipment shall be screened from public view by the extension of a
parapet wall or other roof-mounted equipment, point-in-place screening shall be
required. Such screening shall have similar design features as the building
including material, shape, and color considerations. Wooden fences shall not be
considered appropriate.
         (6)   Buildings proposed or redeveloped in the “Old Town” area, as
designated in the Comprehensive Plan, shall maintain the historic nature, and
incorporate architectural elements and designs which complement and preserve
the character of the area.
      K.   Exterior Material Selection. The building’s exterior material
selection shall be compatible with other buildings and structures in adjoining
developments. The minimum requirements shall be as follows:
         (1)   In all R Zoning Districts, all non-dwelling, principal permitted
structures shall incorporate at a minimum, 50 percent brick, stone, or similar
substantial material into the overall building design. The percentage
requirement shall be calculated on the total exterior surface area exclusive of
glazed surfaces.
         (2)   In R-3 and R-5 Districts, primarily residential construction
materials such as: brick, stone, wood, lap siding, and architectural shingles,
shall be utilized in the design.
            a.   Attached dwelling structures shall incorporate at a minimum,
20 percent brick, stone, or similar substantial material in the overall
building design. The percentage requirement shall be calculated on the total
exterior surface area exclusive of glazed surfaces.
            b.   Multiple family structures shall incorporate at a minimum, 50
percent brick, stone, or similar substantial material into the overall building
design. The percentage requirement shall be calculated on the total exterior
surface area exclusive of glazed surfaces.
         (3)   In C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5, and C-6 Districts, the architectural
material selection shall be dominated with permanency and strength of material
in proportion to the aesthetic characteristics of the building’s bulk and
shape. Structures in these districts shall incorporate at a minimum, 60 percent
brick, stone, or “architecturally designed” concrete tilt-up panels. The
remaining surface shall be finished with split-face block, architectural tilt-
up panels, stucco, or architectural aluminum panels. Accent materials not
listed above may be incorporated into the building as an additional secondary
material to compliment and add architectural character and design elements. The
percentage requirement shall be calculated on the total exterior surface area
exclusive of glazed surfaces or door enclosures.
         (4)   In C-7 Districts the architecture shall be of the highest
quality, with detailed design. The architectural design of any building shall
conform to the approved Development Plan and Design Criteria Manual approved by
the Council. The Council, after receiving a recommendation from the Planning
and Zoning Commission, shall determine the appropriateness of an architectural
material when used as a building element as to whether the material enhances
the physical appearance of the development or provides continuity desired to
unite all structures within the development into the project theme. Buildings
shall be architecturally treated on all elevations to produce an aesthetically
pleasing façade which is of a design that complies with the approved
Development Plan. Attention shall be paid to breaking up solid walls by
incorporating window elements, multiple planes, and articulation of surfaces
through the use of wall modulation, offsets, parapets, and of various
materials, textures, and colors.
         (5)   The use of metal panels or sheet metal will not be considered an
acceptable exterior building or accessory building material in any residential
or commercial district. Metal panels may be used on the non-public faces of
buildings in M-1 and M-2 Districts.
      L.   Exterior Color Selection. The building’s exterior color scheme shall
utilize primarily muted, neutral, or earth tone type colors. The primary use of
bright, intense, or extreme colors not consistent with the adjoining
developments shall not be permitted in any zoning district. This regulation is
not intended to prohibit the use of these colors for specifically approved
architectural detailing.
      M.   Waiver of Design Requirements. The Council reserves the right to
waive or modify to a lesser restriction any provision or requirement of
architectural design elements contained in this chapter for structures that
have been constructed, legally permitted, or a Site Plan approved by the
Council prior to February 1, 2004. Said structures are considered
“Grandfathered” as legally non-conforming. The Council’s right to waive or
modify includes subsequent remodeling, building additions, and detached
accessory buildings or structures on the same lot as a “Grandfathered”
principle structure. Furthermore, the Council shall find that said waiver or
modification does not adversely affect the intent of these regulations to
adequately safeguard the general public and surrounding property. Exceptions
will only be considered for those areas where special circumstances warrant a
change and whereby the modification or waiver is determined to be in the best
interest of the general public. This section is not applicable to new
construction, unless specified here above.
      N.   Horizontal and Vertical Survey Control. The City requires all
projects that modify or add to the City’s infrastructure to be tied into the
horizontal and vertical control system as adopted on June 19, 2006.
         (1)   Vertical Control. A project’s vertical datum must tie into the
vertical control points provided in the City’s Horizontal and Vertical Control
Network with a minimum of one of the points being a Primary Control Point,
other points may be Secondary Points.
         (2)   Horizontal Control. A project may use an existing basis of
bearing and assumed coordinates that meet the project’s on the ground needs and
as may be required by practical and accepted survey methods. Although an
assumed horizontal coordinate system can be used, a project’s horizontal
control must also be tied into the City’s Horizontal Control Network by
labeling at least two points. The basis of the tie must be from a minimum of
one of the Primary Control Points listed in the City’s Horizontal and Vertical
Control Network with a listing of the points used to make the relationship.
   3.   Site Plan Requirements. All Site Plans shall be drawn at a scale not
less than 1 inch = 50 feet. Fourteen copies of the Site Plan shall be submitted
to the Clerk. The purpose of the Site Plan is to show all information needed to
enable the engineer, Planning and Zoning Commission, and the Council to

14 † EDITOR’S NOTE: Ordinance No. 8-19-93.
171.02   SCREENING.
   1.   Intent. The intent of screening regulations is to lessen the
transmission from one lot to another of noise, dust, and glare; to lessen
visual pollution by providing an impression of separation of spaces or entirely
shielding one land use from another; or establishing a sense of privacy from
visual or physical intrusion. The provisions of this chapter are necessary to
safeguard the public health, safety, and welfare.
   2.   General Screening. Every development shall provide sufficient screening
so that neighboring properties are shielded from any adverse external effects
of that development; and the development is shielded from the negative impacts
of adjacent uses, including streets and railroads.
   3.   Compliance With General Standard. The following table illustrates the
type of screen required between zoning classifications. Where such screening is
required, the applicant or burdened use is responsible for installation prior
to receiving an Occupancy Permit for the use in questions. A description of the
screen types (A, B, and C) are described in the following subsection. Where
screening is to be approved at Site Plan review (*), the screening objectives
described in the Site Plan, Section
171.01 are to be adhered. The Council may require additional screening where
deemed appropriate.

A, B, C, Described below
 
   4.   Descriptions of Screens. The following three basic types of screens are
established and are used as the basis for the table of screening requirements.
      A.   Broken Screen, Type A. A screen composed of intermittent visual
obstructions from the ground to a height of at least 20 feet. The broken screen
is intended to create the impression of a separation of spaces without
necessarily eliminating visual contact between the spaces. It may be composed
of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing
vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetations
will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage
of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. The screen
may contain deciduous plants.
      B.   Semi-Opaque Screen, Type B. A screen that is opaque from the ground
to a height of three feet, with intermittent visual obstruction from above the
opaque portion to a height of at least 20 feet. The semi-opaque screen is
intended to partially block visual contact between uses and to create a strong
impression of the separation of spaces. The semi-opaque screen may be composed
of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing
vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will
be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of
the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. At maturity,
the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any
completely unobstructed openings more than 10 feet wide. The zone of
intermittent visual obstruction may contain deciduous plants.
      C.   Opaque Screen, Type C. A screen that is opaque from the ground to a
height of at least six feet, with intermittent visual obstructions from the
opaque portion to a height of at least 20 feet. An opaque screen is intended to
exclude all visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of
spatial separation. The opaque screen may be composed of a wall, fence,
landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance
of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis
of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or
field observation of existing vegetation. The opaque portion of the screen must
be opaque in all seasons of the year. At maturity, the portion of intermittent
visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings
more than 10 feet wide. The portion of intermittent visual obstructions may
contain deciduous plants.
   5.   Storage Areas. The outdoor storage of materials, equipment, or
supplies, when permitted in any commercial or industrial district, shall be so
located or screened, fenced or landscaped so as to effectively prevent
visibility of such storage from all abutting residential zoning districts or
abutting existing residential uses. Such screening shall be sufficient if it
prevents visibility of such storage area by persons traveling on public rights-
of-way or standing at grade level on the side or rear lot lines of such
property. Such screening shall comply with the standard for an opaque screen
Type C as described in Subsection 4, Paragraph C.
171.03   CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
   1.   No land shall be occupied or used, and no building here-after erected
or structurally altered shall be occupied or used, in whole or in part, for any
purpose whatsoever, until a certificate is issued by the Administrative
Official stating that the building and use comply with the provisions of this
Zoning Code.
   2.   No change of use shall be made in any building or part thereof, now or
hereafter erected or structurally altered, without a permit being issued
therefore by the Administrative Official. No permit shall be issued to make a
change unless the changes are in conformity with provisions of this Zoning
Code.
   3.   Applications for Certificates of Occupancy shall be applied for
coincidentally with the application for a Building Permit and shall be issued
within 10 days after the lawful erection or alteration of the building is
completed. A record of all certificates shall be kept on file in the office of
the Administrative Official and copies shall be furnished on request to any
person having a proprietary or tenancy interest in the building affected.
   4.   No permit for excavation for, or the erection or alteration, of any
building shall be issued before the application has been made for a Certificate
of Occupancy, and no building or premises shall be occupied until that
certificate is issued.
   5.   A Certificate of Non-Conforming Uses shall be required of all non-
conforming uses. Application for a Certificate for Non-Conforming Uses shall be
filed with the Administrative Official within 12 months from the effective date
of the ordinance codified herein, accompanied by affidavits of proof that such
non-conforming use was not established in violation of previous ordinance.
171.04   AMENDMENTS.
   1.   The Council may, from time to time, on its own action or on petition,
amend, supplement, or change the boundaries or regulations herein or
subsequently established. However, no such amendment, supplement, restriction,
change of boundaries, or regulations shall become effective until after a
public hearing in relation thereto, at which parties in interest and citizens
shall have an opportunity to be heard. The notice of the time and place of the
hearing shall be published as provided in Section 362.3 of the Code of Iowa,
except that at least seven days’ notice must be given and in no case shall the
public hearing be held earlier than the next regularly scheduled Council
meeting following the published notice. The notice shall be published in a
paper of general circulation in the City. In addition to the notification
requirements above, signs shall also be erected as per Subsection 5. Such
amendment, supplement, or change shall not become effective except by a
favorable vote of a majority of all of the members of the Council. In case,
however, of a written protest against a change or repeal which is filed with
the Clerk and signed by the owners of 20 percent or more of the area of the
lots included in the proposed change or repeal, or by the owners of 20 percent
or more of the property which is located within 200 feet of the exterior
boundaries of the property for which the change or repeal is proposed, the
change or repeal shall not become effective except by the favorable vote of at
least three-fourths of all of the members of the Council. The provisions of
Section 414.4 of the Code of Iowa relative to public hearings and official
notice apply equally to all changes or amendments.
   2.   Whenever any person desires that any amendment or change be made in
this Zoning Code, including the text or map, as to any property in the City,
and there shall be presented to the Council a petition requesting such change
or amendment and clearly describing the property and its boundaries as to which
the change or amendment is desired, duly signed by the owners of 50 percent of
the area of all real estate included within the boundaries of said tract as
described in said petition, and in addition, duly signed by the owners of 50
percent of the area of all real estate lying outside of said tract but within
200 feet of the boundaries thereof (intervening streets and alleys not to be
included in computing such 200 feet), it shall be the duty of the Council to
vote upon such petition within 90 days after the filing of such petition with
the Clerk.
   3.   Before any action shall be taken as provided in this section, the party
or parties proposing or recommending a change in the district regulations or
district boundaries shall deposit with the Clerk the sum of $10.00 to cover the
approximate costs of this procedure and under no conditions shall said sum or
any part thereof, be refunded for failure of said amendment to be enacted into
law.
   4.   Whenever any petition for an amendment, supplement, or change of the
zoning regulations herein contained or subsequently established shall have been
denied by the Council until one year shall have elapsed from the date of the
filing of the first petition.
   5.   For any person, firm, or corporation who requests a hearing before the
Planning and Zoning Commission, a notification sign shall be erected at all of
the street frontages of the property. The notification sign will be provided by
the City and the message will be as prescribed by the Community Development
Director, and intended to inform the public of the proposed item and the time
and place of the hearing on said item. Such signs shall be installed by the
City, no less than 10 days before the hearing of the Planning and Zoning
Commission and shall remain in place until the final hearing before the
Council. Any person who removes a sign erected by the City without consent
shall be guilty of a simple misdemeanor.
171.05   COMPLAINTS REGARDING VIOLATIONS.
   Whenever a violation of this Zoning Code occurs, or is alleged to have
occurred, any person may file a written complaint. Such complaint stating fully
the causes and basis thereof shall be filed with the Administrative Official.
Said Administrative Official shall record properly such complaint, immediately
investigate, and take action thereon as provided by this Zoning Code.
171.06   ENFORCEMENT; PENALTIES.
   1.   Enforcement. All departments, officials, and employees of the City who
are vested with the duty or authority to issue permits or licenses, shall issue
no such permit or license for any use, structure, or purpose if the same would
not conform to the provisions of this Zoning Code.
   2.   Penalties for Violation. The owner or tenant of any building,
structure, premises, or part thereof, and any architect, builder, contractor,
agent, or other person who commits, participates in, assists in, or maintains a
violation of the provisions of this Zoning Code may each be found guilty of a
separate offense and suffer the penalties provided in this Code of Ordinances.
Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful
action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

   The following regulations shall apply to any plats of survey which create
new parcels within the jurisdiction of the City:
   1.   Recording. No plats of survey for any land within the jurisdiction of
the City shall be recorded in the County Recorder’s office or have any validity
until the Council has adopted a resolution approving and releasing the plat of
survey for recordation.
   2.   Application and Processing. Any person, firm, or entity, proposing the
division or subdivision by means of a plat of survey of any land into two or

175.05   PROCEDURE - SUBDIVISION PLATS.
   1.   Whenever the owner of any tract or parcel of land within the
jurisdiction of this chapter wishes to subdivide or plat the same, said owner
shall cause to be prepared a preliminary plat of said subdivision, and shall
submit 12 copies of said preliminary plat and other information to the Clerk.
The preliminary plat shall contain such information and data as is outlined in
Section
175.07 hereof.
   2.   The Clerk shall immediately refer copies of the preliminary plat to the
Planning and Zoning Commission and to the City Engineer. The City Engineer
shall carefully examine said plat as to its compliance with this Code of
Ordinances, the existing street system, and good engineering practices, and
shall, as soon as possible, submit findings to the Planning and Zoning
Commission.
   3.   After receiving the City Engineer’s report, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall study the preliminary plat and other material for conformity
thereof to those regulations. The Planning and Zoning Commission may confer
with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the kind and extent of such
improvements to be made. Before approving a preliminary plat, the Planning and
Zoning Commission may, at its discretion, hold a public hearing on the proposed
plat, notice of which shall be given by publication in a local newspaper of
general distribution, or by posting notices on the tract, or by sending notices
to affected property owners by mail. Such notice shall be given within seven
days prior to the public hearing. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall file
with the Council recommendations for approval or rejection of such preliminary
plat within 45 days after the date of submission of said plat to the Planning
and Zoning Commission. Upon receiving recommendations of the Planning and
Zoning Commission, the Council shall consider the same and, if the plat is
found to conform to the provisions of this chapter, the Council shall approve
the preliminary plat.
   4.   The approval of the preliminary plat by the Council shall be null and
void unless the final plat is presented to the Council within 180 days after
date of said preliminary plat approval.
   5.   Approval of the final plat and final acceptance of improvements shall
be given by resolution of the Council which shall direct the Mayor and Clerk to
certify the resolution which shall be affixed to the plat. Procedure for
approval of the final plat shall be as outlined in Section
175.06(5).
175.06   SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS.
   The standards and details of design herein contained are intended only as
minimum requirements so that the general arrangement and layout of a
subdivision may be adjusted to a wide variety of circumstances. However, in the
design and development of a plat, the subdivider shall use standards consistent
with the site conditions so as to assure an economical, pleasant, and durable
neighborhood.
   1.   Streets.
      A.   Comprehensive Plan. All proposed plats and subdivisions shall
conform to the Comprehensive Plan. All proposed plats and subdivisions shall
also conform to additional proposed street plans as set out by the City.
      B.   Continuation of Existing or Planned Streets. Proposed streets shall
provide for continuation or completion of any existing streets (constructed or
recorded) or any streets which are a part of an approved preliminary
subdivision plan, in adjoining property, at equal or greater width, but not
less than 50 feet in width, and in similar alignment, unless variations are
recommended by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      C.   Circulation. The street pattern shall provide ease of circulation
within the subdivision as well as convenient access to adjoining streets,
thoroughfares, or unsubdivided land as well as may be required by the Planning
and Zoning Commission. Permanent, dead-ended “cul-de-sac” streets may be
utilized as part of a street system layout, but deference is given to street
segments that allow “through” traffic. In a case where a street will eventually
be extended beyond the plat, but is temporarily dead-ended, an interim
turnaround may be required.
      D.   Street Intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly at
right angles as possible.
      E.   Cul-de-sac. Whenever a cul-de-sac is permitted, such street shall be
no longer than 600 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a
turnaround having a street property line diameter of at least 130 feet in the
case of residential subdivisions. The right-of-way width of the street leading
to the turnaround shall be a minimum of 50 feet. The property lines at the
intersection of the turnaround and the lead-in portion of the street shall be
rounded at a radius of not less than 150 feet; or equal straight approach
lines. A turnaround diameter greater than 130 feet may be required by the
Planning and Zoning Commission in the case of commercial or industrial
subdivisions, if it is deemed necessary.
      F.   Street Names. All newly platted streets shall be named in a manner
conforming to the prevailing street naming system. A proposed street that is
obviously in alignment with other existing streets, or with a street that may
logically be extended although the various portions be at a considerable
distance from each other, shall bear the same name. Names of new streets shall
be subject to the approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission in order to
avoid duplication or close similarity of names.
      G.   Physical and Cultural Features. In general, streets shall be platted
with appropriate regard for topography, creeks, wooded areas, and other natural
features which would lend themselves to attractive treatment.
      H.   Half-Streets. Dedication of half-streets will not be permitted.
Where there exists a dedicated or platted half-street or alley adjacent to the
tract of land to be subdivided, the other half shall be platted, if deemed
necessary by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      I.   Alleys. Alleys may be required in business areas and industrial
districts for adequate access to block interiors and for off-street loading and
parking purposes. Except where justified by unusual conditions, alleys will not
be approved in residential districts. Dead-end alleys shall be provided with a
means of turning around at the dead-end thereof.
      J.   Easements. Easements for utilities shall be provided along rear or
side lot lines or along alleys, if needed. Whenever any stream or important
surface water course is located in an area that is being subdivided, the
subdivider shall, at their own expense, make adequate provision for widening
the channel so that it will properly carry the surface water, and shall provide
and dedicate to the City an easement along each side of the stream, which
easement shall be for the purpose of widening, improving, or protecting the
stream and for the purpose of installation of public utilities. The waterway
easements shall be approved by the City Engineer. The total width of the
easement shall be adequate to provide for these purposes, and said easement
shall be a minimum of 50 feet on each side of the centerline of the stream or
water course.
      K.   Neighborhood Plan. If any overall plan has been made by the Planning
and Zoning Commission for the neighborhood in which the proposed subdivision is
located, the street system of the latter shall conform in general thereto.
      L.   Land Not Platted. Where the plat to be submitted includes only part
of the tract owned by the subdivider, the Planning and Zoning Commission may
require topography and a sketch of a tentative future street system of the
unsubdivided portion.
      M.   Major Thoroughfares. Where a new subdivision, except where justified
by limiting conditions, involves frontage on a heavy trafficway, the street
layout shall provide motor access to such frontage by one of the following
means:
         (1)   A parallel street supplying frontage for lots backing onto the
trafficway.
         (2)   A series of cul-de-sacs or short loops entered from and planned
at right angles to such a parallel street, with their terminal lots backing
onto the highway.
         (3)   An access drive separated by a planting strip from the highway
to which a motor access from the drive is provided at points suitably spaced.
         (4)   A service drive or alley at the rear of the lots. Where any one
of the above-mentioned arrangements is used, deed covenants or other means
shall prevent any private residential driveways from having direct access to
the trafficway.
      N.   Dedication. A deed to the City shall be given for all streets before
the same will be accepted for City maintenance.
      O.   Railroads. If a railroad is involved, the subdivision plan should:
         (1)   Be so arranged as to permit, where necessary, future grade
separations at highway crossings of the railroad.
         (2)   Border the railroad with a parallel street at a sufficient
distance from it to permit deep lots to go back onto the railroad, or form a
buffer strip for park, commercial, or industrial use.
         (3)   Provide cul-de-sacs at right angles to the railroad so as to
permit lots to back thereonto.
      P.   Street Widths. Streets shall have a width and cross-section as shown
in the Comprehensive Plan for the type of street involved.
      Q.   Street Grades. Streets and alleys shall be completed to grades which
have been officially determined or approved by the City Engineer. All streets
shall be graded to the full width of the right-of-way and adjacent side slopes
graded to blend with the natural ground level. The maximum grade shall not
exceed six percent for main and secondary thoroughfares, or 10 percent for
minor or local service streets. All changes in grades on major roads or
highways shall be connected by vertical curves of a minimum length in feet
equivalent to 20 times the algebraic difference between the rates of grades, or
greater, if deemed necessary to the City Engineer; for minor streets, 15 times.
The grade alignment and resultant visibility, especially at intersections,
shall be worked out in detail to meet the approval of the City Engineer.
   2.   Blocks.
      A.   Length. No block shall be longer than 1,320 feet. The distance of
1,320 feet may be reduced by the City if it is considered to be excessive in
its particular application.
      B.   Block Corner Radius. At street intersections, block corners shall be
rounded with a radius of not less than 15 feet, unless at any one intersection
a curve radius has been previously established, then such radius shall be used
as standard.
   3.   Lots.
      A.   Corner Lots - Widths. Corner lots shall have a minimum width of 80
feet in order to permit adequate building setbacks on both front and side
streets.
      B.   Double Frontage Lots - Prohibited. Double frontage lots, other than
corner lots, shall be prohibited except where such lots back onto a major
street or highway or except in the case of large commercial or industrial lots.
In addition, no fence or other structure shall be closer than 15 feet from the
major street or highway right-of-way. The yard between the major street or
highway right-of-way and the 15-foot setback shall include one hardwood
deciduous tree (Ash: “Autumn Purple,” Green [seedless]; Maple: Crimson King,
Norway, Sugar; Oak: Burr, English, Northern Red) and three shrubs for every 25
linear feet, or major fraction thereof, of lot width along the major street or
highway. The trees shall be at least one and one-half inch caliper and the
shrubs shall be at least 18 to 24 inches in height. The developer is required
to install the tree and shrub improvements before the final plat is approved.
Thereafter, the property owner is required to maintain the plantings and
replace them as necessary with approved materials. Whenever practical, existing
trees and shrubs should be preserved and incorporated into the overall design.
This section does not replace the screening requirements for commercial and
industrial properties. (Refer to Chapter 165,
Figure L).
      C.   Side Lot Lines. Side lot lines shall be approximately at right
angles to the street or radial to curved streets.
      D.   Lot Size - Public Sewer Not Available. For the purpose of complying
with minimum health standards, lots which cannot be reasonably served by an
existing public sanitary sewer system shall have a minimum width of 100 feet,
measured at the building line, and an area of not less than 20,000 square feet.
   4.   Improvements.
      A.   General. The subdivider shall install and construct all improvements
required by this chapter. All required improvements shall be installed and
constructed in accordance with the latest published versions of the Urban
Design Standards for Public Improvements and the Urban Standard Specifications
for Public Improvements under the supervision of the Council and to its
satisfaction. Inspection shall be provided by the City, at the subdivider’s
expense, as deemed necessary to assure quality workmanship on all portions of
the construction to be dedicated to the City. Said inspection costs shall be
paid by the subdivider before final approval will be given. These requirements
shall also apply to the unincorporated area up to two miles beyond the limits
of the City.
      B.   Grades. All streets, alleys, and sidewalks within the platted area
which are dedicated for public use shall be brought to the grade approved by
the Council after receiving the report and recommendations of the City
Engineer.
      C.   Paving. All paving of roadways constructed for public use will be
installed in accordance with the latest published versions of the Urban Design
Standards for Public Improvements and the Urban Standard Specifications for
Public Improvements and at grades approved by the City Engineer. Pavement type
may be based on characteristics of the roadway.
      D.   Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be constructed on both sides of all
streets being dedicated for public use. Sidewalks shall be a minimum of four
feet in width and shall be constructed of Portland cement concrete in
accordance with designs and specifications approved by the Council and at
grades approved by the City Engineer.
      E.   Water and Sewers. Water mains, sanitary sewer lines, and storm
sewers and their appurtenances shall be constructed and installed in accordance
with the latest published versions of the Urban Design Standards for Public
Improvements and the Urban Standard Specifications for Public Improvements and
the plans and specifications adopted by the Council. Water and sewer lines
shall be made accessible to each lot. At a minimum, water mains shall be eight
inches in size, hydrants shall not be farther apart than 350 feet, and storm
sewers shall be designed for five-year storms.
      F.   Underground Utilities. Improvements such as cable TV, telephone and
electric lines, street lights, gas mains, and similar facilities in any
subdivision shall be installed where necessary in any subdivision addition to
the City and all utility lines, except electric lines of nominal voltage in
excess of 15,000 volts, shall be installed underground. The subdivider shall be
responsible for making the necessary arrangements with the utility companies
for installation of such facilities. Said utility lines shall be installed in
accordance with the latest published versions of the Urban Design Standards for
Public Improvements and the Urban Standard Specifications for Public
Improvements and in such a manner so as not to interfere with other underground
utilities. Underground utility lines which cross underneath the right-of-way of
any street, alley, or way shall be installed prior to the improvement of any
such street, alley, or way in the subdivision. Incidental appurtenances, such
as transformers and their enclosures, pedestal-mounted terminal boxes, meters,
and meter cabinets may be placed above-ground but shall be located so as not to
be unsightly or hazardous to the public. Such incidental appurtenances shall be
in accordance with the standards and specifications of the City Engineer.
      G.   Horizontal and Vertical Survey Control. The City requires all
projects that modify or add to the City’s infrastructure to be tied into the
Horizontal and Vertical Control System as adopted on June 19, 2006.
         (1)   Vertical Control. A project’s vertical datum must tie into the
vertical control points provided in the City’s Horizontal and Vertical Control
Network with a minimum of one of the points being a Primary Control Point,
other points may be Secondary Points.
         (2)   Horizontal Control. A project may use an existing basis of
bearing and assumed coordinates that meet the project’s on the ground needs and
as may be required by practical and accepted survey methods. Although an
assumed horizontal coordinate system can be used, a project’s horizontal
control must also be tied into the City’s Horizontal Control Network by
labeling at least two points. The basis of the tie must be from a minimum of
one of the Primary Control Points listed in the City’s Horizontal and Vertical
Control Network with a listing of the points used to make the relationship.
   5.   Approval of Final Plat and Final Acceptance of Improvements.
      A.   Construction of Improvement or Posting of Bond. Before the Council
approves the final plat, all of the foregoing improvements shall be constructed
and accepted by formal resolution of the Council. Before passage of said
resolution of acceptance, the City Engineer shall report that said improvements
meet all City specifications and ordinances or other requirements, and all
agreements between the subdivider and the City; and the City Attorney shall
report that the subdivision owner has filed in proper form a maintenance bond
(or bonds) to cover all construction being dedicated to the City. Maintenance
bonds shall be in the name of contractors who have done the work. Maintenance
bonds shall be in effect from passage of resolution of acceptance by the
Council, then for the following number of years:
         (1)   Concrete paving   4 years.
         (2)   Storm sewers and appurtenances   4 years.
         (3)   Sanitary sewers and appurtenances   4 years.
         (4)   Water mains and appurtenances   4 years.
   This requirement for the construction of all improvements may be waived if
the subdivider will post a performance bond or certified check with the Council
guaranteeing that said improvements will be constructed within a period of one
year from final acceptance of the plat. The performance bond shall include the
costs of sediment and erosion control measures for the plat. However, if a
performance bond is posted, final acceptance of the plat will not constitute
final acceptance by the City of any improvements to be constructed.
Improvements will be accepted only after their construction has been completed
all in accordance with the rules above outlined. No maintenance work will be
done by the City and no public funds will be expended in the subdivision until
such improvements have been completed and accepted by the City.
      B.   Resubdivisions. The Council may waive the requirements for the
construction and installation of some or all of the foregoing improvements in
cases of resubdivisions where only the size, shape, and arrangement of lots is
being changed and no new streets are required and, in case of dedications of
land or rights-of-way to public use, where such dedication is in excess of the
needs of the subdivision and is desired by a public agency in lieu of a
purchase or condemnation proceeding.

177.02   STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSE.
   1.   The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 414 of the Code of
Iowa, as amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to
secure safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
   2.   Findings of Fact.
      A.   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community.
      B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by:
         (1)   The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood
damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately
elevated or otherwise protected from flooding; and
         (2)   The cumulative effect of obstructions on the floodplain causing
increases in flood heights and velocities.
      C.   This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
   3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Section
177.02(2)(A) with provisions designed to:
      A.   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows
so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
      B.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
      C.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
      D.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
      E.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
177.03   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   1.   Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter shall
apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City shown on the Official
Floodplain Zoning Map as being within the boundaries of the Floodway, Floodway
Fringe, General Floodplain, and Shallow Flooding (Overlay) Districts, as
established in Section 177.05.
   2.   Establishment of Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) for Polk County and Incorporated Areas, City of Altoona, Panels
19153C0210F, 19153C0220F, 19153C0230F, 19153C0240F, 19153C0245F, 19153C0380F,
19153C0385F dated February 1st, 2019, which were prepared as part of the Flood
Insurance Study for Polk County, are hereby adopted by reference and declared
to be the Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The flood profiles and all
explanatory material contained with the Flood Insurance Study are also declared
to be a part of this ordinance
   3.   Rules for Interpretation of District Boundaries. The boundaries of the
zoning district areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the Official
Floodplain Zoning Map. When an interpretation is needed as to the exact
location of a boundary, the City Engineer shall make the necessary
interpretation. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it
is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the City Engineer in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
   4.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used, and no
structure shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered,
without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
   5.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provision of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with
this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
   6.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
   7.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated Floodplain (Overlay) District areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create
liability on the part of the City, or any officer or employee thereof, for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or on any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   8.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.

177.05   ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING (OVERLAY) DISTRICTS.
   The floodplain areas within the jurisdiction of this chapter are hereby
divided into the following districts:
   1.   Floodway (Overlay) District (FW) - those areas identified as Floodway
on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map.
   2.   Floodway Fringe (Overlay) District (FF) - those areas identified as
Zone AE on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map but excluding those areas
identified as Floodway.
   3.   General Floodplain (Overlay) District (GF) - those areas identified as
Zone A on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map.
   The boundaries shall be as shown on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map.
Within these districts, all uses not allowed as permitted uses are prohibited
unless a variance to the terms of this chapter is granted after due
consideration by the Board of Adjustment.
177.06   FLOODWAY (OVERLAY) DISTRICT (FW).
   1.   Permitted Uses. All development within the Floodway District shall be
permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance (or
underlying zoning district) and provided they meet applicable performance
standards of the Floodway District.
   2.   Performance Standards. All Floodway District uses allowed as a
permitted use shall meet the following standards.
      A.   No development shall be permitted in the Floodway District that
would result in any increase in the base flood elevation. Consideration of the
effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption
that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly situated
lands.
      B.   All development within the Floodway District shall:
         (1)   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
         (2)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
         (3)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are
resistant to flood damage.
      C.   No development shall affect the capacity or conveyance of the
channel or floodway of any tributary to the main stream, drainage ditch, or any
other drainage facility or system.
      D.   Structures, buildings, recreational vehicles, and sanitary and
utility systems, if permitted, shall meet the applicable performance standards
of the Floodway Fringe District, and shall be constructed or aligned to present
the minimum possible resistance to flood flows.
      E.   Structures, if permitted, shall have a low flood damage potential
and shall not be for human habitation.
      F.   Storage of materials or equipment that are buoyant, flammable,
explosive, or injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited. Storage
of other material may be allowed if readily removable from the Floodway
District within the time available after flood warning.
      G.   Watercourse alterations or relocations (channel changes and
modifications) must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within
the altered or relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations
must be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
      H.   Any fill allowed in the floodway must be shown to have some
beneficial purpose and shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary.
      I.   Pipeline river or stream crossings shall be buried in the streambed
and banks or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due to channel
degradation and meandering or due to the action of flood flows.
177.07   FLOODWAY FRINGE (OVERLAY) DISTRICT (FF).
   1.   Permitted Uses. All development within the Floodway Fringe District
shall be permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other
ordinance (or underlying zoning district) and provided they meet applicable
performance standards of the Floodway Fringe District.
   2.   Performance Standards. All development must be consistent with the need
to minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance
standards. Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no development may
increase the base flood elevation more than one foot. The applicant will be
responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient
technical information to make such determination.
      A.   All development shall:
         (1)   Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement.
         (2)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
         (3)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are
resistant to flood damage.
      B.   Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved
residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation. Construction
shall be upon compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one
foot above the base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18
feet beyond the limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of
elevating (such as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed subject to
favorable consideration by the Board of Adjustment, where existing topography,
street grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the
methods used must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the
various forces and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential
structures located in areas that would become isolated due to flooding of
surrounding ground shall be provided with a means of access that will be
passable by wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this criterion
shall not apply where the Administrator determines there is sufficient flood
warning time for the protection of life and property. When estimating flood
warning time, consideration shall be given to the criteria listed in 567-75.2
(3), Iowa Administrative Code.
      C.   Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level. When
floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State
shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to withstand the
flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact, and uplift forces and other
factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the base
flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
      D.   All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
         (1)   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
            a.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
            b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
            c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic entry and exit
of floodwaters.
   Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access,
and low damage potential storage. Where the distance between the floor and
ceiling of the fully enclosed area below the lowest floor is five feet or more,
the applicant shall be required to sign and record with the County Recorder a
Non-Conversion Agreement that ensures the lower enclosed area remains compliant
with the criteria outlined in this Section
177.07(2)(D)(1).
         (2)   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
         (3)   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed
with electric meter, electrical service panel box, hot water heater, heating,
air conditioning, ventilation equipment (including ductwork), and other similar
machinery and equipment elevated (or, in the case of nonresidential structures,
optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation.
         (4)   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed
with plumbing, gas lines, water meters, gas meters, and other similar service
utilities either elevated (or in the case of nonresidential structures,
optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation or designed to be watertight and withstand inundation to such a
level.
      E.   Factory-Built Homes.
         (1)   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes,
including those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions,
shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
structure is a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation.
         (2)   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes,
including those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions,
shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Anchorage
systems may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties
to ground anchors as required by the State Building Code.
      F.   Utility and Sanitary Systems.
         (1)   On-site wastewater disposal and water supply systems shall be
located or designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the
system during flooding.
         (2)   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system
as well as the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment
facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood
protection equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood elevation.
         (3)   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water
supply treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with
a level of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood
elevation.
         (4)   Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
      G.   Storage of Equipment and Materials. Storage of materials and
equipment that are flammable, explosive, or injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base
flood elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated
or:
         (1)   Not be subject to major flood damage and anchored to prevent
movement due to flood waters; or
         (2)   Be readily removable from the area within the time available
after flood warning.
      H.   Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as
levees, flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the base
flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for
adequate interior drainage. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources
shall approve structural flood control works.
      I.   Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must
be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources must
approve such alterations or relocations.
      J.   Subdivisions. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and
subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the base flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50 lots
(whichever is less) shall include base flood elevation data for those areas
located within the Floodplain Fringe (Overlay) District.
      K.   Accessory Structures to Residential Uses.
         (1)   Detached garages, sheds, and similar structures that are
incidental to a residential use are exempt from the base flood elevation
requirements where the following criteria are satisfied:
            a.   The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential. Its size shall not exceed 600 square feet in size. Those portions of
the structure located less than one foot above the base flood elevation must be
constructed of flood-resistant materials.
            b.   The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage
potential purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure
shall not be used for human habitation.
            c.   The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building
site so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
            d.   The structure shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement which may result in damage to other structures.
            e.   The structure’s service facilities such as electrical and
heating equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above
the base flood elevation.
            f.   The structure’s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of Section
177.07(2)(D)(1).
         (2)   Exemption from the base flood elevation requirements for such a
structure may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of
the structure and its contents.
      L.   Recreational Vehicles.
         (1)   Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of
Section
177.07(2)(E) regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built homes when the
following criteria are satisfied.
            a.   The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less
than 180 consecutive days, and
            b.   The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
         (2)   Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than
180 consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements
of Section
177.07(2)(E) regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built homes.
      M.   Pipeline Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be
buried in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to
prevent rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
      N.   Maximum Damage Potential Development. All new or substantially
improved maximum damage potential development shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated a minimum of one foot above the elevation of the
500-year flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be
floodproofed to such a level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional
engineer registered in the State shall certify that the floodproofing methods
used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact,
and uplift forces and other factors associated with the two-tenths percent
annual chance flood; and that the structure, below the two-tenths percent
annual chance flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water. A record of the certification indicating
the specific elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to
which any structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
Where a two-tenths percent chance flood elevation data has not been provided in
the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be
contacted to compute such data. The applicant will be responsible for providing
the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to
make such determinations.
177.08   GENERAL FLOODPLAIN (OVERLAY) DISTRICT (GF).
   1.   Permitted Uses.
      A.   All development within the General Floodplain District shall be
permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance (or
underlying zoning district) and provided they meet the applicable performance
standards of the General Floodplain District.
      B.   Any development which involves placement of structures, factory-
built homes, fill or other obstructions, storage of materials or equipment,
excavation or alteration of a watercourse shall be reviewed by the Department
of Natural Resources to determine:
         (1)   Whether the land involved is either wholly or partly within the
floodway or floodway fringe; and
         (2)   The base flood elevation.
   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the Department of Natural
Resources with sufficient technical information to make the determination.
      C.   Review by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources is not required
for the proposed construction of new or replacement bridges or culverts where:
         (1)   The bridge or culvert is located on a stream that drains less
than two square miles, and
         (2)   The bridge or culvert is not associated with a channel
modification that constitutes a channel change as specified in 567-71.2(2b)
Iowa Administrative Code.
   2.   Performance Standards.
      A.   All development, or portions thereof, to be located in the floodway
as determined by the Department of Natural Resources shall meet the applicable
provisions and standards of the Floodway (Overlay) District (Section
177.06).
      B.   All development, or portions thereof, to be located in the floodway
fringe as determined by the Department of Natural Resources shall meet the
applicable provisions and standards of the Floodway Fringe (Overlay) District
(Section
177.07).
177.09   APPOINTMENT AND DUTIES OF BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
   1.   Appointment and Duties of Board of Adjustment. A Board of Adjustment is
hereby established which, hereinafter referred to as the Board, shall hear and
decide:
      A.   Appeals; and
      B.   Requests for variances to the provisions of this chapter, and shall
take any other action which is required of the Board.
   2.   Appeals. Where it is alleged that there is any error in any order,
requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in
the enforcement of this chapter, the aggrieved party may appeal such action.
The notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board and with the official from
whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason for the
appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to the Board
all the documents constituting the record upon which the action appealed from
was taken.
   3.   Variance. The Board may authorize upon request in specific cases such
variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances
granted must meet the following applicable standards.
      A.   Variances shall only be granted upon:
         (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (3)   A determination that the granting of the variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public or conflict with existing local codes or ordinances.
      B.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
      C.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      D.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for structures than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that:
         (1)   The issuance of a variance will result in increased premium
rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of
insurance coverage; and
         (2)   Such construction increases risks to life and property.
      E.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
   4.   Hearings and Decisions of the Board.
      A.   Hearings. Upon the filing with the Board of an appeal or a request
for a variance, the Board shall hold a public hearing. The Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the hearing and give public notice thereof, as well as due
notice to parties in interest. At the hearing, any party may appear in person
or by agent or attorney and present written or oral evidence. The Board may
require the appellant or applicant to provide such information as is reasonably
deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance or evaluation of a
professional engineer or other expert person or agency, including the
Department of Natural Resources.
      B.   Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal or
variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an appeal, the Board may, so
long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter,
reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in
writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision.
In granting a variance, the Board shall consider such factors as contained in
this section and all other relevant sections of this chapter and may prescribe
such conditions as contained in Section
177.09(4)(B)(2).
         (1)   Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board Shall Be Based. In
passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all relevant
factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
            a.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights
or velocities caused by encroachments.
            b.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
            c.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the
ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary
conditions.
            d.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            e.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the City.
            f.   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
            g.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to
flooding for the proposed use.
            h.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing
development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
            i.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for the area.
            j.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            k.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.
            l.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer,
gas, electrical, and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
            m.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
chapter.
         (2)   Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the
factors listed above, the Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such
conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
            a.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
            b.   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
            c.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed
restrictions.
            d.   Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this chapter.
            e.   Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the
flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration,
rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated
with the regulatory flood. The Board shall require that the applicant submit a
plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
   5.   Appeals to the Court. Any person or persons, jointly or severally,
aggrieved by any decision of the Board may present to a court of record a
petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole
or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be
presented to the court within 30 days after the filing of the decision in the
office of the Board.
177.10   NONCONFORMING USES.
   1.   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful
before the passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but
which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be
continued subject to the following conditions:
      A.   If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any future
use of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
      B.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
      C.   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless
it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
State or local health, sanitary, building, or safety codes or regulations, or
the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
designation.
   2.   Except as provided in Section
177.10(1)(B), any use which has been permitted as a variance shall be
considered a conforming use.
177.11   PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
   Violation of any provision of this chapter will be enforced as a municipal
infraction pursuant to Chapter 3.
177.12   AMENDMENTS.
   The regulations and standards set forth in this chapter may from time to
time be amended, supplemented, changed, or repealed. No amendment, supplement,
change, or modification shall be undertaken without prior approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
