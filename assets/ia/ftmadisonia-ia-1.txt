CHAPTER 4: GENERAL PENALTY
Section
   
1-4-1   Violation; penalty
   
1-4-2   Procedures and penalties for municipal infractions
§ 1-4-1 VIOLATION; PENALTY.
   (A)   Penalty for violations. Whenever in this code an act is declared to be
a public offense, an unlawful act or a misdemeanor, any person violating the
same shall be guilty of a simple misdemeanor punishable by a fine of at least
$65, but not to exceed $625. The court may order imprisonment not to exceed 30
days in lieu of the fine or in addition to the fine. Each day that the
violation exists shall constitute a separate offense.
   (B)   Violations. Violations of ordinances contained in Titles 3, 4, 5, 6,
8, 10 and 11 of this code may be prosecuted as municipal infractions and
violations of ordinances contained in Title 7, Chapters 3, 4 and 9 of this code
may be prosecuted as municipal infractions.
(Ord. C-198, passed 6-21-1994; Ord. C-525, passed 12-18-2012)
§ 1-4-2 PROCEDURES AND PENALTIES FOR MUNICIPAL INFRACTIONS.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   A municipal infraction is a civil offense punishable by a civil
penalty of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each violation or
if the infraction is a repeat offense, a civil penalty not to exceed seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for each repeat offense. Each day the illegal
condition continues shall be a separate offense subject to daily penalties of
$750. However, notwithstanding Iowa Code, section 364.3, a municipal infraction
arising from noncompliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement,
referred to in 40 CFR section 403.8, by an industrial user may be punishable by
a civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for each day
a violation exists or continues. (Ord. C-312, 5-4-1999) In the case of
municipal infractions where the citing officer determines a fine alone is
appropriate, and where no court appearance is required if the fine is timely
paid, civil penalties may be set by schedule set by standing resolution of the
City Council. Any violation of these ordinances, including those termed
“misdemeanors” in their respective code sections, including but not limited to
criminal violations contained in various parts of Titles II-VII and IX, may be
cited under Section 1-4-2, at the citing officer’s sole option, and in such
cases the citing officer shall indicate on the citation “no court appearance
required if fine paid within thirty (30) days” and shall further indicate
“Section 1-4-2 (Scheduled Municipal Infraction)”.
      (2)   The city may classify a municipal infraction, other than a
violation arising from non-compliance with a pretreatment standard or
requirement, as an environmental violation if the infraction is a violation of
Iowa Code Chapter 455B or a violation of a standard established by the city in
consultation with the state’s Department of Natural Resources, or both. The
discharge of airborne residue from grain, created by the handling, drying or
storing of grain by a person, shall not be subject to an ordinance, the
violation of which is classified as an environmental violation, unless the
person is engaged in industrial production or manufacturing of grain products.
The discharge of airborne residue from grain, created by the handling, drying
or storing of grain by a person engaged in industrial production or
manufacturing of grain products, shall not be subject to an ordinance, the
violation of which is classified as an environmental violation, if the
discharge occurs from September 15 to January 15. A municipal infraction which
is classified an environmental violation is punishable by a civil penalty of
not more than $1,000 for each occurrence. A person committing an environmental
violation is not subject to a civil penalty, if all of the following conditions
are satisfied:
         (a)   The violation results solely from the person conducting an
initial startup, cleaning, repairing, performing scheduled maintenance, testing
or conducting a shutdown, of either equipment causing the violation or the
equipment designed to reduce or eliminate the violation;
         (b)   The person notifies the city of the violation within 24 hours
from the time that the violation begins; and
         (c)   The violation does not continue in existence for more than eight
hours.
      (3)   The city shall not enforce this section against a person committing
an environmental violation, until the city offers to participate in informal
negotiations with the person. If the person accepts the offer, the city and the
person shall participate in good faith negotiations to resolve issues alleged
to be the basis for the violation.
   (B)   Provided by ordinance. The city, by ordinance, may provide that a
violation of an ordinance is a municipal infraction.
   (C)   State law. The city shall not provide that a violation of an ordinance
is a municipal infraction if the violation is a felony, an aggravated
misdemeanor or a serious misdemeanor under state law or if the violation is a
simple misdemeanor under Iowa Code Chapters 687 through 747.
   (D)   Civil citation. An officer authorized by a city to enforce a city code
or regulation may issue a civil citation to a person who commits a municipal
infraction. A copy of the citation may be served by
personal service as provided in Rule of Civil Procedure 1.305; by certified
mail addressed to the defendant at the defendant’s last known mailing address,
return receipt requested; or by publication in the manner as provided in Rule
of Civil Procedure 1.310 and subject to the conditions of Rule of Civil
Procedure 1.311. A copy of the citation shall be retained by the issuing
officer, and the original citation shall be sent to the Clerk of the District
Court. The citation shall serve as notification that a civil offense has been
committed and shall contain the following information:
      (1)   The name and address of the defendant;
      (2)   The name or description of the infraction attested to by the
officer issuing the citation;
      (3)   The location and time of the infraction;
      (4)   The amount of civil penalty to be assessed or the alternate relief
sought, or both;
      (5)   The manner, location and time in which the penalty may be paid;
      (6)   The time and place of court appearance; and
      (7)   The penalty for failure to appear in court.
   (E)   In municipal infraction proceedings.
      (1)   The matter shall be tried before a magistrate, a district associate
judge or a district judge in District Court if the total amount of civil
penalties does not exceed $2,000 in the same manner as a small claim. The
matter shall only be tried before a judge in District Court if the total amount
of civil penalties assessed exceeds $2,000.
      (2)   The city has the burden of proof that the municipal infraction
occurred and that the defendant committed the infraction. The proof shall be by
clear, satisfactory and convincing evidence.
      (3)   The court shall ensure that the defendant has received a copy of
the charges and that the defendant understands the charges. The defendant may
question all witnesses who appear for the city and produce evidence or
witnesses on the defendant’s behalf.
      (4)   The defendant may be represented by counsel of the defendant’s own
selection and at the defendant’s own expense.
      (5)   The defendant may answer by admitting or denying the infraction.
      (6)   If a municipal infraction is proven, the court shall enter a
judgment against the defendant. If the infraction is not proven, the court
shall dismiss it.
   (F)   Remitted. All penalties or forfeitures collected by the court for
municipal infractions shall be remitted to the city in the same manner as fines
and forfeitures are remitted for criminal violations under Iowa Code §
602.8106. If the person named in the citation is served as provided in this
section and fails without good cause to appear in response to the civil
citation, judgment shall be entered against the person cited.
   (G)   Court costs and fees. A person against whom judgment is entered, shall
pay court costs and fees as in small claims under Iowa Code Chapter 631. If the
action is dismissed, the city is liable for the court costs and court fees.
Where the action is disposed of without payment, or provision for assessment,
of court costs, the Clerk shall at once enter judgment for costs against the
city.
   (H)   Alternative relief. Seeking a civil penalty as authorized in this
section does not preclude the city from seeking alternative relief from the
court in the same action.
   (I)   Other actions.
      (1)   When judgment has been entered against a defendant, the court may
do any of the following:
         (a)   Impose a civil penalty by entry of a personal judgment against
the defendant;
         (b)   Direct that payment of the civil penalty be suspended or
deferred under conditions imposed by the court;
         (c)   Grant appropriate alternative relief ordering the defendant to
abate or cease the violation;
         (d)   Authorize the city to abate or correct the violation; and/or
         (e)   Order that the city’s costs for abatement or correction of the
violation be entered as a personal judgment against the defendant or assessed
against the property where the violation occurred, or both.
      (2)   If a defendant wilfully violates the terms of an order imposed by
the court, the failure is contempt.
      (3)   A magistrate or district associate judge shall have jurisdiction to
assess or enter judgment for costs of abatement or correction in an amount not
to exceed the jurisdictional amount for a money judgment in a civil action
pursuant to Iowa Code § 631.1, subs. 1, for magistrates and Iowa Code §
602.6306, subs. 2, for district associate judges. If the city seeks abatement
or correction costs in excess of those amounts, and the matter is not before a
judge in District Court, the case shall be referred to the District Court for
hearing and entry of an appropriate order. The procedure for hearing in the
District Court shall be the same procedure as that for a small claims appeal
pursuant to Iowa Code § 631.13.
   (J)   Motion for new trial; appeal. The defendant or the city may file a
motion for a new trial or may appeal the decision of a magistrate, district
associate judge or a district judge to the District Court. The procedure on
appeal shall be the same as for a small claim pursuant to Iowa Code § 631.13. A
factual determination made by the trial court, supported by substantial
evidence as shown in the record, is binding for purposes of appeal relating to
the violation at issue, but shall not be admissible or binding as to any future
violation for the same or similar ordinance provision by the same defendant.
   (K)   Criminal citation. This section does not preclude a peace officer of
the city from issuing a criminal citation for a violation of this code or
regulation if criminal penalties are also provided for the violation. Each day
that a violation occurs or is permitted to exist by the defendant, constitutes
a separate offense.
   (L)   Arrest, imprisonment and prosecution. The issuance of a civil citation
for a municipal infraction or the ensuing court proceedings do not provide an
action for false arrest, false imprisonment or malicious prosecution.
   (M)   Environmental violation. An action brought pursuant to this section
for a municipal infraction which is an environmental violation does not
preclude, and is in addition to, any other enforcement action which may be
brought pursuant to Iowa Code Chapters 455B, 455D or 455E.

      (2)   Terms shall be staggered to ensure continued experience on boards
and commissions.
   (C)   Board or commission. The words “board” or “commission” are considered
to be interchangeable for the purpose and intent of this title.
   (D)   Alternate member.
      (1)   In addition to regular members, the City Council may appoint one
alternate member to each city board or commission, with the exception of the
Library Board, now in existence or hereafter established.
      (2)   The alternate member shall, like regular members, attend the
regular meetings and special meetings of the commission to which he or she is
appointed. The alternate member shall review staff reports and documents and
otherwise prepare for such meetings. At such meetings, the alternate member
shall be identified for the record. That alternate member shall publicly
announce any items on the agenda that he or she is disqualified from
participating in because of a conflict of interest. If, as a result of
absences, there is not a quorum at a regular or special meeting, the alternate
member shall move to any vacant seat and shall participate as a regular member
until the completion of the agenda. If the alternate member participates due to
a conflict of interest of a regular member, the alternate member shall
participate as a regular member only until the affected item is completed. In
the event an absent member arrives after the commencement of an agenda item,
the alternate member shall participate as a regular member until the completion
of the current item, at which time the alternate member shall move back to the
alternate member’s seat and shall stop participating as a regular member. In
the event an item on which the alternate member has participated as a regular
member is continued to a subsequent meeting, the alternate member shall
continue to participate as a regular member on the item at any and all such
subsequent meetings.
      (3)   The qualifications, appointment, term of office, attendance,
removal and other requirements applicable to the alternate shall be the same as
those for regular members of a commission.
   (E)   Appointment to fill vacancies. The alternate to a commission, if
willing to accept the position, shall automatically fill a vacancy of a
position on the commission when said vacancy is created by the resignation,
removal or expiration of the term of office of a commission member without
further recruitment, application, nomination or Council action unless such
action would be in violation of gender equity requirements or the vacancy has
special restrictions regarding members (Historic Preservation, Tourism
Commission). All vacancies shall be filled in the same manner as appointments.
   (F)   Attendance. If any member fails to attend three out of five previous
regular meetings or three consecutive regular meetings they shall be considered
removed from the commission unless the commission has voted to excuse the
absences by an affirmative, recorded, majority vote. The appointment of any
removed member, whose absences are not excused, may only be extended or renewed
by action of the Mayor with approval of the City Council.
   (G)   Council and staff liaison. The Mayor may designate a Council member to
serve as a liaison to any commission. The liaison shall serve in such capacity
at the pleasure of the Council. The City Manager may also designate a staff
member to assist as time, staffing and work load allow.
   (H)   Officers. Each commission shall select a Chairperson and Vice
Chairperson from the eligible members of their respective commission during a
regularly scheduled meeting.
   (I)   Removals. All members serve at the pleasure of the Council and may be
removed by a three-fifths’ vote of the full Council.
   (J)   Quorum. A quorum shall consist of a majority of members serving at
such time as any meeting is scheduled or called. Vacant positions must be
included when calculating the number of members that must be present for a
quorum.
   (K)   Gender balance. The intent of this paragraph is to help attain and
assure gender balance on all appointed by the City Council and to be in
conformance with Iowa Code § 69.16A(2) regarding such appointments. It is the
policy of the city to not discriminate against any citizen or applicant to a
commission due to the sex of such citizen or applicant. Upon considering a
person’s interests, education, life experiences and willingness to serve, all
things being equal, preference for appointments to individual commissions shall
be made to balance such commission on the basis of equal numbers of male and
female appointees.
   (L)   All members of boards and commissions shall adhere to the latest
updated version of the Iowa City-County Management Association Code of Ethics
in all duties and obligations incumbent upon them.

appeal, give public notice thereof and decide the same within a reasonable
time. Upon the hearing any party may appear in person or by agent or by

      (2)   An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the administrative officer certifies to the Board, after
the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him or her, that by reason of
facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his or her opinion, cause
imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be
stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board
or by a court of record on application or notice to the administrative officer
and on due cause shown.
(Ord. D-047, passed 11-21-2017)
§ 2-2-5 JURISDICTION.
   The Board shall have the following powers:
   (A)   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any
order, requirement, decision or determination made by the administrative
officer in the enforcement of Title 10 of this code of ordinances;
   (B)   To hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of Title 10 of this
code of ordinances upon which the Board is required to pass under the
provisions of Title 10 of this code of ordinances;
   (C)   Where the street or lot layout on the ground actually varies from the
street and lot lines as shown on the zoning map, the Board shall interpret the
map and the provisions of Title 10 of this code of ordinances in such a way as
to carry out the intent and purposes of Title 10 of this code of ordinances for
the particular district or section in question;
   (D)   To permit the reconstruction, within one year and use as before of a
non-conforming building destroyed or damaged to more than 65% of its value by
explosion, fire, act of God or public enemy or other calamity, where the Board
finds that the public needs require a continuance of the non-conforming use and
that such continuance would not primarily permit a continuation of a monopoly;

any location for a public service corporation for public utility purposes which
is determined reasonably necessary for the public convenience or welfare; and
   (F)   To authorize, upon appeal in specific cases, such variance from the
terms of Title 10 of this code of ordinances as will not be contrary to the
public interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions herein will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the
spirit of Title 10 of this code of ordinances shall be observed and substantial
justice done. The Board shall be satisfied by the evidence heard before it that
the granting of such variance will alleviate a hardship approaching
confiscation as distinguished from a special privilege sought by the owner.

Statutory reference:
   Related provisions, see Iowa Code § 414.12
§ 2-2-6 BOARD AUTHORITY.

the provisions of Title 10 of this code of ordinances, reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or

   This chapter shall be known as the “Housing Code”.
(Ord. C-519, passed 5-15-2012)
§ 3-5-2 INTENT; PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is in the public interest that all rental housing properties comply
with minimum standards regarding the health and safety of the public. The most
effective way to ensure compliance with minimum standards is through routine
inspections of rental housing properties.
   (B)   It is the intent of this chapter to establish a rental housing
inspection program aimed at securing city-wide compliance of rental housing
properties with minimum standards. City-wide compliance will prevent blight and
ensure that all persons who live in rental housing units are provided decent,
safe and sanitary housing.
   (C)   The preservation of existing rental housing in the city is important.
In the city, approximately one-fourth of all housing units are rental units.
   (D)   Over time rental housing can deteriorate because of both intentional
and unintentional neglect of property owners, managers and tenants.
Deterioration can result in substandard conditions that adversely affect the
economic values of neighboring structures and that are hazardous to the public
health and safety.

later, file a registration statement for each such building on forms provided
by the city’s Fire and Building Department. The registration and provisions of
this section shall remain in effect for that period the building remains
vacant.

registered as a vacant building until sold. A property which is listed with MLS

registered as a “seasonal” property at no cost to the owner to assist city
staff and the property owner with any concerns regarding said property during

exempt from the requirements of this chapter provided the city is added as a
certificate holder on the insurance policy. To qualify for exemption, the owner
must submit a form titled “Vacant Building Registration - Insurance/Utility
Exemption” as well as proof of active utilities and have their insurance agent
submit a certificate of insurance showing the city as a certificate holder. In
the event code violations are found by the city and are not repaired as
required by notice given, the property will be deemed non-compliant for vacant
building registration - insurance/utility exemption and shall be required to be
registered in the vacant building registration program for a period of not less
than two full registration cycles; and
      (8)   Property owned by the city.
(Ord. D-87, passed 5-3-2022)

   (D)   Upon the third year of vacancy, the registration fee will double from
the original full-year registration fee and not the prorated fee. Upon the
fourth year of registration, the registration fee will double from the third-
year registration fee and all subsequent fees will remain consistent with the
fourth-year fee.
   (E)   If the property is transferred to new ownership and remains vacant,
the new owner shall file an amended registration form within 30 days of
transfer of ownership. If the building is already registered as vacant the new
owner shall not be required to submit the registration fee for the year already
paid. The new owner shall submit the previous owner’s inspection log as
required in the inspections section of this code. If an inspection log is not
obtained from the previous owner, the owner shall schedule an inspection with
the Building Official within 30 days of registration.

Title 3, Chapter 5, of this code of ordinances) may be transferred to the
Vacant Building Registration Program without having to pay the fee for the

other such charges assessed for non-compliance with the property maintenance
standards of this section or other code provisions in this section or elsewhere
in the city ordinances.

§ 3-10-2 APPLICABILITY; AUTHORITY FOR ENFORCEMENT.
   The requirements and standards set forth in this chapter are applicable to
all properties, residential, commercial or otherwise, situated within the city
limits of Fort Madison, Iowa. The code officials of the City of Fort Madison
shall be responsible for the enforcement of this chapter and shall have all the
necessary authority to carry out such enforcement, including the right to
request entry and inspect any property within city limits against which a
sufficient complaint has been made and which is substantiated by the Code

designated by the City Administrator to enforce this chapter, shall be known
and referred to throughout this chapter as the Code Official.

§ 3-10-3 COMPLAINTS; SUFFICIENCY OF COMPLAINTS.
   (A)   A code official may request entry and conduct an inspection for a
violation of this chapter upon receipt and substantiation of a complaint lodged
against a single-family owner-occupied property. The Code Official must provide
the owner with a written request for entry into the home and such written
request must include a notice to the owner of their right to deny the entry
request. The written request must also contain a statement informing the owner
that denial of the entry request may result in the Code Official applying for
an administrative warrant and court order authorizing entry by the Code
Official regardless of the owner’s objection so long as the warrant procedure
and subsequent entry are performed according to state and federal
constitutional standards.
   (B)   Complaints are deemed sufficient to trigger this authority if they
meet the following criteria for substantiation, as applicable:
      (1)   Exterior complaints. If a complaint is made about any condition
visible from the exterior of the single-family owner-occupied dwelling (for
example, smoke/carbon monoxide detectors, mold, etc.), a complaint will be
deemed sufficient if the complaint states in detail the violation alleged and
is subsequently verified by an authorized code official.
      (2)   Interior complaints. If a complaint is made about any condition
visible only from the interior of the single-family owner-occupied dwelling
(for example, smoke/carbon monoxide detectors, mold, etc.), a complaint will be
deemed sufficient if the complaint states in detail the violation alleged and
is accompanied by photographs of the violation alleged for review by the Code
Official.
   (C)   Complaints about any portion of a rental property as defined in
Chapter 5, Housing Code, are governed by the provisions of Chapter 5.

      (10)   Such other and further information as may be required by the Clerk
to aid the Clerk in determining whether or not the application shall be

(Ord. B-395, passed 1-18-1983)
§ 4-3-4 ISSUANCE OF LICENSE.
   Upon the Clerk determining that a person applying for a license has complied
with the terms of §
4-3-3 of this chapter, that the solicitation so described is in the best
interests of the residents of the city, and that the other sections of this
chapter and ordinances of the city will be obeyed in the conduct of the
solicitations so described, the Clerk shall issue a license to solicit funds.
Failure to so make one or more of the above findings shall be grounds for the
Clerk to deny such license. The methods of solicitation and of expenditure and
distribution of funds and the period of solicitation set forth in the
application, as varied by the Clerk, shall be deemed to be incorporated into
and shall become a part of the license for that person.
(Ord. B-395, passed 1-18-1983)
§ 4-3-5 DURATION OF LICENSE.
   The license issued by the Clerk shall be issued in the name of the
organization, shall embody the particular information contained in the
application therefor, and shall be valid until revoked by the Clerk,
invalidated as described in this section, or turned in by the licensee,
whichever event shall occur first in time. Such license shall permit the
licensee to solicit for contributions of funds in the city so long as the name
and makeup of the organization, the goals and purposes thereof, the manner and
method of solicitation and the proposed distribution of the gross collections
remain the same as stated in the application; if any of those particulars
change, the license shall become and remain invalid until the applicant has
submitted the pertinent corrective information to the City Clerk for approval
by the Clerk, which approval shall again validate the current license.

§ 4-3-6 LICENSE FEE; BOND.

at the time of filing application, and again at any time thereafter when
corrective information such as that described in §
4-3-5 of this chapter is thereafter provided to the City Clerk. In the event
the initial application, or the application with such corrective information is
disapproved by the Clerk, such fee shall be retained by the city. The applicant
shall be required to file bond only in those instances when the Clerk, upon
investigation, determines that insufficient information of local operations by
the person or organization conducting the solicitation has been given to the
Clerk to permit a determination of the propriety of the manner of solicitation
of funds by the organization, or of the adherence of the organization
conducting such solicitation to this chapter or to other ordinances or laws, or
of the proper distribution of funds so raised. In such event, before
authorizing issuance of a license, the Clerk may require a corporate bond to be
executed and delivered to the city in the penal sum of $5,000, conditioned upon
the faithful handling and distribution of the funds so raised, and upon the
funds being solicited in the manner specified in the application and not
contrary to this chapter or other city ordinances or state law. After a period
of operation under a license, but no sooner than six months after its issuance,
the licensee may request that the Clerk relieve it of the requirement of bond,
and in the discretion of the Clerk, it may be so relieved or the period of bond
may be continued until a later date.

the City Clerk.
   (C)   Failure of compliance with divisions (A) and (B) above shall be deemed
a violation of this chapter and, in addition to other legal remedy, failure of
compliance with division (A) above shall be cause for prohibition of further
solicitation by the person or organization in the city until the terms of that
division (A) above are met.

section, within or directly adjacent to city-owned buildings may do so in such

§ 4-3-13 REVOCATION.
   In the event the City Council is advised of circumstances indicating that
the terms of its license or the terms of this chapter have been violated by the
holder of a license granted under the terms of this chapter, the City Council
may cause notice to be mailed to the person whose name and address are shown by
the organization’s most recent filing to be the proper person, demanding that
such person or other representative of the license holder appear for hearing at
a set time, date and place to show cause why the license should not be revoked.
After such hearing, if the City Council shall conclude that a violation has
occurred and that the license should be revoked, it may revoke the license and

which there is a garbage collection service provided, the owner or tenant will
be assessed the monthly service charge. There shall be a garbage deposit
payable by all renters of rental units and chargeable against all rental

Office. Delinquent accounts will be assessed a ten percent (10%) penalty. All
delinquent accounts are subject to termination of service and further
collection without notice.
   (D)   Delinquent Accounts:
      (1)   If a delinquent account is not paid within thirty (30) days, the
City shall have all rights under law to proceed against the user to collect the
unpaid charges, and in addition, the City may proceed for collection of the
unpaid charges in any manner provided by law for the collection of a Municipal
claim.
      (2)   Upon institution of collection measures or certification of the
delinquent bill to the county treasurer, a service charge of fifteen percent
(15) of the total bill, but not less than one dollar ($1.00), shall be added.
All associated costs will be attached to the bill for this service.

   (A)   For water supplied to customers outside the corporate limits, upon
approval of supplying water to said customer the rates shall be 200% of the
base and usage rates listed above.
   (B)   (1)   Each individual residential and commercial unit being supplied
city water, including each individual home within a mobile home park, shall be
assessed, on a monthly basis, a base rate for water usage, whether separately
metered or not. For example, each occupied unit of a four-plex being provided
city water shall be assessed for a base rate each month. The usage rate,
however, shall be assessed per meter, not per unit served. Units within a
complex, whether residential, commercial or mobile home park, separately
metered for water usage shall be separately billed for both base and usage
rates and the amount of water used by those units within the complex shall be
subtracted from the amount of water shown as being used by the master meter for
the complex for purposes of billing usage to the owner of the complex.
      (2)   Returning to the four-plex example, if all four units were occupied
and being provided city water through one meter, the party owning the property
would be billed for four monthly base rates, and the usage rate would be
assessed against that party for all water used. If one of the four-plex units
were separately metered, that unit would be billed separately for not only its
base rate, but for its usage as well, and the amount of water it used would be
subtracted from the master meter reading to determine the usage to bill the
owner of the complex and that party would be billed for that usage, as well as
for three base rates.

§ 7-2-2 APPLICABILITY.

THEFT
§ 7-2-5 THEFT OF PROPERTY.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to commit a theft. A person commits
theft when the person does any of the following:
   (A)   Takes possession or control of the property of another, or property in
the possession of another, with the intent to deprive the other thereof;
   (B)   Misappropriates property which the person has in trust, or property of
another which the person has in his or her possession or control, whether such
possession or control is lawful or unlawful, by using or disposing of it in a
manner which is inconsistent with or a denial of the trust or of the owner’s
rights in such property, or conceals found property, or appropriates such
property to his or her own use, when the owner of such property is known to him
or her. Failure by a bailee or lessee of personal property to return the
property within 72 hours after a time specified in a written agreement of lease
or bailment shall be evidence of misappropriation;
   (C)   Obtains the labor or services of another, or a transfer of possession,
control or ownership of the property of another, or the beneficial use of
property of another, by deception. Where compensation for goods and services is
ordinarily paid immediately upon the obtaining of such goods or the rendering
of such services, the refusal to pay or leaving the premises without payment or
offer to pay or without having obtained from the owner or operator the right to
pay subsequent to leaving the premises gives rise to an inference that the
goods or services were obtained by deception;
   (D)   Exercises control over stolen party, knowing such property to have
been stolen, or having reasonable cause to believe that such property has been
stolen, unless the person’s purpose is to promptly restore it to the owner or
to deliver it to an appropriate public officer. The fact that the person is
found in possession of property which has been stolen from two or more persons
on separate occasions, or that the person is a dealer or other person familiar
with the value of such property and has acquired it for a consideration which
is far below its reasonable value, shall be evidence from which the court or
jury may infer that the person knew or believed that the property had been
stolen;
   (E)   Takes, destroys, conceals or disposes of property in which someone
else has a security interest, with intent to defraud the secured party;
   (F)   (1)   Makes, utters, draws, delivers or gives any check, share draft,
draft or written order on any bank, credit union, person or corporation, and
obtains property or service in exchange therefor, if the person knows that such
check, share draft, draft or written order will not be paid when presented;
      (2)   Whenever the drawee of such instrument has refused payment because
of insufficient funds, and the maker has not paid the holder of the instrument
the amount due thereon within ten days of the maker’s receipt of notice from
the holder that payment has been refused by the drawee, the court or jury may
infer from such facts that the maker knew that the instrument would not be paid
on presentation. Notice of refusal of payment shall be by certified mail, or by
personal service in the manner prescribed for serving original notices; and
      (3)   Whenever the drawee of such instrument has refused payment because
the maker has no account with the drawee, the court or jury may infer from such
fact that the maker knew that the instrument would not be paid on presentation.
   (H)   Obtains gas, electricity or water from a public utility or obtains
cable television or telephone service from an unauthorized connection to the
supply or service line or by intentionally altering, adjusting, removing or
tampering with the metering or service device so as to cause inaccurate
readings; and/or
   (H)   Any act that is declared to be theft by any provision of the Iowa
Code.
Statutory reference:
   Related provisions, see Iowa Code § 714.1
§ 7-2-6 ENTERTAINMENT; EVADING ADMISSION FEE.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to willfully enter any building or
enclosure where public entertainment or exhibition is being held, and at which
an admission fee is charged, without paying such fee or without leave from the
proper party to so enter.
(Ord. B-256, passed 3-7-1978)
ASSAULT
§ 7-2-7 ASSAULT.
   (A)   A person commits an assault when, without justification, the person
does any of the following:
      (1)   Any act which is intended to cause pain or injury to, or which is
intended to result in physical contact which will be insulting or offensive to
another, coupled with the apparent ability to execute the act;
      (2)   Any act which is intended to place another in fear of immediate
physical contact which will be painful, injurious, insulting or offensive,
coupled with the apparent ability to execute the act; and/or
      (3)   Intentionally points any firearm toward another, or displays in a
threatening manner any dangerous weapon toward another.
   (B)   Provided that, where the person doing any of the above enumerated
acts, and such other person, are voluntary participants in a sport, social or
other activity, not in itself criminal, and such act is a reasonably
foreseeable incident of such sport or activity, and does not create an
unreasonable risk of serious injury or breach of the peace, the act shall not
be an assault.
Statutory reference:
   Related provisions, see Iowa Code § 708.1
§ 7-2-8 HARASSMENT.
   (A)   A person commits harassment when, with intent to intimidate, annoy or
alarm another person, the person does any of the following:
      (1)   Communicates with another by telephone, telegraph or writing
without legitimate purpose and in a manner likely to cause the other person
annoyance or harm;
      (2)   Places a simulated explosive or simulated incendiary device in or
near a building, vehicle, airplane, railroad engine or railroad car, or boat
occupied by another person;
      (3)   Orders merchandise or services in the name of another, or to be
delivered to another, without the other person’s knowledge or consent; and/or
      (4)   Reports or causes to be reported false information to a law
enforcement authority implicating another in some criminal activity, knowing
that the information is false, or reports the alleged occurrence of a criminal
act, knowing the act did not occur.
   (B)   Any other act of harassment is harassment in the third degree.
Harassment in the third degree is a simple misdemeanor.
(Ord. C-175, passed 10-19-1993)
DAMAGE AND TRESPASS TO PROPERTY
§ 7-2-9 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF.
   Any damage, defacing, alteration or destruction of tangible property is
criminal mischief when done intentionally by one who has no right to so act.
Statutory reference:
   Related provisions, see Iowa Code § 716.1
§ 7-2-10 MULTIPLE ACTS.
   Whenever criminal mischief is committed upon more than one item of property
at approximately the same location or time period, so that all of these acts of
mischief can be attributed to a single scheme, plan or conspiracy, such acts
shall be considered as a single act of criminal mischief.
Statutory reference:
   Related provisions, see Iowa Code § 716.2
§ 7-2-11 CRIMINAL TRESPASS.
   (A)   The term PROPERTY shall include any land, dwelling, building,
conveyance, vehicle or other temporary or permanent structure, whether publicly
or privately owned.

      (1)   Entering upon or in property without the express permission of the

therein anything animate or inanimate, or to hunt, fish or trap on or in the
property. This subsection does not prohibit the unarmed pursuit of game or fur-
bearing animals lawfully injured or killed which come to rest on or escape to
the property of another;
      (2)   Entering or remaining upon or in property without justification
after being notified or requested to abstain from entering or to remove or
vacate therefrom by the owner, lessee or person in lawful possession, or the
agent or employee of the owner, lessee or person in lawful possession, or by
any peace officer, magistrate or public employee whose duty it is to supervise
the use or maintenance of the property;
      (3)   Entering upon or in property for the purpose or with the effect of
unduly interfering with the lawful use of the property by others; and/or
      (4)   Being upon or in property and wrongfully using, removing therefrom,
altering, damaging, harassing or placing thereon or therein anything animate or
inanimate, without the implied or actual permission of the owner, lessee or
person in lawful possession.
   (C)   The term TRESPASS shall not mean entering upon the property of another
for the sole purpose of retrieving personal property which has accidentally or
inadvertently been thrown, fallen, strayed or blown onto the property of
another; provided, that the person retrieving the property takes the most
direct and accessible route to and from the property to be retrieved, quits the

   (B)   Influent limits. The maximum influent limits shall not exceed those
limits as established in the pretreatment program manual at Table 8, page 18,
as adopted by the City Council.
   (C)   Dilution. No industrial user shall ever increase the use of process
water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete
substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge
limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard
or requirement.
   (D)   Special agreement. The city reserves the right to enter into special
agreements with industrial users setting out special terms under which they may
discharge to the POTW. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance
with a pretreatment standard or requirement.
   (E)   City’s right of revision. The city reserves the right to establish, by
ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or
requirements on discharges to the POTW if deemed necessary to comply with the
objectives of this chapter or the general and specific prohibitions in this
chapter. The Superintendent shall have the authority to develop local limits
based on the maximum allowable headworks loadings (MAHL) and the authority to
apply these limits in industrial user discharge permits.
(Ord. C-172, passed 9-7-1993)
§ 8-2-3 PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER.
   (A)   Provision of necessary wastewater treatment. Industrial users shall
provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this chapter
and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local
limits and the prohibitions set out in §
8-2-2 of this chapter within the time limitations specified by the EPA, the
state or the Superintendent, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities
required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be
provided, continuously operated and maintained at the industrial user’s
expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating
procedures shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be approved, in
writing, by the city before construction of the facility. The review and
approval of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the
industrial user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary
to produce an acceptable discharge to the city under the provisions of this
chapter.
   (B)   Restriction of discharge. Whenever deemed necessary, the
Superintendent may require industrial users to restrict their discharge during
peak flow periods, to install and maintain a suitable storage and flow control
facility to ensure equalization of flow, designate that certain wastewater be
discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of
discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams and such
other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the
industrial user’s compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (C)   Interceptors and bar screens. Grease, oil and sand interceptors and
bar screens shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Superintendent, they
are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amount
of grease and oil, sand or screenings; except that, such interceptors shall not
be required for residential users. All interception units shall be of type and
capacity approved by the Superintendent and shall be so located to be easily
accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected,
cleaned and repaired regularly as needed, by the owner at his or her expense.
   (D)   Combustible gas detection meter. Industrial users with the potential
to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an
approved combustible gas detection meter.
   (E)   Slug control plan. The Superintendent may require any industrial user
to develop a slug control plan which outlines discharge practices, describes
stored chemicals and contains procedures both to notify the treatment plant
immediately and to prevent adverse impacts from any accidental or slug
discharges.
   (F)   Hauled wastewater.
      (1)   Septic tank waste may be accepted into the POTW at a designated
receiving structure within the treatment plant area, and at such times as are
established by the Superintendent; provided, such wastes do not violate this
chapter or any other requirements established or adopted by the city. The
Superintendent may issue discharge permits for individual vehicles to use such
facilities and may require the completion of records to establish the origin of
and the constituents in the hauled waste.
      (2)   The discharge of hauled industrial wastes as “industrial septage”
requires prior approval from the city. The Superintendent shall have authority
to prohibit the disposal of such wastes or any other hauled wastes if such
disposal would interfere with the treatment plant operation. Waste haulers are
subject to all other sections of this chapter.
      (3)   Fees for dumping septage or other hauled wastes and fees for
analyzing such wastes may be established by the Superintendent in conjunction
with the sewer rate system provisions in § 8-7-2 of this code of ordinances.
   (G)   Tenant responsibility. Where an owner of property leases premises to
any other person as a tenant under any rental or lease agreement, if either the
owner or the tenant is an industrial user, either or both may be held
responsible for compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (H)   Vandalism. No person shall maliciously, wilfully or negligently break,
damage, destroy, uncover, deface, tamper with or prevent access to any
structure, appurtenance or equipment or other part of the POTW. Any person
found in violation of this requirement shall be subject to the sanctions set
out in this chapter.
   (I)   Pollution control equipment. An industrial user defined as a “new
source” shall install and have in operating condition and shall “start up” all
pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards
before beginning to discharge. Within 90 days, new sources must meet all
applicable pretreatment standards.
(Ord. C-172, passed 9-7-1993)
§ 8-2-4 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT ISSUANCE PROCESS.
   (A)   Wastewater survey. When requested by the Superintendent all industrial
users must submit information on the nature and characteristics of their
wastewater by completing a wastewater survey prior to commencing their
discharge. The Superintendent is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose
and may periodically require industrial users to update the survey. Failure to
complete this survey shall be reasonable grounds for terminating service to the
industrial user and shall be considered a violation of the chapter.
   (B)   Wastewater discharge permit requirements.
      (1)   It shall be unlawful for any significant industrial user to
discharge wastewater into the city’s POTW without first obtaining a wastewater
discharge permit from the Superintendent. Any violation of the terms and
conditions of a wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this
chapter and subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set
out in this chapter. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a
permittee of its obligation to comply with all federal and state pretreatment
standards or requirements or with any other requirements of federal, state and
local law.
      (2)   The Superintendent may require other industrial users, including
liquid waste haulers, to obtain wastewater discharge permits as necessary to

each regulated process;
            2.   Submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the
nature and concentration (and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the
city) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process.
Instantaneous, daily maximum and long-term average concentrations (or mass,
where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily
operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in
division (J) below; and
            3.   Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set
out in division (K) below.
         (f)   Certification. A statement reviewed by the industrial user’s
authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating
whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements;
         (g)   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will
be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which

contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and
completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of
additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable
pretreatment standards (such events include hiring an engineer, completing
preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components,
commencing and completing construction, beginning and conducting routine
operation). No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months. The
industrial user shall submit a progress report to the Superintendent no later
than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of
compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, (and, if appropriate) the
steps being taken by the industrial user to return to the established schedule.
In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to
the Superintendent.
   (C)   Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline.
Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any industrial
user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to
the city a report containing the information described in divisions (A)(2)(d)
through (A)(2)(f) above. For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 C.F.R.
§ 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the industrial
user’s long-term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to
categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant
discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report
shall include the industrial user’s actual production during the appropriate
sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with §
8-2-4(F) of this chapter.
   (D)   Periodic compliance reports.

pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily
flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed
and certified in accordance with §
8-2-4(F) of this chapter.
      (2)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial
user’s discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall
be properly operated, kept clean and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in
good working order shall not be grounds for the industrial user to claim that
sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
      (3)   If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in and
of this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the
POTW, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
   (E)   Report of changed conditions. Each industrial user is required to
notify the Superintendent of any planned significant changes to the industrial
user’s operations or system which might alter the nature, quality or volume of
its wastewater at least 60 days before the change.

information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition,
including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under §
8-2-4(E) of this chapter.
      (2)   The Superintendent may issue a wastewater discharge permit under §
8-2-4(B) of this chapter or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit
under §
8-2-4(K) of this chapter.
      (3)   No industrial user shall implement the planned changed conditions
until and unless the Superintendent has responded to the industrial user’s
notice.
      (4)   For purposes of this requirement flow increases of 10% or greater,
and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants, shall be deemed
significant.
   (F)   Reports of potential problems.
      (1)   In the case of any discharge including, but not limited to
accidental discharges of a non- routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch
discharge or a slug load which may cause potential problems for the POTW
(including a violation of the prohibited discharge standards in §
8-2-2(A) of this chapter), it is the responsibility of the industrial user to
immediately telephone and notify the city of the incident. This notification
shall include the location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and
volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the industrial user.
      (2)   Within five days following such discharge, the industrial user
shall, unless waived by the Superintendent, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall
not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability
which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources or
any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the
industrial user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be
imposed by this chapter.
      (3)   Failure to notify the city of potential problem discharges shall be
deemed a separate violation of this chapter.
      (4)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user’s
bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the
event of a discharge described in division (F)(1) above. Employers shall ensure
that all employees, who may cause or suffer such a discharge to occur are
advised of the emergency notification procedure.
   (G)   Reports from non-significant industrial users. All industrial users
not subject to categorical pretreatment standards and not required to obtain a
wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the city as
the Superintendent may require.
   (H)   Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling
performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the industrial user must
notify the control authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and
submit the results of the repeat analysis to the control authority within 30
days after becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user is not required
to resample if the POTW performs monitoring at the industrial user’s at least
once a month, or if the POTW performs sampling between the industrial user’s
initial sampling and when the industrial user receives the results of this
sampling.
   (I)   Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
      (1)   Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste
shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director and
state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW
of a substance which, if otherwise disposed, of, would be a hazardous waste
under 40 C.F.R. part 261. Such notification must include the name of the
hazardous waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. part 261, the EPA hazardous waste
number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the
industrial user discharges more than ten kilograms of such waste per calendar
month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following
information to the extent such information is known and readily available to
the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained
in the wastes; an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents
in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month; and an estimation of
the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during
the following 12 months. All notification must take place no later than 180
days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this division (I)(1)
above need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However,
notification of changed discharges must be submitted under division (E) above.
The notification requirements in this section does not apply to pollutants
already reported under the self-monitoring requirements in divisions (A), (C)
and (D) above.
      (2)   (a)   Discharges are exempt from the requirements of division (I)
(1) above during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15
kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity
of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e),
requires a one-time notification.
         (b)   Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges
more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional
notification.
      (3)   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA, being 42
U.S.C. § 6921, identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or
listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director and
state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90
days of the effective date of such regulations.
      (4)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the
industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the
volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
   (J)   Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 C.F.R. part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 C.F.R. part 136 does not contain
sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA.
   (K)   Sample collection.
      (1)   Except as indicated in division (K)(2) below, the industrial user
must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection
techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the
Superintendent may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or through a
minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide
a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab
samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
      (2)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
toxicity, sulfides and volatile organic chemicals must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
   (L)   Determination of non-compliance. The Superintendent may use a grab
sample(s) to determine non-compliance with pretreatment standards.
   (M)   Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the
date post-marked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a
mail facility serviced by the U.S. Postal Service, the date of receipt of the
report shall govern.
   (N)   Record keeping. Industrial users shall retain and make available for
inspection and copying, all records and information required to be retained
under this chapter. These records shall remain available for a period of at
least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration
of any litigation concerning compliance with this chapter, or where the
industrial user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by
the Superintendent.
(Ord. C-172, passed 9-7-1993)
§ 8-2-6 COMPLIANCE MONITORING.
   (A)   Inspection and sampling. The city shall have the right to enter the
facilities of any industrial user to ascertain whether the purpose of this
chapter, and any permit or order issued hereunder, is being met and whether the
industrial user is complying with all requirements thereof. Industrial users
shall allow the Superintendent or his or her representatives ready access to
all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
      (1)   Where an industrial user has security measures in force which
require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
industrial user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so
that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city,
state and EPA will be permitted to enter without delay, for the purposes of
performing their specific responsibilities.
      (2)   The city, state and EPA shall have the right to set up on the
industrial user’s property, or require installation of, such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user’s operations.
      (3)   The city may require the industrial user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the
industrial user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow
and quality shall be calibrated periodically to ensure their accuracy.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the industrial facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the industrial user at the written or verbal request of the
Superintendent and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access
shall be born by the industrial user.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing city personnel access to the
industrial user’s premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
   (B)   Search warrants. If the Superintendent has been refused access to a
building, structure or property or any part thereof, and if the Superintendent
has demonstrated probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of
this chapter or that there is a need to inspect as part of a routine inspection
program of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any
permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety and welfare of the community, then upon application by the City
Attorney, the Magistrate Judge can issue a search and/or seizure warrant
describing therein the specific location subject to the warrant. The warrant
shall specify what, if anything, may be searched and/or seized on the property
described. Such warrant shall be served at reasonable hours by the
Superintendent in the company of a uniformed police officer of the city. In the
event of an emergency affecting public health and safety, inspections shall be
made without the issuance of a warrant.
(Ord. C-172, passed 9-7-1993)
§ 8-2-7 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on an industrial user obtained from reports, surveys,
wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits and
monitoring programs, and from city inspection and sampling activities, shall be
available to the public without restriction, unless the industrial user
specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
city, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes
or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under
applicable state law. When requested and demonstrated by the industrial user
furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the
portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes
shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made
available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to
the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics and other “effluent data” as defined by 40 C.F.R. § 2.302 will
not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the
public without restriction.
(Ord. C-172, passed 9-7-1993)
§ 8-2-8 PUBLICATION OF INDUSTRIAL USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NON- COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   The city shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper
published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the
industrial users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant non-
compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
   (B)   The term SIGNIFICANT NON- COMPLIANCE shall mean:
      (1)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month
period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant
parameter by any amount;
      (2)   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those
in which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant
parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily
maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4
for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants, except
pH);
      (3)   Any other discharge that the city believes has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including
endangering the health of city personnel or the general public);
      (4)   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment
to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the city’s exercise of
its emergency authority to halt or prevent such discharge;
      (5)   Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement
order for starting construction, completing construction or attaining final
compliance;
      (6)   Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports,
periodic self-monitoring reports and reports on compliance with compliance
schedules;
      (7)   Failure to accurately report non- compliance; and
      (8)   Any other violation(s) which the city determines will adversely
affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
(Ord. C-172, passed 9-7-1993)
§ 8-2-9 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Notification of violation. Whenever the Superintendent finds that any
user has violated or is violating this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit
or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the
Superintendent or his or her agent may serve upon said user a written notice of
violation. Within seven days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of
the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention
thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user
to the Superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city to
take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action,
without first issuing a notice of violation.
   (B)   Consent orders. The Superintendent is hereby empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with any user responsible for non-compliance. Such
orders will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the non-
compliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders
shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued
pursuant division (D) below and shall be judicially enforceable.
   (C)   Show cause hearing. The Superintendent may order any user which causes
or contributes to violation(s) of this chapter, wastewater discharge permits or
orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to
appear before the Superintendent and show cause why a proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the
time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons
for such actions and a request that the user show cause why this proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be
served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested)
at least seven days prior to the hearing. Such notice may served on any
authorized representative of the user. Whether or not the user appears as
ordered, immediate enforcement action may be pursued following the hearing
date. A show cause hearing shall not be prerequisite for taking any other
action against the user.
   (D)   Compliance orders. When the Superintendent finds that a user has
violated or continues to violate the ordinance, wastewater discharge permits or
orders issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard of requirement, he
or she may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing
that the user come into compliance within a period of time specified in the
order. If the user does not come into compliance within the specified period of
time, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities,
devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated.
Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the non-
compliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A
compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
federal pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order
release the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing
violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a prerequisite to taking
any other action against the user.
   (E)   Cease and desist orders.
      (1)   When the Superintendent finds that a user is violating this
chapter, the user’s wastewater discharge permit, any order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user’s past
violations are likely to recur, the Superintendent may issue an order to the
user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the
user to:
         (a)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
         (b)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
      (2)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a prerequisite to
taking any other action against the user.
   (F)   Emergency suspensions.
      (1)   The Superintendent may immediately suspend a user’s discharge
(after informal notice to the user) whenever such suspension is necessary in
order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to
present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons. The Superintendent may also immediately suspend a user’s
discharge (after notice and opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere
with the operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present an
endangerment to the environment.
         (a)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Superintendent shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream or endangerment to any individuals. The Superintendent
shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated
to the satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed,
unless the termination proceedings set forth in division (G) below are
initiated against the user.
         (b)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence to the Superintendent, prior to the date
of any show cause or termination hearing under division (C) above and division
(G) below.
      (2)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
   (G)   Termination of discharge.
      (1)   In addition to those provisions in §
8-2-4(M) of this chapter, any user that violates the following conditions of
this chapter, wastewater discharge permits or orders issued hereunder, is
subject to discharge termination:
         (a)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
         (b)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
         (c)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
         (d)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling;
         (e)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §
8-2-2 of this chapter; and
         (f)   Failure to pay sewer use charges as specified in § 8-7-2 of this
code of ordinances, or any other fee that may be assessed by matters covered by
this chapter.
      (2)   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under division (C) above
why the proposed action should not be taken.
(Ord. C-172, passed 9-7-1993)
§ 8-2-10 JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (A)   Injunctive relief. Whenever a user has violated a pretreatment
standard or requirement or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter,
wastewater discharge permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment requirement, the Superintendent may petition the Lee County
District Court at Fort Madison through the City’s Attorney for the issuance of
a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels
the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other
requirements imposed by this chapter on activities of the industrial user. Such
other action as appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief may also be
sought by the city. A petition for injunctive relief need not be filed as a
prerequisite to taking any other action against a user.
   (B)   Civil penalties.
      (1)   Any user which has violated or continues to violate this chapter,
any order or wastewater discharge permit hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement shall be liable to the Superintendent for a maximum
civil penalty of $1,000 per violation per day. In the case of a monthly or
other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day
during the period of the violation.
      (2)   The Superintendent may recover reasonable attorney fees, court
costs and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses and the cost of any actual damages incurred by
the city.
      (3)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any
economic benefit gained through the user’s violation, corrective action by the
user, the compliance history of the user and any other factor as justice
requires.
      (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a prerequisite for
taking any other action against a user.
   (C)   Criminal prosecution.
      (1)   Any user that wilfully or negligently violates any provision of
this chapter, any orders or wastewater discharge permits issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
simple misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $200 per violation
per day or imprisonment for not more than 30 days.
      (2)   Any user that wilfully or negligently introduces any substance into
the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a simple misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of
not more than $200 or be subject to imprisonment for not more than 30 days.
This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal
injury or property damage available under state law.
      (3)   Any user that knowingly makes any false statements, representations
or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other
documentation filed or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter,
wastewater discharge permit or order or who falsifies, tampers with or
knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under
this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punishable by a fine of not more than
$200 per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than 30 days.
   (D)   Simple misdemeanor. Any violation of this chapter, wastewater
discharge permits or orders issued hereunder, is a simple misdemeanor. Each day
that a violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.
   (E)   Municipal infraction.
      (1)   Any violation of this chapter arising from non-compliance with a
pretreatment standard or requirement, referred to in 40 C.F.R. § 403.8 by an
industrial user is a municipal infraction and punishable by a civil penalty of
not more than $1,000 for each day a violation exists or continues.
      (2)   The city may classify a municipal infraction, other than a
violation arising from non- compliance with a pretreatment standard or
requirement, as an environmental violation if the infraction is a violation of
Iowa Code Chapter 455B or a violation of a standard established by the city in
consultation with the Department of Natural Resources, or both. A municipal
infraction which is classified an environmental violation is punishable by a
civil penalty of not more than $1,000 for each occurrence. A person committing
an environmental violation is not subject to a civil penalty, if all of the
following conditions are satisfied:
         (a)   The violation results solely from the person conducting an
initial start-up, cleaning, repairing, performing scheduled maintenance,
testing or conducting a shutdown, of either equipment causing the violation or
the equipment designed to reduce or eliminate the violation;
         (b)   The person notifies the city of the violation within 24 hours
from the time that the violation begins; and
         (c)   The violation does not continue in existence for more than eight
hours.
      (3)   The city shall not enforce this section against a person committing
an environmental violation, until the city offers to participate in informal
negotiations with the person. If the person accepts the offer, the city and the
person shall participate in good faith negotiations to resolve issues alleged
to be the basis for the violation.
   (F)   Remedies non-exclusive. The provisions in §§
8-2-9 through
8-2-11 of this chapter are not exclusive remedies. The city reserves the right
to take any, all or any combination of these actions against a non-compliant
user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance
with the city’s enforcement response plan. However, the city reserves the right
to take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further,
the city is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any non-
compliant user. These actions may be taken concurrently.
(Ord. C-172, passed 9-7-1993; Ord. C-322, passed 4-4-2000)
§ 8-2-11 SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION.
   (A)   Liability insurance. The Superintendent may decline to reissue a
wastewater discharge permit to any user which has filed to comply with the
provisions of this chapter, any order or a previous wastewater discharge permit
issued hereunder, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained
financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused
by its discharge.
   (B)   Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to
violate the provisions of this chapter, orders or wastewater discharge permits
issued hereunder, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only
recommence, at the user’s expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its
ability to comply.
   (C)   Public nuisances. Any violation of this chapter, wastewater discharge
permits or orders issued hereunder, is hereby declared a public nuisance and
shall be corrected or abated as directed by the Superintendent or his or her
designee. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the
provisions of the city code.
(Ord. C-172, passed 9-7-1993)
§ 8-2-12 PRETREATMENT CHARGES AND FEES.
   The city may adopt reasonable charges and fees for reimbursement of costs of
setting up and operating the city’s pretreatment program which may include:
   (A)   Fees for wastewater discharge permit application including the cost of
processing such applications;
   (B)   Fees for monitoring, inspection and surveillance procedures including
the cost of collection and analyzing an industrial user’s discharge and
reviewing monitoring reports submitted by industrial users;
   (C)   Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures
and construction;
   (D)   Fees for filing appeals; and
   (E)   Other fees as the city may deem necessary to carry out the
requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters covered
by this chapter and are separate from all other fees, fines and penalties
chargeable by the city.

      (2)   Effective July 1 of each year, beginning in 2021, the customer base
service charges and volume charges as set forth in this section shall be
increased 2% from the prior year, except as amended by ordinance of the City
Council. The city shall review said charges and rates every two years to ensure
that the system generates adequate revenues to pay the full costs of operation,
maintenance and any debt service and to maintain adequate fund balances.
      (3)   Past due bills will be subject to a 10% late fee.
      (4)   The portion of this rate system applicable to monitored
contributors is applicable where wastewater volume is continuously measured and
wastewater strength is determined on the basis of regular sampling and
analysis. Monitored contributors will be billed for a minimum volume of 30,000
gallons per month. If the analysis for BOD produces unreliable or erroneous
results, as determined by the Superintendent, due to inhibition or interference
of the waste sample, the monitored contributor may be billed on the basis of
chemical oxygen demand (COD) in lieu of BOD.
      (5)   The charges for total nitrogen and total phosphorus will be
developed by the Wastewater Superintendent and implemented by 7-1-2023 so as to
meet the nutrient requirements in the current POTW NPDES permit as amended by
ordinance of the City Council.
      (6)   The city has adopted reasonable charges and fees for reimbursement
of costs of setting up and operating the city’s billing program, monitoring,
inspection and surveillance procedures and all laboratory testing required
which include:
         (a)   Fees for wastewater laboratory testing at the city’s Water
Pollution Control Plant are updated annually by the Wastewater Superintendent
effective July 1 of each year, beginning in 2022;
         (b)   Fees for monitoring, inspection and surveillance procedures
including the cost of collection and analyzing an industrial user’s discharge
and reviewing monitoring reports submitted by industrial users. Fees for
monitoring, inspection and surveillance procedures at the city’s Water
Pollution Control Plant are updated annually by the Wastewater Superintendent
effective July 1 of each year, beginning in 2022;
         (c)   Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge
procedures and construction;
         (d)   Fees for filing appeals; and
         (e)   Other fees as the city may deem necessary to carry out the
requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters covered
by this chapter and are separate from all other fees, fines and penalties
chargeable by the city.
      (7)   Haulers of septic tank wastes and industrial or other wastes that
are hauled to the wastewater treatment plant for discharge and treatment are
subject to all provisions of this chapter. Contributors not falling within the
rate system provided herein shall be subject to charges and requirements, as
determined by the Superintendent.
   (B)   Base rate. Each individual residential and commercial unit being
supplied city sewer, including each individual home within a mobile home park,
shall be assessed, on a monthly basis, a base rate for sewer rental, whether
separately metered for water or not. For example, each occupied unit of a four-
plex being serviced with city sewer shall be assessed for a base rate each
month. The usage rate, however, shall be assessed per meter, not per unit
served. Units within a complex, whether residential, commercial or mobile home
park that has a master meter and then each unit is separately metered for water
usage shall be separately billed for both base and usage rates and the amount
of water used by those units within the complex shall be subtracted from the
amount of water shown as being used by the master meter for the complex for
purposes of billing usage to the owner of the complex.
   (C)   Minimum sewerage charge. The minimum charge for service shall be
assessed for each month or fraction thereof. This minimum sewerage service
charge shall apply to any contributor connected to the sewage works. Any
contributor which is not connected to a public sewer but should be under the
requirements of any chapter shall pay this minimum sewerage charge.
   (D)   Classification system, non-monitored contributors.
      (1)   The following classification system for non-monitored contributors
is adopted to recognize wastewater strengths greater than domestic wastewater.
Wastewater strength less than domestic wastewater concentrations shall be
recognized as domestic wastewater. The classification system establishes
standard strength units which combine the three strength parameters, BOD or
COD, suspended solids and NH3-N into a single, common measurement. The number
of strength units assigned are based on the ratio of sewage works unit cost for
each parameter. Presently, the ratio of sewage works unit cost associated with
BOD to suspended solids to NH3-N is 1.35:1:1 and COD to suspended solids to
NH3-N is 0.64:1:1. Therefore, standard strength units are:
         (BOD mg/l x 1.35) + (suspended solids mg/l) + (NH3-N mg/l)
         or
         (COD mg/l x 0.64) + (suspended solids mg/l) + (NH3-N mg/l)
      (2)   The classification system defines the relative sewage works costs
associated with the wastewater strength for each class. The sewage charges
shall be calculated from metered water use times the sewage rate stated in
division (A) above, times the factor presented in the following table:
 7/2022 7/2023 7/2024
 (2%)   (2%)   (2%)
                                                           7/2022 7/2023 7/2024
                                                           (2%)   (2%)   (2%)

      (3)   The customer charge, referred to in division (A) above, is
applicable to all of the above classes, regardless of wastewater strength.
   (E)   Customer class.
      (1)   The Wastewater Superintendent shall be responsible for assigning
each contributor to a customer class. Any customer may appeal the assignment to
a customer class by presenting wastewater sampling data and/or other pertinent
data relative to the customer operation and wastewater characteristics. The
wastewater sampling shall be 24-hour composite samples unless otherwise
directed by the city. The samples shall be obtained with facilities constructed
for metering and recording wastewater flow and for proportional sampling and
preservation of samples. Samples may be split for analysis and preservation by
both the customer and the city. Sample analysis shall be in conformance with
federal guidelines establishing test procedures as set forth in the “Federal
Register”, volume 40, part 136, as amended. The Wastewater Superintendent will
review the submitted data to determine the reasonableness of the customer’s

disagreements, the city and the customer shall submit the matter to a qualified
third party arbitrator, said arbitrator to be selected by mutual agreement of
the parties. In the event the arbitrator determines that the customer is
entitled to a change of classification from that determined by the city the
cost for the arbitrator’s services shall be borne equally by the parties, but
if no change of classification is made the cost shall be paid by the customer.

§ 8-7-3 GENERAL.
   (A)   The monthly sewage charges, as specified in §
8-7-2 of this chapter, shall be 200% of the base and usage rates listed above.
      (1)   If: a) a property owner’s property is located outside of the city’s
corporate limits, and b) the owner’s property line does not abut the city’s
corporate line, and c) the property owner agrees to petition for voluntary
annexation to the city at any time in the future when the city’s corporate line
abuts the property owner’s property line; then, in exchange for the property
owner’s written signed agreement to annex to the city in the future, the city
may allow the property owner to connect to the city’s sewage system.
      (2)   If: a) a property owner’s property is located outside of the city’s
corporate limits, and b) the owner’s property line abuts the corporate limits
of the city, and, if the property owner wishes to receive city sewer service;
then, in exchange for the property owner’s immediate voluntary annexation to
the city; and, upon completion of annexation process, city may permit the
customer to connect to city’s sewer system.
   (B)   Where, in the opinion of the City Council a contributor assumes a
substantial portion of the sewage works capacity, a contract may be required
between the city and the major user. Such a contract will indicate portions of
this Sewerage Rate System Ordinance which are applicable, establish a maximum
contribution for each waste characteristic (i.e., volume, BOD, suspended solids
and the like), provide for penalties when the maximum is exceeded, and indicate
the means of measuring and sampling the wastewater.
   (C)   (1)   Sampling and analytical laboratory charges may be assessed to
all users that the city is required to sample as part of a state and/or federal
permit or program or that the city monitors for billing purposes.
      (2)   Contracted private laboratory fees will be charged on a direct cost
basis to those users whose waste requires that the city use a private
laboratory for the analytical work.
   (D)   Where a contributor may arrange his or her waste piping system to
provide for discharge of sanitary wastes to the sanitary sewer and clear
uncontaminated water discharged separately to a storm sewer drainageway, the
contributor will be billed for the volume of sanitary sewage only, provided he
or she installs water or sewage meters in the separate systems for determining
waste volumes at his or her own expense. Water meters used may be those
furnished on a rental basis by the waterworks. Privately-owned water or sewage
meters shall be subject to the approval of the waterworks and shall be subject
to inspection and checking by the waterworks to determine accuracy.
   (E)   The sewerage charges may be billed the tenant or tenants occupying the
properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the owners, but
such billing shall in no way relieve the owner from liability in the event
payment is not made as herein required.
   (F)   (1)   The City Council hereby delegates the billing of sewerage
charges, except those established under special contract, and the authority to
accept payment of same to the waterworks in accordance with the foregoing
schedule of charges. Said schedule of charges shall be certified to the
waterworks by such official of the city as shall be designated by the City
Council.
      (2)   As part of the duties delegated to the waterworks, an accurate and
complete record of such collections will be maintained and at least once each
month all funds so collected shall be deposited in a bank or banks specified by
the City Treasurer. This fund shall only be used for the purpose of retiring
debt, operating and maintaining the sewage works. At the end of each month the
City Treasurer shall report to the City Council a statement of collections and
deposits for said month.
      (3)   The City Council authorizes that the waterworks shall charge to the
city for its services such amount as may from time to time be mutually agreed
upon, same to be paid by the city on a monthly basis.
   (G)   (1)   For non-monitored contributors, the sewerage charges as provided
in §
8-7-2 of this chapter, shall be applied to the quantity of water as determined
by monthly water meter readings of the waterworks, unless the sanitary sewage
is measured as provided for in division (D) above. In the case of a monitored
contributor, the quantity of wastewater volume and strength of pollutant load
shall be determined from wastewater flow metering station equipped with a
sampling device to collect and preserve composite wastewater samples.
      (2)   When a parcel of real estate, property, building or premises
discharging sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other approved waste,
either directly or indirectly into the city sanitary sewer system and the water
used thereon or therein is not measured by a water meter, uses water supplied
by the city’s water system, and in addition uses water from another source
which is not measured by a water meter, or is not a user of water supplied by
the city water system, the city shall require such water use to be metered in
order to establish the proper sewerage charge, except single-family residential
contributors with estimated water use of 5,000 gallons, or less, per month. For
such residential contributors, the amount of water used shall be determined by
mutual agreement between the user and the city, or failing to agree, by the
city in such manner as the superintendent may elect in order to establish the
rate of charge as provided in this chapter, or the owner or owners or other
interested party may have a water meter installed by the waterworks on a rental
basis so that the water used on the premises is metered. If a privately owned
meter is used the meter shall be subject to the approval of the waterworks and
shall be subject to inspection and checking by the waterworks to determine
accuracy. If it is necessary to rearrange the plumbing in order to install a
meter, the rearranging shall be at the expense of the owner or other interested
parties and the installation shall be made in a manner meeting the approval of
the waterworks and the Wastewater Superintendent.
   (H)   The Wastewater Superintendent and other authorized representatives of
the waterworks or sewage works shall be entitled to access to the premises of
any contributor for the purpose of reading meters, inspection, observation,
measurement, sampling and testing at any reasonable time to such extent as may
be necessary to carry out the spirit and intent of this chapter. If such access
is denied, the contributor will be assigned and billed as a Class 10 customer
in accordance with §
8-7-2(D) of this chapter.
   (I)   Billings.
      (1)   Due date. All billings under the sewage charges herein established
shall be due and payable at the utility billing office according to the billing
schedule established by the Water Department.
      (2)   Final bills.
         (a)   If an account is not paid by the date due, it shall be
considered delinquent. The city shall have all rights to proceed with
collection of the unpaid charges in any way provided by law for the collection
of a municipal claim.
         (b)   The City Clerk may proceed with collection measures of
delinquent bills, including certification of the bill to the County Treasurer.
Notice shall be sent to the appropriate persons by ordinary mail not less than
30 days prior to certification of the lien to the County Treasurer. If the
customer is a tenant and if the owner or landlord of the property has made a
written request for notice, the notice shall also be given to the owner or
landlord. All associated cost will be attached to the bill for this service.
         (c)   All delinquent bills certified to the County Treasurer or that
the city institutes collection measures upon will include a service charge of
15% of the total bill, but not less than $1. All associated costs will be
attached to the bill for this service.
      (3)   Delinquent bills, owner exempt from property tax. If the owner of a
property, where a delinquent bill has been incurred, is exempt from paying
taxes (i.e., state government, religious organizations or any other
organization or entity that is not required to pay property tax), then
collection of the delinquent bill may proceed as follows:
         (a)   Bills not paid within the time allotted by the billing schedule
shall be delinquent.
         (b)   If a bill is delinquent, the city may collect the delinquent
amount by pursuing any available legal remedy including, but not limited to:
            1.   Terminating the discharge (including severance of the sewer
connection to the property);
            2.   Collection through a collection agency; and
            3.   Collection through the court system.

§ 8-7-5 METERING STATIONS, CALIBRATION REPORTS AND INOPERABLE METERS.
   (A)   When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property
serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a
suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and
measurement of the waste. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the City Engineer. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his or her
expense, and shall be maintained by him or her so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
   (B)   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial waste when required by the Superintendent shall maintain metering
and sampling equipment in continuous, effective operation at the owner’s
expense. Said owner shall have the metering equipment calibrated by a qualified
individual at least once every six months and the Wastewater Superintendent
shall be provided with a copy of the calibration report.
   (C)   If the required metering equipment is inoperable for two consecutive
billing periods (months), then the owner’s sewage bill shall be increased by
taking the average month’s flowage rate for the last six operable months and
increasing that average by 20%. The owner shall then be billed for the average
flowage rate plus 20% for all subsequent months until the metering equipment is
operating properly, has been calibrated by a qualified individual and a copy of
the calibration report has been provided the Wastewater Superintendent.

exceed eight feet; except that, a motor home or bus having a total outside
width not exceeding eight feet six inches, exclusive of safety equipment, is
exempt from the permit requirements of Iowa Code Chapter 321E and may be
operated on the public highways of the state. However, if hay, straw or stover
moved on any implement of husbandry and the total width of load of the
implement of husbandry exceeds eight feet in width, the implement of husbandry
is not subject to the permit requirements of Iowa Code Chapter 321E. If hay,
straw or stover is moved on any other vehicle subject to registration, the
moves are subject to the permit requirements for transporting loads exceeding
eight feet in width as required under said Iowa Code Chapter 321E. The vehicle
width limitations imposed by this division (A) only apply to the public
highways of the state not subject to the width limitations imposed under
division (B) below.
   (B)   The total outside width of any vehicle and load shall not exceed eight
feet six inches, exclusive of safety equipment determined necessary for safe
and efficient operation by the Secretary of the United States Department of
Transportation, on highways designated by the Transportation Commission. The

this division (B) are exempt from Iowa Code Chapter 17A.
Statutory reference:
   Related provisions, see Iowa Code § 321.454
§ 9-11-2 HEIGHT OF VEHICLES; PERMITS.
   A vehicle laden or with load shall not exceed a height of 13 feet six
inches, except by permit as provided in this section. This section shall not be
construed to require any railroad or public authorities to provide sufficient
vertical clearance to permit the operation of such vehicle upon the highways of
this state. Any damage to highways, highway or railroad structures or under
passes caused by the height of any vehicle provided for by this section shall
be borne by the operator or owner of the vehicle. Vehicles unladen or with load
exceeding a height of 13 feet six inches, but not exceeding 14 feet may be
operated with a permit issued by the state or jurisdictional local authorities.
The permits shall be issued annually, with fees set by resolution of the City
Council, and subject to rules adopted by the state. The state or a political
subdivision shall not be liable for damage to any vehicle or its cargo if
changes in vertical clearance of a structure are made subsequent to the
issuance of a permit during the term of the permit.
(Ord. D-045, passed 10-3-2017)
Statutory reference:
   Related provisions, see Iowa Code § 321.456
§ 9-11-3 MAXIMUM LENGTH.
   (A)   A combination of four vehicles is not allowed on the highways of this
state, except for power units saddle mounted on other power units which shall
be restricted to a maximum overall length of 65 feet.
   (B)   The maximum length of any motor vehicle or combination of vehicles
operated on the highways of this state, unless subject to the maximum length
provisions of division (C) below, are as follows.
      (1)   A single truck, unladen or with load, shall not have an overall
length, inclusive of front and rear bumpers, in excess of 40 feet.
      (2)   A single bus, unladen or with load, shall not have an overall
length, inclusive of front and rear bumpers, in excess of 40 feet; except that,
buses constructed so as to contain a flexible part allowing articulation shall
not exceed 61 feet.
      (3)   Except for combinations of vehicles, provisions for which are
otherwise made in Iowa Code Chapter 321, no combination of a truck tractor and
a semi-trailer coupled together or a motor truck and a trailer or semi-trailer
coupled together unladen or with load, shall have an overall length, inclusive
of front and rear bumpers, in excess of 60 feet.
      (4)   However, a mobile home not in excess of 48 feet in length may be
drawn by any motor vehicle, except a motor truck; provided that, the mobile
home and its towing unit are not in excess of an overall length of 60 feet. For
the purposes of this division (B)(4), a light delivery truck, panel delivery
truck or “pickup” is not a motor truck. A portable livestock loading chute not
in excess of a length of 13 feet including its hitch or tongue may be drawn by
any vehicle or combination of vehicles; provided that, the vehicle or
combination of vehicles drawing the loading chute is not in excess of the legal
length provided for such vehicles or combinations.
      (5)   Combinations of vehicles coupled together which are used
exclusively for the transportation of passenger vehicles, light delivery
trucks, panel delivery trucks, pickup trucks, recreational vehicle chassis, and
boats shall not exceed 65 feet in overall length. However, the load carried on
a truck semi-trailer combination may extend up to three feet beyond the front
bumper and up to four feet beyond the rear bumper.
      (6)   A combination of three vehicles coupled together, one of which is a
motor vehicle, unladen or with load, shall not have an overall length,
inclusive of front and rear bumpers, in excess of 60 feet.
      (7)   A motor vehicle or combination of vehicles may be operated upon the
highways of this state, irrespective of the length and weight limitations
imposed by the laws of this state, if the motor vehicle or combination of
vehicles is operated within the corporate limits of a city abutting a border of
this state and such operations have been approved by ordinance of the City
Council and if the length and weight of the motor vehicle or combination of
vehicles is in conformity with the laws relating to length and weight of the
abutting state on 7-1-1974. If a City Council has authorized such operation
upon highways within the corporate limits, then the limit of travel for such
motor vehicles or combination of vehicles within the state is extended to the
commercial zones as described by federal regulations concerning interstate
commerce, 49 C.F.R. §§ 1048.10, 1048.38 and 1048.101, as they exist on 7-1-
1974.
      (8)   A semi-trailer shall not have a distance between the kingpin and
the center of its rearmost axle in excess of 40 feet, except a semi-trailer
used principally for hauling livestock, a semi-trailer used exclusively for
hauling self-propelled industrial and construction equipment, or a semi-trailer
used exclusively for the purposes described in division (B)(5) above. A semi-
trailer which is a 1980 or older model having a distance between the kingpin
and center of the rearmost axle of more than 40 feet may be operated on the
highways of this state if a special overlength permit is obtained from the
department for the vehicle. The special overlength permit shall be valid until
the semi-trailer is inoperable.
   (C)   The maximum length of any motor vehicle or combination of vehicles
operated on the highways of this state which are designated by the
Transportation Commission shall be as follows.
      (1)   A trailer or semi-trailer, laden or unladen, shall not have an
overall length in excess of 53 feet when operating in a truck tractor-semi-
trailer combination.
      (2)   A trailer or semi-trailer, laden or unladen, shall not have an
overall length in excess of 28 feet six inches when operating in a truck
tractor- semi-trailer-trailer combination or truck tractor-semi- trailer-semi-
trailer combination. When the semi- trailers in a truck tractor-semi-trailer-
semi-trailer combination are connected by a rigid frame extension including a
fifth-wheel connection point attached to the rear frame of the first semi-
trailer, the length of the frame extension shall not be included when
determining the overall length of the first semi-trailer.
      (3)   Power units designed to carry cargo, when used in combination with
a trailer or semi-trailer shall not exceed 65 feet in overall length for the
combination.
      (4)   In a combination of vehicles used principally for hauling livestock
or a stinger-steered automobile transporter operating under this division (C)
(4) and § 9-11-1(B) of this chapter, the combination of vehicles used
principally for hauling livestock or the stinger-steered automobile transporter
may depart from the designated highway system by the most direct route to
points of pickup and delivery. Vehicles operating under this division (C)(4)
are not exempt from posted size and weight restrictions on highway structures.
      (5)   A stinger-steered automobile transporter shall not have an overall
length exceeding 75 feet; except that, the load may extend up to three feet
beyond the front bumper and up to four feet beyond the rear bumper.
   (D)   Firefighting apparatus and vehicles operated during daylight hours
when transporting poles, pipes, machinery or other objects of a structural
nature which cannot be readily disassembled when required for emergency repair
of public service facilities or properties are not subject to the limitations
on overall length of vehicles and combinations of vehicles imposed under this
section. However, for operation during nighttime hours, these vehicles and the
load being transported shall be equipped with a sufficient number of clearance
lamps on both sides and marker lamps at the extreme ends of the projecting load
to clearly mark the dimensions of the load. A member of the state highway
safety patrol shall also be notified prior to the operation of the vehicle.
   (E)   The state may adopt rules to designate highways, in addition to those
designated under division (C) above, to which the overall length limitations
imposed under division (C) above for vehicles and combinations of vehicles
shall be applicable. However, rules adopted under this subsection are subject
to Iowa Code Chapter 17A.

   Related provisions, see Iowa Code § 321.457
§ 9-11-4 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   Except for offenses punishable under the provisions of §
9-11-8 of this chapter, it is a misdemeanor for any person to drive or move or
for the owner to cause or knowingly permit to be driven or moved on any highway
any vehicle or vehicles of a size or weight exceeding the limitations stated in
this chapter, and the maximum size and weight of vehicles herein specified
shall be lawful throughout this state, and local authorities shall have no
power or authority to alter said limitations except as express authority may be
granted in Iowa Code Chapter 321.

§ 9-11-7 SPILLING LOADS ON HIGHWAYS.
   A vehicle shall not be driven or moved on any highway by any person unless
such vehicle is so constructed or loaded or the load securely covered as to
prevent any of its load from dropping, sifting, leaking or otherwise escaping
or its load covering from dropping from the vehicle, except that sand may be
dropped for the purpose of securing traction, or water or other substance may
be sprinkled on a roadway in cleaning or maintaining such roadway. The
provisions of this section shall not apply to vehicles loaded with hay or
stover.
Statutory reference:
   Related provisions, see Iowa Code § 321.460
§ 9-11-8 MAXIMUM GROSS WEIGHT.
   (A)   An axle may be divided into two or more parts; except that, all parts
in the same vertical transverse plane shall be considered as one axle.
   (B)   The gross weight on any one axle of a vehicle, or of a combination of
vehicles, operated on the highways of this state, shall not exceed 20,000
pounds on an axle equipped with pneumatic tires, and shall not exceed 14,000
pounds on an axle equipped with solid rubber tires. The gross weight on any
tandem axle of a vehicle, or any combination of vehicles, shall not exceed
34,000 pounds on an axle equipped with pneumatic tires.
   (C)   A group of two or more consecutive axles of any vehicle or combination
of vehicles, shall not carry a load in pounds in excess of the overall gross
weight determined by application of the following formula:
      W equals 500 (LN/N-1 + 12N +36).
      “W” equals the overall gross weight on any group of two or more
consecutive axles to the nearest 500 pounds, “L” equals the distance in feet,
rounded to the nearest whole foot, between the extreme of any group of two or
more consecutive axles, and “N” equals the number of axles in the group under
consideration. The following are exceptions to applications of the formula.
      (1)   Two consecutive sets of tandem axles may carry a gross load of
34,000 pounds each providing the overall distance between the first and last
axles of the consecutive sets of tandem axles is 36 feet or more.
      (2)   On highways not part of the inter-state system, a vehicle or
combination of vehicles having:
         (a)   Four axles where the extreme axles are 18 feet apart may carry a
gross load of 53,000 pounds;
         (b)   Five axles where the extreme axles are 32 feet apart may carry a
gross load of 67,500 pounds; and
         (c)   Six or more axles where the extreme axles are 41 feet apart may
carry a gross load of 78,000 pounds.
   (D)   For every foot of distance between extreme axles less than the above
axle spacings, the overall gross weight of the vehicle or combination of
vehicles shall be determined by deducting 1,000 pounds from the gross loads
specified in divisions (C)(2)(a), (C)(2)(b) and (C)(2)(c) above. All
measurements between extreme axles shall be rounded to the nearest whole foot.
   (E)   The maximum gross weight shall not exceed 80,000 pounds.
   (F)   The weight on any one axle, including a tandem axle, of a vehicle
which is transporting livestock on highways not part of the interstate system
may exceed the legal maximum weight given in this chapter providing that the
gross weight on any particular group of axles on such vehicle does not exceed
the gross weight allowable under this chapter for such groups of axles.
   (G)   In addition, the weight on any one axle, including a tandem axle, of a
vehicle which is transporting raw materials which are removed from a road under
construction, may exceed the legal maximum weight otherwise allowed under this
chapter by 10% if the gross weight on any particular group of axles on the
vehicle does not exceed the gross weight allowed under this chapter for that
group of axles. However, if the vehicle exceeds the 10% tolerance allowed for
any one axle or tandem axle under this division (G) the fine to be assessed for
the axle or tandem axle shall be computed on the difference between the actual
weight and the 10% tolerance weight allowed for the axle or tandem axle under
this division (G). This division (G) applies only to vehicles operating along a
route of travel approved by the state.
   (H)   A person who operates a vehicle in violation of the provisions of this
section, and an owner, or any other person, employing or otherwise directing
the operator of a vehicle, who requires or knowingly permits the operation of a
vehicle in violation of the provisions of this section shall be fined according
to the following schedule:
Axle, Tandem Axle and Group of Axles Weight Violations
Pounds Overloaded Amount of Fine
Axle, Tandem Axle and Group of Axles Weight Violations
Pounds Overloaded                               Amount of Fine
Up to and including 1,000 pounds                $10, plus $0.005 per pound
Over 1,000 pounds to and including 2,000 pounds $15, plus $0.005 per pound
Over 2,000 pounds to and including 3,000 pounds $80, plus $0.03 per pound
Over 3,000 pounds to and including 4,000 pounds $100, plus $0.04 per pound
Over 4,000 pounds to and including 5,000 pounds $150, plus $0.05 per pound
Over 5,000 pounds to and including 6,000 pounds $200, plus $0.07 per pound
Over 6,000 pounds                               $200, plus $0.10 per pound
 
   (I)   Fines for gross weight violations for vehicles or combinations of
vehicles shall be assessed at one-half of the fine rate schedule for axle,
tandem axle and groups of axles weight violations.
   (J)   Except as otherwise provided, the amount of the fine to be assessed
shall be computed on the difference between the actual weight and the maximum
legal weight specified in this section by applying the appropriate rate in the
preceding schedule for the total amount of overload.
   (K)   The schedule of fines may be assessed in addition to any other
penalties provided for in this chapter.
   (L)   Overloads on axles and tandem axles and overloads on groups of axles
or on an entire vehicle or combination of vehicles shall be considered as
separate violations of the provisions of this section.
   (M)   A person who issues or executes, or causes to be issued or executed, a
bill of lading, manifest or shipping document of any kind which states a false
weight of the cargo set forth on such bill, manifest or document, which is less
than the actual weight of the cargo, shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
simple misdemeanor.

otherwise provided. (Ord. B-39, 1969)
   B.   Any legal nonconforming use of a building or structure may be
continued, provided there are no physical changes other than necessary
maintenance and repair. If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming
use of a building may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same
classification or of a more restricted classification. Whenever a nonconforming

building may have been originally designed and constructed for the prior
nonconforming use.
   B.   Whenever a nonconforming use of a building or structure or part thereof
has been discontinued for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months, or
whenever there is evident a clear intent on the part of the owner to abandon a
nonconforming use, such use shall not, after being discontinued or abandoned,
be reestablished, and the use of the premises thereafter shall be in conformity
with the regulations of the district.
   C.   Where no enclosed building is involved, discontinuance of a
nonconforming use for a period of six (6) months shall constitute abandonment,
and shall not thereafter be used in a nonconforming manner. (Ord. B-39, 1969)
10-5-3: TERMINATION AND REMOVAL:
The period of time during which the following nonconforming uses of buildings,

the city clerk's office, shall not become a valid use unless it is a conforming
use under this title, nor shall such continued use become a valid nonconforming
use under this title. (Ord. B-39, 1969)
10-5-4: REPAIRS AND ALTERATIONS:
   A.   Normal maintenance of a building or other structure containing a
nonconforming use is permitted, including necessary nonstructural repairs and
incidental alterations which do not extend or intensify the nonconforming use.
   B.   No structure alteration shall be made in a building or other structure
containing a nonconforming use, except in the following situations:
      1.   When the alteration is required by law.
      2.   When the alteration will actually result in elimination of the
nonconforming use.
      3.   When a building in a residential district containing residential
nonconforming uses may be altered in any way to improve livability, provided no
structural alterations shall be made which would increase the number of
dwelling units or the bulk of the building. (Ord. B-39, 1969)
10-5-5: DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION:
If a building or other structure containing a nonconforming use is
involuntarily damaged or destroyed by any means, the building may then be

   A.   A building, nonconforming in use, may be enlarged or extended one time
during the existence of said nonconforming use by no more than twenty five
percent (25%) of the existing floor area. Such building will not need to become
a conforming use. Applicant will be required to go through the special use
application process as provided in
chapter 22 of this title. However, a building may be enlarged or extended by
more than twenty five percent (25%) only if the entire building is thereafter
devoted to a conforming use. In both cases, the building must conform to all
other regulations of the district in which it is located. (Ord. C-152, 2-2-
1993)
   B.   No building partially occupied by a nonconforming use shall be altered
in such a way as to permit the enlargement or expansion of the space occupied
by such nonconforming use.
   C.   No nonconforming use may be enlarged or extended in such a way as to
occupy any required usable open space, or any land beyond the boundaries of the
zoning lot as it existed on the effective date of this title, or to displace
any conforming use in the same building or on the same premises. (Ord. B-39,
1969)
   D.   A building or structure which is nonconforming with respect to yards or
any other specific element of bulk may be altered or expanded, provided the
degree of the nonconformity is not increased, and provided no other code
requirement or bulk regulation, for the district in which it is located, is
violated. (Ord. B-338, 1-6-1981)
   E.   No building or structure which is nonconforming with respect to yards
or any other specific element of bulk can be expanded by more than thirty
percent (30%) of its existing gross floor area whenever such expansion
increases the actual amount of a structure's nonconformity and nonconforming
area, nor can any alteration be effected that involves replacement of more than
thirty percent (30%) of the structure's existing framework. An expansion or
alteration in accordance with this section, involving no more than thirty
percent (30%) of the existing floor area or structural framework, can occur
only one time unless specifically permitted thereafter by special use. An
expansion or alteration of more than thirty percent (30%) of existing floor
area or structural framework replacement of more than thirty percent (30%) can
also occur through issuance of a special use permit. (Ord. C-430, 11-15-2005)
   F.   In the event of involuntary destruction or substantial damage, the
building or structure may be restored or reconstructed "as was" or may be
expanded in accordance with subsection E of this section. Reconstruction or
expansion must be completed within twelve (12) months of the occurrence of the
destruction or substantial damage. (Ord. C-418, 5-3-2005)
10-5-7: CONVERSION TO SPECIAL USE:
   A.   Any nonconforming use may be made a special use by granting of a
special use permit, as authorized in
chapter 22 of this title.
   B.   Any nonconforming use of a building or structure which has been vacant
for more than twelve (12) months and lost its nonconforming classification as
required by subsection 10-5-2B of this chapter, may be made a special use by
granting of a special use permit, as authorized in
chapter 22 of this title, provided the following conditions are met:
      1.   The building or structure must be of such nature that conversion to
an allowable use would be impossible, financially impractical (improvements to
convert would cost in excess of 50 percent of the value of the structure), or
nonconducive to the structure.
      2.   The proposed use is suitable for the subject structure and site.
      3.   The use proposed must be similar or more restrictive than previous
uses of the property with evidence showing previous uses in legal operation.
      4.   The structure will not be structurally altered or enlarged in such a
way as to enlarge the special use beyond the space previously used for
nonconforming uses.
      5.   Any special use approved using this subsection B is approved for the
use only. Any change in use is not allowed under the previous special use.

the vicinity of the use and such lots will fill the general parking
requirements. (Ord. D-39, 1-17-2017)
   B.   Existing Parking And Loading Facilities: Accessory off street parking
or loading facilities which are located on the same lot as the building or use

A permit shall be required before commencing work on any building project or
structure, as set forth in section
10-4-2 of this title, and issued by the Zoning Administrator in conformity with
the provisions of this Code.
   A.   No permit as required by the zoning or building provisions of this Code
shall be issued by the Zoning Administrator for construction of a building,
structure or land improvement, or an alteration or enlargement of an existing
building, structure or land improvement and/or the uses thereof, until the

and specifications, conforms with the regulations of this title.
   B.   An application for a zoning permit shall be filed with the Zoning
Administrator for any building, structure, land improvement and/or the use
thereof requiring conformance with this title, even though a permit is not
required by other building provisions of this Code.
   C.   All applications for building or zoning permits shall be accompanied by

10-20-4: CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY:
   A.   Scope Of Permit: A certificate of occupancy shall be required before
the occupancy or use of each building or structure hereafter constructed,
enlarged or altered, and the regulatory ordinances of this City. No building or
addition thereto, constructed after the effective date hereof, and no addition
to an existing building shall be occupied, and no land vacant on the effective
date hereof shall be used for any purpose, until a certificate of occupancy has
been issued by the Zoning Administrator. No change in a use in any district
shall be made until a certificate of occupancy has been issued by the Zoning
Administrator. Every occupancy certificate shall state that the use or
occupancy complies with all the provisions of this title.
   B.   Application For Occupancy Certificates: Every application for a
building permit shall also be deemed to be an application for a certificate of
occupancy. Every application for a certificate of occupancy for a new or
changed use of land, or building where no building permit is required, shall be
made to the Zoning Administrator on approved forms.
   C.   Issuance Of Occupancy Certificate: Said certificate shall be issued by
the Zoning Administrator, and may be on one form conforming with all the
regulatory ordinances of this City. No certificates of occupancy for a building
or addition thereto, constructed after the effective date hereof, shall be
issued until construction has been completed, and the premises have been
inspected and certified by the Zoning Administrator to be in full and complete
compliance with the plans and specifications. No addition to a previously
existing building shall be occupied, and no new use of a building in any
district shall be established until the premises have been inspected and
certified by the Zoning Administrator to be in full compliance with all the
applicable standards of the zoning district in which it is located. Pending the
issuance of a regular certificate, a temporary certificate may be issued to be
valid for a period not to exceed six (6) months from its date, during the
completion of any addition or during partial occupancy of the premises. An
occupancy certificate shall be issued, or written notice shall be given to the
applicant stating the reasons why a certificate cannot be issued, not later
than fourteen (14) days after the Zoning Administrator is notified in writing
that the building or premises is ready for occupancy.
   D.   Certificate For Continued Occupancy Of Nonconforming Uses: Certificates
for the continued occupancy of nonconforming uses existing at the time of
passage of this title, or made nonconforming by this title, shall state that
the use is a nonconforming one, and does not conform with the provisions of
this title. The Zoning Administrator shall notify the owners of such property
that it is subject to all the limitations and restrictions imposed by the
regulatory ordinances of this City upon the nonconforming use of property.

   C.   Variance Review Criteria: The Board of Adjustment shall be permitted to
approve, approve with conditions, or deny a request for a variance. Each
request for a variance shall be consistent with the following criteria:

no reasonable use of the property.
      2.   Limitations on the use of the property due to physical,
topographical and geological features.
      3.   The grant of the variance will not grant any special privilege to
the property owner.
      4.   The grant of the variance is not based solely on economic reasons.

shall be granted by the Board only in accordance with the standards established
in subsection C of this section, and may be granted only in the following
circumstances:

or rear yard required by this title.
      2.   To allow any reduction in yard size (lot coverage) or greater yard
encroachments than are permitted by this title.

structure height than the maximums or minimums required.
      5.   To allow the same off street parking facility to qualify as required

      7.   To increase by not more than twenty five percent (25%) the maximum
distance that required off street parking facilities are permitted to be

areas containing more than four (4) parking spaces and adjoining or fronting on
property situated in a Residential District. (Ord. C-196, 5-17-1994)

10-22-10: Planned Mobile Home Parks
10-22-11: Tiny Homes
10-22-1: PURPOSE:
The development and enactment of a zoning ordinance is based upon the division
of the city into districts, within which districts the use of land and
buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to
the land are mutually compatible. It is recognized, however, that there are
uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly
classified in any particular district or districts without consideration, in
each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public
need for the particular use at the particular location. Such special uses fall
into three (3) categories:
   A.   Uses either publicly operated or operated by publicly regulated
utilities or uses traditionally affected by public interest.
   B.   Uses entirely private in character but of such an unusual nature that
their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact
upon neighboring property or public facilities.
   C.   Nonconforming uses which, as special uses, can be made more compatible
with their surroundings. (Ord. B-39, 1969)
10-22-2: INITIATION OF SPECIAL USES:
Any person owning or having an interest in the subject property may file an
application to use such land for one (1) or more of the special uses provided
for herein in the zoning district in which the land is situated. (Ord. B-39,
1969)
10-22-3: APPLICATION FOR SPECIAL USE:
An application for a special use shall be filed with the zoning administrator
upon such form and accompanied by such information as shall be established from
time to time by the planning and zoning commission. The zoning administrator
shall forward to the board of adjustment and appeals without delay a copy of
each special use permit proposed for authorization of a special use. (Ord. D-
39, 1-17-2017)
10-22-4: RESERVED:
(Ord. D-39, 1-17-2017)
10-22-5: HEARING ON APPLICATION:
Upon receipt in proper form of the application with the accompanied information
as referred to above, the board of adjustment and appeals shall hold at least
one (1) public hearing. Notice of the time shall be given by one (1)
publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, at least fifteen
(15) days before the date of hearing. (Ord. B-39, 1969; amd. Ord. D-39, 1-17-
2017)
10-22-6: AUTHORIZATION:
Special uses shall be authorized by special use permit granted by the board of
adjustment and appeals in the same manner and for the same purposes as
variances. (Ord. B-39, 1969; amd. 1993 Code; Ord. D-39, 1-17-2017)
10-22-7: STANDARDS:
No special use shall be approved by the board of adjustment and appeals unless
said board shall find that: (Ord. D-39, 1-17-2017)
   A.   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use, will

commission and approval of the board of adjustment and appeals.
   A.   Use Exceptions: In the case of residential, business or manufacturing
planned developments, the planning and zoning commission may authorize that
there be in part of the area of such development and for the duration of such
development, specified uses not permitted by the use regulations of the
district in which said development is located, provided the commission shall
find:
      1.   That the uses permitted by such exception are necessary or desirable
and are appropriate with respect to the primary purpose of the development;

during a ten (10) year period, the cumulative cost of which, equals or exceeds
fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure either (i) before the
"start of construction" of the first improvement of the structure, or (ii) if
the structure has been "substantially damaged" and is being restored, before
the damage occurred.)
   The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a
structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or
safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and    which are the minimum necessary to assure safe
living conditions. The term also does not include any alteration of an
"historic structure", provided the alteration will not preclude the structure's
designation as an "historic structure."
   B.   Any addition which increases the original floor area of a building by
twenty five percent (25%) or more. All additions constructed after the
effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by the

10-25-2: STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE:
   A.   The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in chapter 414, Iowa Code, as
amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure
safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
   B.   Findings Of Fact:
      1.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Fort Madison are subject to
periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare of the community.
      2.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by: (i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
      3.   This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
   C.   Statement Of Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City of Fort Madison and
its residents and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare,
and comfort and convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses
described in division B1 with provisions designed to:
      1.   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows
so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
      2.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
      3.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
      4.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
      5.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program. (Ord. D-61, 6-2-2020)

10-25-7: FLOODWAY FRINGE (OVERLAY) DISTRICT (FF):
   A.   Permitted Uses: All development within the Floodway Fringe District
shall be permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other
ordinance (or underlying zoning district) and provided they meet applicable
performance standards of the Floodway Fringe District.
   B.   Performance Standards: All development must be consistent with the need
to minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance
standards. Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no development may
increase the base flood elevation more than one foot (1'). The applicant will
be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with
sufficient technical information to make such determination.
      1.   All new and substantially improved structures shall:
         a.   Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement of the structure.

      2.   Residential Structures: All new or substantially improved
residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated a minimum of one foot (1') above the base flood elevation.
Construction shall be upon compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no
lower than one foot (1') above the base flood elevation and extend at such
elevation at least eighteen feet (18') beyond the limits of any structure
erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such as piers or extended
foundations) may be allowed subject to favorable consideration by the Board of
Adjustment, where existing topography, street grades, or other factors preclude
elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods used must be adequate to support
the structure as well as withstand the various forces and hazards associated
with flooding.
      All new residential structures located in areas that would become
isolated due to flooding of surrounding ground shall be provided with a means
of access that will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the base flood.
However, this criterion shall not apply where the Administrator determines
there is sufficient flood warning time for the protection of life and property.
When estimating flood warning time, consideration shall be given to the
criteria listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa Administrative Code.
      3.   Non-Residential Structures: All new or substantially improved non-
residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot (1') above the base flood elevation, or together
with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level.

of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and
other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the
base flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
      4.   All new and substantially improved structures:
         a.   Fully enclosed areas below the "lowest floor" (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:

two (2) walls, having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for
every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
            (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
(1') above grade.
            (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
            Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building
access and low damage potential storage.
         b.   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
         c.   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed
with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment and
other service facilities (including ductwork) elevated or floodproofed to a
minimum of one foot (1') above the base flood elevation.

is a minimum of one foot (1') above the base flood elevation.
         b.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Anchorage systems
may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to
ground anchors as required by the State Building Code.
      6.   Utility And Sanitary Systems:
         a.   On-site wastewater disposal and water supply systems shall be
located or designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the
system during flooding.
         b.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system as well
as the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment facilities
(other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood protection
equal to or greater than one foot (1') above the base flood elevation.
         c.   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water
supply treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with
a level of protection equal to or greater than one foot (1') above the base
flood elevation.
         d.   Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
      7.   Storage of materials and equipment that are flammable, explosive or
injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited unless elevated a
minimum of one foot (1') above the base flood elevation. Other material and
equipment must either be similarly elevated or (i) not be subject to major
flood damage and be anchored to prevent movement due to flood waters or (ii) be
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
      8.   Flood control structural works such as levees, flood walls, etc.
shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the base flood with a minimum of
three feet (3') of design freeboard and shall provide for adequate interior
drainage. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources shall approve
structural flood control works.
      9.   Watercourse alterations or relocations must be designed to maintain
the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion. In
addition, the Department of Natural Resources must approve such alterations or
relocations.
      10.   Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and subdivisions)
shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and shall have
adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage. Development
associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation of public
utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this chapter.
Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all lots with
a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the base
flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five (5) acres or fifty (50)
lots (whichever is less) shall include base flood elevation data for those
areas located within the Floodway Fringe (Overlay) District.
      11.   Accessory Structures To Residential Uses:
         a.   Detached garages, sheds, and similar structures that are
incidental to a residential use are exempt from the base flood elevation
requirements where the following criteria are satisfied.
            (1)   The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential. Its size shall not exceed six hundred (600) square feet in size.
Those portions of the structure located less than one foot (1') above the BFE

10-25-9: [RESERVED]:
10-25-10: APPOINTMENT AND DUTIES OF BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT:
   A.   Appointment And Duties Of Board Of Adjustment: A Board of Adjustment is
hereby established which shall hear and decide (i) appeals and (ii) requests
for variances to the provisions of this chapter, and shall take any other
action which is required of the Board.
   B.   Appeals: Where it is alleged there is any error in any order,
requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in
the enforcement of this chapter, the aggrieved party may appeal such action.
The notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board of Adjustment and with the
official from whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason
for the appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to
the Board of Adjustment all the documents constituting the record upon which
the action appealed from was taken.
   C.   Variance: The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in
specific cases such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be
contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary
hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.
      1.   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
      2.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
      3.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      4.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty five dollars ($25.00) for one
hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage and (ii) such construction
increases risks to life and property.
      5.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
   D.   Hearings And Decisions Of The Board Of Adjustment:
      1.   Hearings: Upon the filing with the Board of Adjustment of an appeal
or a request for a variance, the Board shall hold a public hearing. The Board
shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing and give public notice thereof, as
well as due notice to parties in interest. At the hearing, any party may appear
in person or by agent or attorney and present written or oral evidence. The
board may require the appellant or applicant to provide such    information as
is reasonably deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or
evaluation of a professional engineer or other expert person or agency,
including the Department of Natural Resources.
      2.   Decisions: The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal or
variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an appeal, the Board may, so
long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter,
reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in
writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision.
In granting a variance, the Board shall consider such factors as contained in
this section and all other relevant sections of this chapter and may prescribe
such conditions as contained in division D2b.
         a.   Factors Upon Which The Decision Of The Board Of Adjustment Shall
Be Based: In passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider
all relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
            (1)   The danger to life and property due to increased flood
heights or velocities caused by encroachments.
            (2)   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
            (3)   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the
ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary
conditions.
            (4)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            (5)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the city.

development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
            (9)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for the area.
            (10)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            (11)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.
            (12)   The cost of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer,
gas, electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and bridges.
            (13)   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
chapter.
         b.   Conditions Attached To Variances: Upon consideration of the
factors listed above, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this
chapter. Such conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
            (1)   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
            (2)   Limitation of periods of use and operation.

Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this chapter.
            (5)   Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the
flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration,
rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated
with the regulatory flood. The Board of Adjustment shall require that the
applicant submit a plan or document certified by a registered professional
engineer that the floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory
flood protection elevation and associated flood factors for the particular
area.
   E.   Appeals To The Court: Any person or persons, jointly or severally,
aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Adjustment may present to a court of
record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal,

planned for either end of that runway. The elevation of any point on the
primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway
centerline.
AIRSPACE HEIGHT: For the purpose of determining the height limits in all zones
set forth in this Chapter and shown on the Zoning Map, the datum shall be mean
sea level elevation unless otherwise specified.
CONTROL ZONE: Airspace extending upward from the surface of the earth which may
include one or more airports and is normally a circular area of five (5)
statute miles in radium with extensions where necessary to include instrument
approach and departure paths.
INSTRUMENT RUNWAY: A runway having an existing instrument approach procedure
utilizing air navigation facilities or area type navigation equipment, for
which an instrument approach procedure has been approved or planned.
MINIMUM DESCENT ALTITUDE: The lowest altitude, expressed in feet above mean sea
level, to which descent is authorized on final approach or during circle-to-
land maneuvering in execution of a standard instrument approach procedure,
where no electronic glide slope is provided.
MINIMUM EN ROUTE ALTITUDE: The altitude in effect between radio fixes which
assures acceptable navigational signal coverage and meets obstruction clearance
requirements between those fixes.
MINIMUM OBSTRUCTION CLEARANCE ALTITUDE: The specified altitude in effect
between radio fixes or VOR airways, off-airway routes, or route segments which
meets obstruction clearance requirements for the entire route segment and which
assures acceptable navigational signal coverage only within twenty two (22)
miles of a VOR.
RUNWAY: A defined area on an airport prepared for landing and takeoff of
aircraft along its length.
VOR: Visual omny range.
VISUAL RUNWAY: A runway intended solely for the operation of aircraft using
visual approach procedures with no straight-in instrument approach procedure
and no instrument designation indicated on an FAA approved airport layout plan,
a military services approved military airport layout plan, or by any planning
document submitted to the FAA by competent authority. (Ord. B-368, 3-2-82; 1993
Code)
10-26-4: AIRPORT ZONES AND AIRSPACE HEIGHT LIMITATIONS:
In order to carry out the provisions of this Chapter, there are hereby created
and established certain zones which are depicted on the Fort Madison Municipal
Airport Tall Structure Map. A structure located in more than one zone of the
following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive
height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as
follows:
   A.   Horizontal Zone: The land lying under a horizontal plane one hundred
fifty feet (150') above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of
which is constructed by:
 
                                1. Swinging arcs of 5,000 feet radii from

   B.   Conical Zone: The land lying under a surface extending outward and
upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20 to 1 for a
horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. No structure shall penetrate the conical
surface in the conical zone, as depicted on the Fort Madison Municipal Airport
Tall Structure Map.
   C.   Approach Zone: The land lying under a surface longitudinally centered
on the extended runway centerline and extending outward and upward from each
end of the primary surface. (Note: An approach surface is applied to each end
of each runway based upon the type of approach available or planned for that
runway end.)

   (G)   Unless unavoidable, lots shall not front, or have direct access to
arterial streets. Where unavoidable, lots shall be so arranged as to minimize
the number of access points.
   (H)   All lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or
radial to curved street lines, except where, in the judgment of the governing
body, a variation to this provision will provide a better street and lot
layout.
   (I)   Corner lots shall have sufficient extra width to permit the required
front yard setback as specified in the Zoning Ordinance, oriented to either
street.

served by septic systems shall be approved by the governing body until
percolation tests have been performed and the results of the tests have been
provided to, and reported on, by the City Engineer.
   (L)   Satellite dishes intended to serve an entire development should be
shown on the site plan construction dwellings. Assurances should exist that

sites in the Comprehensive Plan or other official plans of the city, the
subdivider shall indicate the areas on the plat.
   (A)   Proposed parks sites shall be reserved for three years, giving the
city or other authorized public agency the option to purchase the land at the

land appraiser. The purchase price shall also include one-half of the cost for
grading and paving, including curbs, of the portion of any streets that are
contiguous to the site and any taxes and interest incurred by the subdivider
