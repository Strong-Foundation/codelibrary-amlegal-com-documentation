Notes
  † EDITOR’S NOTE: A suggested form of notice for the abatement of nuisances is
  included in the Appendix of this Code of Ordinances. Caution is urged in the use
  of this administrative abatement procedure, particularly where cost of abatement

  in fact exist. If compliance is not secured following notice and hearings, we
  recommend you review the situation with your attorney before proceeding with

into custody any abandoned vehicle on private property. The police authority

placing the vehicle in custody and upon payment of the costs of the notice. The
notice shall also state that the failure of the owner, lienholders or claimants
to exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property within the
time provided shall be deemed a waiver by the owner, lienholders and claimants
of all right, title, claim and interest in the vehicle or personal property and
that failure to reclaim the vehicle or personal property is deemed consent to
the sale of the vehicle at a public auction or disposal of the vehicle to a
demolisher and to disposal of the personal property by sale or destruction. If
the abandoned vehicle was taken into custody by a private entity without a
police authority’s initiative, the notice shall state that the private entity

ten-day reclaiming period, the owner, lienholders or claimants shall no longer
have any right, title, claim, or interest in or to the vehicle or the personal
property. A court in any case in law or equity shall not recognize any right,

   If it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identity and
addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders, notice by one
publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the
vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice
under Section
52.03. The published notice may contain multiple listings of abandoned vehicles
and personal property but shall be published within the same time requirements
and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed notice in Section
52.03.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3b])
52.05   FEES FOR IMPOUNDMENT.
   The owner, lienholder, or claimant shall pay five dollars ($5.00) if claimed
within five (5) days of impounding, plus one dollar ($1.00) for each additional
day within the reclaiming period plus towing charges, if stored by the City, or
towing and storage fees, if stored in a public garage, whereupon said vehicle
shall be released. The amount of towing charges, and the rate of storage
charges by privately owned garages, shall be established by such facility.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3a])
52.06   DISPOSAL OF ABANDONED VEHICLES.

any abandoned motor vehicle, or any person being the owner of a motor vehicle
whose title certificate is faulty, lost or destroyed, may dispose of such motor
vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without notification
procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more wheels or
other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable. The police
authority shall give the applicant a certificate of authority. The applicant
shall then apply to the County Treasurer for a junking certificate and shall
surrender the certificate of authority in lieu of the certificate of title.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.90[2e])
52.08   PROCEEDS FROM SALES.
   Proceeds from the sale of any abandoned vehicle shall be applied to the
expense of auction, cost of towing, preserving, storing, and notification
required, in accordance with State law. Any balance shall be held for the owner
of the motor vehicle or entitled lienholder for ninety (90) days, and then
shall be deposited in the State Road Use Tax Fund. Where the sale of any
vehicle fails to realize the amount necessary to meet costs the police
authority shall apply for reimbursement from the Department of Transportation.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[4])
52.09   DUTIES OF DEMOLISHER.
   Any demolisher who purchases or otherwise acquires an abandoned motor
vehicle for junk shall junk, scrap, wreck, dismantle, or otherwise demolish

   Any connection with a public sanitary sewer must be made under the direct
supervision of the Superintendent and in accordance with the following:
   1.   Old Building Sewers. Old building sewers may be used in connection with
new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test conducted by
the owner and observed by the Superintendent, to meet all requirements of this
chapter.
   2.   Separate Building Sewers. A separate and independent building sewer
shall be provided for every occupied building; except where one building stands
at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or
can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court,
yard, or driveway. In such cases the building sewer from the front building may
be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building
sewer.
   3.   Installation. The installation and connection of the building sewer to
the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the State Plumbing Code
and applicable rules and regulations of the City. All such connections shall be
made gastight and watertight. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and
materials must be approved by the Superintendent before installation.
   4.   Water Lines. When possible, building sewers should be laid at least ten
(10) feet horizontally from a water service. The horizontal separation may be
less, provided the water service line is located at one side and at least
twelve (12) inches above the top of the building sewer.
   5.   Size. Building sewers shall be sized for the peak expected sewage flow
from the building with a minimum building sewer size of four (4) inches.
   6.   Alignment and Grade. All building sewers shall be laid to a straight
line to meet the following:

      D.   Any deviation in alignment or grade shall be made only with the
written approval of the Superintendent and shall be made only with approved
fittings.
   7.   Depth. Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the
building at an elevation below the basement floor. The depth of cover above the
sewer shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost.
   8.   Sewage Lifts. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low
to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such
drain shall be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the
building sewer.
   9.   Pipe Specifications. Building sewer pipe shall be free from flaws,
splits, or breaks. Materials shall be as specified in the State Plumbing Code
except that the building sewer pipe, from the property line to the public
sewer, shall comply with the current edition of one of the following:
      A.   Clay sewer pipe - A.S.T.M. C-700 (extra strength).

   10.   Bearing Walls. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to, or within
three (3) feet of any bearing wall, which might thereby be weakened.
   11.   Jointing. Fittings, type of joint, and jointing material shall be
compatible with the type of pipe used, subject to the approval of the
Superintendent. Solvent-welded joints are not permitted.
   12.   Unstable Soil. No sewer connection shall be laid so that it is exposed
when crossing any watercourse. Where an old watercourse must of necessity be
crossed or where there is any danger of undermining or settlement, cast iron
soil pipe or vitrified clay sewer pipe thoroughly encased in concrete shall be
required for such crossings. Such encasement shall extend at least six (6)
inches on all sides of the pipe. The cast iron pipe or encased clay pipe shall
rest on firm, solid material at either end.
   13.   Preparation of Basement or Crawl Space. No connection for any
residence, business or other structure with any sanitary sewer shall be made
unless the basement floor is poured, or in the case of a building with a slab
or crawl space, unless the ground floor is installed with the area adjacent to
the foundation of such building cleared of debris and backfilled. The backfill
shall be well compacted and graded so that the drainage is away from the
foundation. Prior to the time the basement floor is poured, or the first floor
is installed in buildings without basements, the sewer shall be plugged and the
plug shall be sealed by the Superintendent. Any accumulation of water in any
excavation or basement during construction and prior to connection to the
sanitary sewer shall be removed by means other than draining into the sanitary
sewer.
96.06   INTERCEPTORS REQUIRED.
   Grease, oil, sludge and sand interceptors shall be provided by gas and
service stations, convenience stores, car washes, garages, and other facilities
when, in the opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper
handling of such wastes that contain grease in excessive amounts or any
flammable waste, sand or other harmful ingredients. Such interceptors shall not
be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. When required, such
interceptors shall be installed in accordance with the following:
   1.   Design and Location. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity
as specified in the State Plumbing Code, to be approved by the Superintendent,
and shall be located so as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection.
   2.   Construction Standards. The interceptors shall be constructed of
impervious material capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in
temperature. They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped
with easily removable covers that shall be gastight and watertight.
   3.   Maintenance. All such interceptors shall be maintained by the owner at
the owner’s expense and shall be kept in continuously efficient operations at
all times.
96.07   SEWER TAP.
   Connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the
“Y” branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If no properly
located “Y” branch is available, a saddle “Y” shall be installed at the
location specified by the Superintendent. The public sewer shall be tapped with
a tapping machine and a saddle appropriate to the type of public sewer shall be
glued or attached with a gasket and stainless steel clamps to the sewer. At no
time shall a building sewer be constructed so as to enter a manhole unless
special written permission is received from the Superintendent and in
accordance with the Superintendent’s direction if such connection is approved.
96.08   INSPECTION REQUIRED.
   All connections with the sanitary sewer system before being covered shall be
inspected and approved, in writing, by the Superintendent. As soon as all pipe
work from the public sewer to inside the building has been completed, and
before any backfilling is done, the Superintendent shall be notified and the
Superintendent shall inspect and test the work as to workmanship and material;
no sewer pipe laid underground shall be covered or trenches filled until after
the sewer has been so inspected and approved. If the Superintendent refuses to
approve the work, the plumber or owner must proceed immediately to correct the
work.
96.09   PROPERTY OWNER’S RESPONSIBILITY.
   All costs and expenses incident to the installation, connection and
maintenance of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall
indemnify the City from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be
occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.
96.10   ABATEMENT OF VIOLATIONS.
   Construction or maintenance of building sewer lines whether located upon the
private property of any owner or in the public right-of-way, which construction
or maintenance is in violation of any of the requirements of this chapter,
shall be corrected, at the owner’s expense, within thirty (30) days after date
of official notice from the Council of such violation. If not made within such
time the Council shall, in addition to the other penalties herein provided,
have the right to finish and correct the work and assess the cost thereof to
the property owner. Such assessment shall be collected with and in the same
manner as general property taxes.

97.01   STORM WATER.
   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any storm water, surface
water, groundwater, roof run-off, sub-surface drainage, uncontaminated cooling
water, or unpolluted industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer. Storm
water and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such sewers as
are specifically designated as combined sewers or storm sewers, or to a natural
outlet approved by the Superintendent. Industrial cooling water or unpolluted
process waters may be discharged on approval of the Superintendent, to a storm
sewer, combined sewer, or natural outlet.
97.02   SUMP PUMPS.
   1.   Definition and Method. No water from any roof, surface, ground, sump
pump, footing tile, swimming pool, or other natural precipitation shall be
discharged into the sanitary sewage system. Dwellings and other buildings and
structures which require, because of the infiltration of water into basements,
crawl spaces and the like, a sump pump system to discharge excess water shall
have a permanently installed discharge line which shall not at any time
discharge water into the sanitary sewage system, except as provided herein. A
permanent installation is one which provides for year-round discharge
capability to either the outside of the dwelling, building, or structure or is
connected to the City storm sewer system. If there is no sub-drain available,
the surface discharge point shall be located no closer than four (4) feet from
any property line or traveled portion of any street, except the drain hose may
not be laid across a sidewalk or in a driveway, allowing the water to run down
a sidewalk, driveway, or other hard surface. It shall consist of a discharge
line, without valving or quick connections for altering the path of discharge.
If a storm sewer inlet is adjacent to a property, with City permission and
inspection, the property owner may connect his or her sump pump discharge hose
to the back side of this inlet.
   2.   Inspection. Every person owning improved real estate that discharges
into the City’s sanitary sewer system shall allow an employee of the City to
inspect the buildings to confirm that there is no sump pump or other prohibited
discharge into the sanitary sewer system. Further, every person shall allow
said employee access to test by televised scoping or otherwise the sewer
service line. In lieu of having the City inspect the property, any person may
furnish a certificate from a plumber approved by the City certifying that said
person’s property is in compliance with this section. Any person refusing to
allow his or her property to be inspected or refusing to furnish a plumber’s
certificate within fourteen (14) days of the date City employees are denied
admittance to the property, shall immediately become subject to the surcharge
hereinafter provided for. Any owner of property found to violate this section
shall make the necessary changes to comply with this section and furnish proof
of the changes to the City within forty-five (45) days from the date the
violation was identified.
   3.   Future Inspections. At any future time, if the City has reason to
suspect that an illegal connection may exist in a premises, the owner, by
written notice, shall comply with the provisions of this section.
   4.   Penalty. A surcharge of seventy-five dollars ($75.00) per month may be
imposed and added to every sewer billing to property owners who dispose of
water in violation of Subsection 2 herein. This surcharge may be levied monthly
to those properties found not to be in compliance.
   5.   Street Discharge. No discharge of water as defined in Subsection 2
shall be discharged on the City streets after November 15, 1998. However,
existing houses that currently discharge water on to City streets shall be
exempted from this provision upon registering with the City by November 15,
1998, and paying a fee of $25.00. All such exempted properties shall have
buried hoses or pipes, which discharge the water into the street. Such
residences shall not discharge water into the street from and after November 15
of each year until April 1 of each year.
97.03   PROHIBITED DISCHARGES.
   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any of the following
described waters or wastes to any public sewers:

commenced until said approvals are obtained in writing.
97.04   RESTRICTED DISCHARGES.
   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following described
substances, materials, waters, or wastes if it appears likely in the opinion of
the Superintendent that such wastes can harm either the sewers, sewage
treatment process, or equipment, have an adverse effect on the receiving stream
or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public property, or constitute a
nuisance. In forming an opinion as to the acceptability of these wastes, the
Superintendent will give consideration to such factors as the quantities of
subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of
construction of the sewers, nature of the sewage treatment process, capacity of
the sewage treatment plant, degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage
treatment plant, and other pertinent factors. The substances restricted are:

   7.   Odor or Taste. Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste
or odor producing substances, in such concentrations exceeding limits which may
be established by the Superintendent as necessary, after treatment of the
composite sewage, to meet the requirements of state, federal, or other public
agencies of jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters.
   8.   Radioactive Wastes. Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-
life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the Superintendent in
compliance with applicable State or federal regulations.
   9.   Excess Alkalinity. Any waters or wastes having a pH in excess of 9.5.
   10.   Unusual Wastes. Materials which exert or cause:

for their maintenance and repair.
   12.   Damaging Substances. Any waters, wastes, materials or substances which
react with water or wastes in the sewer system to release noxious gases,
develop color of undesirable intensity, form suspended solids in objectionable
concentration or create any other condition deleterious to structures and
treatment processes.
   13.   Untreatable Wastes. Waters or wastes containing substances which are
not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes
employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage
treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having
jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.
97.05   RESTRICTED DISCHARGES - POWERS.
   If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to
the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in Section
97.04 and which in the judgment of the Superintendent may have a deleterious
effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or
which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the
Superintendent may:
   1.   Rejection. Reject the wastes by requiring disconnection from the public
sewage system;
   2.   Pretreatment. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for
discharge to the public sewers;
   3.   Controls Imposed. Require control over the quantities and rates of
discharge; and/or
   4.   Special Charges. Require payment to cover the added cost of handling
and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under
the provisions of
Chapter 99.
97.06   SPECIAL FACILITIES.
   If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste
flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject
to the review and approval of the Superintendent and subject to the
requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws. Where preliminary
treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes,
they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation
by the owner at the owner’s expense.
97.07   CONTROL MANHOLES.
   When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner’s
expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
97.08   TESTING OF WASTES.
   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a twenty-four (24) hour composite of all
outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken. Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses
are obtained from twenty-four (24) hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s
are determined from periodic grab samples.)

Service Units and Amount of Charge
 
100.01   PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish the Storm Water Drainage
Utility, authorize charges, rates and fees for use of, and discharge to, the
public storm water drainage system, to provide a process for appeals from
certain decisions of the Council relating to such charges, and to provide for
collection of delinquent charges. The Council finds that the construction,
operation and maintenance of the City’s storm water system should be funded
through use charges imposed for the discharge of storm and surface water
system, thereby charging those persons and activities using or receiving
service from that system. The City may be required to provide increased
quantity or quality controls to mitigate those impacts of pollutants from
discharging storm and surface waters into the storm water system. Therefore, it
is appropriate to impose a storm and surface water user charge upon all users
of property which may discharge, directly or indirectly into the storm water
system.
100.02   DEFINITIONS.
   The following words shall have the following definitions when used in this
chapter, and any resolution and order adopted pursuant hereto, unless the
context requires otherwise or unless such word is expressly defined otherwise:
   1.   “Connection” means the physical act or process of tapping a public
storm sewer or drainage line, or joining onto an existing side sewer, for the
purpose of connecting private impervious surface or other storm and surface
water sources or systems to the public storm and surface water system. It also
includes creation or maintenance of impervious surface that causes or is likely
to cause an increase in the quantity or decrease in quality or both from the
natural state of storm water runoff, and which drains, directly or indirectly,
to the storm and surface water system.
   2.   “Date of imposition” or “imposition date” means July 1 of each fiscal
year or such other date designated by the Council at which time a charge is
imposed and becomes the legal obligation of the user. The obligation may
include the cost of services to be provided during the billing period or for
services previously provided to the same person under this chapter.
   3.   “Days” means calendar days unless otherwise specified.
   4.   “Equivalent service units” or “ESU” means a measurement unit based on
the impervious surface area of an average improved single-family dwelling lot
or parcel within the City (as determined by a statistical sampling performed by
the City) added to the approximate total of impervious street surface divided
by the number of users. Except as provided in Section 100.05 of this chapter,
one equivalent service unit shall be deemed to be 5,750 square feet of
impervious surface. As of December 13, 1996, the impervious surface area of an
average improved single-family dwelling lot or parcel within the City was
calculated to be 2,574 square feet. The approximate total of impervious street
surface of 3,549,560 square feet was divided by 1,122 users to arrive at 3,164
square feet per user. Adding 2,574 and 3,164 produces a square footage of 5,738
which was rounded to 5,750 square feet.
   5.   “Impervious surface area” means all land area that has been altered
from its natural state such that it does not allow the infiltration and
retention of water equivalent to that of undisturbed soil. This includes, but
is not limited to: pavement, buildings, decks, parking areas, and compacted
gravel areas. “Impervious surface” does not include improved public streets,
roads, sidewalks and bike paths; railroad beds or quarry excavation areas and
temporary service roads in the excavation areas. Rather such facilities are
deemed to be a part of the public surface water drainage conveyance system or
to constitute non-impervious surfaces.
   6.   “Improved single dwelling parcel” means a lot or parcel on which a
single-family dwelling or duplex exists at any time during the same years as
the imposition of the charge.
   7.   “Occupant” means the person residing or doing business on the property.
In a family or household situation, the occupants responsible for the
obligation herein imposed are the adult heads of the household, jointly and
severally. In a dwelling or office sharing situation, the adult occupant
legally responsible for the management or condition of the property shall be
responsible.
   8.   “Owner” means the legal owner(s) of records as shown on the tax rolls
of Hancock County, or where there is a recorded land sale contract, the
purchaser thereunder.
   9.   “Person” means any individual, public or private corporation, political
subdivision, governmental agency, municipality, partnership, association, firm,
trust, or any other legal entity whatsoever.
   10.   “Rule” means any written standard, directive, interpretation, policy,
regulation, procedure or other provision, adopted by the Council as a
resolution and order to carry out the provisions of this chapter.
   11.   “Storm and surface water drainage system” means any combination of
publicly-owned storm and surface water quantity and quality and quality
facilities, pumping, or lift facilities, storm and secondary drain pipes and
culverts, open channels, creeks and rivers, force mains, laterals, manholes,
catch basins and inlets, including the grates and covers thereof, detention and
other retention facilities, laboratory facilities and equipment, and any other
publicly-owned facilities for the collection, conveyance, treatment and
disposal of storm and surface water comprising the total publicly-owned storm
and surface water system with the City, to which sanitary sewage flows are not
intentionally admitted.
   12.   “User” means any person who uses property which maintains connection
to, discharges to, or otherwise receives services from the City for surface
water management. The occupant of occupied property is deemed the user. If the
property is not occupied, the person who has the right to occupy it shall be
deemed the user.
100.03   STORM WATER UTILITY ESTABLISHED.
   Pursuant to the authority of Section 384.84 of the Code of Iowa, as amended,
the Council hereby establishes a storm water utility in the City. The entire
City, as increased from time to time, shall constitute a single storm water
drainage system district.
100.04   CHARGES AND FEES.
   The Council may adopt by rule, charges, rates, and fees for the use of the
City’s storm and surface water system, and for services provided by the City
relating to that system. Such rules may include delinquency and interest
charges and penalties. Such charges and fees shall be just and equitable based
upon the actual costs of operation, maintenance, acquisition, extension and
replacement of the City’s system, the costs of bond repayment, regulation,
administration, and services of the City’s storm and surface water system and
program, and for services of the City. Except as specifically provided in this
chapter or by resolution and order, all charges and service fees shall be due
and payable in advance of provision of service. All billing procedures shall be
the same as for water usage and may be billed on the same bill.
   1.   Service Charge. Each customer shall pay for public storm water drainage
$6.25 per month per equivalent service unit or ESU as defined in Section 100.02
of this chapter.
   2.   As needed, the City may amend this chapter to change the Storm Water
Drainage System rates.
100.05   STORM WATER UTILITY USER CHARGE.
   1.   There is hereby established a storm water utility system user charge.
This charge hereby is imposed on every user within the City of the storm and
surface water system on the imposition date. The charge may be required to be
paid in advance of the provision of service for the billing period. The charge
due for the billing period shall be the obligation of the user of the public
storm system on the imposition date, notwithstanding whether the user is the
addressee of the bill.
   2.   The charge shall be the personal obligation of the user on the
imposition date, regardless of whether that person has any ownership interest
in the property. This charge shall constitute a debt due the City as of the
date of imposition.
   3.   Any person who has paid the full amount due in advance of receiving
service shall be entitled to a refund if the person ceases to be the user. The
refund shall be effective on the date the property is vacated or sold and based
on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The refund is waived
unless a written request for refund is filed within thirty (30) days of
vacating or selling the property. The request shall include documentation
reasonably deemed adequate by the Council. Notwithstanding any other provision,
the new user shall be responsible for the remaining balance of the service
charge, which may be billed immediately or added to the bill for the next
period.
   4.   There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the owner of the real
property, as shown in the records of the County Assessor, is the occupant.
   5.   The storm water utility user charge shall be imposed upon any person
who uses or discharges to the public storm and surface water system by:
      A.   Maintaining impervious surface connected to (directly or indirectly)
and capable of discharge to the public surface water management systems; or
      B.   Actually discharging storm or surface water into the system; or
      C.   Making a specific request for storm and surface water management
service.
Said charge shall be charged for all users of properties covered in part by
impervious surface area within the boundaries of the City. A property
containing impervious surface is presumed to discharge storm water to the storm
and surface water drainage system, and to generate a demand for storm and
surface water drainage services, unless that property has an on-site disposal
system which meets the standards of Section
100.09 of this chapter and any rules adopted thereunder.
100.06   CALCULATION OF EQUIVALENT SERVICE UNITS AND AMOUNT OF CHARGE.
   This section shall be used to determine the number of equivalent service
units (ESUs) for a property for purposes of determining the amount of storm
water utility (SWU) service charges and the water quantity component of the
SWU.
   There are two types of uses: flat rate uses and measured uses. These are
defined as follows:
   1.   Flat Rate Uses. Properties that qualify under this section as flat rate
uses shall be charged at the rate of one ESU per dwelling unit. The following
uses shall be defined as flat rate uses:
      A.   A “flat rate use residence” is a residential structure not attached
to another residential structure on one or more parcels of land, providing
there are no more than two residential structures on one parcel. Flat rate use
residences shall have impervious surfaces totaling no more than 5,750 square
feet in area. This definition also includes trailers, mobile homes, and
manufactured homes, if on separate parcels. Two separate dwelling units on a
single parcel shall be charged one ESU per dwelling unit. Three or more
residential dwelling units on one parcel, whether attached or unattached, shall
be considered a multiple-family residential use, and shall be a measured use,
as defined below.
      B.   A “duplex” is two dwelling units joined to each other with a common
wall, or one above the other, on one or two parcels. The units may be under the
ownership, or owned separately. Each dwelling unit of the duplex shall be
charged one ESU.
      C.   “Trailer parks” and “mobile home parks” include trailers and mobile
homes on a single tax lot (even if there are more than two per tax lot) under
one ownership, where spaces are leased or rented for a mobile home or trailer
to be placed. Each space of a trailer park or mobile home park shall be charged
one ESU whether or not there is a trailer or mobile home on the space. Other
impervious areas within the boundaries of the trailer park or mobile home park
shall not be measured. The owner of the tax lot shall be deemed the lessor.
   2.   Measured Uses. Properties that are not flat rate uses shall be measured
uses. For such uses, the impervious surfaces of the property, as defined by
agency rule, shall be measured. The area shall be estimated using one or more
of the following: aerial photographs, assessment records, building permits,
construction plans, site visits, ad valorem property tax records, storm and
surface water system connection permits, field surveys or other sources deemed
reliable by the City. This area shall then be divided by 5,750 square feet, the
area of one equivalent service unit within the City. Any ESU’s above 15 shall
be multiplied by 0.25 and added to the original 15 ESU’s before rounding to
determine the total. Fractional values shall be rounded down if below 0.5 and
up if 0.5 or above. The minimum value shall be 0.5 ESU’s. The ESU’s for all of
the uses in this subsection shall be determined by measuring the impervious
area.
      A.   A “multi-family residential use” is:
         (1)   A group of residential dwellings on one parcel including three
or more units, whether or not the units are attached; or
         (2)   Three or more attached units on one or more parcels. This
definition includes triplexes, townhouses, apartments, condominiums, hotels,
motels, recreational vehicle parks, and similar uses.
      B.   “Commercial, industrial and institutional” categories include the
entire range of office, manufacturing service, sales, restaurant, day care,
nursery, warehouse, churches, schools, utilities, public service buildings,
parks, hospital, nursing home, rest home, retirement home, and other similar
uses.
      C.   A “measured use residence” is a residential property with impervious
surface totaling more than 5,750 square feet.
   3.   General Policies.
      A.   Multi-Family Residential Use. The total charge for a multi-family
residential use shall be calculated for the entire complex by measurement of
the total impervious surface area, including the garages and common areas. The
total ESUs shall be divided equally among all units if the units have separate
water billings. If the complex is billed under one water billing, the recipient
of that bill shall be deemed the user and receive the total ESU charge for the
complex. “Units” are defined as living units and do not include supporting
uses, such as garages, even though they may be on separate parcels.
      B.   No Limit on Charge for a Measured Use. Flat Rate Residences and
duplexes are not individually measured. All other uses are individually
measured. If a use is a measured use, its charge shall not be limited to one
ESU, even if it is residential.
      C.   Community Facilities. The flat rate category includes typical
residential uses within a parcel or single ownership, as defined above. If a
community or neighborhood recreation center or similar facility exists within a
subdivision, even if associated with the single-family or duplex properties,
that property shall be measured and charged separately to the user of that
property as provided in this chapter.
      D.   Seasonal Impervious Area. Properties which have areas that are
impervious for only a portion of the year shall constitute seasonal impervious
area. For example, a greenhouse that is covered six (6) months, and open with a
pervious floor for six months. If an impervious area is in place for more than
one month per year, it shall be included in the impervious area measurement,
unless exempted under the policy for “Spreading of Runoff to Pervious
Surfaces.”
      E.   Miscellaneous.
         (1)   No credits, exemptions, or reductions shall be given for
impervious surfaces that are submerged for a portion of the year.
         (2)   If impervious areas are so small they cannot be detected on
aerial maps at a scale of 1" = 50', then they shall not be included in the
total impervious area.
         (3)   A flat rate use residence (or a duplex unit) and garage, under
one ownership, shall be charged one ESU (two for a duplex), even if on two
adjacent parcels.
         (4)   Swimming pools (not including the impervious deck around the
swimming pool) are exempted from SWU fees providing the filter drains are
connected to the sanitary sewer system.
         (5)   No waiver shall be given for small impervious areas on a large
pervious property.
   4.   Exclusion from Impervious Surface Measurement.
      A.   Roads.
         (1)   Public roads shall not be included in the measurement of
impervious surface areas.
         (2)   All private roads are to be included in the measurement of
impervious surface areas, except private roads that serve flat rate uses
(single-family, duplex and trailer park properties). Private roads are defined
as all roads and driveways which have not been dedicated to the public and
accepted for public use, and which are defined as an impervious surface under
other City rules.
      B.   Determination of Impervious Surfaces – Roadways. All roadways,
whether dirt, gravel, or paved, shall be considered impervious, and unless a
part of an exempted category of road, or a part of a flat rate use, shall be
included in the impervious area measurement. A “roadway” is defined as an area
intended for the purpose of providing access for motor vehicles. Motor vehicles
shall include automobiles, trucks and tractors if similar or larger in size and
weight to a passenger automobile. Roadways shall include such things as roads,
streets, alleys and driveways.
      C.   Determination of Impervious Surfaces – Parking and Storage Areas.
         (1)   All parking and storage areas, whether dirt, gravel or paved,
shall be deemed impervious. A parking area is defined as an area where motor
vehicles are parked temporarily. This includes such areas as public and private
parking lots (regardless of frequency of use), and storage areas.
         (2)   A dirt or gravel area that is not accessed by motor vehicles, or
is not otherwise highly compacted, shall be considered not impervious. This
includes such uses as landscaping, and gravel or dirt areas accessed only by
foot traffic, or small vehicles, as defined above.
         (3)   A user may submit information for City review showing that the
conditions of Subparagraph (2) above are valid. The City shall review such
information and may perform a site inspection. If, based upon objective,
verifiable information presented, or upon the site inspection performed, the
City may modify the ESUs for the property to conform to the actual impervious
surface. Failure to permit the City to perform a site inspection of the
property shall be grounds to deny an application for review under this
subsection.
      D.   Spreading of Runoff to Pervious Surfaces. Impervious areas shall be
excluded from measurement and charge if the runoff is spread to a pervious area
that does not otherwise receive rainfall. For properties which meet the
criteria of this subsection, all or part of the impervious area may be excluded
from measurement and charge, as appropriate. For such property, the following
criteria shall apply:
         (1)   It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to provide
documentation as required by the City to demonstrate that the criteria are met.
         (2)   The area of impervious area that can be exempted is limited to
the area of the pervious area where the runoff is effectively spread.
         (3)   To qualify, the runoff from an impervious area must not be
concentrated but must remain as “sheet flow,” or be spread so it is in sheet
flow; the runoff must pass through the pervious area before it is collected in
a drain or channel system and carried away; and there cannot be any barriers
such as a concrete foundation preventing the sheet flow runoff from passing
through the impervious area.
      E.   Quarry Property. Permanent roadways, parking areas, and structures
shall be included in the impervious area measurement. The actual excavated area
from which material is being taken, and the temporary service roads in the
excavation area shall be excluded as not being impervious.
   5.   Exemption from SWU Service Charges.
      A.   Users of properties for which all storm water is disposed of on-
site, as defined by City standards, may request an exemption from SWU service
charges. No partial exemptions for disposal of only a portion of the storm and
surface waters on-site, shall be allowed. In order to qualify for a service
charge exemption, the user must design, construct and maintain an on-site
facility that keeps all storm and surface water for the full range of storms
during the year. This applicant for exemption must pay an initial inspection/
review fee. For the purpose of this section, the term “property” means a parcel
of land, or a group of adjacent parcels working in cooperation. The term “on-
site disposal” means on the parcel, or on another parcel in the near vicinity
of the parcel requesting the exemption. In order to qualify for the exemption,
the on-site system must encompass the entire property (except for incidental
impervious areas as defined below), must be completely separated from the
public system, and must provide adequate on-site disposal. Incidental areas
such as sidewalks, decks, and driveway aprons, shall not exceed ten percent
(10%) of the total impervious area. On-site disposal facilities that may
qualify are dry wells, injection wells, retention basins with percolation/
evaporation capacity, and retention basins with capacity large enough to
accommodate the total of all storms through the year. Many of these may have a
possible adverse effect on ground water, and some techniques may require
approval of State, federal and local agencies.
      B.   To qualify, an applicant must submit a request to the City for a
waiver of monthly service charges relating to the property. This request shall
include a certification from an engineer, or other evidence acceptable to the
City, that shows the system is separate and will dispose of the full range and
volume of storm water through the year on-site. The applicant shall also submit
a maintenance plan for assuring the system will function as designed. The
application must be signed by the property owner. An inspection/review fee
shall be paid at the time of application. If the application is denied, the
inspection/review fee will be credited to the service charges due. If the
request for the waiver is made as part of the construction plans, this fee
shall be waived. A decision denying an exemption may be appealed following the
procedures in this chapter. If approved, the waiver will be effective for the
next billing cycle.
      C.   The City retains the right to inspect the on-site measures to assure
they are functioning as designed. If at any time the measures are found to not
be effective, the exemption shall cease.
   6.   Credits for Water Quantity Portion of the SWU.
   New developments that provide on-site retention, disposal, or detention, or
provide off-site conveyance system enlargements are entitled to a credit in SWU
fees. To be eligible, new development, or portions of new development, must
include design and construction of a facility that meets one of the following
standards:
      A.   Retention facility sized to accommodate the full volume of storm
water through the year with no overflow or release into the SWU system.
Eligible facilities shall be exempt from SWU fees.
      B.   A disposal facility which keeps all storm and surface water
separated from the public system, and disposes of it on site for the full range
of storms during the year, including the winter, through on-site disposal (dry
wells, injection wells, percolation/evaporation basins). Eligible facilities
shall be exempt from SWU fees.
      C.   A detention facility which meets or exceeds the standards defined in
City rules for on-site storm water detention facilities. Eligible facilities
shall be entitled to a reduction of one-half of the actual number of ESUs
calculated.
      D.   Upsizing of the downstream conveyance system. Credit shall be
determined by the City on a case-by-case basis.
The term “on-site” means on the parcel, or on another parcel in the near
vicinity of that for which the credit or reduction is requested. To be eligible
for a credit (reduction) of the SWU fees, the request must be submitted prior
to, or as part of, the development process, but in all cases the request must
be made prior to the payment of the SWU fees. To be eligible for a credit, the
request can be made at any time, in accordance with this chapter. The request
shall demonstrate the property meets one of the above conditions. For on-site
facilities, the City reserves the right to inspect the facilities installed at
any time. If it is found that the system no longer functions, then the SWU fees
that were waived will become due and payable.
The rate for the service charge shall be established in accordance with Section
100.04 and in accordance with the procedures set forth in this chapter and is,
on a fiscal year basis, the estimated storm water utility system actual costs,
less other projected revenue, divided by the estimated total number of ESUs
connected to the City storm water utility system. The City may prescribe by
rule further detail regarding determination, calculations, and classification
of impervious surfaces; and for payment of a deposit not to exceed one year’s
estimated storm water utility service charge as a condition of connection of
property to the City’s water system, or for continued maintenance of connection
to the system.
100.07   BILLING.
   1.   The City shall send a bill for the amount due by regular mail to every
user in the City. Mailing to the owner of record as shown in the assessor
records shall satisfy this requirement. The billing period shall be the same as
for water usage.
   2.   The bill date shall state that the recipient has thirty (30) days from
the billing date to file a notice of non-occupancy. The notice shall indicate
the relationship of the recipient to the property (e.g. owner, lessor,
mortgagee), whether on the imposition date the property was occupied, and if
so, by whom.
   3.   Upon receipt of the notice, the City shall determine who is obligated
for payment. Based on this determination, the City shall:
      A.   Issue a new bill to the occupant if the property was occupied by
someone other than the original recipient;
      B.   Reissue the bill to the recipient if it is found that that person
was the occupant;
      C.   Issue a bill to the owner as the user, if the property was not
occupied.
The City may take into account any reasonably reliable information available to
it, including utility or water district records.
   4.   Failure to file the notice such that it is actually received by the
City within the thirty (30) days of the mailing date of the bill shall
conclusively establish that the original addressee was the user on the
imposition date.
   5.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any person may
agree in writing to be responsible for payment of the charge. Upon filing of
such a writing with the City, subsequent bills shall be sent to that person,
and that person shall be deemed to be the user.
   6.   It is a violation of this chapter to knowingly provide false
information to the City regarding any fact related to billing of a storm water
utility service charge or other charge of the City.
100.08   DELINQUENCY, COLLECTION, INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   1.   Charges imposed under this chapter are deemed delinquent when not paid
in full by the due date provided in a billing for the charge.
   2.   It is unlawful and a violation of this chapter for any person to
discharge wastewater into the City’s storm water utility system. It is also
unlawful and a violation of this chapter to maintain a connection to or use the
City’s storm water utility system without paying the appropriate charges and
fees established in this section or any rule adopted pursuant hereto. If no
billing is sent, such charges are deemed delinquent thirty (30) days from the
date services were provided to a user.
   3.   Delinquent charges may be collected pursuant to the same procedure as
with delinquent water bills by the City, with the assistance of City legal
counsel, without further action or authorization by the Council.
   4.   Delinquent charges may be recovered by the City in the same manner as
provided in
Chapter 92.
   5.   In addition to remedies provided for collection of a debt, the City may
seek a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting continued occupancy of
premises, requiring disconnection of the premises from the public storm water
utility system, and termination of water and sewer service to the user’s
premises.
   6.   The Council may prescribe, by resolution and order, a schedule of
interest and penalty charges to be imposed upon delinquent charges.
   7.   In a collection action under this chapter, the City shall be entitled
to its costs and reasonable attorney fees, including at trial and on appeal, if
it is the prevailing party.
   8.   In addition to the right of the City to bring a civil action to collect
any delinquent charges or enforce any provision of the chapter, the City may
take any of the following actions to secure payment:
      A.   The City may refuse to issue any permit to any person who is
delinquent in any payment due under this chapter.
      B.   The City may terminate provision of storm and surface water service
to premises used by the user.
      C.   The City may terminate sanitary sewer service to premises used by
the user.
      D.   The City may terminate water service to the premises used by the
user.
Termination of service pursuant to this subsection shall be according to
procedures adopted under Section
100.09. If the City terminates service as provided in this section, the cost of
such disconnection shall be added to the amount of any other delinquent charges
and shall be recoverable in the same manner as are such charges.
   9.   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to make the owner of property
responsible for the storm utility user charge of a tenant unless the owner
agrees in writing to be so liable; to require any person to pay the charges
incurred by prior occupant or user of property; or to require any person to pay
to reconnect service where that service was terminated due to the delinquency
of the account of a prior occupant or user.
   10.   A lien against property shall exist from the date the bill was last
brought current in the same manner as with a lien for water service. The
provisions of Section
92.08 of this Code of Ordinances shall apply to delinquent storm water utility
bills.
100.09   REQUEST FOR SERVICE; DISCONNECTION FROM SERVICE; TERMINATION OF USER
CHARGES.
   1.   The issuance of a storm water utility system connection permit relating
to impervious surface on a property or parcel shall be deemed to be a specific
request for provision of storm and surface water service to that property.
   2.   Any user of the public storm water utility system may disconnect
property served by the system from service and terminate further user charges
by utilizing the procedure in this section.
   3.   A person desiring to disconnect property from the system shall make
application on a form provided by the City and pay the fee established
therefor. The application shall be signed by the owner of the property; shall
provide evidence of demolition or removal of any impervious surface on the
property, or of installation of an approved on-site storm and surface water
retention or infiltration system serving the property. Such on-site system
shall be designed and operated to retain or dispose of on-site all storm and
surface waters generated by impervious surfaces on the property, through the
full range of storm events prescribed by City rule. The Council may, by rule,
adopt additional criteria and administrative procedures to provide for
disconnection from storm water utility service, and suspension or termination
of user charges.
   4.   Upon receipt of a complete application for disconnection, and
verification of information thereon, and installation of the on-site system or
demolition of impervious area as provided in Subsection 3 of this section, the
City shall issue a permit for disconnection. Whether performed by the City or
other person, the City shall inspect the disconnection.
   5.   The City may inspect the on-site system at any time. If at any time the
system fails to perform to the standard specified in subsection 3 above, the
City shall notify the owner to correct the system. If the system is not
corrected to meet on-site retention or infiltration standards within thirty
(30) days of such notice, the City may treat such deficiency as a reconnection
to the storm water utility system and as a specific request for storm water
utility service. Service fees shall then relate back to the earliest date on
which the system failed to meet applicable performance standards for on-site
retention or disposal.
100.10   ADOPTION OF RULES; INTERPRETATIONS AND APPEALS.
   1.   Adoption of Rules.
      A.   The Council may, by resolution and order, promulgate rules
pertaining to matters within the scope of this chapter.
      B.   Any rule adopted pursuant to this section shall require a public
hearing. Not less than four (4) or more than twenty (20) days before such
hearing, public notice of such hearing shall be given by publication in a
newspaper of general circulation within the City. Such notice shall include the
place, time and purpose of the hearing and the location at which copies of the
full text of the proposed rules may be obtained.
      C.   At the public hearing, the Council shall hear testimony concerning
the proposed rules. At the conclusion of the public hearing, the Council shall
either adopt the proposal, modify or reject it. If a modification is made, an
additional public hearing shall be held but no additional notice shall be
required if such additional hearing is announced at the meeting at which the
modification is made. All rules shall be effective upon adoption by the Council
and shall be filed in the office of the City.
      D.   Notwithstanding paragraphs B and C of this subsection, a rule maybe
adopted without prior notice upon a finding that failure of the Council to act
promptly will result in serious prejudice to the public interest or the
interest of the affected parties, including the specific reasons for such
prejudice. Any rule adopted pursuant to this subsection shall be effective for
a period of not longer than one hundred eighty (180) days.
   2.   Appeals. The following may be appealed to the City Council:
      A.   A determination that the person is obligated to pay the service
charge imposed herein.
      B.   A dispute as to the proper calculation of the amount due from the
person. This does not include, however, an objection to the overall
establishment of the storm water utility charge or the amount per ESU
established by the Council or the establishment of classes of impervious
surface area pursuant to this chapter.
      C.   A discretionary decision implementing a rule adopted by the Council
if an appeal is provided in the Order adopting the rule.
   3.   The appeal shall be filed in writing and must be actually received by
the City no later than the thirtieth (30th) day after the action appealed. The
30 days shall be calculated from the due date of the original or reissued bill
in response to a notice of non-occupancy, whichever is later.
   4.   The appeal shall be heard by the Council in an informal proceeding. The
appellant shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to submit written and oral
support for the appellant’s position. The Council shall issue a written
decision within 30 days of the proceeding. The written decision of the Council
may be appealed to the District Court of Hancock County by writ of review.
Failure to properly exhaust the administrative remedy provided for herein shall
constitute a bar to judicial relief.

the Company in the erection or maintenance of the transmission system.
112.03   RELOCATION.
   Except as provided herein below, the Company shall, at its cost and expense,

require for the purposes of facilitating the construction, reconstruction,
maintenance or repair of the street or alley or any public improvement of, in
or about any such street or alley or reasonably promoting the efficient
operation of any such improvement. If the City orders or requests the Company
to relocate its facilities for the primary benefit of a commercial or private
project, or as the result of the initial request of a commercial or private
developer or other non-public entity, the Company shall receive payment for the
cost of such relocation as a precondition to relocating its facilities. The
City shall consider reasonable alternatives in designing its public works
projects so as not arbitrarily to cause the Company unreasonable additional
expense in exercising its authority under this section. The City shall also
provide a reasonable alternate location for the Company’s facilities. The City
shall give the Company reasonable advance written notice to vacate a public

grounds. In addition, the Company is authorized to remove, cut, trim, destroy,
or otherwise control any tree, located adjacent to any street, alley, right-of-
way, or public grounds that, in the sole and absolute judgment of the Company
may interfere with the safe maintenance, operation, or use of its facilities or

management shall be completed in accordance with the most current nationally
accepted safety and utility industry standards, as revised and updated from
time to time.

   The City may request estimates for the undergrounding of replacement lines,
upgrades or new lines, including lines to be adjusted for road moves or for
other specific projects. When requested, the Company will provide to the City
two estimates: i) An estimate for the cost of the project with overhead
construction and ii) An estimate for the cost of the project with underground
construction. The City will have no more than 60 days from the estimate date to
determine if it wants the line built overhead or placed underground. If the
City chooses underground construction for such project, the City will be
responsible for the incremental cost of undergrounding, if and to the extent,
such costs are not already part of or included in a precondition payment for
relocation pursuant to Section
112.03. The incremental cost of undergrounding is defined as the differential
between the estimate for underground construction and the estimate for overhead
construction. Upon receipt of the City’s payment for the incremental cost of
undergrounding, the Company will install the underground facilities. The
Company reserves the right to bill City for the amount that the incremental
cost associated with installation exceeds its estimate. The City reserves the
right to a refund of overpayment if the incremental costs are less than the
amount billed in the estimate. If the City wishes to have a line not scheduled
for replacement or upgrade placed underground, the City shall contact the
Company to make such a request. The City shall cover all costs related to his
work. If undergrounding of transmission lines requires entities interconnecting
with the Company to make adjustments to their electrical systems, the City
bears the responsibility of communication with those entities and, if it
chooses, the cost of converting their facilities from overhead to underground.
The Company reserves the right to review all of the City’s communications with
the affected entities.
112.09   TERM OF AGREEMENT.  
   The term of the franchise granted by this chapter and the rights
granted thereunder shall continue for the period of 25 years from and after its acceptance by

otherwise becomes effective by operation of law.
112.10   FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS.
   The City agrees it will not permit any real estate developments or land uses
in the City that would cause the Company’s Facilities to violate the setback or
safety requirements of the National Electric Safety Code or any law, regulation
or chapter of the State of Iowa, Hancock County or the City.
112.11   ENTIRE AGREEMENT.
   This chapter sets forth and constitutes the entire agreement between the
Company and the City with respect to the rights contained herein, and may not
be superseded, modified or otherwise amended without the approval and
acceptance of the Company. Upon acceptance by the Company, this Chapter shall
supersede, abrogate, and repeal any prior electric system chapter between the

place any limitations, either operationally.

115.01   PURPOSE AND RULE OF INTERPRETATION.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish uniform rules and controls to
ensure public safety and provide efficient delivery of services by the City and
others wishing to utilize streets and other public property for the delivery of
utility or other services, in order to protect public and private investment,
ensure orderly use of public property and ensure the health, safety and welfare
of the population, to provide for the regulation and administration of the
public streets and other public property and secure the rights of the City to a
return on its investment in public property. This chapter is to be interpreted
in light of these findings for the benefit of the public and users of the
streets and other public property.
115.02   FRANCHISE, LICENSE OR EASEMENT REQUIRED.
   No person or other entity shall use the public right-of-way or other public
property without first obtaining a franchise, license or easement from the
City. The City shall not enter into or issue any franchise, license or easement
that grants exclusive rights.
115.03   FEES REQUIRED.
   No franchise, license or easement for the use of public right-of-way or
other public property shall be granted without requiring the grantee thereof to
pay a reasonable and competitively neutral fee for the use of public right-of-
way or other public property.
115.04   LIMIT ON TERM.
   No franchise, license or easement for use of the public right-of-way or
other public property shall be granted for a term of more than twenty-five (25)
years.
115.05   PLACEMENT OF FACILITIES.
   The facilities, fixtures and equipment of the distribution, transmission or
sale of any utility services, or services provided under license or easement,
shall be placed and maintained so as not to unnecessarily or unreasonably
interfere with the travel on the streets, highways, avenues, alleys, bridges
and public places in the City, nor shall such facilities, fixtures and
equipment unnecessarily or unreasonably interfere with the proper use of the
same, including, but not limited to, ordinary drainage, or the functioning of
the sewers, underground pipe or other property of the City. In the event that
facilities, fixtures and equipment of any person or other entity located within
a public right-of-way must be relocated because of paving, road construction or
road reconstruction, sewer construction or sewer reconstruction or the
construction or reconstruction of public drainage systems or similar public
works or the construction or reconstruction of the facilities of any City-owned
utility, such relocation, at the written request of the City, shall be
completed by the owner of such facilities at the owner’s cost. The City shall
upon request of any person or other entity holding a franchise, license or
easement, review any plans for the construction of facilities, fixtures and
equipment within the public right-of-way and advise the person or other entity
of any conflict such construction may have with planned or anticipated public
improvements, but failure of the City to so advise such person or other entity
will not relieve the owner of such facilities of its obligations under this
chapter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City engineer may require placement
of equipment or facilities belonging to any holder of a franchise, license or
easement be limited to locations designated by the Council if such limitation
is deemed by the engineer to be necessary to protect the integrity of use of
present and future users of the public right-of-way or other public property.
115.06   INDEMNIFICATION.
   The holder of any franchise, license or easement shall indemnify and hold
the City harmless at all times during the term of the franchise, license or
easement from and against all claims for injury or damage to any person or
property caused by the construction, erection, operation or maintenance of its
facilities, fixtures or equipment, or the negligence of its contractors or its
employees. In case of any suit or action at law being commenced against the
City, upon any claim for damage arising out of any loss, injury or damage
claimed to have been caused by any installation, improvement, obstruction or
excavation in any street, alley, sidewalk or public place in the City, and
which installation, improvement, obstruction or excavation was made or left in,
under or upon such street, sidewalk, alley or public place by the holder of a
franchise, license or easement, its agents, contractors or employees, upon
being notified in writing by the City of such action or proceeding, the holder
of said franchise, license or easement shall appear and make proper defense
thereto at the expense of the holder of the franchise, license or easement; and
if any judgment or decree shall in any such case be rendered against the City
therein, the holder of said franchise, license or easement shall assume, pay
and satisfy such judgment or decree, with the cost thereof.
115.07   REGULATION BY THE CITY.
   The City reserves the right to make reasonable general regulations for the
use of streets and other public property which unless otherwise specifically
provided shall apply to any holder of a franchise, license or easement.
115.08   CONSTRUCTION AND EXCAVATION BY HOLDERS.
   A written permit will be obtained from the City engineer whenever it becomes
necessary for the holder of any franchise, license or easement to excavate in
streets or public grounds of the City. Such permits shall state a particular
part or point of the street where the excavation is to be made and the length
of time in which such permit shall authorize the work to be done. An exception
to a requirement for a permit shall be made in cases of emergency involving
public safety, in which case a permit will be obtained at the earliest
opportunity after the work has started. In making excavations in the streets,
the holder of any franchise, license or easement shall proceed with such work
as to cause the least possible inconvenience to the public. The holder of any
franchise, license or easement shall properly protect, according to safety
standards generally accepted at the time of placement as may be determined from
time to time by the City engineer, all excavations and obstructions by proper
placement of shoring, surface plates, barricades, warning lights and such other
or additional devices as circumstances may warrant. If in the opinion of the
City engineer such excavation or obstruction is not properly and safely
protected, the engineer shall notify such holder of a franchise, license or
easement, who shall immediately comply with such reasonable instructions.
Immediately after use, any trenches for excavations which the holder of a
franchise, license or easement has opened shall be filled. However, no trench
or excavation in the streets shall be filled or covered without giving the City
the right to inspect the same. All backfilling in streets will be according to
City specifications. Temporary street surfacing will be placed in such
excavations as soon as the same has been backfilled. Pavements, sidewalks,
curbs and gutters or other portions of streets and public places opened,
disturbed or damaged shall be promptly restored and replaced with like
materials at the expense of the holder of a franchise, license or easement and
left in as good condition as before the opening, disturbance or damage

as may be needed to properly repair such pavements, sidewalks, curbs and
gutters or other portions of streets and public places and the cost thereof
shall be repaired to the City by the holder of the franchise, license or

conduit, water main service or water connection, sewer or other City-owned
public works or City-owned utility, it shall be the duty of the holder of any
franchise, license or easement, when so ordered by the City, to relocate its
service lines and other property in the streets or other public places at its
own expense so as to conform to the established grade or line of such street or
public place and so as not to interfere with the public improvements so
constructed or reconstructed. In the case of other public improvements,
including but not limited to urban renewal projects, the City may require the
holder of a franchise, license or easement to relocate its poles, service lines
and appurtenances in the streets at the owner’s expense. The City may at its
discretion assign personnel for inspection of excavation and related work being
performed by the holder of a franchise, license or easement. Should the holder
of the franchise, license or easement fail or refuse to do and perform the
things provided in this chapter, the City may, after reasonable notice, perform
the work and charge the expense thereof to the holder of the franchise, license
or lease and the holder of the franchise, license or easement shall promptly
pay said charges.
115.10   DESIGN NOTICE TO CITY.
   The holder of a franchise, license or easement shall promptly, upon request,

additions or deletions to the distribution system. Prior to any excavation by
the City or its agents, a representative must contact the holder of any
franchise, license or easement regarding current information on the location of
underground lines or facilities in the area concerned. The obligation to
contact the holder of a franchise, license or easement under this section shall
be satisfied if contact is made with the corporation organized pursuant to Code
of Iowa Chapter 480 or an entity with a similar function utilized by both the
City and the Company, currently the Iowa One Call System.
115.11   ASSIGNMENT.
   No sale, assignment or lease of any franchise, license or easement of the
use of the public right-of-way or other public property shall be effective
until it is approved by the Council and until the holder thereof has filed in
the office of the Clerk written notice of the proposed sale, transfer,
disposition or assignment, such notice to clearly summarize the proposed
procedure and the terms and conditions thereof. Such approval by the City shall
not be unreasonably withheld. The proposed vendee, assignee or lessee shall
similarly file an instrument, duly executed, reciting such proposal, accepting
the terms of the franchise, license or lease and agreeing to perform all of the
conditions thereof.
115.12   FORFEITURE.
   The violation of any material portion of a franchise, license or easement by
the holder thereof or its successors or assigns or its failure promptly to
perform any of the provisions of this chapter shall be cause for forfeiture of
said franchise, license or easement and the termination of all rights
thereunder. Such forfeiture shall be accomplished by ordinance of the City
after written notice to the holder thereof and a continuation of the violation,
failure or default specified on the notice for at least thirty (30) days from
the date the notice was served.
115.13   APPLICATION.
   This chapter shall apply to all franchises, licenses and easements granted
by the City, including all existing franchises, licenses and easements.
115.14   HOME RULE.
   This chapter is intended to be and shall be construed as consistent with the
reservation of local authority contained in the 25th Amendment to the Iowa
Constitution granting cities Home Rule powers. To such end, any limitation on
the power of the City contained herein is to be strictly construed and the City
reserves to itself the right to exercise all power and authority to regulate
and control its local affairs and all ordinances and regulations of the City
shall be enforceable against the holder of any franchise, license or easement.
115.15   NEW TECHNOLOGIES.
   Should, within the term of any franchise, license or easement, developments
within the field for which the grant was made offer to the holder thereof the
opportunity to effectively, efficiently and economically serve its customers
through use of a substance or material other than those for which the grant was
originally made, then the holder of the franchise, license or easement may
petition the Council, which, with such requirements or limitation as it deems
necessary to protect public health, safety and welfare, may allow the use of
such substances under the terms and conditions of the franchise, license or
easement.

year design storm shall be limited to the storm water runoff rate for the site
in the pre-developed condition based on a five year design storm. The discharge
rate shall be controlled at the detention/retention facilities outlet and NOT
by the size of the storm sewer pipe serving the site. Retention facilities may
be used in lieu of detention facilities with approval from the building
official.
   2.   A safe overflow path shall be designed for storms exceeding the
capacity of the detention/retention basin.
   3.   Regional storm water management facilities are encouraged.
   4.   For new residential developments, storm water detention is not allowed

management plan, all of which is to be submitted to the City Administrator for
review. The storm water management plan, including proposed storm water
detention or retention facilities, shall be reviewed and approved by the City
Administrator (or those chosen by the Administrator) prior to the issuance of
any building permit for the proposed development. The City may inspect the site
at any time to determine compliance with this chapter. Upon determination that
a site is not in compliance with this chapter, the City may issue a stop work
order until compliance is achieved. The order shall describe the problem,
specify a completion date, and indicate the penalties to be assessed for
further noncompliance.
147.07   OWNERSHIP BY CITY.
   Regional storm water management facilities which are of sufficient size may
be deeded to the City to be maintained by the City. The conditions for City
ownership will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The City is under no

160.02   STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
   1.   The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 364, Code of Iowa,
as amended, delegated the power to cities to exercise any power and perform any
function it deems appropriate to protect and preserve the rights, privileges
and property of the City or of its residents, and to preserve and improve the
peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort and convenience of its residents.
   2.   Findings of Fact.
      A.   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of
the community.
      B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by: (i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
   3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Paragraph 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
      A.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
      B.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
      C.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
      D.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   1.   Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter shall
apply to all lands and development having special flood hazards within the
jurisdiction of the City. For the purpose of this chapter, the special flood
hazard areas are those areas designated as Zone A on the Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM) for Hancock County and Incorporated Areas, City of Garner, Panels
19081C0326D. 0327D, 0328D, and 0329D, dated April 4, 2018, which is hereby
adopted and made a part of this chapter. The Flood Insurance Study for Hancock
County is hereby adopted by reference and is made a part of this chapter for
the purpose of administering floodplain management regulations.
   2.   Rules for Interpretation of Flood Hazard Boundaries. The boundaries of
the Special Flood Hazard areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the
official Flood Insurance Rate Map. When an interpretation is needed as to the
exact location of a boundary, the Zoning Administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation. The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals
when it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the Zoning Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
   3.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no
structure shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without
full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
   4.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
   5.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
   6.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated special flood hazard areas will be
free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on
the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
   7.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.
160.04   ADMINISTRATION.

         (8)   Such other information as the Administrator deems reasonably
necessary (e.g., drawings or a site plan) for the purpose of this chapter.
      C.   Action on Permit Application. The Administrator shall, within a
reasonable time, make a determination as to whether the proposed floodplain
development meets the applicable standards of this chapter and shall approve or
disapprove the application. For disapprovals, the applicant shall be informed,
in writing, of the specific reasons therefor. The Administrator shall not issue
permits for variances except as directed by the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
      D.   Construction and Use to Be as Provided in Application and Plans.
Floodplain Development Permits based on the basis of approved plans and
applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in
such approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement or
construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. The applicant shall be
required to submit certification by a professional engineer or land surveyor,
as appropriate, registered in the State of Iowa, that the finished fill,
structure floor elevations, floodproofing, or other flood protection measures
were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to
the use or occupancy of any structure.
160.05   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT STANDARDS.
   All development must be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage
and meet the following applicable performance standards. Where base flood
elevations have not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to determine: (i) whether
the land involved is either wholly or partly within the floodway or floodway
fringe; and (ii) the base flood elevation. The applicant will be responsible
for providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical
information to make such determination. Review by the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources is not required for the proposed construction of new or
replacement bridges or culverts where: (i) the bridge or culvert is located on
a stream that drains less than two square miles; and (ii) the bridge or culvert
is not associated with a channel modification that constitutes a channel change
as specified in 567 IAC 71.2(2).
   1.   All Development. All development within the special flood hazard areas
shall:
      A.   Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement.
      B.   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
      C.   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
      D.   Obtain all other necessary permits from federal, State and local
governmental agencies including approval when required from the Iowa Department
of Natural Resources.
   2.   Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the base flood elevations. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
base flood elevations and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed subject to favorable
consideration by the City Council, where existing topography, street grades, or
other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods used must
be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various forces
and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential structures located in
areas that would become isolated due to flooding of surrounding ground shall be
provided with a means of access that will be passable by wheeled vehicles
during the base flood. However, this criterion shall not apply where the
Administrator determines there is sufficient flood warning time for the
protection of life and property. When estimating flood warning time,
consideration shall be given to the criteria listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa
Administrative Code.
   3.   Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be flood proofed to such a level. When
floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State of
Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and
other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the
base flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
   4.   All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
      A.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
         (1)   A minimum of two openings, with positioning on at least two
walls, having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.

above grade.
         (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access and
low damage potential storage.
      B.   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
      C.   New and substantially improved structures must be constructed with
electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and
other service facilities elevated or flood proofed to a minimum of one foot
above the base flood elevation.
   5.   Factory-Built Homes.
      A.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the structure
is a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation.
      B.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame
ties to ground anchors. Anchorage systems may include, but are not limited to,
use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors as required by the State
Building Code.
   6.   Utility and Sanitary Systems.
      A.   On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located or
designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
      B.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system as well as
the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment facilities
(other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood protection
equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood elevation.
      C.   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water
supply treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with
a level of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood
elevation.
      D.   Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
   7.   Storage of Materials and Equipment. Storage of equipment and materials
that are flammable, explosive, or injurious to human, animal or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or:
(i) not subject to major flood damage and be anchored to prevent movement due
to flood waters; or (ii) readily removable from the area within the time
available after flood warning.
   8.   Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as
levees, flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the base
flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for
adequate interior drainage. In addition, structural flood control works shall
be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
   9.   Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must be
designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations must be
approved by the Department of Natural Resources.

subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the base flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50 lots
(whichever is less) shall include base flood elevation data for those areas
located within the Special Flood Hazard Area.
   11.   Accessory Structures to Residential Uses. Detached garages, sheds, and
similar structures that are incidental to a residential use are exempt from the
base flood elevation requirements where the following criteria are satisfied.
      A.   The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage potential.
Its size shall not exceed 600 square feet in size. Those portions of the
structure located less than one foot above the BFE must be constructed of
flood-resistant materials.
      B.   The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage potential
purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure shall not
be used for human habitation.
      C.   The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building site
so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
      D.   The structure shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement.
      E.   The structure’s service facilities such as electrical and heating
equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above the base
flood elevation.
      F.   The structure’s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of Subsection 4(A) of this section.
Exemption from the base flood elevation requirements for such a structure may
result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of the structure
and its contents.
   12.   Recreational Vehicles.
      A.   Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of Subsection
5 of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built homes when
the following criteria are satisfied.
         (1)   The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less
than 180 consecutive days; and
         (2)   The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
      B.   Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than 180
consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements of
Subsection 5 of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built
homes.
   13.   Pipeline Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be
buried in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to
prevent rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
   14.   Maximum Damage Potential Development. All new or substantially
improved maximum damage potential development shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated a minimum of one foot above the elevation of the
500-year flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be
floodproofed to such a level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional
engineer registered in the State of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing
methods used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities,
impact and uplift forces and other factors associated with the base flood; and
that the structure, below the base flood elevation is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water. A record of the
certification indicating the specific elevation (in relation to North American
Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are flood proofed shall be
maintained by the Administrator. Where 0.2% chance flood elevation data has not
been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The applicant will be
responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient
technical information to make such determinations.
160.06   ESTABLISHMENT OF VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   1.   The Zoning Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in specific
cases such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary
hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.
      A.   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
      B.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
      C.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      D.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for structures than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance
coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
      E.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
   2.   Factors upon Which the Decision of the Zoning Board of Adjustment Shall
Be Based. In passing upon applications for variances, the Zoning Board of
Adjustment shall consider all relevant factors specified in other sections of
this chapter and:
      A.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
      B.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
      C.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
      D.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      E.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the City.
      F.   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
      G.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
      H.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
      I.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for the area.
      J.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      K.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood water expected at the site.
      L.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
      M.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
chapter.
   3.   Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the Zoning Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this
chapter. Such conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
      A.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
      B.   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
      C.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
      D.   Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this chapter.
      E.   Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the flood
protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration, rate
of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated with
the regulatory flood. The Council shall require that the applicant submit a
plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
160.07   NONCONFORMING USES.
   1.   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful
before the passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but
which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be
continued subject to the following conditions:
      A.   If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any future
use of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
      B.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
   2.   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless
it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary, building or safety codes or regulations or the
cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
designation.
160.08   PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
   Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any
of the requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates
this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon
conviction thereof be fined not more than $500.00 or imprisoned for not more
than 30 days. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City from taking such
other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy violation.
160.09   AMENDMENTS.
   The regulations and standards set forth in this chapter may from time to
time be amended, supplemented, changed, or repealed. No amendment, supplement,
change, or modification shall be undertaken without prior approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.

as sidewalks, driveways, retaining walls less than four feet high, ornamental
yard features, play structures, play houses under 16 square feet, dog houses

permit shall be in writing and delivered to the Zoning Administrator and shall
be accompanied by a detailed site plan. Said application shall be on forms
prescribed by the Zoning Administrator.

165.05   BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
   1.   Creation and Membership. A Board of Adjustment, to be hereinafter
referred to as the Board, is established. The Board shall consist of five (5)
members appointed by the Mayor, subject to the approval of the Council. Terms
shall be for five (5) years and vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired
terms of any member whose office becomes vacant. Members shall be removable for
cause by the appointing authority upon written charges and after public
hearing. All members of the Board shall serve without compensation. The Board,
subject to the approval of the Council, may employ such clerical and technical
assistance as may be needed to carry on its work. The Board shall adopt its own
rules of procedure, not in conflict with this chapter or the Code of Iowa, to
enable it to perform its functions and duties. The Board shall elect its own
Chairperson, who shall serve for one year. Such Chairperson, or in the
Chairperson’s absence, the acting Chairperson, may administer oaths and compel
the attendance of witnesses. Meetings of the Board shall be held at the call of
the Chairperson and at such other times as the Board may determine. All
meetings of the Board shall be open to the public. The Clerk, or such other
City employee as the Board may designate, shall serve as the Secretary of the
Board. In the absence of the Secretary, the Chairperson of the Board may
appoint one of the members of the Board to act as Secretary Pro Tem for the
meeting. The Board shall have the power to call on any City department for
assistance in the performance of its duties, and it shall be the duty of such
department to render such assistance as may reasonably be required. The Board
shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each member upon each
question or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact and shall keep
records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be
immediately filed in the office of the Board.
   2.   Appeals to the Board. Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person
aggrieved or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the City affected
by any decision of the administrative officer. Such appeal shall be taken
within a reasonable time as provided by the rules of the Board by filing, with
the officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the Board, a notice of
appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The administrative officer shall
forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the record upon
which the action appealed from was taken.
      A.   Each appeal shall be accompanied by a fee as set by resolution of
the Council to be paid by the appellant to the Clerk. In addition, the
appellant shall have a signed consent to the variance by the neighboring
property owner(s) who is affected by the requested variance.
      B.   The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal,
give public notice thereof, and decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon
the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney.
      C.   An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the administrative officer certifies to the Board, after
the notice of appeal shall have been filed with such officer, that by reason of
facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in the officer’s opinion, cause
imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be
stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board
or by a court of record on application or notice to the administrative officer
and on due cause shown.
      D.   The Council shall review variances granted by the Board of
Adjustment before their effective date and the Council may remand a decision to
grant variance to the Board of Adjustment for further study. The effective date
of the variance is thirty (30) days from the date of the remand.
      E.   Variances from setbacks for side, rear, and front yards shall be
granted by the Board of Adjustment upon the condition that the lot lines will
be established by a registered surveyor. The survey pins on the lot lines will
be “flagged” by the surveyor. The Zoning Administrator, or designee, will be
contacted by the surveyor to inspect where the property pins and flags are
located. Such person shall also contact the two property owners to make sure
they are both in agreement with the location of the property pins. The surveyor
only needs to locate the pins on the affected property lines where the Board of
Adjustment has granted a variance. In the event the property owners do not
agree to the lot line, the applying property owner will be required to obtain a
formal survey.
   3.   Jurisdiction. The Board shall have the following powers:
      A.   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any
order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the administrative
officer in the enforcement of this chapter or any ordinance adopted pursuant
thereto.
      B.   To hear and decide special exceptions.
      C.   To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the
terms of these zoning regulations as will not be contrary to the public
interest, where owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the
spirit of these zoning regulations shall be observed and substantial justice
done. The Board may require any appropriate conditions and stipulations as they
deem necessary to assure that the preceding requirements will be fully complied
with. Such conditions and stipulations attached to the approval shall be
complied with, and a violation of these conditions shall be considered the same
as any violation of the other provisions of this chapter.
In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the Board may, in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify
the order, requirements, decision, or determination appealed from and may make
such order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be made, and to
that end shall have all powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.
The concurring vote of three (3) members of the Board shall be necessary to
reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of the
administrative officer or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter
which is required to pass under this chapter or to affect any variation in this
chapter.
   4.   Appeal from Decision of Board. Any person or persons, jointly or
severally, aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Adjustment under the
provisions of this chapter, or any taxpayer or any officer, department, board,
or bureau of the municipality, may present to a court of record a petition,
duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in
part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be
presented to the court within thirty (30) days after the filing of the decision
in the office of the Board.
165.06   AMENDMENTS.
   The regulations, restrictions, and boundaries may, from time to time, be
amended, supplemented, changed, modified, or repealed, provided that at least
seven (7) days’ notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published
in a paper of general circulation in the City. In no case shall the notice be
published more than twenty (20) days prior to the hearing. Notwithstanding
Section 414.2 of the Code of Iowa, as a part of an ordinance changing land from
one zoning district to another zoning district or an ordinance approving a site
development plan, the Council may impose conditions on a property owner which
are in addition to existing regulations if the additional conditions have been
agreed to in writing by the property owner before the public hearing required
under this section or any adjournment of the hearing. The conditions must be
reasonable and imposed to satisfy public needs which are directly caused by the
requested change. In case, however, of a written protest against a change or
repeal which is filed with the Clerk and signed by the owners of 20 percent or
more of the area of the lots included in the proposed change or repeal, or by
the owners of 20 percent or more of the property which is located within 200
feet of the exterior boundaries of the property for which the change or repeal
is proposed, the change or repeal shall not become effective except by the
favorable vote of at least three-fourths of all the members of the Council. The
protest, if filed, must be filed before or at the public hearing. Proposed
amendments not recommended by the Commission shall become effective only upon a
favorable vote of three-fourths of the members of the Council. All zoning
amendment application forms shall be approved by resolution of the Council.
165.07   BUILDING PERMIT REQUIRED.

is not dangerous to life.
165.08   VIOLATION; PENALTY.
   Any person, whether acting directly or through employees or agents, that

in an area regulated by airport height zoning, any lower height requirement of
that airport zoning regulation shall prevail.
165.31   STRUCTURES CONSIDERED PART OF BUILDING.
   Any portion of a building which is covered by a roof and any structure
attached to the building shall be considered as part of the building for
purposes of determining yard and height requirements of this chapter.

165.33   NONCONFORMING USES.

existing at the time of the adoption of these zoning regulations may be
continued, even though such use does not conform with the provisions hereof.
Such use may be extended throughout the building, provided no structural
alterations except those required by law or ordinance are made therein. If no
structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a building may be
changed to another nonconforming use of the same or more restricted
classification. If a nonconforming building is removed, the future use of such
premises shall be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. When a
nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use or to a more restricted
nonconforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less
restricted use. If, by amendment to this chapter, any property is hereafter
zoned to a more restrictive district by a change in district boundaries or the
regulations and restrictions in any district are made more restrictive or of a
higher classification, the provisions of this chapter relating to the
nonconforming use of buildings or land existing at the time of the enactment of
the ordinance codified in this chapter shall apply to buildings or land
occupied or used at the time of the passage of such amendment. No nonconforming
building which has been damaged by fire, explosion, act of God, or the public
enemy to the extent of more than 65 percent of its value shall be restored
until a permit is secured from the Board of Adjustment.
165.34   PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   “Planned unit development” means an area of land to be developed as a single

which may not conform to the lot size, bulk, or type of building, density, lot
coverage, required open space, or other requirements in any district
established by this chapter. Exceptions to provisions found in this chapter are
hereby made for planned unit developments. Planned unit development, for
purposes of this chapter, shall be considered a type of subdivision and will
require approval as delineated in the City’s subdivision regulations.

and such other persons as necessary to review the plat and within two (2) weeks
shall submit the plat for consideration by the Commission.
   3.   The Commission shall examine the plat and the report of the City
Engineer and such other information as it deems necessary or desirable to
ascertain whether the plat conforms to the ordinances of the City, to the
comprehensive plan, and other duly adopted plans of the City. The Commission
shall, within forty-five (45) days of the filing of the plat with the Clerk,

the report of the Commission, and such other information as it deems necessary
or desirable. Upon such examination, the Council shall ascertain whether the
plat conforms to the ordinances and standards of the City, conforms to the
comprehensive plan and other duly adopted plans of the City, and will be
conducive to the orderly growth and development of the City in order to protect
the public health, safety and welfare. Following such examination, the Council
may approve, approve subject to conditions, or disapprove the plat. If the
decision of the Council is to disapprove the plat or to approve the plat
subject to conditions, the reasons therefor shall be set forth in writing in
the official records of the Council, and such decisions shall be provided to
the applicant. Action on the preliminary plat by the Council shall be taken
within sixty (60) days of the filing of the plat with the Clerk, unless such
time period is extended by agreement between the subdivider and the City.
   5.   The approval of a preliminary plat by the Council shall be valid for a
period of one year from the date of such approval, after which such approval
shall be void. The subdivider shall take no action requiring the precedent
approval of a preliminary plat except upon application for and approval of an
extension of such period of validity by the Council.
   6.   The approval of the preliminary plat shall constitute authorization by
the Council for the installation of improvements as required by this chapter

constructed or installed until and unless the plans, profiles, cross sections
and specifications for the construction of such improvement have been submitted
to and approved in writing by the City Engineer.
   7.   Before the Council will approve the final plat, all of the foregoing
improvements shall be constructed and accepted by formal resolution of the
Council. Before passage of said resolution of acceptance, the City Engineer
shall report that said improvements meet all City specifications and ordinances
or other City requirements and the agreements between the subdivider and the
City.
   8.   In lieu of the requirements that improvements be completed prior to the
approval of a final plat, the subdivider may post a performance bond with the
City guaranteeing that improvements not completed shall be completed within a
period of two years from the date of approval of such final plat, unless
extended by Council approval, but such approval of the plat shall not
constitute final acceptance of any improvements to be constructed. Improvements
will be accepted only after their construction has been completed.
166.06   PRELIMINARY PLAT REQUIREMENTS.

   16.   The following shall be attached to and accompany any final plat:
      A.   A statement by the proprietors and their spouses, if any, that the
plat is prepared with their free consent and in accordance with their desire,
signed and acknowledged before an officer authorized to take the
acknowledgments of deeds. The statement by the proprietors may also include a
dedication to the public of all lands within the plat that are designated for
streets, alleys, parks, open areas, school property, or other public use, if
the dedication is approved by the Council;
      B.   A statement from the mortgage holders or lienholders, if any, that
the plat is prepared with their free consent and in accordance with their

improvements to meet City standards and the assessment of all costs of the
property owners in the event of annexation and dedication and acceptance shall
be required.
166.09   STANDARDS.
   1.   Acreage Subdivisions. Where the parcel of land is subdivided into
larger tracts than ordinarily used for building lots, such parcel shall be
divided so as to allow for the opening of streets and the ultimate extension of
adjacent streets. Easements providing for the future opening and extension of
such streets may, at the discretion of the Council, be made a requirement of
the plat.
   2.   Relation to Existing Streets. New subdivisions shall make provisions
for the continuation of the principal existing streets in adjoining areas (or
their proper projection where adjoining property is not subdivided) insofar
they may be necessary for the public requirements.
   3.   Streets. The street layout shall be in conformity with a plan for the
most favorable development of the entire neighboring area, and proposed streets
shall be adjusted to the contour of the land so as to produce usable lots and
street of reasonable gradient. If a railroad is involved, the subdivision plan
should be laid out such that the distance between any street and the railroad
will provide lots of sufficient depth to allow for a buffer strip between the
residence and the railroad unless it is a minimum of one hundred (100) feet
between the railroad right-of-way line and the street right-of-way line.
   4.   Minimum Street and Alley Widths. The minimum width of a street shall be
66 feet and the minimum alley width shall be 20 feet. When a street is
considered by the Council to be a major traffic carrier, the minimum street
width may be required to be up to twice the required roadway width, as
determined by the Council. Cul-de-sac streets shall be permitted where
topographical or geographical features preclude continuation of streets.
Whenever a cul-de-sac is permitted, a turnaround having a street property line
diameter of at least 100 feet and the minimum paved turnaround shall be 80
feet. The property line at the intersection of the turnaround and the leading
portion of the street shall be rounded at a radius of not less than 50 feet. A
turnaround diameter greater than 100 feet may be required by the Council in the
case of commercial or industrial subdivision.
   5.   Minimum Roadway Width. The minimum roadway width shall be 28 feet and
the minimum roadway width for alleys shall be 18 feet.
   6.   Street Grades. Street grades shall be so arranged that grades shall not
exceed ten percent. Gutter grades shall not be less than 0.4 percent. All
changes in street grades shall be connected by a vertical curve of reasonable
length to assure adequate visibility. However, on streets which have minimum
grade, no vertical curve shall be used. In approaching intersections, there
shall be suitable leveling of the street at a grade generally not to exceed one
percent and for a distance of generally not less than 50 feet from the nearest
line of the intersecting street. The grade within the intersection should be as
level as possible permitting drainage. The Council may permit variance from
these grades where it deems modification advisable to adjust to topographic
situations.
   7.   Intersections. Street curb intersections shall be rounded by a radii of
at least 20 feet. Streets should be laid out to intersect at right angles, and
may be curved approaching the intersection in order to bring this about; no
street shall intersect any other street at an angle of less than 60 degrees.
   8.   Street Names. Streets that are obviously in alignment with others
already existing and named shall bear the name of the existing streets. The
proposed names of new streets shall be shown on the preliminary and final plats
and such names shall not duplicate or sound similar to existing street names.
The Clerk shall determine street names and house numbers.
   9.   Blocks. No block shall be longer than 900 feet between streets, except
where the topography or platted area requires blocks of greater length. In
blocks greater than 300 feet in length between street lines, the Council may
require a right-of-way of not less than ten feet in width to be dedicated for
crosswalks if it is considered essential for the welfare of the community.
   10.   Lots. Residential lots shall be a minimum of 60 feet in width, except
on cul-de-sacs. On cul-de-sacs the minimum lot width shall be 60 feet wide at
the building setback line and 45 feet at the property line. The residential lot
area shall not be less than 6,000 square feet and shall have a minimum depth of
80 feet. Corner lots for residential use shall be a minimum of 70 feet in
width.
   11.   Easements for Public Utilities. Where alleys are not provided in the
plat, easements of not less than five (5) feet in width shall be granted to the
City by the owner on each side of all rear and side lot lines where necessary
for the extensions of main sewers or other utilities. The subdivider shall
install electrical and telephone wiring systems consisting of the necessary
wiring, fixtures and equipment which shall be installed and maintained in
accordance with applicable codes and regulations governing such systems.
Telephone lines shall be installed underground according to local utility
specifications.
   12.   Monuments. Permanent monuments meeting the requirements of Chapter 355
of the Code of Iowa shall be placed at block corners, points of curves, change
in direction along lot lines and at each lot corner.
166.10   IMPROVEMENTS.
   The subdivider shall install and construct all improvements required by this
chapter. All required improvements shall be installed and constructed in
accordance with the specifications provided by the subdivider and prepared by a
Registered Engineer. All improvements shall be constructed under the
supervision of the City Engineer.
   1.   Streets and Alleys. All streets and alleys within the platted area
which are dedicated for public use shall be designed for six-inch Portland
cement concrete with integral curb. The subdivider is obligated for the cost of
grading, compaction and minimum of four (4) inches of crushed stone. All grades
shall be approved by the Council after receiving the report and recommendations
of the City Engineer. If the subdivider elects not to construct six-inch
Portland cement concrete streets with integral curb he shall construct a street
to meet the requirements as follows: The roadway width shall be 28 feet and to
the grade of the finished concrete street; the roadway shall also have a four-
foot-wide shoulder on each side and shall receive four inches of crushed stone
on a compacted subgrade; the subgrade shall be four inches below the finished
grade and shall be compacted to 95% standard proctor density; the property line
shall be brought to a grade above the proposed top of curb and a ditch cut
between the property line and the shoulder of the roadway.
   2.   Sidewalks. Portland cement concrete sidewalks shall be required by the
Council if they are considered necessary for the general welfare and safety of
the community. The sidewalks shall be constructed to the grade approved by the
Council after receiving the report and recommendations of the City Engineer.
   3.   Water Lines. Where a usable and acceptable public water main as
determined by the City Engineer is within 600 feet of the area to be
subdivided, the subdivider shall connect with such water main and provide a
water connection for each lot and stubbed to the property line in accordance
with the Water Department Standards, procedure and supervision. Where the water
main is not within the 600 feet as defined above, the subdivider and the
Council shall negotiate the cost for extending the water line to within 600
feet of the subdivision, if the Council wishes to make such extension. The
subdivider is obligated for the cost of a 6-inch diameter water main, valves,
fittings, fire hydrants, and appurtenances. If a water main greater than six
inches in diameter is required by the City, the additional cost shall be paid
for by the City. The subdivider may, at his or her own expense and with the
permission of the Council, construct water mains of greater diameter than that
which is required by the City.
   4.   Sewers. Where a usable and acceptable public sanitary sewer, as
determined by the City Engineer, is within 600 feet of the area to be
subdivided, the subdivider shall connect to such sanitary sewer and provide a
sanitary sewer service for each lot and stubbed to the property line. The sewer
system shall be constructed subject to the supervision of the City Engineer.
Where the public sanitary sewer is not within 600 feet of the area to be
subdivided, the subdivider and the Council shall negotiate the cost for
providing sanitary sewer to within 600 feet of the subdivision, if the Council
wishes to make such extension. The subdivider is obligated for the cost of all
sewers up to eight inches in diameter including all appurtenances. If a sewer
main greater than eight inches in diameter is required by the City, the
additional cost shall be paid for by the City. The subdivider may, at his or
her own expense and with the permission of the Council, construct sanitary
sewers of greater diameter than that required by the City.
   5.   Storm Sewers. Adequate provisions shall be made for the disposal of
storm water; however, the Council reserves the right to waive a part or all of
these storm sewer requirements. If storm sewers are required, in part or in
whole, they shall be subject to the approval of the Council and the supervision
of the City Engineer:
      A.   A design frequency of five (5) years shall be used in the design of
all laterals and a ten-year frequency in the design of all trunk lines.
      B.   The minimum pipe diameter shall be 12 inches.
      C.   Provisions shall be made for disposing of storm water for design
frequencies greater than five years on an emergency basis.
      D.   Storm water inlets shall be in accordance with the City’s standard
details.
      E.   The subdivider is obligated for the cost of all storm sewers
required by this chapter, except in the case of a trunk line extension, in
which case the subdivider shall pay a proportional share of the overall cost of
the trunk. The proportional share shall be the ratio of the total trunk line
capacity to capacity required for only the subdivision. All of the foregoing
improvements shall be completed and constructed before the Council approves the
final plat. However, this requirement may be waived if the subdivider will post
a performance bond with the Council guaranteeing that said improvements will be
constructed within a period of two years from final acceptance of the plat. If
utilities, sanitary sewer, water main or storm sewer outlets are not available
or accessible, the subdivider may be required to post a performance bond
guaranteeing that the improvements will be constructed within a five-year
period providing the utility service becomes available (within 600 feet of the
subdivision).
166.11   PLANS, PROFILES AND CROSS SECTIONS.
   The subdivider shall submit to the City Engineer the following: plans and
profiles drawn to a minimum horizontal scale of one inch to twenty feet (1" =
20') and a minimum vertical scale of one inch to five feet (1" = 5') and
specifications for the construction of the improvements for the subdivision as
required in Section 166.10 of this chapter. All elevations shall be referred to
the City datum and taken from bench marks as defined by the City Engineer:
   1.   The plan and profile of each street with tentative grades and street
intersection elevations. All grades shown shall be top of curb grades.
   2.   The plan and profile of proposed sanitary sewers with grades and pipe
sizes indicated, and a plan of the proposed water distribution system showing
pipe sizes and locations of valves and fire hydrants.
   3.   The cross sections of proposed streets showing the width of roadways,
present and proposed grade lines, and location and size of utility mains. The
cross sections shall be taken and plotted at intervals of not more than 50 feet
along the centerline and shall extend out to the sides to that point where the
proposed grade intersects the existing grade. In no case shall these cross
sections be extended less than the full width of the right-of-way.
   4.   Standard specifications approved by the City Engineer may be used.
   5.   Provide an overall drainage plan which shall show the drainage area of
each inlet of the subdivision.
   6.   The grading plan shall be sufficiently complete and of such accuracy
that it can be used for final lot grading.
166.12   VARIANCES.
   Where in the case of a particular proposed subdivision, it can be shown that
strict compliance with the requirement of this chapter would result in
extraordinary hardship to the subdivider, because of unusual topography or
other conditions, the Council may vary, modify or waive the requirements so
that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured. Provided,
however, such variance, modification or waiver will not have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of this chapter. In no case shall any
variance or modification be more than a minimum easing of the requirements and
in no instance shall it be in conflict with any zoning ordinance and such
variances and waivers may be granted only by the affirmative vote of three
fourths (3/4) of the members of the Council.
