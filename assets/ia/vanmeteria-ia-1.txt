   1.   Standard Civil Penalties.
      A.   First offense – not to exceed $750.00

day a violation exists or continues.
      B.   A municipal infraction classified as an environmental violation is

However, an environmental violation is not subject to such penalty if all of
the following conditions are satisfied:

last known mailing address, return receipt requested, or by publication in the
manner as provided in Rule of Civil Procedure 1.310 and subject to the
conditions of Rule of Civil Procedure 1.311. A copy of the citation shall be

alternative relief may include, but is not limited to, an order for abatement
or injunctive relief.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.22[8])
3.06 ALTERNATIVE PENALTIES.

the monitoring of automatic sprinkler systems and all equipment or devices
commonly known as fire alarms. A group of buildings with a single ownership,

communications center, shall be considered a single fire alarm system for the
purpose of this division. Any building, group of buildings, or building
situated on a common campus subject to a condominium regime shall be, as to
common areas for the purposes of this division, considered a single system; if
the entire premises subject to the condominium regime, including individual
units, is connected to or part of a single integrated alarm system, the entire
premises shall be considered to have a single fire alarm system held in common,
but if the premises is not so connected, individual units shall be treated as
other premises. All other premises not specifically mentioned shall, as to each
separate ownership, lease or other interest owning, maintaining or using a fire
alarm system, be considered for the purposes of this division to have a
separate fire alarm system.

system is an alarm user. Also excluded from this definition and from the
coverage of this division are persons who use alarm systems to alert or signal
persons within the premises in which the alarm system is located of an
attempted unauthorized intrusion or holdup attempt; provided, however, if such
a system employs an audible signal emitting sounds or a flashing light or
beacon designed to signal persons outside the premises, such system shall be
within the definition of an alarm system and shall be subject to this division.
      D.   False alarm means the activation of an alarm system through
technical failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence of the
owner or lessee of an alarm system or of his or her employees or agents. False
alarm under this division does not include alarm system failures caused by
transmission lines not under control of an alarm user or alarm agent; the
willful act of any person other than the alarm user or an agent, servant or
employee of the alarm user or alarm agent; and does not include failures due to
conditions clearly beyond the control of the alarm user or alarm agent. False

the leaks and spills of hazardous substances, these regulations are promulgated
to establish responsibility for the treatment, removal and cleanup of hazardous
substance spills within the City limits.

   For purposes of this chapter the following terms are defined:
   1.   “Cleanup” means actions necessary to contain, collect, control,
identify, analyze, clean up, treat, disperse, remove, or dispose of a hazardous
substance.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[1])
   2.   “Hazardous condition” means any situation involving the actual,
imminent, or probable spillage, leakage, or release of a hazardous substance

(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[7])
36.03 CLEANUP REQUIRED.
   Whenever a hazardous condition is created by the deposit, injection,
dumping, spilling, leaking or placing of a hazardous substance, so that the
hazardous substance or a constituent of the hazardous substance may enter the
environment or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters, including
ground waters, the responsible person shall cause the condition to be remedied
by a cleanup, as defined in the preceding section, as rapidly as feasible to an
acceptable, safe condition. The costs of cleanup shall be borne by the
responsible person. If the responsible person does not cause the cleanup to
begin in a reasonable time in relation to the hazard and circumstances of the

on the character of the hazardous condition, said notice setting a deadline for
accomplishing the cleanup and stating that the City will proceed to procure
cleanup services and bill the responsible person for all costs associated with
the cleanup if the cleanup is not accomplished within the deadline. In the
event that it is determined that immediate cleanup is necessary as a result of
the present danger to the public health, safety and welfare, then no notice
shall be required and the City may proceed to procure the cleanup and bill the
responsible person for all costs associated with the cleanup. If the bill for
those services is not paid within 30 days, the City Attorney shall proceed to
obtain payment by all legal means. If the cost of the cleanup is beyond the
capacity of the City to finance it, the authorized officer shall report to the
Council and immediately seek any State or federal funds available for said
cleanup.

of a hazardous substance shall notify the State Department of Natural Resources
and the Police Chief of the occurrence of a hazardous condition as soon as
possible but not later than six hours after the onset of the hazardous
condition or discovery of the hazardous condition. The Police Chief shall
immediately notify the Department of Natural Resources.
   2.   Any other person who discovers a hazardous condition shall notify the

46.01 Curfew                 46.03 Contributing to Delinquency
46.02 Cigarettes and Tobacco 46.04 Minors in Liquor Establishments
 
46.01 CURFEW.
   The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote
the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and
specifically to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults
responsible for minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors
committed after the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences
and criminal activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.
   1.   Definitions. For use in this section, the following terms are defined:
      A.   “Emergency errand” means, but is not limited to, an errand relating
to a fire, a natural disaster, an automobile accident or any other situation
requiring immediate action to prevent serious illness, bodily injury, or loss
of life.
      B.   “Knowingly” means knowledge that a responsible adult should
reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that
responsible adult’s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful
or careless adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult
responsibility through an objective test. It is therefore no defense that an
adult responsible for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or
conduct or whereabouts of the minor.
      C.   “Minor” means any unemancipated person under the age of 18 years.
      D.   “Nonsecured custody” means custody in an unlocked multipurpose area,

secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically
accompanied by a law enforcement officer or a person employed by the facility
where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to
providing nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate
juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the person’s
parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but
not for longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or
magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
      E.   “Public place” includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys, and sidewalks dedicated to public use and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises, whether publicly or privately owned,
that are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited
commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is
permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has
access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is
considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.
      F.   “Responsible adult” means a parent, guardian or other adult
specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have
custody or control of a minor.
   2.   Curfew Established. It is unlawful for any minor to be or remain upon
any of the alleys, streets, or public places or to be in places of business and
amusement in the City between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. of the
following day on days commencing on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and

in which the minor is permitted by law to be engaged or, if traveling, within

meeting of an association for the advancement of economic, political, religious
or cultural matters, or for any other activity protected by the First Amendment
of the U.S. Constitution guarantees of free exercise of religion, freedom of
speech, freedom of assembly or, if traveling, within one hour after the end or
before the beginning of the activity.
      D.   The minor is on an emergency errand for a responsible adult;
      E.   The minor is engaged in interstate travel through the City
beginning, ending or passing through the City when such travel is by direct
route.
   4.   Responsibility of Adults. It is unlawful for any responsible adult
knowingly to permit or to allow a minor to be in any public place in the City
within the time periods prohibited by this section unless the minor’s presence
falls within one of the above exceptions.
   5.   Enforcement Procedures.
      A.   Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in
the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driver’s
license, a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance,
use his or her best judgment in determining age.

that the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the person’s
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any nonsecured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into
custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.
      C.   Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into
custody, the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the
minor as soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible
for the minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at
such time as the court may direct.
      D.   Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minor’s parent, guardian or other person
legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the
law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative
of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person
who is known to the child.
   6.   Penalties.
      A.   Responsible Adult’s First Violation. In the case of a first
violation by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall, by certified mail,
send to the adult responsible for the minor, written notice of the violation
with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of
the curfew ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with
applicable penalties.
      B.   Responsible Adult’s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as
defined in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows
the minor to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a
municipal infraction.
      C.   Minor’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a
minor, the law enforcement officer shall give the minor a written warning,
which states that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of
the curfew ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with
applicable penalties, or, at the law enforcement officer’s discretion, may
issue the minor a citation for a first violation.
      D.   Minor’s Second Violation. For the minor’s second and subsequent
violations of any of the provisions of this section, the minor is guilty of a
municipal infraction.

purchase, or attempt to purchase any tobacco, tobacco products, alternative
nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes. Possession of tobacco,
tobacco products, alternative nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes
by a person under 18 years of age shall not constitute a violation of this
section if said person possesses the tobacco, tobacco products, alternative
nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes as part of the person’s
employment and said person is employed by a person who holds a valid permit
under Chapter 453A of the Code of Iowa or who lawfully offers for sale or sells

that the denial of the application for noise permit be reviewed by the City
Council at the Council’s next regularly scheduled meeting. The City shall
consider the following factors in connection with the issuance of a noise
permit:

welfare and quality of life for the residents and businesses of the City.
   4.   Limitations. A Sound Equipment Permit shall not be issued if the sound
to be emitted by the sound equipment would be a noise disturbance under Section
52.04 (other than Subsection 9) of this chapter. A Sound Equipment Permit
issued in violation of this Subsection 4 is void and of no force and effect.
   5.   Conditions. When a permit is issued pursuant to this chapter, the sound
levels listed in the following table shall be the maximum levels permitted when
measured at the edge of the City street, the alley right-of-way or the property
line, whichever reasonably appears to be nearest to the source of the sound:
 
Source Land Use Maximum dB Permitted
Residential     75 between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.
                65 between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.

   When granting the permit, the Council may impose lower sound level limits
based upon the location and length of the proposed event for which the permit
is requested and the Council may impose other reasonable conditions and
requirements to be met or fulfilled by the noise permit holder preliminary to
or at the time of the use or operation of the sound equipment. Such conditions
shall be those necessary or advisable to protect the health, welfare and
quality of life of the residents of the City and may include, without
limitation, restrictions on the time of day the sound equipment can be used or
operated and restrictions on the length of time that the sound equipment may be
used or operated. The permit holder shall be responsible for monitoring the
level of sound to ensure that the conditions of the permit are not violated.
   6.   Noncompliance by Permittee. Should the person, business, or
organization holding a permit not attentively observe all limitations and
restrictions found in this chapter and in the noise permit:
      A.   The peace officer shall be authorized to stop such permitted event
or to turn the sound equipment off or reduce it to the level authorized by the
noise permit.
      B.   For continued or repeated noncompliance after corrective action is
taken by the peace officer in Paragraph A of this subsection the responding
officer shall cite continued or repeated noncompliance with the maximum fine
prescribed in Chapter
3 of this Code of Ordinances.
   7.   Permissibility. Any other language to the contrary in this chapter
notwithstanding, sound made by sound equipment for which a valid Sound
Equipment Permit has been issued under this section shall be permissible
hereunder and shall not constitute a violation of this chapter regardless of
the fact that said sound equipment may be operated upon the public right-of-way
or in a building or upon premises, public or private, that is plainly audible
from a public right-of-way within the City.
52.08 OTHER LAWS AND ORDINANCES.
   No provisions of this chapter should be construed to legalize or permit
sounds, devices or activities made unlawful by other ordinances of the City or
State or federal statutes.
52.09 PENALTY.
   Unless another penalty is expressly provided by this chapter for any
particular provision or section, any person violating any provision of this
chapter or any rule or regulation adopted herein by reference shall be subject

not exceed the heights set forth specifically in this chapter.
53.02 MOWING OF PROPERTIES.
   Any property within the City, other than property used and taxed as
agricultural, whether vacated or non-vacated, is required to be mowed prior to
the vegetation reaching a height of 10 inches. Once the vegetation has reached
the height of 10 inches to 24 inches, the City will arrange to mow the property
at the property owner’s expense. Property used and taxed as agricultural is
exempt from this chapter’s height and mowing requirements.

a fee of $75.00 per hour (with a minimum of one hour and any additional time
over the first hour billed in half-hour increments), plus an administrative
surcharge of $100.00, will be charged to the property owner. Any property owner
who fails to mow his or her property, thus allowing the same to be mowed by the
City or its agents, and who does not provide payment for the mowing as
required, will be assessed by the City for such costs, which will be collected
in the same manner as general property taxes.
53.04 METHOD OF NOTICE.

53.06 NON-ZONING VARIANCE PROCEDURE.
   A non-zoning variance is a case-by-case deviation from this chapter only,
when it is demonstrated that compliance with this chapter would be a practical
impossibility and/or upon showing of good cause, an alternative to this chapter
is provided that conforms to the general intent and spirit of this chapter. The
Grounds Official shall be the Public Works Director. Any individual may apply
to the Grounds Official for a non-zoning variance from this chapter. Procedures
for granting variances from this chapter are as follows:
   1.   Application. Any individual seeking a non-zoning variance shall submit
a written application to the Grounds Official. The application shall be
submitted at the time the applicant becomes aware of the reason necessitating
the non-zoning variance, but under no circumstances shall an application be
considered after a violation under this chapter has occurred. The application
shall state the provision from which a non-zoning variance is being sought, the
period of time it is to apply, the reason for which the non-zoning variance is
sought, and any other supporting information which the Grounds Official may
reasonably require.
   2.   The Grounds Official shall decide, on the basis of the application,
whether to grant or deny the non-zoning variance and what conditions or terms,
if any, shall be attached. The decision of the Grounds Official shall be final,
unless appealed within five days of the Grounds Official’s decision to the City
Council.
   3.   Review Considerations. The Grounds Official, for an initial decision,
and the Council, on review, shall consider:
      A.   The character and nature of the property under consideration.
      B.   Whether the public health, safety or welfare is endangered by
granting the non-zoning variance.
      C.   Whether compliance with the provision would produce no benefit to
the public.
      D.   Whether a previous non-zoning variance has been previously issued
and the applicant’s record of compliance.
   4.   Time Duration of Non-Zoning Variance. A non-zoning variance may be
granted for a specific time interval only.
   5.   Council’s Action. At the next regularly scheduled meeting, the Council
shall, by resolution, deny the non-zoning variance, approve it, or approve it
subject to conditions. The Council’s decision shall be final for purposes of
any right to review under applicable law when that decision is reduced to
writing and signed.
   6.   Revocation. The Council may at any time before or during the operation
of a non-zoning variance granted by the Council or the Grounds Official revoke
the variance for good cause.

animal for any other purpose or in any other capacity within the City.
56.03 KEEPING OF DANGEROUS ANIMALS PROHIBITED.
   No person shall keep, shelter, or harbor for any reason within the City a
dangerous animal except for dangerous animals under the control of a law

   1.   In the event that an illegal animal or any animal which displays
dangerous tendencies is found at large and unattended upon public property,
park property, public right-of-way or the property of someone other than its
owner, thereby creating a hazard to persons or property, such animal may, in
the discretion of the City Clerk or the peace officer, be destroyed if it
cannot be confined or captured. Any dog which has been previously declared
vicious or which is believed to be vicious and is not properly confined may be
treated as a dangerous animal and be immediately seized anywhere within the
City. The City shall be under no duty to attempt the confinement or capture of
an illegal animal found at large, nor shall it have a duty to notify the owner
of such animal prior to its destruction.
   2.   Upon the complaint of an individual that a person is keeping,
sheltering or harboring an illegal animal on premises in the City, the City
Clerk shall cause the matter to be investigated by the peace officer and if
after investigation, the facts indicate that the person named in the complaint
is keeping, sheltering or harboring an illegal animal in the City, the peace
officer shall immediately seize any such animal. An animal so seized shall be
impounded for a period of seven days. If at the end of the impoundment period
the individual or entity keeping, sheltering or harboring such illegal animal
has not petitioned the Dallas County District Court seeking return of such
illegal animal, the peace officer shall safely remove such animal from the City
or destroy the animal in a humane manner.
   3.   Upon the complaint of an individual that a person is keeping,

is keeping, sheltering or harboring such dangerous animal in the City, the
peace officer shall order the person named in the complaint to safely remove
such animal from the City or destroy the animal within three days of the
receipt of such an order. Such order shall be contained in a notice to remove
the dangerous animal, which notice shall be given in writing to the person
keeping, sheltering or harboring the dangerous animal, and shall be served
personally or by certified mail. Such order and notice to remove a dangerous
animal shall not be required where such dangerous animal has previously caused
serious physical harm or death to any person, in which case the peace officer
shall cause the animal to be immediately seized or destroyed if seizure and
impoundment are not possible without risk of serious physical harm or death to
any person.
   4.   The order to remove a dangerous animal issued by the peace officer may
be appealed to the Council. In order to appeal such order, written notice of
appeal must be filed with the City Clerk within three days after receipt of the
order contained in the notice to remove the dangerous animal. Failure to file
such written notice of appeal shall constitute a waiver of right to appeal the
order of the peace officer.
   5.   The notice of appeal shall state the grounds for such appeal and shall
be delivered personally or by certified mail to the City Clerk. The hearing of
such appeal shall be scheduled within seven days of the receipt of notice of
appeal. The hearing may be continued for good cause. After such hearing, the
Council may affirm or reverse the order of the peace officer. Such
determination shall be contained in a written decision and shall be filed with
the City Clerk within three days after the hearing or any continued session
thereof.
   6.   If the Council affirms the action of the peace officer, the Council
shall order in its written decision that the individual or entity owning,
sheltering, harboring or keeping such dangerous animal remove such animal from
the City or destroy it. The decision and order shall immediately be served upon
the person or entity against whom rendered in the same manner as the notice of
removal. If the original order of the peace officer is not appealed and is not
complied with within three days or the order of the Council after appeal is not
complied with within three days of its issuance, the peace officer is
authorized to seize and impound such animal. An animal so seized shall be
impounded for a period of seven days. If at the end of the impoundment period,
the individual or entity against whom the decision and order of the peace
officer or Council was issued has not petitioned the Dallas County District
Court for a review of said order, the peace officer shall safely remove such
animal from the City or destroy the animal in a humane manner. Failure to
comply with an order of the peace officer issued pursuant hereto and not
appealed, or of the Council after appeal, shall constitute a simple
misdemeanor.
56.05 REMOVAL OF ANIMAL.
   Any animal required by any provision of this chapter to be removed,
voluntarily or otherwise, from the City shall be removed by its owner or the
person harboring or having control of such animal who shall provide the peace
officer a notarized statement designating the place to which the animal has
been removed. An animal not removed as required, or an animal which has been
removed and which is again found to be illegally within the City shall be
humanely destroyed.

into custody any abandoned vehicle on private property. The police authority
may employ its own personnel, equipment, and facilities or hire a private

exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property within the
time provided shall be deemed a waiver by the owner, lienholders and claimants
of all right, title, claim and interest in the vehicle or personal property and

under Section 80.03. The published notice may contain multiple listings of
abandoned vehicles and personal property but shall be published within the same
time requirements and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed
notice in Section 80.03.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3b])
80.05 FEES FOR IMPOUNDMENT.

vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without notification
procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more wheels or
other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable. The police

deposited in the State Road Use Tax Fund. Where the sale of any vehicle fails
to realize the amount necessary to meet costs the police authority shall apply
for reimbursement from the Department of Transportation.

concentration or create any other condition deleterious to structures and
treatment processes.
   13.   Untreatable Wastes. Waters or wastes containing substances that are
not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes
employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage
treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having
jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.
97.05 RESTRICTED DISCHARGES; POWERS OF SUPERINTENDENT.
   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to
the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in Section 97.04 and which in the judgment of the
Superintendent may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes,
equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or
constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent may:
   1.   Rejection. Reject the wastes by requiring disconnection from the public
sewage system;
   2.   Pretreatment. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for
discharge to the public sewers;
   3.   Controls Imposed. Require control over the quantities and rates of
discharge; and/or
   4.   Special Charges. Require payment to cover the added cost of handling
and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under
the provisions of Chapter 99.
97.06 SPECIAL FACILITIES.
   If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste
flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject
to the review and approval of the Superintendent and subject to the
requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws. Where preliminary
treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes,
they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation
by the owner at the owner’s expense.
97.07 CONTROL MANHOLES.
   When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner’s
expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
97.08 TESTING OF WASTES.
   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from
periodic grab samples.)

CHAPTER 100
BENEFITED DISTRICTS
 
100.01 Purpose   100.04 West Service Area Benefited Sewer District
100.02 Intent    100.05 District Connection Fees
100.03 Procedure
 
100.01 PURPOSE.
   The City has determined the necessity of establishing a policy and a
procedure to be utilized to recover the cost of designing and constructing
major sanitary sewer facilities and major water main facilities in those
instances in which a significant number of the properties to be benefited by
such facilities are not sufficiently developed to permit the recovery of those
costs through the special assessment process as provided in Chapter 384,
Division IV of the Code of Iowa. The City hereby declares its intent to utilize
connection fees, as herein provided, to recover the costs of designing and
constructing such major sanitary sewer facilities and major water main
facilities from property owners who connect to such facilities subsequent to
their construction.
100.02 INTENT.
   It is the intent of this chapter to set forth the method of recovery of
proportional cost shares from those property owners who connect their
properties to major sanitary sewer facilities and major water main facilities
subsequent to their construction, so that in the event that all property, other
than street and road right-of-way, which lies within the benefited district is
connected to the major sanitary sewer facilities and major water main
facilities during their expected useful life, then those properties shall bear,
in the aggregate, up to 100 percent of the cost for designing and constructing
such facilities, including legal, administrative, and interest expenses
associated therewith.
100.03 PROCEDURE.
   1.   In the event the Council determines the necessity of constructing a
major sanitary sewer facility or major water main facility, and determines that
the utilization of a connection fee is the most equitable manner in which to
recover the City’s costs associated therewith, the Council shall cause a
“Notice of Public Hearing on the Proposed Adoption of an Ordinance to Establish
a Benefited District and a Connection Fee” to be published in a newspaper of
general circulation within the City as hereinafter provided. In addition to
indicating the date, time and place of the public hearing, the notice shall:
      A.   Indicate the nature and extent of the major sanitary sewer facility
or facilities, or major water main facility or facilities, under consideration
for construction, as well as the estimated cost or costs for the design and
construction of same;
      B.   Identify by general description the proposed benefited district to
be served by the major sanitary sewer facility or facilities, or major water
main facility or facilities; and
      C.   Set forth the proposed schedule of connection fees to be paid by
property owners within the benefited district who connect to said facilities,
expressed in dollars per acre of land area served or such other method as the
City determines to be equitable for the benefited district.
The notice shall state that the proposed connection fee ordinance is on file,
along with a plat of the area to be served, and both are available for public
inspection in the office of the Clerk. The notice shall be published not more
than 45 days and not less than 20 days prior to the scheduled date of the
public hearing, and shall be mailed to each property owner within the benefited
district as shown by the records of the County Auditor.
   2.   At the public hearing, the owners of property within the proposed
benefited district shall be heard and may offer comments or objections as to:
      A.   The necessity for the project;
      B.   The calculation of the area benefited by the proposed major sanitary
sewer facilities or major water main facilities; 
      C.   The estimated cost of the proposed facilities; and
      D.   The proposed connection fee.
   3.   Upon concluding the hearing, the Council shall rule upon the objections
presented during the hearing and may consider the adoption of the proposed
connection fee ordinance. Upon consideration of the proposed connection fee
ordinance, the Council may:
      A.   Adopt the ordinance as proposed;
      B.   Delete elements or portions of the proposed major sanitary sewer
facilities and major water main facilities from the proposed project and the
properties served thereby from the benefited district proposed; or
      C.   Amend the ordinance to revise the connection fee schedule.
   4.   The connection fee ordinance may provide, at the Council's discretion,
that single family residences within the benefited district, in existence or
under construction upon the effective date of the ordinance, and located within
the corporate limits of the City, are eligible for connection to the major
sanitary sewer facility or major water main facility. In that event, the
ordinance shall include the following provisions:
      A.   The owners of residences on parcels of less than one acre in size
located within the City may connect such residences to the major sanitary sewer
facility or major water main facility upon approval of their application for
connection, payment of the connection fee for the parcel, and construction, at
the owner’s expense, of appropriate connection structures, as determined
necessary by the City.
      B.   The owners of residences on parcels in excess of one acre in size
located within the City may connect such residences to the major sanitary sewer
facility or major water main facility upon approval of their application for
connection, division of said parcel into a residence parcel and a remainder
parcel, payment of the connection fee for the residence parcel, and
construction, at the owner’s expense, of appropriate connection structures, as
determined necessary by the City. The connection fee for the remainder parcel
shall be payable at such time as the remainder parcel shall be connected to the
major sanitary sewer facility or major water main facility. For purposes of
this chapter, a parcel may be divided once. For purposes of this section,
division of the property into a residence parcel and a reminder parcel may be
accomplished by submitting a drawing showing a graphical depiction of the two
parcels including dimensions accurate to within a distance of one foot, a legal
description of the entire parcel and a legal description of the residence
parcel with such accuracy as to allow the City to determine a reasonable
description of the remainder parcel. For purposes of this section, the division
of property does not require a subdivision of the property or a plat of survey.
The connection fee ordinance may also provide, at the Council’s discretion,
that sanitary sewer service or water service can be provided to recreational
and park facilities and to commercial and industrial parcels and facilities, in
the same manner and under the same procedures set forth in this section for
single-family residences within the benefited district. All other property
located within the corporate limits of the City and within a benefited district
shall be eligible for connection to the major sanitary sewer facility or major
water main facility upon approval of an application for connection by the owner
thereof, as hereinafter provided, and payment of the connection fee for such
property, provided such property has been appropriately subdivided for
development, and, where applicable, all sanitary sewer improvements and/or
water main improvements necessary to serve said property have been constructed,
at the owner’s expense, and accepted by the City.
   5.   After adoption, publication and recording by the Clerk of a connection
fee ordinance for a benefited district, all owners of those properties within
the benefited district whose properties are eligible for connection, and who
propose to connect such properties directly or indirectly to the major sanitary
sewer facility or water main facility, shall make application to the City for
such connection. The submittal of construction plans to the City for sanitary
sewer improvements and/or water main improvements on property being subdivided
for development shall constitute an application to the City for purposes of
this chapter. The sewer connection fee or water connection fee shall be due and
payable at the time application is made to the City for connection to the major
sanitary sewer facility or major water main facility. No connection shall be
made to a major sanitary sewer facility or major water main facility until such
application has been approved and until the required connection fee has been
paid. The sewer connection fee and/or water connection fee required by this
section shall be paid before the City will approve the final plat of property
subject to the connection fee.
   6.   The sewer connection fee or water connection fee shall be in an amount
equal to the maximum acre area of contiguous property, or fraction thereof,
within the benefited district under common ownership which can be lawfully
served through such proposed connection, multiplied by the per-acre connection
fee or such other fee basis as determined for the benefited district
established in the connection fee ordinance for that benefited district. The
connection fee ordinance may provide for a graduated connection fee, with
annual interest adjustments, such that property owners who connect in later
years pay interest on the connection fee for their property. The rate of
interest applicable to the connection fee established in each benefited
district shall not exceed the rate of interest applicable to special
assessments pursuant to Chapter 74A and Section 384.60(3) of the Code of Iowa
in effect on the date that the connection fee was established for that district
by enactment of a connection fee ordinance.
   7.   Property outside of the benefited district would be eligible for
connection to a major sanitary sewer facility or major water main facility only
upon the approval of an application for connection by the owner thereof, a
determination by the City that sufficient capacity exists in the major sanitary
sewer facility or major water main facility to serve such area outside of the
boundaries of the benefited district and following payment of a fee calculated
on the same basis as if the property were located within the benefited
district. Without approval of the City and payment of the applicable fee, no
property outside of the benefited district may connect to the major sanitary
sewer facility or major water main facility constructed to serve the benefited
district. The City may waive the requirement for payment of the applicable fee.
   8.   The sewer connection fee or water connection fee required by this
chapter shall be due and payable to the City and is in addition to, and not in
lieu of, any other fees for connection required under the plumbing code or
other provisions of this Code of Ordinances.
   9.   In the event any property owner connects his or her property within a
benefited district or property outside a benefited district connecting to a
major sanitary sewer facility or major water main facility for which a
benefited distribution has been established to a major sanitary sewer facility
or major water main facility without having made application therefor or
without having received approval thereof or without having paid the required
connection fee established by a connection fee ordinance, the City shall be
entitled to disconnect such private sewer connection or water connection until
such time as the property owner has made and received approval of the
application, and has paid the required connection fee.
100.04 WEST SERVICE AREA BENEFITED SEWER DISTRICT.

the stream bank slope or the highest point of the stream channel.
   10.   “Stream channel” is part of the watercourse either naturally or
artificially created that contains an intermittent or perennial base flow of
groundwater origin. Base flows of groundwater origin can be distinguished by
any of the following physical indicators:
      A.   Hydrophytic vegetation, hydric soil, or other hydrologic indicators
in the area(s) where groundwater enters the stream channel in the vicinity of
the stream headwaters, channel bed, or channel banks.
      B.   Flowing water not directly related to a storm event.
      C.   Historical records of a local high groundwater table, such as well
and stream gauge records.

   12.   “Wetland” is defined as areas that are inundated or saturated by
surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and
that normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically
adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include
swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.
102.03 APPLICABILITY.
   This chapter shall apply to proposed improvements associated with all land
development activity requiring a site plan, construction drawings, or
subdivision on property containing a stream, near a stream, or drainage swale
draining greater than 50 acres. These requirements are in addition to, and do
not replace or supersede, any other applicable buffer requirements established
by other regulatory avenues.
102.04 STREAM BUFFER DESIGN.
   1.   A stream buffer for a stream system shall consist of a native
vegetative strip of land extending along both sides of a stream and its
adjacent wetlands, floodplain, or slopes. The stream buffer width shall be
adjusted to include contiguous sensitive areas, such as steep slopes or
erodible soils, where development or disturbance may adversely affect water
quality, streams, wetlands, or other water bodies.
   2.   The required base width for all buffers shall be determined based on
the type of stream being protected, as specified in TABLE I of this chapter
below:
 
TABLE I. Required Minimum Stream Buffer Width
Stream                            Required Width
Streams with Floodway             Floodway plus 50 feet on each side of
                                  floodway boundary
Type I or Type II Streams with No Iowa DNR Method
Floodway
Type III Streams                  30 feet on each side of stream channel
                                  centerline
 
   3.   A comprehensive map of all existing stream buffer areas within the
jurisdiction of the City of Van Meter has been established and is on file with
the City Clerk.
   4.   The City Engineer or his/her designee may consider buffer design
modifications in unique cases of topography or other hardship provided that the
project can meet the goals outline in the purpose and intent of this chapter.
   5.   A stream buffer shall not be required for the portions of a stream that
are less than 150 feet in length due to the stream having been previously
enclosed within a pipe or box structure.
   6.   Impervious surfaces, septic systems and all associated equipment are
prohibited within the buffer.
   7.   Dominant vegetation shall consist of existing or seeded/planted native
trees, shrubs, perennial grasses and forbs suited to the soil and hydrology of
the site and the intended purpose. No single species shall make up more than
50% of the total number of species planted. Turf grass (lawn) is not permitted.
   8.   Overland flow through the stream buffer area will be maintained as
sheet flow.
102.05 BUFFER MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE.
   1.   The stream buffer, including wetlands and floodplains, shall be managed
to enhance and maximize the unique value of these resources. Management
includes specific limitations on alteration of the natural conditions of these
resources. All buffer areas should be left in a natural state and not mowed,
trimmed, fertilized, or irrigated except to provide optimal plant establishment
and maintenance. Weed control should be limited to legal requirements for
eradication of noxious plants or for establishment of desirable plants.
Maintenance shall normally consist of restoring natural or native plantings and
following recommended practices of maintenance after establishment. Weeds and
debris shall be removed as necessary. Fallen trees should be left to increase
habitat for wildlife.
   2.   The City of Van Meter will only be responsible for the management and
maintenance of City-owned stream buffers.
   3.   Management and maintenance of privately-owned stream buffers shall be
subject to drainage area and development goals and management plan shall be
developed by the owner. The requirements for a stream buffer management plan
are outlined in Section 102.06.
   4.   At the full discretion of the City, any stream buffer may be required
to be deeded to the City as part of the final plat or site plan approval
process, and/or park land dedication requirement. In special circumstances, the
City may accept a permanent easement for the purpose of protecting the land in
and around the established stream buffer and impose any and all restrictions as
determined in this chapter.
   5.   Temporary or permanent access easements may need to be developed during
the site plan or subdivision process, if the buffer is not yet contiguous to
another point of access or to otherwise ensure adequate access is provided to
all areas of the buffer as necessary to perform maintenance.
   6.   Encroachment onto public lands is a form of trespass. The erection of
structures or modifications to natural areas on public lands that have been set
aside for natural resource conservation and/or public use are considered
encroachments. The unauthorized placement of natural or manmade materials on or
within City owned or managed property is prohibited. The unauthorized
construction or placement of any structures or other “improvements” on or
within City property and the unauthorized alteration (i.e. mowing) of City
property in anyway is also prohibited.
   7.   The following structures, practices, and activities are permitted in
the stream buffer, with specific design or maintenance features, subject to the
review of the City of Van Meter:
      A.   Roads, bridges, paths, and utilities.
      B.   The right-of-way should be the minimum width needed to allow for
maintenance access and installation.
      C.   The angle of the crossing shall be as close to perpendicular as

   The rights and privileges hereby granted are subject to the restrictions and
limitations of Chapter 364 of the Code of Iowa, or as subsequently amended or
changed.
110.03 PIPES AND MAINS.
   Company shall have the right to excavate in any public street for the
purpose of laying, relaying, repairing or extending gas pipes, mains, conduits,
and other facilities provided that the same shall be so placed as not to
unreasonably interfere with any above or below-ground utility services or
facilities which have been or may hereafter be located by or under authority of
the City.
110.04 CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE.
   The Company shall, excluding facilities located in private easements
(whether titled in Company exclusively or in Company and other entities), in
accordance with Iowa law including Company’s tariff on file with and made
effective by the Iowa Utilities Board as may subsequently be amended (“Tariff”)
at its cost and expense, locate and relocate its existing facilities or
equipment in, on, over or under any public street or alley in the City in such
a manner as the City may reasonably require for the purposes of facilitating
the construction, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of the street or alley.
Relocation expenses for other hard surfaces, including pedestrian and non-
motorized vehicle pathways, will be paid by the City. If the City has a
reasonable alternative route for the street, alley or public improvements or an
alternative construction method, which would not cause the relocation of the
Company installations, the City shall select said alternative route, or
construction method. The City shall be responsible for surveying and staking
the right-of-way for City projects that require the Company to relocate Company
facilities. If requested the City shall provide, at no cost to the Company,
copies of its relocation plan and profile and cross section drawings. If
vegetation or tree removal must be completed by the City as part of the City’s
project and are necessary, whether or not utility facilities must be relocated,
the City at its own cost shall be responsible for said removals. If the timing
of the tree removals does not coincide with the Company facilities relocation
schedule and Company must remove vegetation or trees that are included in the
City’s portion of the project, the City shall either remove the vegetation or
trees at its cost or reimburse the Company for the expenses incurred to remove
said trees or vegetation. If project funds from a source other than the City
are available to pay for the relocation of utility facilities, the City shall
attempt to secure said funds and provide them to the Company to compensate the
Company for the costs of relocation.
110.05 EXCAVATIONS.
   In making excavations in any streets, avenues, alleys and public places for
the installation of gas pipes, conduits or apparatus, Company shall not
unreasonably obstruct the use of the streets and shall replace the surface,
restoring it to the condition as existed immediately prior to excavation.
Company agrees any replacement of road surface shall conform to current City
code regarding its depth and composition. The Company shall not be required to
restore or modify public right-of-way, sidewalks or other areas in or adjacent
to the Company project to a condition superior to its immediate previously
existing condition or to a condition exceeding its previously existing
condition to the extent any alterations are required for the City to comply
with City, State or federal rules, regulations or laws.
110.06 UTILITY EASEMENTS.  
   Vacating a street, avenue, alley, public ground or public right-of-way shall
not deprive the Company of its right to operate and maintain existing
facilities on, below, above, or beneath the vacated property. Prior to the City
abandoning or vacating any street, avenue, alley or public ground where the
Company has gas lines, mains or facilities, the City shall provide Company with
not less than 60 days’ advance notice of the City’s proposed action and, upon
request grant the Company a utility easement covering existing and future
facilities and activities. If the City fails to grant the Company a utility
easement for said facilities prior to abandoning or vacating a street, avenue,
alley or public ground, the City shall at its cost and expense obtain easements
for the existing Company facilities.
110.07 RELOCATION NOT REQUIRED.  
   The Company shall not be required to relocate, at its cost and expense,
Company facilities in the public right-of-way that have been relocated at
Company expense at the direction of the City in the previous 10 years.
110.08 RELOCATION REIMBURSEMENT.  
   Pursuant to relocation of Company facilities as may be required here under,
if the City orders or requests the Company to relocate its existing facilities
or equipment in order to directly or indirectly facilitate the project of a
commercial or private developer or other non-public entity, City shall
reimburse or the City shall require the developer or non-public entity to
reimburse the Company for the cost of such relocation as a precondition to
relocation. The Company shall not be required to relocate in order to
facilitate such private project at its expense.
110.09 INDEMNIFICATION.  
   The Company shall indemnify and save harmless the City from any and all
claims, suits, losses, damages, costs or expenses, on account of injury or
damage to any person or property, to the extent caused or occasioned by the
Company’s negligence in construction, reconstruction, excavation, operation or
maintenance of the natural gas facilities authorized by this franchise;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to defend, indemnify
and save harmless the City for any costs or damages to the extent arising from
the negligence of the City, its officers, employees or agents.
110.10 INFORMATION.
   Upon reasonable request, the Company shall provide the City, on a project
specific basis, information indicating the horizontal location, relative to
boundaries of the right-of-way, of all equipment which it owns or over which it
has control that is located in the public right-of-way, including documents,
maps and other information in paper or electronic or other forms
(“Information”). The Company and City recognize the Information may in whole or
part be considered a confidential record under State or federal law or both.
Upon receipt of a request from a third party for information concerning
information about the Company’s facilities within the City, the City will
promptly submit same to Company. If the Company believes any of the information
requested constitutes a trade secret which may otherwise be protected from
public disclosure by State or federal law, or otherwise exempt from disclosure
under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission Critical Energy Infrastructure requirements pursuant to
18 CFR 388.112 and 388.113, or Chapter 22 of the Code of Iowa, as such statutes
and regulations may be amended from time to time, then the Company shall
provide the City with a written explanation of the basis for such assertion of
confidentiality or exemption from disclosure within 10 days.
110.11 APPLICABLE REGULATIONS.
   The Company shall extend its mains and pipes and operate, and maintain the

Board or its successors and Iowa law. During the term of the franchise, the
Company shall furnish natural gas in the quantity and quality consistent and in
accordance with the applicable regulations of the Iowa Utilities Board the

and Iowa law. All reasonable and proper police regulations shall be adopted and
enforced by the City for the protection of the facilities of Company.
110.12 FRANCHISE FEE.  
   There is hereby imposed upon the customers a franchise fee of five percent
upon the gross receipts, minus uncollectible accounts, generated from sales of
natural gas and distribution service, pursuant to the Tariff, by the Company to
the City. The Franchise fee shall be remitted by the Company to the City on or
before the last business day of the calendar quarter following the close of the
calendar quarter following the close of the calendar quarter in which the
franchise fee is charged.
   1.   The City recognizes the administrative burden collecting franchise fees
imposes upon the Company and the Company requires lead time to commence
collecting said franchise fees. The Company will commence collecting franchise
fees on or before the first Company billing cycle of the first calendar month
following 90 days of receipt of information required of the City to implement
the franchise fee, including the City’s documentation of customer classes
subject to or exempted from City-imposed franchise fee. The City shall provide
the information and data required in a form and format acceptable to the
Company. The Company will, if requested by the City, provide the City with a
list of premises considered by the Company to be within the corporate limits of
the City.
   2.   The City shall be solely responsible for identifying customer classes
subject to or exempt from paying the City imposed franchise fee. The City shall
be solely responsible for notifying Company of its corporate limits, including,
over time, annexations or other alterations thereto, and customer classes that
it wishes to subject to, or to the extent permitted by law, exempt from paying
the franchise fee. The City shall provide to the Company, by certified mail,
copies of annexation ordinances in a timely manner to ensure appropriate
franchise fee collection from customers within the corporate limits of the
City. The Company shall have no obligation to collect franchise fees from
customers in annexed areas until and unless such ordinances have been provided
to the Company by certified mail. The Company shall commence collecting
franchise fees in the annexed areas no sooner than 60 days after receiving
annexation ordinances from the City.
   3.   The City agrees to modify the level of franchise fees imposed only once
in any 24-month period. Any such ordinance exempting classes of customers,
increasing, decreasing, modifying or eliminating the franchise fee shall become
effective, and billings reflecting the change shall commence on an agreed upon
date which is not less than 60 days following written notice to the Company by
certified mail. The Company shall not be required to implement such new
ordinance unless and until it determines that it has received appropriate
official documentation of final action by the City Council.
   4.   The City shall indemnify the Company from claims of any nature arising
out of or related to the imposition and collection of the franchise fee. In
addition, the Company shall not be liable for collecting franchise fees from
any customer originally or subsequently identified, or incorrectly identified,
by the City as being subject to the franchise fee or being subject to a
different level of franchise fees or being exempt from the imposition of
franchise fees.
   5.   The Company shall remit franchise fee revenues to the City no more
frequently than on or before the last business day of the month following each
quarter as follows.

changes made in this collection schedule, including any alterations in the
calendar quarters or any other changes in the remittance periods.
   6.   The City recognizes that the costs of franchise fee administration are
not charged directly to the City and agrees it shall, if required by the
Company, reimburse the Company for any initial or ongoing costs incurred by the
Company in collecting franchise fees that Company in its sole opinion deems to
be in excess of typical costs of franchise fee administration.
   7.   The Company shall not, under any circumstances be required to return or
refund any franchise fees that have been collected from City customers and
remitted to the City. In the event the Company is required to provide data or
information in defense of the City’s imposition of franchise fees or the
Company is required to assist the City in identifying customers or calculating
any franchise fee refunds for groups of or individual customers, the City shall
reimburse the Company for the expenses incurred by the Company to provide such
data or information.
   8.   The obligation to collect and remit the fee imposed by this chapter is
modified or repealed if:
      A.   Any other person is authorized to sell natural gas at retail to City
consumers and the City imposes a franchise fee or its lawful equivalent at zero
or a lesser rate than provided in this ordinance, in which case the obligation
of Company to collect and remit franchise fee shall be modified to zero or the
lesser rate.
      B.   The City adds additional territory by annexation or consolidation
and is unable or unwilling to impose the franchise fee upon all persons selling
natural gas at retail to consumers within the additional territory, in which
case the franchise fee imposed on the revenue from sales by Company in the
additional territory shall be zero or equal to that of the lowest fee being
paid by any other retail seller of natural gas within the City.
      C.   Legislation is enacted by the Iowa General Assembly or the Supreme
Court of Iowa issues a final ruling regarding franchise fees or the Iowa
Utilities Board issues a final non-appealable order (collectively, “final
franchise fee action”) that modifies, but does not repeal, the ability of the
City to impose a franchise fee or the ability of Company to collect from City
customers and remit franchise fees to City. Within 60 days of final franchise
fee action, the City shall notify Company and the parties shall meet to
determine whether this ordinance can be revised, and, if so, how to revise the
franchise fee on a continuing basis to meet revised legal requirements. After
final franchise fee action and until passage by the City of revisions to the
franchise fee ordinance, Company may temporarily discontinue collection and
remittance of the franchise fee if in its sole opinion it believes it is
required to do so in order to comply with revised legal requirements.
   9.   The other provisions of this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding,
the Company shall be completely relieved of its obligation to collect and remit
to the City the franchise fee as, effective as the date specified below with no
liability therefor under each of any of the following circumstances as
determined to exist in the sole discretion of Company:
      A.   Any of the imposition, collection or remittance of a franchise fee
is ruled to be unlawful by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date
of such ruling or as may be specified by that Court.
      B.   The Iowa General Assembly enacts legislation making imposition,
collection or remittance of a franchise fee unlawful, effective as of the date
lawfully specified by the General Assembly.
      C.   The Iowa Utilities Board, or its successor agency, denies the
Company the right to impose, collect or remit a franchise fee provided such
denial is affirmed by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date of
the final agency order from which the appeal is taken.
   10.   Upon implementation of a franchise fee the City shall not, pursuant to
Chapter 480A.6 of the Code of Iowa, impose or charge Company right of way
management fees for permits for Company construction, maintenance, repairs,
excavation, pavement cutting or inspections of Company work sites and projects
or related matters.
110.13 TERMINATION.
   Either City or Company (“party”) may terminate the franchise if the other
party shall be materially in breach of its provisions. Upon the occurrence of a
material breach, the non-breaching party shall provide the breaching party with
notification by certified mail specifying the alleged breach. The breaching
party shall have 60 days to cure the breach, unless it notifies the non-
breaching party, and the parties agree upon a shorter or longer period for
cure. If the breach is not cured within the cure period, the non-breaching
party may terminate the franchise. A party shall not be considered to be in
breach of the franchise if it has operated in compliance with State or federal
law. A party shall not be considered to have breached the franchise if the
alleged breach is the result of the actions of a third party or the other
party.

1   Deep and shallow wells, as defined in IAC 567-40.2(455B): A deep well is a
well located and constructed in such a manner that there is a continuous layer
of low permeability soil or rock at least five feet thick located at least 25
feet below the normal ground surface and above the aquifer from which water is
to be drawn. A shallow well is a well located and constructed in such a manner
that there is not a continuous layer of low permeability soil or rock (or
equivalent retarding mechanism acceptable to the department) at least five feet
thick, the top of which is located at least 25 feet below the normal ground
surface and above the aquifer from which water is to be drawn.
2   The separation distances are dependent upon two factors: the type of piping
that is in the existing sewer or drain, as noted in the table, and that the
piping was properly installed in accordance with the standards.
3   Solid wastes are those derived from the treatment of water or wastewater.
Certain types of solid wastes from water treatment processes may be land-
applied within the separation distance on an individual, case-by-case basis.
4   Solid waste means garbage, refuse, rubbish, and other similar discarded
solid or semisolid materials, including but not limited to such materials
resulting from industrial, commercial, agricultural, and domestic activities.

   Subsection 102.11, Housing Code is hereby established by adding the
following subsections:
102.11.1 Housing Code. In addition to provisions of the Property Maintenance
Code of the City of Van Meter, this section shall be hereafter known as the
City housing code and may be cited as such and will be referred to as such in
this section.
102.11.2 Scope. The provisions of this section shall be deemed to apply to all
dwellings or portions thereof used or designed or intended to be used for human
habitation. All occupancies in existing buildings may be continued as provided
in previously adopted Building Code(s) except such structures as are found to
be substandard as defined in this code. Where any building or portion thereof
is used or intended to be used as a combination apartment house-hotel, the
provisions of this code shall apply to the separate portions as if they were
separate buildings. Every rooming house or lodging house shall comply with all
of the requirements of this code applicable to dwellings.
102.11.3 Dwellings--Definition. A dwelling is any house or building or portion
thereof which is occupied in whole or in part as a home or residence of one or
more human beings, either permanently or transiently. No part of a building
hereafter constructed as or altered into a dwelling may be occupied in whole or
in part for human habitation until the issuance of a certificate by the Code
Official that such part of the dwelling conforms to requirements relative to
dwellings hereafter erected. The certificate shall be issued within fourteen
days after written application therefore if the dwelling at the date of such
application shall be entitled thereto. Such certificate shall hereafter be
known as an occupancy certificate.
102.11.4 Housing Inspector. The City Council may designate, by resolution, the
Building and Zoning Administrator and his or her representatives or designees
as housing inspectors, or, the City Council may, by resolution, approve certain
qualified firms or persons who by training or experience are familiar with the
provisions of this code to perform inspections of rental dwelling units in the
City, to insure their compliance with this code. The inspectors appointed under
the provisions of this section shall be charged with the responsibility of
performing inspections of rental dwelling units in the City only, but shall not
be charged with the duty of enforcing the provisions of this chapter. The Code
Official shall be responsible for the enforcement of this chapter and may also
make any inspections required under the provisions of this chapter.
102.11.5 Regular Inspections. Regular inspections of rental dwelling units
shall be required every three years in the case of multiple-family dwellings
and every five years in the case of unattached single-family rental units and
duplexes.
102.11.6 Application for a Certificate. Every person, firm or corporation that
offers for rent a dwelling or portion(s) thereof within the City shall submit
to the Planning and Building Department, on forms provided, an application
requesting an inspection certificate. Such application shall be accompanied by
an inspection and application fee in an amount established by Council
resolution. Upon receipt of such application, the City shall cause an
inspection of the premises and, if the same comply with the provisions of this
chapter, issue an inspection certificate. If the premises fail to comply, the
housing inspector shall notify the applicant in writing, stating the reasons
for such noncompliance.
102.11.7 Additional Inspections. In addition to the inspections required under
Section 102.11.4, the City Inspector or inspectors are also empowered to make
similar inspections of all rental units as frequently as may be necessary and
may make inspection at any reasonable time on a written complaint submitted by
the owner, tenant or other person concerned; the City will make special
provisions in the case of elderly and handicapped persons in order to insure
that their housing facilities are adequate.
102.11.8 Inspection Fees for Additional Inspections. When an inspection is made
at the request of the owner, an inspection fee as provided in Section 102.11.6
shall be charged. If an inspection is made at the written request of a tenant
and the dwelling is found to be in noncompliance, due to an omission of the
owner, such owner shall be responsible for the re-inspection fee. No inspection
shall be conducted at the request of a tenant unless the tenant has first
submitted his complaint, in writing, to the landlord, no less than ninety-six
hours before making such complaint to the City. If, after a written complaint
by the tenant, the dwelling is found to comply, or if such noncompliance is due
to conduct on the part of the tenant, the tenant shall be liable for the cost
of such inspection. If such costs are not paid by the tenant within 30 days
from date of billing, the City may initiate an action in law or in equity to
recover the same, in which event the tenant shall be liable for reasonable
attorney fees. No fee shall be charged to the owner for such inspection. In the
event an inspection is initiated by the City or at the request of a person
other than the owner or tenant, and if the building is found to be in
noncompliance, the owner shall be liable for such inspection fees. In the event
that on the date of the inspection the building complies with the provisions of
the housing code, no fee shall be charged. In the event that on the date of
inspection a dwelling fails to comply with the provisions of the housing code,
which necessitates additional inspections, the owner shall be liable for the
cost of such re-inspections. All fees required under this chapter shall be paid
prior to the issuance or renewal of the inspection certificate.
102.11.9 Entrance and Survey of Buildings. The building inspector and all
inspectors and employees of the building department and such other persons as
may be authorized by the City Council may, without fee, except as provided in
Section 102.11.8, enter, examine, make necessary records and survey all rental
dwellings within the City. If entry into the interior portion of a dwelling
unit is required, 24 hours' notice to the tenant shall be given by the City.
The owner or his agent or representative and the lessee and occupant of every
rental dwelling and every person having the care and management of the same
shall, at all reasonable times when required by such officers or persons, give
them free access to such rental dwellings and premises. The owner of a rental

dwellings at reasonable times for the purpose of bringing about compliance with
the provisions of this chapter or any order issued thereunder.

dwellings and duplexes, it shall expire five years from the original date of
its issuance, unless sooner revoked or suspended. The housing inspector shall
inspect each such dwelling within 60 days prior to the expiration date of the

certificate shall be issued.
102.11.12 Issuance Duration Validation. If the dwelling and premises are found
to comply with the requirements of this chapter, upon reinspection, the housing
inspector shall issue a temporary inspection certificate. This certificate

shall be presented to the Planning and Building Department within that period
of time and, upon payment of the appropriate fees, the Code Official shall
validate it.
102.11.13 Certificate Displayed--Transferability. Inspection certificates shall
be transferable to succeeding owners. They shall be displayed by the owner for

occupied.

penalty of $100.00. For the recovery of such penalties, costs, expenses or
disbursements, an action may be brought in a court of competent civil
jurisdiction.

constructed, altered, converted or maintained in violation of any provisions of
this chapter or of any order or notice of the Code Official, or in case a

for a property to be considered a “dwelling” within the meaning of this
chapter. No part of a building hereafter constructed or altered into a dwelling

issuance of a rental housing compliance certificate by the City Building
Inspector that such part of the dwelling conforms to the requirements of this
chapter. A dwelling unit that is being rented for a period of 90 days or less
in a single calendar year or a portion of such dwelling unit is exempt from
this chapter.
   4.   “Dwelling unit” means one or more habitable rooms in a dwelling,
apartment house or building which are occupied or which are intended or

   6.   “Tenant” means a person occupying a dwelling unit who pays, or has

the terms of this chapter for a person to be considered a “tenant” within the
meaning of this chapter.
161.02 TITLE AND PURPOSE.
   This chapter shall be known as the City of Van Meter Rental Housing Code.
The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that rental housing facilities and the
conditions of such facilities are of sufficient quality to protect and promote
the health, safety and welfare of those persons utilizing such housing as well
as the general public.
161.03 SCOPE.
   The provisions of this chapter shall be deemed to apply to all dwellings as
defined in this chapter or portions thereof used or designed or intended to be
used for human habitation. All occupancies in existing buildings may be

161.05 APPLICATIONS FOR RENTAL HOUSING COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATE.
   Every person that offers for rent a dwelling unit within the City shall
submit to the Clerk, on forms provided by the City, an application requesting a
rental housing compliance certificate. Such application shall be accompanied by
a registration fee in an amount established by Council resolution. When
inspections are due, the person that offers for rent a dwelling unit must

inspection fee is due. If the premises fails to comply, the Building Inspector
shall notify the applicant in writing, stating the reasons for such
noncompliance. The landlord shall have 30 days after receipt of noncompliance
to correct the deficiencies and schedule a re-inspection. Fees for re-
inspection shall also be established by the Council resolution.
161.06 ADDITIONAL INSPECTIONS.
   The Building Inspector is empowered to make inspections of all rental
dwelling units as frequently or infrequently as may be necessary and may make
inspection at any reasonable time on a written complaint submitted by the
owner, tenant or other person concerning the dwelling unit.
161.07 INSPECTION FEES FOR ADDITIONAL INSPECTIONS.
   1.   When an inspection is made at the request of the owner, an inspection
fee as provided in

shall be liable for the cost of such inspection. If such costs are not paid by
the tenant within 30 days from the date of billing, the City may initiate an
action at law or in equity to recover the same, in which event the tenant shall
be liable for reasonable attorney fees incurred in the prosecution of the
action. No fee shall be charged to the owner for such inspection.
   2.   In the event an inspection is initiated by the City or at the written
request of a person other than the owner or tenant, and if the dwelling unit is
found to be in noncompliance, the owner shall be liable for such inspection
fees. No inspection shall be conducted at the request of a person other than
the owner or tenant unless that person has first submitted the complaint in
writing to the landlord no less than seven days before making such complaint to
the Building Inspector. In the event that on the date of the inspection the
dwelling unit complies with the provisions of this chapter, no fee shall be
charged. In the event that on the date of inspection a dwelling unit fails to
comply with the provisions of this chapter which necessitates additional
inspections, the owner shall be liable for the cost of such re-inspection.

City Clerk. No person shall rent, lease, operate or otherwise allow the
occupancy of any dwelling unit unless such person holds a Rental Housing
Compliance Certificate as required by this chapter.

control thereof.

   Whenever the Building Inspector finds that an emergency exists which
threatens immediately the public health, safety or welfare, the Building
Inspector may issue an order reciting the existence of such an emergency and

directed shall comply therewith immediately.

action were based have been eliminated.

any such dwelling unit, building or structure or upon the lot on which it is
situated, the City may cause the institution of any appropriate action or
proceeding to prevent such unlawful construction, alteration, conversion or
maintenance, to restrain, correct or abate such violation, or nuisance, or to
prevent the occupation of the dwelling unit, building or structure, or to
prevent any illegal act, or to prevent the conduct of business in or about such
dwelling unit or lot.

doing or permitting to be done any work in or upon such dwelling unit,
building, structure or lot, or from occupying or using the same for any purpose
until the entry of final judgment or order.
161.22 EVICTION; LEASE TERMINATION.
   If the occupant of a dwelling fails to comply with the provisions of this

162.02 STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
   1.   The Legislature of the State of Iowa has, in Chapter 414 of the Code of
Iowa, as amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to
secure safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
   2.   Findings of Fact.
      A.   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of
the community.
      B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by: (i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
      C.   This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
   3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Paragraph 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
      A.   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows
so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
      B.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
      C.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
      D.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
      E.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
162.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   1.   Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter shall
apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City shown on the Official
Floodplain Zoning Map as being within the boundaries of the Floodway, Floodway
Fringe and General Floodplain (Overlay) districts, as established in this
section.
   2.   Establishment of Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) for Dallas County and Incorporated Areas, City of Van Meter,
Panels 19049C0337G, 0339G, and 0343G, dated December 15, 2022, which were
prepared as part of the Flood Insurance Study for Dallas County, are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be the Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The
flood profiles and all explanatory material contained with the Flood Insurance
Study are also declared to be a part of this chapter.
   3.   Rules for Interpretation of District Boundaries. The boundaries of the
zoning district areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the official
Floodplain Zoning Map. When an interpretation is needed as to the exact
location of a boundary, the Zoning Administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it
is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the Zoning Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
   4.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no
structure shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without
full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
   5.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter
to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
   6.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
   7.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated Floodplain (Overlay) District areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create
liability on the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
   8.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.

permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance (or
underlying zoning district) and provided they meet applicable performance
standards of the Floodway District.
   2.   Performance Standards. No development shall be permitted in the
Floodway District that would result in any increase in the base flood
elevation. Consideration of the effects of any development on flood levels
shall be based upon the assumption that an equal degree of development would be
allowed for similarly situated lands.
   3.   All Development. All development within the Floodway District shall:
      A.   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
      B.   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.

any tributary to the main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage
facility or system.
   4.   Structures. Structures, buildings, recreational vehicles and sanitary
and utility systems, if permitted, shall meet the applicable performance
standards of the Floodway Fringe District and shall be constructed or aligned
to present the minimum possible resistance to flood flows.
   5.   Buildings. Buildings, if permitted shall have a low flood damage
potential and shall not be for human habitation.
   6.   Storage. Storage of equipment or materials that are buoyant, flammable,
explosive, or injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. Storage
of other material may be allowed if readily removable from the Floodway
District within the time available after flood warning.
   7.   Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations
(channel changes and modifications) must be designed to maintain the flood
carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion. In addition, such
alterations or relocations must be approved by the Department of Natural
Resources.
   8.   Fill. Any fill allowed in the floodway must be shown to have some
beneficial purpose and shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary.
   9.   Pipeline Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be buried

designed to be watertight and withstand inundation to such a level.
   7.   Factory-Built Homes.
      A.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the structure
is a minimum of one foot above the 100-year flood level.
      B.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame
ties to ground anchors. Anchorage systems may include, but are not limited to,
use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors as required by the State
Building Code.
   8.   Utility and Sanitary Systems.
      A.   On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located or
designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.

that are flammable, explosive or injurious to human, animal or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or:
(i) not subject to major flood damage and anchored to prevent movement due to
flood waters; or (ii) readily removable from the area within the time available
after flood warning.
   10.   Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as
levees, flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the base
flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for
adequate interior drainage. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources
shall approve structural flood control works.
   Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must be
designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources must
approve such alterations or relocations.
   11.   Subdivision. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and
subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the base flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50 lots
(whichever is less) shall include base flood elevation data for those areas
located within the Floodway Fringe (Overlay) District.
   12.   Accessory Structures to Residential Uses.

162.09 APPOINTMENT AND DUTIES OF BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
   1.   Appointment and Duties of Board of Adjustment. A Board of Adjustment is
hereby established which shall hear and decide appeals and requests for
variances to the provisions of this chapter, and shall take any other action
which is required of the Board.
   2.   Appeals. Where it is alleged there is any error in any order,
requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in
the enforcement of this chapter, the aggrieved party may appeal such action.
The notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board of Adjustment and with the
official from whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason
for the appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to
the Board of Adjustment all the documents constituting the record upon which
the action appealed from was taken.
   3.   Variance. The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in
specific cases such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be
contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary
hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.
      A.   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
      B.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
      C.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      D.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for structures than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance
coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
      E.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
   4.   Hearings and Decisions of the Board of Adjustment.
      A.   Hearings. Upon the filing with the Board of Adjustment of an appeal
or a request for a variance, the Board shall hold a public hearing. The Board
shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing and give public notice thereof, as
well as due notice to parties in interest. At the hearing, any party may appear
in person or by agent or attorney and present written or oral evidence. The
Board may require the appellant or applicant to provide such information as is
reasonably deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or
evaluation of a professional engineer or other expert person or agency,
including the Department of Natural Resources.
      B.   Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal or
variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an appeal, the Board may, so
long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter,
reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in
writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision.
In granting a variance, the Board shall consider such factors as contained in
this section and all other relevant sections of this chapter and may prescribe
such conditions as contained in Paragraph D of this subsection.
      C.   Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board of Adjustment Shall Be
Based. In passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
         (1)   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights
or velocities caused by encroachments.
         (2)   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
         (3)   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability
of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.
         (4)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         (5)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the City.
         (6)   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
         (7)   The availability of alternative locations not subject to
flooding for the proposed use.
         (8)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development
and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
         (9)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for the area.
         (10)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         (11)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.
         (12)   The cost of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer,
gas, electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and bridges.
         (13)   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
chapter.
      D.   Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this
chapter. Such conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
         (1)   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
         (2)   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
         (3)   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed
restrictions.

levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this chapter.
         (5)   Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the
flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration,
rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated
with the regulatory flood. The Board of Adjustment shall require that the
applicant submit a plan or document certified by a registered professional
engineer that the floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory
flood protection elevation and associated flood factors for the particular
area.
      E.   Appeals to the Court. Any person or persons, jointly or severally,
aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Adjustment may present to a court of
record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal,
in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition
shall be presented to the court within 30 days after the filing of the decision
in the office of the Board.
162.10 NONCONFORMING USES.
   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before
the passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but which
is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be continued
subject to the following conditions:
   1.   If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any future use
of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
   2.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be

administrator.
      D.   Waiver of Requirements. Any one or more of the requirements set
forth herein may be waived by the Planning and Zoning Commission for reasons of
safety or engineering, as the Commission may determine. No waiver shall be
authorized or permitted for relief from any of the requirements for reasons
related primarily to the costs of compliance or aesthetic preferences. Any
person seeking a waiver under this section shall submit a written application
to the Commission which shall include a detailed description of the safety or
engineering need for a waiver.
      E.   Exception. The provisions of this section shall be applicable in the
BP-1 District, except the building façade materials allowed are those set forth
in this paragraph. The exterior walls of each building shall be constructed of
permanent durable architectural materials. The front façade and each façade
facing a street shall incorporate brick, stone, architectural block,
architectural concrete panels, architectural wood, architectural steel, glass,
or similar materials in the design. Façade materials required for the front
façade and street side façades shall be continued for not less than 20 feet on
each side adjoining a front façade or street side façade. All other sides of
the building shall be constructed and finished in an attractive manner in
keeping with the generally accepted standards for a high quality commercial/
industrial development. Unfaced concrete block and non-architectural streel

165.11 R-4 RESERVED.
165.12 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
   1.   Intent. The Planned Unit Development District (P.U.D.) is intended and
designed to promote and encourage development or redevelopment of tracts of
lands on a planned, unified basis by allowing greater flexibility and
diversification of land uses and building locations than the conventional
single lot method provided in other sections of this ordinance. It is the
intent of this section that the basic principles of good land use planning
including an orderly and graded relationship between various types of uses be
maintained and that the sound zoning standards as set forth, in this ordinance
and statutes concerning population density, adequate light and air, recreation
and open space, and building coverage be preserved. Although Planned Unit
Development Districts may appear to deviate in certain respects from a literal
interpretation of the Comprehensive Plan, regulations adapted to such unified
planning and development are intended both to accomplish the purpose of zoning
and other applicable regulations to an equivalent or higher degree than where
such regulations are designed to control unscheduled development on individual
lots, and to promote economical and efficient land use, and improved level of
amenities, appropriate and harmonious variety, creative design and a better
living environment.
   2.   Procedure.
      A.   The owner or owners of any tract of land comprising not less than
ten (10) acres to permit construction of at least thirty-two (32) dwelling
units, may submit to the City Council a petition requesting a change to the
Planned Unit Development District zoning classification. Each petition shall be
accompanied by five (5) copies of a development plan, which shall consist of a
complete set of drawings and specifications for the proposed use and
development of the entire tract of land. The development plan shall be referred
to the Planning and Zoning Commission for study and report, including
recommendation, to the City Council. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall
review the conformity of the proposed development with the standards of the
Comprehensive Plan, and with recognized principles of architectural design,
land use planning and landscape architecture. The Commission may approve the
plan as submitted or, before approval, may require that the applicant modify,
alter, adjust, or amend the plan as the Commission deems necessary to the end
that it preserves the intent and purpose of this ordinance to promote public
health, safety, morals, and general welfare. The development plan as approved
by the Commission shall then be reported to the City Council, whereupon the
City Council may approve or disapprove said plan, after a public hearing, as
reported or may require such changes thereto as it deems necessary to
effectuate the intent and purpose of this ordinance.
      B.   If the Council approves the preliminary plan and request for
rezoning, the applicant shall submit within 270 days, or longer period as may
be allowed by the Council, five (5) copies of a final development plan for the
entire tract of land shall be submitted to the Commission. The final
development plan shall then be reviewed by the Commission, for compliance with
the Planned Unite Development District standards and substantial compliance
with the preliminary plan. The Commission’s recommendations and report on the
final development plan shall be referred to the Council for final approval. The
Council shall review the final development plan and approve it if it complies
with the standards of this section and is in substantial compliance with the
preliminary development plan. The final development plan and final plat shall
be approved by the Council and the final plat recorded with the County Auditor
and Recorder before any building permit is issued.
      C.   The Council may make the approval of the development plan contingent
upon the completion of construction and improvements within a reasonable period
of time; provided, however, that in the determination of such period, the
Council shall consider the scope and magnitude of the development project and
any schedule of construction and improvements submitted by the developer.
Failure to complete all construction and improvements within said period of
time shall be deemed sufficient cause for the Council to rezone the unimproved
property to the classification effective at the time of original submission of
the development plan, unless an extension as recommended by the Commission and
approved by the Council for due cause shown. Any proposed change in the
development plan after approval by the Council shall be resubmitted and
considered in the same manner as the original proposal. The term “unimproved”
property shall mean all property situated within a stage or stages of the final
development plan upon which the installation of improvements has not been
commenced.
   3.   Plan Requirements. The development plan shall include, but is not
limited to, the following required items:
      A.   If the proposed development includes common land which will not be
dedicated to the City, and the proposed development will not be held in single
ownership, proposed by-laws of an owner’s association fully defining the
functions, responsibilities and operating procedures of the association. The
proposed by-laws shall include but not be limited to provisions:
         (1)   Requiring membership in the association by all owners of
property within the development;
         (2)   Limiting the uses of the common property to those permitted by
the final development;
         (3)   Granting to each owner of property within the development the
right to the use and enjoyment of the common property;
         (4)   Placing the responsibility for operation and maintenance of the
common property in the association;
         (5)   Giving every owner of property within the development voting
rights in the association;
         (6)   If the development will combine rental and for sale units,
stating the relationship between the renters and the owner’s associations and
the rights renters shall have to the use of the common land; and
         (7)   The association must be established before properties are sold.
      B.   Covenants to run with the land, in favor of the City and all persons
having a proprietary interest in any portion of the development premises, that
the owner of the land or successors in interest will maintain all interior
streets, parking areas, sidewalks, common land, parks and plantings which have
not been dedicated to the City in compliance with the City ordinances.
      C.   Any additional agreements required by the Council at the time of
preliminary plat approval.
      D.   Height and exterior design of typical proposed dwellings and the
number of dwelling units in each.
      E.   A plat which shall show building lines; lots and/or blocks; common
land, recreation areas, and parks, streets within or abutting the proposed
development, existing and proposed easements; parking areas; walks, landscaping
and planting areas; development stages and timing of each; and other applicable
items required by the subdivision ordinance.
      F.   Proposed mitigation along the perimeter of the project for
protection of adjoining properties, such as larger setbacks, buffer yards,
landscaping, walls, fences or other screening, height limitations,
architectural or site design, or other provisions.
      G.   Proposed phasing and timetable.
   4.   Standards. The land usage, minimum lot area, yard, height, and
accessory uses shall be determined by the requirements set forth below, which
shall prevail over conflicting requirements of this ordinance or the
subdivision ordinance.
      A.   Residential properties shall be used only for residential purposes
and the accessory uses as permitted by this section. Uses along project
boundary lines shall not be in conflict with those allowed in adjoining or
opposite property. To this end, the Commission may require, in the absence of
an appropriate physical barrier, that uses of least intensity or a buffer of
open space or screening be arranged along the borders of the project.
      B.   The following accessory uses shall be permitted on residential
properties:
         (1)   Private garage or carport.
         (2)   Occupant storage and similar accessory uses.
         (3)   Non-commercial recreational facilities.
         (4)   Community facilities including municipal facilities, churches
and schools.
      C.   Commercial uses, including business and professional offices, and
retail convenience facilities designed to serve primarily occupants of the
planned development may be permitted provided the following conditions are met:
         (1)   The planned unit development shall provide for a total of at
least one hundred and fifty (150) residential dwelling units.
         (2)   Gross leasable floor area for commercial uses shall not exceed
fifteen percent (15%) of the total development area.
      D.   The Council may require open space or screening be located along all
or a portion of the development boundaries. The maximum height of any building
located within the development shall be thirty-five (35) feet when adjacent to
an “R-1” district.
      E.   All public streets, water mains, sanitary sewer and storm sewer
facilities shall comply with appropriate ordinances and specifications of the
City.
      F.   “Common land” as used in this section refers to land retained in
private ownership for the use of the residents of the development, or to land
dedicated to the general public. The minimum requirement for any P.U.D shall
comply with Van Meter Code of Ordinances 170.32 Park and Recreational Areas.
      G.   Spaces for off-street parking and loading shall be provided in
accordance with the zoning requirements of the zoning district in which the
P.U.D in constructed. Where a P.U.D is proposed and is contained within two or
more zoning districts, parking requirements shall be determined by the City
Council, but shall not be any less restrictive than the existing requirements
of the zones in which the P.U.D is constructed. Parking lot design
considerations shall be as follows:
         (1)   Parking shall be treated as an integral part of the development
in scale, location and character.
         (2)   Parking shall be arranged to discourage through traffic.
         (3)   As appropriate, parking areas shall be screened from adjacent
structures and streets with hedges, plantings, fences, earth berms, changes in
grade, and/or similar buffers.
         (4)   Parking areas shall be designed to allow for drainage of surface
water without erosion, flooding, and other inconveniences.
      H.   Signs on-site shall be subject to the provisions of the “C-1”
classification.
      I.   No stage of a development shall contain less than thirty (30)
dwelling units.
      J.   Developments or portions thereof which are being developed for sale
or resale shall contain common land in area totaling not less than the minimum
requirements of Van Meter Code of Ordinances 170.32 Park and Recreational
Areas.
      K.   Existing trees shall be preserved whenever possible. The location of
trees is to be considered in designing building location, underground services,
and paved areas.
   5.   Development Controls. Although P.U.D.s are intended to promote and
permit flexibility of design and thereby may involve modifications of
conventional regulations or standards, certain requirements which are set forth
below shall be applied to ensure that the development is compatible with the
intent of this Code.
      A.   Surety may be required to ensure completion of recreational
amenities provided in lieu of public facilities, or for mitigating elements
such as screening or public improvements.
      B.   Expect where the City agrees to other arrangements, a P.U.D shall be
comprised of a single owner, or a group of owners acting as a partnership or
corporation with each agreeing in advance to be bound by the conditions which
will be effective in the P.U.D.
      C.   Only those uses that are approved and made a part of the plan, and
subject to any conditions attached thereto, shall be permitted.
      D.   Height, setback, bulk and other requirements set out in the plan
shall constitute the basic for and become the zoning requirements, provided
that refinements may be made through the final plan approval if not defined as
a substantial modification; in lack of any special provisions set out in the
plan, the requirements of the most proximate zoning district, as defined by
use, shall be applied.
      E.   Project phases shall be substantially and functionally self-
contained and self-sustaining with regard to access, parking, utilities,
required open space, screening and transitional element and other support
features, and be capable of supporting required operation and maintenance
activities; temporary provisions, such as turnarounds or access easements, may
be required for this purpose; the initial phases generally should not be
comprised of the most intensive portions of the P.U.D., unless the City concurs
this the most feasible means of developing the property in terms of access,
sewer service or similar physical constraints, or will permit earlier
development of common amenities.
      F.   Attention shall be given to mitigation of existing or potential land
use conflicts through proper orientation, open space setbacks, landscaping and
screening, grading, traffic circulation and architectural compatibility. It is
the intent of this Code to recognize that appropriate use of design techniques
will provide the required mitigation, and thereby eliminate the need for
certain conventional regulations or standards. As examples and not
requirements: orienting views, access, and principal activities away from the
land use needing protection, placing those least compatible activities farthest
from the common boundary and those most compatible nearest, can create an
effective buffer; setbacks in conjunction with landscaping can mitigate
conflicts by providing a visual buffer, controlling pedestrian access,
softening visual contrast by subduing the differences in architecture and bulk,
and reducing heat, and dense landscaping can reduce the width of physical
separation needed for such purposes; proper grading will control drainage, can
alter views and subdue sound, and channel access; fences, walls and berms will
channel access and control visual, sound and light pollution; proper
architectural use of color, bulk, materials and shape will enhance
compatibility and reduce contrast, although details added to the building for
aesthetic purpose without consideration to form and surroundings may be
detrimental rather than helpful; and proper design of pedestrianways, streets
and points of access and proper location of parking areas, will reduce
congestion and safety hazards, and help prevent introduction of noise,
pollutants and other conflicts into areas with less intensive land use. Other
techniques may also be used.
      G.   There shall be a minimum setback of 20 feet for any garage whose
vehicular access faces the street.
      H.   Permanent care and maintenance of open space, recreation amenities
and other common elements shall be provided in a legally binding form. If the
common elements are to be maintained by a owners’ association, the applicant
shall file the proposed documents governing the association for review by legal
counsel for compliance with the following requirements at the time the final
plat or site plan is filed.
         (1)   Membership shall be mandatory for each buyer of successive buyer
of property within the development.
         (2)   The open space restrictions shall be in perpetuity, or
automatically renewable, and shall not terminate, except by approval of both
the owners’ association and the City of Van Meter.
         (3)   The owners’ association shall be responsible for liability
insurance, local taxes and the maintenance of recreational and other
facilities.
         (4)   Property owners shall pay their pro rata share of the cost or
the assessment levied by the association shall become a lien on the property.
         (5)   The association shall be able to adjust the assessment to meet
changes needed.
         (6)   No change in open space use or dissolution of owners’
association shall occur without approval by the City of Van Meter.
   6.   Validity.
      A.   In the event the first development phase has not commenced within
two years after the date of rezoning, or if subsequent phases are delayed more
than two years beyond the indicated development schedule, the developer shall
file appropriate information detailing the reasons for the delay with the City.
The City Administrator shall review circumstances and prepare a report
recommending appropriate action to be taken concerning the P.U.D. The Planning
and Zoning Commission and City Council shall review the matter, and may
continue the P.U.D. zoning with revised time limits; require that appropriate
amendments be made or action taken, such amendments to comply with the
procedures of this section if deemed substantial; continue the P.U.D. zoning
for part of the area, with or without revised time limits, and initiate
rezoning of the remainder to an appropriate district; or initiate rezoning of
the entire parcel to an appropriate district, provided that the rezoning shall
not be to a zone more restrictive than the applied immediately prior to the
rezoning to P.U.D., except after comprehensive planning analysis. The
Commission and Council may schedule such public hearings as deemed appropriate.
      B.   Approval of a final site plan or preliminary plat shall be deemed to
commence development, provided that the permanent placement of construction
materials shall have started and be proceeding without delay within two years
after the date of site plan approval, and a final plat approved within one year
after the date of preliminary plat approval in the event a site plan is not
required. Failure to comply with this provision shall void the site plan and
preliminary plat approvals, and make the P.U.D. subject to review as provided
above.
      C.   The developer shall be responsible for compliance with all
prescribed time limits without notice from the City.

165.24 AMENDMENTS TO THE ZONING ORDINANCE.
   1.   Procedure. The regulations, restrictions and boundaries set forth in
this chapter may from time to time be amended, supplemented, changed, or
repealed, upon initial action by the Council, or upon application by the owner
of the land involved, provided, however, that no such action may be taken until
after a public hearing in relation thereto, at which parties in interest and
citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard. At least seven days’ notice of
the time and place of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City, and in at least three conspicuous places within the
City, one of which shall be the City Hall, one of which shall be upon the
property in question, in the form of a sign approximately two feet square,
posted in at least one location on each officially recorded lot or plot, along
the front lot line of said lot or lots; and one of which shall be on a public
bulletin board. When a proposed amendment affects the zoning classification of
property, and in case a protest against such change is signed by the owners of
20 percent or more either of the area of the lots included in such proposed
change, or of those lots or parcels of land within a 200 foot radius of the
boundary lines of the proposed change, then such amendments shall not become
effective except by the favorable vote of three-fourths of the City Council. No
provision of this subsection should be construed to impact a change in
requirements with regard to an existing zoning classification. In the case of
additional or different requirements for an existing use, the only notice
provided will be publication as required by Code of Iowa Section 414.4 as
amended from time to time.
   2.   Filing Fees. Before any action shall be taken as provided in this part,
the party or parties proposing a change in district regulations or boundaries
shall have deposited with the City Clerk the sum of $75.00 to cover the
approximate costs of this procedure and under no conditions shall said sum or
any part thereof be refunded for failure of said amendment to be enacted into
law.
   3.   Rejection of Amendments. In the event any application seeking amendment
of the Zoning Ordinance is submitted by the owner of the land involved and such
application for amendment to the Zoning Ordinance is rejected by the Council,
no application seeking amendment to the Zoning Ordinance as it affects the same
real estate shall be considered by the Commission for 60 days from the date the
Council rejects the previous application.
165.25 BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.

of Adjustment and the manner of their appointment shall be as provided by
Statute.
      B.   Meetings. The meetings of the Board shall be held at the call of the
Chairperson, and at such other times as the Board may determine. Such
Chairperson or, in his absence, the acting Chairperson, may administer oaths
and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the Board shall be open
to the public. The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the
vote of each member on each question, or if absent or failing to vote,
indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other
official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the Office of the
Board and shall be a public record. The presence of three members shall be
necessary to constitute a quorum.
      C.   Appeals. Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person aggrieved
or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the City affected by any
decision of the inspector of buildings. Such appeal shall be taken within 10
days by filing with the inspector of buildings and with the Board a notice of
appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The inspector of buildings shall
forthwith transmit to the Board all papers constituting the record upon which
the action appealed from is taken. An appeal stays all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the inspector of buildings
certifies to the Board, after notice of appeal should have been filed with him,
that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his
opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings
shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted
by the Board or by a court of record on application on notice to the inspector
of buildings, and on due cause shown. The Board shall fix a reasonable time not
to exceed 60 days for the hearing on the appeal, give public notice thereof as
well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a
reasonable time. At the hearing any party may appear in person or by agent, or
by attorney. Before an appeal is filed with the Board of Adjustment, the
appellant shall pay a fee of $15.00 to be credited to the general fund of the
City.
   2.   Powers and Duties of the Board. The Board shall have the following
powers, and it shall be its duty:
      A.   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any
order, requirements, decision, or determination made by the inspector of
buildings in the enforcement of this chapter.
      B.   To grant a variation in the regulations when a property owner can
show that his property was acquired in good faith and where by reason of
exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a specific piece of property,
or where by reason of exceptional topographical conditions or other strict
application of the terms of this chapter actually prohibits the use of this
property in a manner reasonably similar to that of other property in the
District, or where the Board is satisfied under the evidence before it, that
the granting of such variation will alleviate a clearly demonstrable hardship;
provided, however, that all variations granted under this clause shall be in
harmony with the intended spirit and purpose of this chapter.
      C.   To permit the following exceptions to the district regulations set
forth in this chapter, provided all exceptions shall by their design,
construction and operation adequately safeguard the health, safety and welfare
of the occupants of adjoining and surrounding property, shall not increase
congestion in the public streets, shall not increase public danger of fire and
safety, and shall not diminish or impair established property values in
surrounding areas:
         (1)   To permit erection and use of a building or the use of premises
or vary the height and the regulations in any location for a public service
corporation for public utility purposes or for purposes of public
communication, which the Board determines is reasonably necessary for the
public convenience or welfare.
         (2)   To permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of
a district divides a lot in a single ownership as shown of record or by
existing contract or purchase at the time of the passage of the Zoning
Ordinance, but in no case shall such extensions of the district boundary line
exceed 40 feet in any direction.
165.26 CERTIFICATE OF ZONING COMPLIANCE.
   1.   No land shall be occupied or used, and no building hereafter erected or
structurally altered shall be occupied or used in whole or in part for any
purpose whatsoever, until a certificate is issued by the Zoning Administrator,
stating that the building and use comply with the provisions of this chapter.
   2.   No change of use shall be made in any building or part thereof, now or
hereafter erected or structurally altered, without a permit being issued
therefor by the Zoning Administrator. No permit shall be issued to make a
change unless the changes are in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter.
   3.   Nothing in this part shall prevent the continuance of a nonconforming
use as hereinbefore authorized, unless a discontinuance is necessary for the
safety of life or property.
   4.   Certificates for zoning compliance shall be applied for coincidentally
with the application for a building permit, and shall be issued within 10 days
after the lawful erection or alteration of the building is completed. A record
of all certificates shall be kept on file in the office of the Zoning
Administrator, and copies shall be furnished on request to any person having a
proprietary or tenancy interest in the building affected.
   5.   No permit for excavation for, or the erection or alteration of any
building shall be issued before the application has been made for certificate

166.01 STATEMENT OF INTENT.
   It is the intent of the City that the Mill Street Gateway Corridor be
developed in a manner that provides an appropriate aesthetic entrance to the
City along its primary entrance of Mill Street. The Mill Street Gateway
Corridor District provides for certain requirements for development within the
district compatible with the intent of the City in establishing the Mill Street
Gateway Corridor District. The Mill Street Gateway Corridor District is an
overlay district and does not impact the underlying zoning district. The Mill
Street Gateway Corridor District is intended to:
   1.   Provide development standards for the Mill Street Gateway to the City
of Van Meter consistent with the goals and objectives of the adopted
Comprehensive Land Use Plan.
   2.   Promote flexibility in design, placement of buildings, use of open
space, pedestrian and vehicular circulation facilities, and off-street parking
areas in a manner that will best utilize the potential of sites characterized
by special nature of Mill Street area.
   3.   Provide for the enhancement of the natural setting through careful and
sensitive placement of man-made facilities and plant materials.
Developers shall be encouraged to incorporate features with landscaping that
add to aesthetics and visual attraction of the area.
166.02 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   It is not the intention by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, annul, impair,
or interfere with any existing easements, covenants, deed restrictions,
agreements, or ordinances, previously adopted or issued pursuant to law.
However, in the Mill Street Gateway Corridor District wherever this chapter
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall govern.
166.03 INTERPRETATION OF STANDARDS.
   In their interpretation and application, the provisions outlined in this
chapter shall be interpreted and applied as minimum requirements. Where this
chapter imposes a greater restriction than is imposed or required by other
provisions of law or by other rules or regulations or ordinances, the
provisions of this chapter shall control. This chapter shall not be deemed a
limitation or repeal of any other power granted by the Code of Iowa.
166.04 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as and referred to or cited as the “Mill Street
Gateway Corridor District” of the City.
166.05 SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   Site plan review for development in the Mill Street Gateway Corridor shall
be in accordance with provisions of Chapter 167 of this Code of Ordinances.
Prior to the submission of a site plan within the Mill Street Gateway Corridor
District, a pre-application conference with the City Administrator is
recommended.
166.06 GRAPHIC REQUIRED.
   The applicant must also include graphic renderings that illustrate the
proposed development. Copies shall also be submitted two weeks prior to the
presentation date to all appropriate City designees. These rendered graphic
illustrations shall be used to ensure the approved appearance of the project is
completed and maintained.
166.07 OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS.
   Parking lots should be effectively landscaped with trees and shrubs to
reduce the visual impact of glare from headlights and parking lot lights and
the view from public right-of-way and adjoining properties.
   1.   The parking space requirements listed in Section 165.23 of this Code of
Ordinances shall be incorporated.
   2.   Any additional parking spaces shall be oriented so that no vehicle is
required to back directly into a street right-of-way.
   3.   All exterior parking light structures shall be designed in conjunction
with the overall architectural theme of the project.
   4.   Required parking spaces shall have a minimum size of nine feet wide by
18 feet long exclusive of access drives, aisles or ramps. The length of parking
stalls may be reduced to 16½ feet including wheel stops if an additional one
and one-half feet is provided for the overhang of wheels.
166.08 GENERAL LANDSCAPE AND BUFFER REQUIREMENTS.
   The landscaping requirements are minimum standards and applicable to areas
used for the parking of one or more vehicles to traverse back and forth to
parking spaces, service bays, and loading/unloading areas. The landscaping
requirements shall provide effective buffering of all vehicular use areas,
including service bays, from neighboring buildings and from street view and
shall serve to guide traffic. Walls, fences or other artificial screens to be
used as buffers shall be shown in elevation and perspective. Proposed height
and structural material to be used shall be clearly indicated on the site plan.
   1.   Interior of Lot. Interior lot landscaping shall be provided by
landscaped islands or medians within the vehicular area and shall be used to
guide traffic and separate pedestrian walkways from vehicular traffic. One such
landscaped island or median shall be placed for every 12 parking spaces and
shall be a minimum of 60 square feet in area. Landscaped islands may be grouped
or combined to meet interior landscape requirements provided the total square
footage of any single grouping does not exceed 120 square feet. The use of
ornamental shrubs and coniferous trees shall be encouraged. The ground cover of
the island shall consist of grass and/or shrubs, excluding paving.
   2.   Perimeter of Lot Adjacent to Abutting Property. On the perimeter of the
lot adjacent to abutting residential property, a continuous, unbroken barrier
is required for the purpose of buffering service bays, loading and unloading
areas, and off-street parking or other vehicular use areas exposed to abutting
property.
      A.   The barrier shall be located between the common lot line and the
service bay, loading or unloading area, off-street parking or other vehicular
use area. The barrier shall be a minimum of six feet in height consisting of a
natural material such as wood fence, an earth berm or an opaque hedge or any
combination thereof. Additional buffer strip area may be required for
developments greater than 25,000 square feet of building area.
      B.   At a minimum, one tree shall be provided every 50 linear feet. Such
trees shall be located or grouped between the common lot line and the service
bay, loading or unloading area, off-street parking or other vehicular use area.
The developer is strongly encouraged to use appropriate landscaping techniques
to ensure the overall character of the site is maintained.
      C.   The provisions of this subsection shall not apply when the proposed
perimeter abuts an existing wall or durable landscape barrier on an abutting
property, provided the barrier meets all applicable standards set out in this
chapter.
   3.   Perimeter of Lots Adjacent to Public Right-of-Way. On the perimeter of
the lot adjacent to public rights-of-way, a strip of land of at least 10 feet
in depth located between the right-of-way and the off-street parking or other
vehicular use area shall be landscaped to include one tree for every 50 feet or
fraction thereof. Such trees shall be located between the abutting right-of-way
and the off-street parking or other vehicular use area and shall be planted
singularly or grouped in a planting area of at least 25 square feet. In
addition, a hedge, wall, earth berm, or other durable landscape barrier a
minimum of three feet in height shall be placed along the perimeter of such
landscape strip. If said barrier consists of non-living material, one shrub
shall be planted every 10 feet and abutting the barrier. The remainder of the
required landscape strip shall be planted with grass, ground cover or other
landscape material, exclusive of paving.
   4.   Visual Clearance. To insure landscaped areas do not constitute a
driving hazard, safety triangle setback requirements are as follows:
      A.   At access ways the sight triangle shall be formed by measuring 10
feet along the intersection of each side of the access way and the public
right-of-way line and connecting these two points.
      B.   At street intersections the sight triangle shall be formed by
measuring 35 feet along curb lines and connecting these points.
   5.   Installation of Landscape. All landscaping shall be installed in an
appropriate manner in order to maintain the health and quality of plant
material. No certificate of use shall be authorized unless all landscaping
requirements are met.
   6.   Protection of Landscaped Areas. The placement of barrier curbs or wheel
stops is required to protect all landscaped areas from vehicular damage.
   7.   Existing Plant Material. Existing, healthy plant material on site may
be used as a credit towards fulfilling the landscaping requirements specified
in this section.
   8.   Landscape Vegetation Standards. Landscape vegetation shall consist of
species compatible with conditions in Central Iowa and shall meet the following
standards. Landscaping to be used for screening purposes shall be illustrated
in elevation and perspective as well as plan with the size and exact names of
plants, shrubs or trees to be planted clearly indicated. On all site plans, the
following requirements shall be met:
      A.   Minimum Requirements: two trees or two trees per 3,000 square feet
of required open space, 50 percent two-inch caliper and the remaining eight
feet to 10 feet in height and one and one-half-inch caliper. The trees shall be
balled or burlap stock. The minimum height for evergreens shall be six feet and
may be counted as two-inch caliper for requirements. The trees must live for at
least 12 months after planting or be replaced by the landowner.
      B.   Minimum Requirements. One shrub shall be planted for every 1,000
square feet of open space, but no less than three shrubs per lot.
      C.   Enforcement. Landscaping plan to be submitted for approval as part
of final site plan submittal. Landscaping plan is to show the following
information:
         (1)   Location of trees and shrubs.
         (2)   Size and species of trees and shrubs.
         (3)   Percentage of each size of tree.
         (4)   Type of ground cover and form of maintenance.
      D.   Approval of landscaping in-place is to be requested by the developer
at the time occupancy permit is requested. Any changes or deviation from the
approved site plan landscape design shall be approved by the Zoning
Administrator prior to installation. Landscaping materials shall be planted as
each phase of a site is developed. Should completion of landscaping be delayed
due to season of the year, a temporary occupancy permit may be issued if the
developer posts a bond in the amount of the landscaping not completed. At the
developer’s option and at the time of site plan filing, the developer may
submit a list of alternate or substitute species from the permitted or
established list to be used should the preferred material not be available when
needed and required.
      E.   Ground cover plants shall form a solid mat or cover over the ground
within a 12-month period. Sod shall be employed when grass is used as a ground
cover in Zone 1. Non-living material shall not be used as the primary ground
cover device, but may be used in conjunction with living plant material to
develop an ornamental landscaping effect. Non-living materials such as rocks,
pebbles, sand, wood mulch or wood chips shall be placed at a minimum depth of
three inches and shall be used in conjunction with an appropriate landscape
weed control fabric.

out in the Van Meter Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations; and any
other provisions for public services necessary as determined by the City. No
above ground electrical communication equipment may be located in any set back
from a public street, and all above ground electrical and communications
equipment must be screened from view by the general public by an opaque screen
constructed of either wood or brick.
166.10 BUILDING RESTRICTIONS, EASEMENTS AND COVENANTS.
   The developer of property owner shall with the approval of the City Council
adopt building restrictions, easements and covenants pertaining to each parcel
developed where the developer and the City deem appropriate.
166.11 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   Each parcel shall be developed based upon a single Site Plan with buildings
compatible in design and use of materials. The Site Plan shall contain, but not
be limited to, parts such as an architectural project theme plan, landscape
plan, master signage plan, water management plan, pedestrian and vehicular
traffic plan and parking plan. All new developments shall be built in a
cohesive and uniform manner creating a campus-like setting with all buildings
and the overall site developed as a single or unified development. Any
development shall have a minimum open green space of 20 percent.
166.12 SERVICE BAYS AND DRIVE AREAS.
   The service bay drives, trash receptacles and dumpster areas located shall
not face Mill Street and shall not face abutting residential property. The
purpose of this is to mitigate the negative effect of such service areas, such
as noise, odor, refuse, and visual pollution from residential development and
for motor travelers entering the City.
   1.   All service bays, loading and unloading areas must be screened by an
opaque fence of a height sufficient to adequately screen the bay or area from
Mill Street and consisting of wood or brick. No service bays, loading or
unloading areas, trash receptacles and dumpsters may be located in or face any
set back from a public right-of-way. In cases where a substantial green space
exists a landscape/berm screen can be provided, which must provide a 75 percent
opaque view within 18 months. The majority of the landscape material shall be
coniferous to provide a year-round screen.
   2.   Service bays and drives, trash receptacles and dumpster areas shall be
oriented in such a way that in the process of loading or unloading, no vehicle
will block the passage of other vehicles on the service drive or extend into
any other public or private street.

property line and 45 feet at the curb line, unless an alternative curb cut
width is approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
166.14 LIGHTING.
   The maximum height for any light fixture is 35 feet, except on the side or
sides of a development abutting a residential use, in which case the maximum
height of 25 feet shall be allowed.
   1.   All light structures shall be shaded or hooded and oriented inward so
as to prevent intrusion into surrounding areas.
   2.   All lighting fixtures must be drawn to scale and submitted for review
along with the project plans to allow for a uniform lighting plan in the area.
166.15 FEES.
   Fees for development in the Mill Street Gateway Corridor District shall be:

impacts to existing and proposed developments surrounding the site; (ii) impact
on public rights-of-way, utilities, facilities, and services; and (iii) impact
to existing on-site conditions.
167.03 DESIGN STANDARDS.  
   Site Plans shall reflect the following standards of design which are
necessary to insure the orderly and harmonious development of property in such
manner as will safeguard property values and the public’s health, safety and
general welfare.
   1.   The design of the proposed improvements shall make adequate provisions
for surface and subsurface drainage, for connections to water and sanitary

topography, surface drainage, natural drains and streams, wooded area, and
other natural features which will lend themselves to proper, harmonious and
attractive development of the site.
   3.   The proposed improvements shall be designed and located within the
property in such manner as not to unduly diminish or impair the use and
enjoyment of adjoining property, and to this end shall minimize the adverse
effects on such adjoining property from automobile headlights, illumination of
required perimeter yards, refuse containers, and impairment of light and air.
Lighting, and its impact on adjacent property, shall be shown on the Site Plan.
For the purpose of this section, the term “use and enjoyment of adjoining
property” means the use and enjoyment presently being made of such adjoining
property, unless such property is vacant. If vacant, the term “use and
enjoyment of adjoining property” means those uses permitted under the zoning
districts in which such adjoining property is located.
   4.   The proposed development shall have such entrances and exits upon
adjacent streets and such internal traffic circulation pattern and will not
unduly increase congestion on adjacent or surrounding public streets. Public
streets are required in all multiple-family and townhouse developments. Any
proposed development which will include a loading dock or truck entrance facing
an exterior street must, as a part of the Site Plan approval process, conform
to any and all requirements which may be established by the City with respect
to the location of such loading dock or truck entrance.
   5.   The proposed development shall have such buffers, screen fences and
landscaping and shall be designed, and the buildings and improvements located,
in such a manner as to not unduly diminish or impair the use and enjoyment of
adjoining or surrounding property.
   6.   The proposed development shall not duly increase the public danger of
fire or diminish the public safety, and shall be designed to adequately
safeguard the health, safety, and general welfare of the public and of persons
residing and working in the development and in the adjoining or surrounding
property.
   7.   The proposed development shall utilize stormwater management to limit
the release from any site to no more than a five-year undeveloped release rate.

an existing structure shall not be converted to a multiple housing cooperative
unless the converted structure meets building code requirements in effect on
the date of conversion.
   2.   At least 60 days prior to filing a declaration of horizontal property
regime as provided in Code of Iowa Chapter 499B or articles of incorporation
for a multiple housing cooperative as provided in Code of Iowa Chapter 499A
which converts an existing structure within the City, the owner shall file a
copy of the declaration of the horizontal property regime or the articles of
incorporation of the multiple housing cooperative with the City Building
Official to enable the City to establish that the converted structure meets
appropriate building code requirements.

Notes
1 EDITOR’S NOTE: The ordinance adopting Chapter 173 is Ordinance No. 2021-02
  adopted by the City on February 8, 2021.
173.05 COMPUTATIONS OF THE AMOUNT OF PUBLIC PARKLAND REQUIRED.
   This section shall prescribe the minimum amount of space to be provided in a
proposed development for use as public parkland. Such space shall be required
to be provided for by a developer who, after the effective date of the
ordinance codified in this chapter, seeks to develop land within the City by
submitting a plat or site plan for approval.
   1.   The amount of public parkland required in a proposed development shall
be a minimum of 20,000 square feet and computed as follows:
      A.   Residential Occupancy Per Living Units. In determining the
anticipated occupancy for the proposed development, it shall be assumed that
the following dwellings will accommodate the following number of individuals:
 
LAND USE TYPE (UNIT)
Individuals Per Each Residential Unit
Single-Family Detached 2.8 Individuals
Single-Family Attached 2.5 Individuals
Multi-Family           1.8 Individuals
Mobile Home Each Unit  1.6 Individuals
 
      B.   Public Parkland Per Individual. In determining the space required
for public parkland in a proposed development, it shall be required that 5
acres of recreational space be provided for every 1,000 individuals. Since some
developments will not house 1,000 individuals, the space requirement is to be
applied on a per individual basis. Therefore, .005 acres of public parkland
shall be provide for each individual proposed to be housed in the new
development based on the assumptions contained in Paragraph 1A, above.
      C.   Calculation of Required Public Parkland for Each Development.
         (1)   For single family detached developments, the following formula
shall be utilized:
            (number of lots) x (2.8 individuals/lot) x (.005 acres/individual)
         Example for illustration purposes only: For a single family detached
residential development subject to the requirements of this chapter that
proposes 75 lots, the calculation under this paragraph would be as follows:
            75 lots x 2.8 x .005 = 1.05 acres
         Under this illustration, the developer would be required to dedicate
public parkland of at least 1.05 acres of property within the proposed
development.
         (2)   For single family attached developments, the following formula
shall be utilized:
            (number of lots) x (2.5 individuals/lot) x (.005 acres/individual)
         Example for illustration purposes only: For a single family attached
residential development subject to the requirements of this chapter that
proposes 75 lots, the calculation under this paragraph would be as follows:
            75 lots x 2.5 x .005 = .9375 acres
         Under this illustration, the developer would be required to dedicate
public parkland of at least .9375 acres of property within the proposed
development.
         (3)   For multi-family developments, the following formula shall be
utilized:
            (number of units) x (1.9 individuals/unit) x (.005 acres/
individual)
         Example for illustration purposes only: For a multi-family residential
development subject to the requirements of this chapter that proposes 100
units, the calculation under this paragraph would be as follows:
            100 units x 1.8 x .005 = .9 acres
         Under this illustration, the developer would be required to dedicate
public parkland of at least .9 acres of property within the proposed
development.
         (4)   For mobile home developments, the following formula shall be
utilized:
            (number of lots) x (1.6 individuals/lot) x (.005 acres/individual)
         Example for illustration purposes only: For a mobile home development
subject to the requirements of this chapter that proposes 75 mobile home lots,
the calculation under this paragraph would be as follows:
            75 lots x 1.6 x .005 = .6 acres
         Under this illustration, the developer would be required to dedicate
public parkland of at least .6 acres of property within the proposed
development.
   2.   If a plat or site plan is requested for mixed uses, then Subsection 1
of this section shall apply only to those areas of the plat or site plan
devoted to residential uses.
   3.   The dedicated public parkland may include waterways and ponds, provided
the area of such waterways and ponds is not used to satisfy the amount of
public park land required in Subsection 1 of this section.
   4.   In the case of change of use, redevelopment, expansion, or modification
of an existing use which requires the approval of an amended plat or site plan,
the above space requirements for public parkland shall be based upon the new
lots or new units being proposed for development.
   5.   Where proposed subdivisions abut undeveloped lands, the dedicated
public parkland shall be located adjacent to the subdivision boundaries with
the undeveloped land, at the discretion of the Council, to allow the public
parkland to be increased in size when the adjacent property develops.
   6.   The amount of public parkland required to be dedicated under this
section shall be capped and shall not exceed the following percentages when
compared to the amount of acres being developed.
      A.   Single-Family Detached. The amount of acres required to be dedicated
as public parkland shall not exceed 5% of the total number of acres being
developed as single-family detached.
      B.   Single-Family Attached and Multi-Family. The amount of acres
required to be dedicated as public parkland shall not exceed 10% of the total
number of acres being developed, as long as the proposed development does not
exceed 12 units per acre. If the proposed development exceeds 12 units per
acre, the amount of acres required to be dedicated as public parkland shall not
exceed 15% of the total number of acres being developed as single-family
attached or multifamily.
      C.   Mobile Homes. The amount of acres required to be dedicated as public
parkland shall not exceed 10% of the total number of acres being developed as
mobile homes.
173.06 PARKLAND DEDICATION LOCATION AND MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   Land dedicated for parkland shall be located in accordance with the City’s
Comprehensive Plan and any other relevant planning documents including but not
limited to the 2019 Community Visioning Report, regional park and trail master
plans, and other internal park and green space planning documents. The specific
location of the land to be dedicated shall be acceptable to the City, as
determined by the Zoning Administrator in coordination with the Parks and
Recreation Board and staff, and shall be located and planned with future
parkland dedications to create a neighborhood parkland site that will be no
less than 7.5 acres in size.
   All land to be dedicated to meet the parkland dedication requirement shall
be usable park space as determined by the Zoning Administrator in coordination
with the Parks and Recreation Board and staff, shall not be located within any
floodplain, shall not contain any areas for storm water detention, and shall
have cross slopes no greater than 5%.
   The developer shall be responsible for rough grading, stabilization, and
seeding of the parkland and providing paved public street access, sanitary
sewer services, and water service to the property.
173.07 REQUIREMENTS OF DEDICATION OF LAND OR EASEMENTS FOR TRAILS.
   Where bike/pedestrian or recreational trails are indicated in the
Comprehensive Plan the developer shall be required to dedicate land or trail
easements of at least twenty (20) feet in width. This land or easements, if
recommended by the Parks and Recreation Board and approved by the Council, may
serve to satisfy parkland dedication requirements based on the area of land
dedicated in fee title or by perpetual easement.
173.08 ALTERNATIVES TO DEDICATION OF PUBLIC PARKLAND.
   In such situations as determined by the Zoning Administrator in coordination
with the Parks and Recreation Board and staff where all or a portion of land
for neighborhood parkland cannot be dedicated, the developer shall construct or
otherwise complete park improvements within the neighborhood parkland service
area equal to the value of the required parkland dedication. The value of these
improvements shall be based on the fair market value of the land to be
dedicated. Subject to approval by the City, parkland improvements may include
construction and installation of trails, parking lots, playground equipment,
park shelters, tennis courts, basketball courts, ball fields and appurtenances,
or landscaping and the dedication of land or easements necessary for planned
trails. The developer shall provide written proof of the land’s value and
written estimates of the costs of the park improvements in the form of an
appraisal from a qualified, licensed appraiser.
173.09 STREAM BUFFER DEDICATION CALCULATION AND CREDIT.
   At the discretion of the City, all development, including residential,
commercial, and industrial, that includes land identified in the City’s adopted
Comprehensive Plan as greenways shall be dedicated to the City at the time
development. For purposes of this chapter, greenways required to be dedicated
to the City include all required stream buffers for Type I and Type II streams
as defined in Chapter 102 of the City Code.
   The dedicator of said required stream buffer may request a credit from the
City toward a current or future parkland dedication requirement at the
following conversation rate:
   1 acre of stream buffer dedicated to the City shall be equivalent and worth
0.10 acres of parkland dedication.
173.10 STREAM BUFFER DEDICATION STANDARDS.
   Prior to dedication of any greenbelt or stream buffer to the City, the
developer dedicating the land shall have an engineer complete an analysis of
the stability of all drainageways within the greenbelt or stream buffer to be
dedicated and shall complete any improvements determined necessary by the City
to prevent or stop drainageway erosion and maintain long-term bank stability.
173.11 PARKLAND AND STREAM BUFFER DEDICATION AGREEMENTS AND SURETY.
   At the time of development, the developer shall enter into a written
agreement with the City to detail the parkland dedication, stream buffer
dedication, and/or park improvement. Depending on the timing of the dedication
or park improvement, the developer may propose, and/or the City may require the
developer to provide adequate surety to the City to ensure completion of the
dedication or improvement. The form and amount of surety shall be determined by
the City at its full discretion.
173.12 EXEMPTIONS AND CREDITS.
   The following shall be exempted from the requirements of Sections 173.04,
173.05 and 173.06:
      1.   Alterations or expansion of an existing building where no additional
residential units are created and where the use is not changed.

installation of a non-residential mobile home.
Any claim of exemption shall be made no later than the time of application for
a preliminary plat approval. Any claim not so made shall be deemed waived.
173.13 PENALTY PROVISIONS.
   A violation of this chapter shall be prosecuted in the same manner as
misdemeanors are prosecuted and upon conviction the violator shall be
punishable according to law; however, in addition to or in lieu of any criminal
prosecution, the City shall have the power to issue a civil infraction for any
violation of this chapter and shall be entitled to any fines, injunctive
relief, and other remedies allowed the City under the civil infraction
