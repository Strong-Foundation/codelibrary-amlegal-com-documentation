Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no person owning,
possessing, harboring, or having the care of a vicious dog shall permit such
animal to go unconfined on or off the premises of such person unless the

pen or kennel must be constructed of metal fencing material, which is strong
enough to withstand any pressure exerted by the confined dog or dogs. All
fencing shall be of a type that will not allow a dog to push through and all

lighted and kept in a clean and sanitary manner.
2.Â Â Â Leash and Muzzle. No person shall permit a vicious dog to go outside its

animalâ€™s kennel, pen, or indoor confinement must be muzzled by a muzzling
device sufficient to prevent the dog from biting persons or other animals. No
person shall permit a vicious dog to be tethered on a chain, rope, or other
type of leash. Such dogs may not be secured to inanimate objects such as trees,
posts, buildings, etc.
3.Â Â Â No vicious dog may be kept on a porch, patio or in any part of a house or

windows are open or when screen windows or screen doors are the only obstacles
preventing the dog from exiting the structure.
56.04Â Â Â SEIZURE, IMPOUNDMENT, AND DISPOSITION.
Unconfined vicious dogs may be seized and impounded in accordance with the
following:
1.Â Â Â The Sheriff, a Sheriffâ€™s Deputy, or any animal control officer designated
by the Council, upon receipt of a complaint alleging that a dog is a vicious
dog as defined in the chapter and is unconfined may immediately take said dog
into custody or impoundment using such means that will protect the general
public, the police officer, and the dog.
2.Â Â Â Upon receipt of said complaint and following an investigation, a criminal
complaint may be filed by the Sheriffâ€™s Department against the person owning,
keeping, sheltering, harboring, or otherwise maintaining the dog in question.
Said notice shall set forth a description of the dog and the basis for the
allegation of being unconfined and vicious. The complaint shall be served upon
any adult residing at the premises where in the animal was located or may be
posted on those premises if no adult is present to accept service.
3.Â Â Â Any dog found at large which displays vicious tendencies may be handled as
a vicious dog pursuant to the foregoing, unless the animal is so vicious that
it cannot safely be apprehended, in which case the Sheriff, Sheriffâ€™s Deputy,
or animal control officer may immediately destroy the dog, or unless its
ownership is not ascertainable, it may be destroyed after seven days
impoundment.
4.Â Â Â Any dog which is alleged to be vicious and which is under impoundment or
quarantine shall not be released to the owner, but shall continue to be held at
the expense of the owner, pending the outcome of any court proceeding. All
costs of such impoundment or quarantine shall be paid by the owner of the
animal if determined to be vicious. If the dog is not determined to be vicious,
all costs of such impoundment or quarantine shall be paid by the City.
56.05Â Â Â INSURANCE.
The owner of any vicious dog must provide proof to the Clerk of public
liability insurance in a single accident amount of $50,000.00 for bodily injury
to or death of any person or persons or for damages to property owned by such
persons which may result from the ownership, keeping, or maintenance of such
animal.
56.06Â Â Â VIOLATION AND PENALTIES.

chapter shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a municipal infraction. The
magistrate may order the dog to be removed from the City or the magistrate may

(impoundment) of the dog. In addition to the foregoing, any person who violates

accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHâ€™s are determined from
periodic grab samples.)

1.Â Â Â It is unlawful for any owner, occupant, or user of any premises to direct
into or allow any stormwater, surface water, ground water, well water, or water
from industrial or commercial air conditioning systems (residential properties
may have a 20 gallon per day maximum discharge from air conditioning systems)
to drain into the wastewater collection system. No rainspout, or other form of
surface drainage, and no foundation drainage or sump pump shall be connected or
discharged into any wastewater collection system.
2.Â Â Â Any new or existing construction in which a sump and pump have been or
will be installed shall be required to install, inside the structure, a rigid
pipe connection discharge in accordance with this chapter. It is unlawful to
maintain any connection with the sanitary sewer carrying roof water, ground
water, surface water or any other natural precipitation.
100.03Â Â Â SUMP PUMP AND RIGID PIPE INSTALLATION.
1.Â Â Â A discharge pipe shall be installed through the outside foundation wall of

or piping that is not in conformance with this chapter may lose their plumbing
license privileges in the City for a period of one year, following the
opportunity for a hearing before the Council.
100.04Â Â Â INSPECTIONS.
Property owners shall allow a City employee or a designated representative,
satisfactory to the City, to inspect the building to confirm and document that
there is no sump pump or other prohibited discharge into the wastewater
collection system. The City may periodically re-inspect any building or
premises to determine compliance with the requirements of this chapter. When
ownership of any home or other building is transferred, the building must have
a re-inspection completed and passed within 90 days of the sale date.
100.05Â Â Â REMOVAL OF CONNECTIONS.
1.Â Â Â Any property owner who previously made any connection or installation in
violation of this chapter shall immediately remove such connection or correct
such an installation. If not removed or connected within 30 calendar days after
notice of the violation has been delivered personally or by certified mail to
the owner, the City shall impose a surcharge in the amount provided by this
chapter. The time frame for making corrections may be extended upon the
approval of the Mayor for up to 90 days for cause, beyond the initial 30- day
period.
2.Â Â Â The owner of a building or premises found to not be in conformance with
this chapter during periodic re-inspections shall be subjected to a surcharge
as provided herein starting from the previous date of inspection.
100.06Â Â Â SURCHARGE.
1.Â Â Â Any property owner or contractor/builder refusing to allow the property
under their control to be inspected in accordance with this chapter, in order
to determine compliance, shall within 30 days of the date that admittance to
the property is refused or denied, immediately become subject to a monthly
surcharge which shall be applied to the sanitary sewer component of their
utility bill. This surcharge shall commence on the first day of the month
following the month when either the property owner or contractor/builder refuse
to allow the property under their control to be inspected by the City or to
otherwise validate compliance in accordance with this chapter. This surcharge
shall continue as long as no documentation satisfactory to the City to
ascertain compliance with this chapter has been provided to the Building
Official. This surcharge is intended to offset the added costs associated with
having to treat and collect clear water unnecessarily when the status of a
propertyâ€™s connection to the sanitary sewer system cannot be ascertained.
2.Â Â Â A surcharge of $100.00 per month is hereby imposed on every sewer bill to
property owners for the following conditions:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Not in compliance with this chapter.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Refusal of property inspection.
100.07Â Â Â NUISANCE.
The City may require a property to connect its sump pump discharge line to a
City storm sewer or drainage tile, if available, and if, in the determination
of the City, it is necessary because the discharge from the sump pump is
creating a nuisance or hazardous situation.
100.08Â Â Â PENALTY.
Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall become liable
to the City for any expense, loss or damage occasioned the City by reason of
such violation. The City will also retain any and all civil remedies including,
but not limited to, injunction or abatement actions to remedy a violation.
100.09Â Â Â HEARING.
Any person aggrieved by any provision of this chapter must request a hearing
before the Council within 30 days following an inspection or the imposition of
the surcharge. The finding of the Council shall be final. Any person aggrieved
by the actions of the Council under the provisions of this chapter may seek
such relief through the courts as provided by law.

31.Â Â Â â€œStart of constructionâ€ includes substantial improvement, and means the
date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or
other improvement, was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start
means either the first placement or permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of pile, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a factory-built home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or

the damage occurred. Volunteer labor and donated materials shall be included in
the estimated cost of repair.
34.Â Â Â â€œSubstantial improvementâ€ means any improvement to a structure which
satisfies either of the following criteria:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either:
(i) before the start of construction of the improvement; or (ii) if the
structure has been substantially damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred. The term does not, however, include any project for
improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of State or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions. The term also does not include any alteration of
a historic structure, provided the alteration will not preclude the structureâ€™s
designation as a historic structure.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Any addition which increases the original floor area of a building by
25 percent or more. All additions constructed after the effective date of the
first floodplain management regulations adopted by the community shall be added
to any proposed addition in determining whether the total increase in original
floor space would exceed 25 percent.
35.Â Â Â â€œVarianceâ€ means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of the
floodplain management regulations.
36.Â Â Â â€œViolationâ€ means the failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with the communityâ€™s floodplain management regulations.
160.02Â Â Â STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSE.
1.Â Â Â The Legislature of the State has in Chapter 364 of the Code of Iowa, as
amended, delegated the power to cities to exercise any power and perform any
function it deems appropriate to protect and preserve the rights, privileges,
and property of the City or of its residents, and to preserve and improve the
peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort, and convenience of its residents.
2.Â Â Â Findings of Fact.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation
which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by:
(i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The ordinance codified in this chapter relies upon engineering
methodology for analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the standards
established by the Department of Natural Resources.
3.Â Â Â Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Subsection 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows so
that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03Â Â Â GENERAL PROVISIONS.
1.Â Â Â Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter shall apply
to all areas having special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the City.
For purposes of this chapter, the special flood hazard areas are those areas
designated as Zone A on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Grundy County
and Incorporated Areas, City of Wellsburg, Panels 19075C0160C, 0170C, and
0175C, dated December 29, 2019, which were prepared as part of the Grundy
County Flood Insurance Study, shall be used to identify such flood hazard
areas, and all areas shown thereon to be within the boundaries of the base
flood shall be considered as having significant flood hazards. The Flood
Insurance Study for Grundy County is hereby adopted by reference and is made a
part of this chapter for the purpose of administering floodplain management
regulations.
2.Â Â Â Rules for Interpretation of Flood Hazard Boundaries. The boundaries of the
Special Flood Hazard areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the
official Flood Insurance Rate Map. When an interpretation is needed as to the
exact location of a boundary, the Clerk shall make the necessary
interpretation. The Council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged
that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by
the Clerk in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
3.Â Â Â Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used, and no structure
shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered, without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
4.Â Â Â Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
5.Â Â Â Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
6.Â Â Â Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated special flood hazard areas will be
free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on
the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
7.Â Â Â Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.
160.04Â Â Â ADMINISTRATION.
1.Â Â Â Appointment, Duties and Responsibilities of Administrator.

2.Â Â Â Floodplain Development Permit.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Permit Required. A Floodplain Development Permit issued by the
Administrator shall be secured prior to any floodplain development (any manmade
change to improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to
buildings or other structures, mining, filling, grading, paving, storage of
material and equipment, excavation, or drilling operations), including the
placement of factory-built homes.

improvements and market value of the structure prior to the improvements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Such other information as the Administrator deems reasonably
necessary (e.g., drawings or a site plan) for the purpose of this chapter.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Action on Permit Application. The Administrator shall, within a
reasonable time, make a determination as to whether the proposed floodplain
development meets the applicable standards of this chapter and shall approve or
disapprove the application. For disapprovals, the applicant shall be informed,
in writing, of the specific reasons therefor. The Administrator shall not issue
permits for variances except as directed by the Council.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Construction and Use to Be as Provided in Application and Plans.
Floodplain Development Permits based on approved plans and applications
authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in such
approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement, or construction.
Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that authorized shall be
deemed a violation of this chapter. The applicant shall be required to submit
certification by a professional engineer or land surveyor, as appropriate,
registered in the State of Iowa, that the finished fill, structure floor
elevations, floodproofing, or other flood protection measures were accomplished
in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to the use or
occupancy of any structure.
160.05Â Â Â FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT STANDARDS.
All development must be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and
meet the following applicable performance standards. Where base flood
elevations have not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to determine: (i) whether
the land involved is either wholly or partly within the floodway or floodway
fringe; and (ii) the base flood elevation. The applicant will be responsible
for providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical
information to make such determination. Review by the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources is not required for the proposed construction of new or
replacement bridges or culverts where: (i) the bridge or culvert is located on
a stream that drains less than two square miles; and (ii) the bridge or culvert
is not associated with a channel modification that constitutes a channel change
as specified in 567 IAC 71.2(2).
1.Â Â Â All Development. All development within the special flood hazard areas
shall:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood damage.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant to
flood damage.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Obtain all other necessary permits from federal, State, and local
governmental agencies including approval when required from the Iowa Department
of Natural Resources.
2.Â Â Â Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the base flood elevation. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed subject to favorable
consideration by the Council, where existing topography, street grades, or
other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods used must
be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various forces
and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential structures located in
areas that would become isolated due to flooding of surrounding ground shall be
provided with a means of access that will be passable by wheeled vehicles
during the base flood. However, this criterion shall not apply where the
Administrator determines there is sufficient flood warning time for the
protection of life and property. When estimating flood warning time,
consideration shall be given to the criteria listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa
Administrative Code.
3.Â Â Â Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be flood proofed to such a level. When
floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State
shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to withstand the
flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and other factors
associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the base flood
elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water. A record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in
relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
4.Â Â Â All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including basements)
that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A minimum of two openings, with positioning on at least two walls,
having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot
of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access and
low damage potential storage. Where the distance between the floor and ceiling
of the fully enclosed area below the â€œlowest floorâ€ is five feet or more, the
applicant shall be required to sign and record with the County Recorder a Non-
Conversion Agreement that ensures the lower enclosed area remains compliant
with the criteria outlined in this paragraph.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures must be constructed with
electric meter, electrical service panel box, hot water heater, heating, air
conditioning, ventilation equipment (including ductwork), and other similar
machinery and equipment elevated or flood-proofed to a minimum of one foot
above the base flood elevation.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
plumbing, gas lines, water meters, gas meters, and other similar service

equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above the base
flood elevation.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The structureâ€™s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of Subsection 4(A) of this section.
Exemption from the base flood elevation requirements for such a structure may
result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of the structure
and its contents.
12.Â Â Â Recreational Vehicles.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of Subsection 5
of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built homes when
the following criteria are satisfied.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less than
180 consecutive days; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than 180
consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements of
Subsection 5 of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built
homes.
13.Â Â Â Pipeline Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be buried
in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent
rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
14.Â Â Â Maximum Damage Potential Development. All new or substantially improved
maximum damage potential development shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated a minimum of one foot above the elevation of the 500-year
flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed
to such a level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer
registered in the State of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods
used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact
and uplift forces and other factors associated with the base flood; and that
the structure, below the base flood elevation is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water. A record of the
certification indicating the specific elevation (in relation to North American
Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are flood proofed shall be
maintained by the Administrator. Where 0.2 percent chance flood elevation data
has not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The applicant will
be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with
sufficient technical information to make such determinations.
160.06Â Â Â VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
1.Â Â Â The Council may authorize upon request in specific cases such variances
from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the public interest
where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of
this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances granted must meet
the following applicable standards.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection
for structures than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the applicant
shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator that: (i)
the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage;
and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
2.Â Â Â Factors upon Which the Decision of the Council Shall Be Based. In passing
upon applications for variances, the Council shall consider all relevant
factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or downstream
to the injury of others.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
City.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for
the proposed use.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for the area.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood water expected at the site.
Â Â Â L.Â Â Â The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
Â Â Â M.Â Â Â Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this chapter.
3.Â Â Â Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above, the Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as
it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such conditions may
include, but not necessarily be limited to:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Limitation of periods of use and operation.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes, levees,
and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the Department of
Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative to achieving
the purpose of this chapter.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the flood
protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration, rate
of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated with
the regulatory flood. The Council shall require that the applicant submit a
plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
160.07Â Â Â NONCONFORMING USES.
1.Â Â Â A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before
the passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but which
is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be continued
subject to the following conditions:

of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless
it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
State or local health, sanitary, building, or safety codes or regulations, or
the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
designation.
2.Â Â Â Except as provided in Section
160.07(1)(B), any use which has been permitted as a variance shall be
considered a conforming use.
160.08Â Â Â PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
the requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this
chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction
thereof be fined not more than $500.00 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days.
Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful
action as is necessary to prevent or remedy violation.
160.09Â Â Â AMENDMENTS.
