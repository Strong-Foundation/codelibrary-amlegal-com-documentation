each year by and for the benefit of the State, the City, the County and any
school district or other taxing district in which the such Urban Renewal Area
is located, from and after the effective date of the ordinance codified by this
section shall be divided as follows:
1.   That portion of the taxes which would be produced by the rate at which the
tax is levied each year by or for each of the taxing districts upon the total
sum of the assessed value of the taxable property in the Urban Renewal Area
Amendment, as shown on the assessment roll as of January 1, 1993, shall be
allocated to and when collected be paid into the fund for the respective taxing
district as taxes by or for said taxing district into which all other property
taxes are paid. For the purpose of allocating taxes levied by or for any taxing
district which did not include the territory in the Urban Renewal Area
Amendment on the effective date of ordinance codified by this section but to
which the territory has been annexed or otherwise included after said effective
date, the assessment roll as of January 1, 1993, shall be used in determining

2.   That portion of the taxes each year in excess of such amounts shall be
allocated to and when collected be paid into a special fund of the City to pay
the principal of and interest on loans, advances or indebtedness, whether
funded, refunded, assumed or otherwise, including bonds issued under the
authority of Section 403.9[1] of the Code of Iowa, incurred by the City to
finance or refinance, in whole or in part, projects in the Urban Renewal Area
Amendment, except that taxes for the payment of bonds and interest of each
taxing district shall be collected against all taxable property within the
taxing district without limitation by the provisions of this section. Unless
and until the total assessed valuation of the taxable property in the Urban
Renewal Area Amendment exceeds the total assessed value of the taxable property
in such area as shown on the assessment roll referred to in Subsection 1 of
this section, all of the taxes levied and collected upon the taxable property
in the Urban Renewal Area Amendment shall be paid into the funds for the
respective taxing districts as taxes by or for said taxing districts in the
same manner as all other property taxes. When such loans, advances,
indebtedness, and bonds, if any, and interest thereon, have been paid, all
money thereafter received from taxes upon the taxable property in the Urban
Renewal Area Amendment shall be paid into the funds for the respective taxing
districts in the same manner as taxes on all other property.
3.   The portion of taxes mentioned in Subsection 2 of this section and the
special fund into which that portion shall be paid may be irrevocably pledged
by the City for the payment of the principal and interest on loans, advances,
bonds issued under the authority of Section 403.9[1] of the Code of Iowa, or
indebtedness incurred by the City to finance or refinance in whole or in part
projects in the Urban Renewal Area Amendment.

In order to reduce the danger to the public health, safety, and welfare from
the leaks and spills of hazardous substances, these regulations are promulgated
to establish responsibility for the treatment, removal, and cleanup of
hazardous substance spills within the City limits.
36.02   DEFINITIONS.
For purposes of this chapter the following terms are defined:
1.   “Cleanup” means actions necessary to contain, collect, control, identify,
analyze, clean up, treat, disperse, remove, or dispose of a hazardous
substance.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[1])
2.   “Hazardous condition” means any situation involving the actual, imminent,
or probable spillage, leakage, or release of a hazardous substance onto the
land, into a water of the State, or into the atmosphere which creates an
immediate or potential danger to the public health or safety or to the
environment.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[4])
3.   “Hazardous substance” means any substance or mixture of substances that
presents a danger to the public health or safety and includes, but is not
limited to, a substance that is toxic, corrosive, or flammable, or that is an
irritant or that generates pressure through decomposition, heat, or other
means. “Hazardous substance” may include any hazardous waste identified or
listed by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection
Agency under the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended by the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, or any toxic pollutant listed under
Section 307 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as amended to January 1,
1977, or any hazardous substance designated under Section 311 of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act as amended to January 1, 1977, or any hazardous

4.   “Responsible person” means a person who at any time produces, handles,
stores, uses, transports, refines, or disposes of a hazardous substance, the
release of which creates a hazardous condition, including bailees, carriers,

condition occurs, whether the person owns the hazardous substance or is
operating under a lease, contract, or other agreement with the legal owner of
the hazardous substance.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[7])
36.03   CLEANUP REQUIRED.
Whenever a hazardous condition is created by the deposit, injection, dumping,
spilling, leaking, or placing of a hazardous substance, so that the hazardous
substance or a constituent of the hazardous substance may enter the environment
or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters, including ground
waters, the responsible person shall cause the condition to be remedied by a
cleanup, as defined in the preceding section, as rapidly as feasible to an
acceptable, safe condition. The costs of cleanup shall be borne by the
responsible person. If the responsible person does not cause the cleanup to
begin in a reasonable time in relation to the hazard and circumstances of the
incident, the City may, by an authorized officer, give reasonable notice, based
on the character of the hazardous condition, said notice setting a deadline for
accomplishing the cleanup and stating that the City will proceed to procure
cleanup services and bill the responsible person for all costs associated with
the cleanup if the cleanup is not accomplished within the deadline. In the
event that it is determined that immediate cleanup is necessary as a result of
the present danger to the public health, safety, and welfare, then no notice
shall be required and the City may proceed to procure the cleanup and bill the
responsible person for all costs associated with the cleanup. If the bill for
those services is not paid within 30 days, the City Attorney shall proceed to
obtain payment by all legal means. If the cost of the cleanup is beyond the
capacity of the City to finance it, the authorized officer shall report to the

evacuate people from the area threatened by a hazardous condition caused by the
person.

condition caused by that person, including the costs of assessing the injury,
destruction, or loss.
4.   The excessive and extraordinary cost incurred by the City or the agents of
the City in responding at and to the scene of a hazardous condition caused by
that person.

1.   A person manufacturing, storing, handling, transporting, or disposing of a
hazardous substance shall notify the State Department of Natural Resources and
the Police Chief of the occurrence of a hazardous condition as soon as possible
but not later than six hours after the onset of the hazardous condition or

the Department of Natural Resources.

hazardous condition, and

46.02 Cigarettes and Tobacco 46.04 Parental Responsibility
 
46.01   CURFEW.
The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote the
public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the City and specifically
to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults responsible for
minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors committed after
the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences and criminal
activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.
1.   Definitions. For use in this section, the following terms are defined:
   A.   “Emergency errand” means, but is not limited to, an errand relating to
a fire, a natural disaster, an automobile accident or any other situation
requiring immediate action to prevent serious illness, bodily injury, or loss
of life.
   B.   “Knowingly” means knowledge that a responsible adult should reasonably
be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that responsible
adult’s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful or careless
adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult responsibility
through an objective test. It is therefore no defense that an adult responsible
for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or
whereabouts of the minor.
   C.   “Minor” means any unemancipated person under the age of 18 years.
   D.   “Nonsecured custody” means custody in an unlocked multipurpose area,
such as a lobby, office or interrogation room that is not designed, set aside,
or used as a secure detention area, and the person arrested is not physically
secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically
accompanied by a law enforcement officer or a person employed by the facility
where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to
providing nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate
juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the person’s
parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but
not for longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or
magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
   E.   “Public place” includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys, and sidewalks dedicated to public use and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises, whether publicly or privately owned,
that are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited
commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is
permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has
access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is
considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.
   F.   “Responsible adult” means a parent, guardian or other adult
specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have
custody or control of a minor.

amusement in the City between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. of the
following day on days commencing on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and
Thursday and between the hours of midnight and 6:00 a.m. on Friday and

3.   Exceptions. The following are exceptions to the curfew:
   A.   The minor is accompanied by a responsible adult.

   C.   The minor is present at or is traveling between home and one of the
following:
      (1)   Minor’s place of employment in a business, trade or occupation in
which the minor is permitted by law to be engaged or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of work;
      (2)   Minor’s place of religious activity or, if traveling, within one

      (5)   Assembly such as a march, protest, demonstration, sit-in or meeting
of an association for the advancement of economic, political, religious or
cultural matters, or for any other activity protected by the First Amendment of
the U.S. Constitution guarantees of free exercise of religion, freedom of
speech, freedom of assembly or, if traveling, within one hour after the end or
before the beginning of the activity.
   D.   The minor is on an emergency errand for a responsible adult;
   E.   The minor is engaged in interstate travel through the City beginning,
ending or passing through the City when such travel is by direct route.
4.   Responsibility of Adults. It is unlawful for any responsible adult
knowingly to permit or to allow a minor to be in any public place in the City
within the time periods prohibited by this section unless the minor’s presence
falls within one of the above exceptions.
5.   Enforcement Procedures.
   A.   Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in the
absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driver’s license,
a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance, use his
or her best judgment in determining age.
   B.   Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody. Grounds for arrest are that
the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the person’s
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any nonsecured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into
custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.
   C.   Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into custody,
the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the minor as
soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible for the
minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at such
time as the court may direct.
   D.   Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minor’s parent, guardian or other person
legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the
law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative
of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person
who is known to the child.
6.   Penalties.
   A.   Responsible Adult’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation
by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall, by certified mail, send to the
adult responsible for the minor, written notice of the violation with a warning
that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew
ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with applicable
penalties.
   B.   Responsible Adult’s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as defined
in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows the minor
to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a municipal
infraction.
   C.   Minor’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a minor,
the law enforcement officer shall give the minor a written warning, which
states that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the
curfew ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with applicable
penalties, or, at the law enforcement officer’s discretion, may issue the minor
a citation for a first violation.
   D.   Minor’s Second Violation. For the minor’s second and subsequent
violations of any of the provisions of this section, the minor is guilty of a
municipal infraction.
46.02   CIGARETTES AND TOBACCO.
It is unlawful for any person under 21 years of age to smoke, use, possess,
purchase, or attempt to purchase any tobacco, tobacco products, alternative
nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes. Possession of tobacco,
tobacco products, alternative nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes
by an individual under 21 years of age shall not constitute a violation of this
section if the individual under 21 years of age possesses the tobacco, tobacco
products, alternative nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes as part
of the person’s employment and said person is employed by a person who holds a
valid permit under Chapter 453A of the Code of Iowa or who lawfully offers for
sale or sells cigarettes or tobacco products.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 453A.2)
46.03   CONTRIBUTING TO DELINQUENCY.
It is unlawful for any person to encourage any child under 18 years of age to
commit any act of delinquency.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 709A.1)
46.04   PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY.
The purpose of this section is to preserve the peace, safety, health, and
welfare of the City’s citizens, visitors, and guests. The Council finds that
there has been an increase in the number of criminal acts committed by
juveniles. The Council further finds that those who bring children into the
world, or those who assume a parenting role, but who fail to effectively teach,
train, guide, and control them, should be accountable to the community under
the law. Those who need assistance and training should be aided; those who
neglect their parenting duties should be encouraged to be more diligent,
through civil sanctions, if necessary. This section should be construed to
achieve these remedial objectives by addressing situations where parents or
guardians have failed or neglected to act responsibly or reasonably in the
supervision of their minor children.
1.   Definitions. The following words have the following meanings when used in
this section, unless a different meaning is clear from context or usage.
   A.   “Parent” means a father, mother, legal guardian, or any other person
having (or who has assumed) the care, control, or custody of a minor in the
sense that the child lives with such person and said person looks after that
child, either by court order or on a voluntary basis.
   B.   “Minor” means any person who has not attained the age of 18 years old.
   C.   “Adjudication” means that a juvenile court has entered a finding of
fact that a minor has committed a delinquent act as defined by Iowa law.
   D.   “Informal adjustment” means a disposition of a juvenile investigation
or case which results in a nonjudicial admission of guilt and nonjudicial
agreement between juvenile court services and a minor. For purposes of this
section, a consent decree as provided for by Iowa law shall be deemed an
informal adjustment.
   E.   “Occurrence” means a law enforcement agency has probable cause to
believe a particular child engaged in a delinquent act and has filed a
delinquency complaint with the court based upon such probable cause or has
otherwise taken said child into custody.
2.   Parental Responsibility. The parent of a minor shall not fail to exercise
reasonable control over said minor.
3.   Parental Duties.
   A.   It is the duty of the parent of a minor child to exercise sufficient
control over said minor to prevent the minor from committing any unlawful act
in violation of federal law, State law, or City ordinance. Any occurrence is a
breach of this duty. A second occurrence or an adjudication or the entry of an
informal adjustment agreement involving a minor related to any unlawful act,
and prior notification to the parent of the parental responsibility ordinance
codified in this chapter, including notice of possible fines or penalties,
establishes a rebuttable presumption that the parent failed to exercise
reasonable parental control of said minor.

observe the curfew ordinance codified in this chapter.

adult under circumstances when the parent was unable to personally supervise
the child.
      (5)   Took reasonable and responsible action to prevent, deter, or report
the minor child’s involvement in unlawful activity in violation of federal law,
State law, or City ordinance; e.g., reported stolen property to police, turned
in illegal or dangerous weapons to the police, prevented the minor’s
association with known juvenile delinquents.
      (6)   Sought assistance from appropriate agencies prior to the
adjudication or informal adjustment.
4.   Penalties. Any person who violates this section is guilty of a municipal
infraction violation. A separate and distinct offense shall be regarded as

section.
   A.   Upon the occurrence of a first offense the City will issue the parent a
warning letter which states that the parent is in violation of the parental
responsibility ordinance codified in this section, together with a description
of the nature of the parent’s violation and a statement setting forth the fines
or consequences of future violations.
   B.   Upon the occurrence of a second offense the parent will be ordered to
attend and successfully complete a recognized course of instruction on
parenting skills or techniques. A parent failing to successfully complete such
course may be subject to contempt of court.

vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice
under Subsection 2 of this section. The published notice may contain multiple

97.05   RESTRICTED DISCHARGES; POWERS OF PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR.
If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the
public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in Section
97.04 and which in the judgment of the Public Works Director may have a
deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving
waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public
nuisance, the Public Works Director may:
1.   Rejection. Reject the wastes by requiring disconnection from the public
sewage system;
2.   Pretreatment. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for
discharge to the public sewers;
3.   Controls Imposed. Require control over the quantities and rates of
discharge; and/or
4.   Special Charges. Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and
treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the
provisions of
Chapter 99.
97.06   SPECIAL FACILITIES.
If the Public Works Director permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste
flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject
to the review and approval of the Public Works Director and subject to the
requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws. Where preliminary
treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes,
they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation
by the owner at the owner’s expense.
97.07   CONTROL MANHOLES.
When required by the Public Works Director, the owner of any property serviced
by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Public Works
Director. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner’s expense,
and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible at all
times.
97.08   TESTING OF WASTES.
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from
periodic grab samples.)

cost associated with installation exceeds its estimate. The City reserves the
right to a refund of overpayment if the incremental costs are less than the
amount billed in the estimate. If the City wishes to have a line not scheduled
for replacement or upgrade placed underground, the City shall contact the
Company to make such a request. The City shall cover all costs related to this
work. If undergrounding of transmission lines requires entities interconnecting
with the Company to make adjustments to their electrical systems, the City
bears the responsibility of communication with those entities and, if it
chooses, the cost of converting their facilities from overhead to underground.
The Company reserves the right to review all of the City’s communications with
the affected entities.

   B.   A public or private elementary or secondary school;
   C.   A boundary of any residential district;
   D.   A public park;
   E.   A licensed day-care center; or
   F.   Another sexually oriented business.

structure, or portion thereof, containing another sexually oriented business.
3.   For the purpose of this section, measurement shall be made in a straight

portion of the building or structure used as a part of the premises where a
sexually oriented business is conducted, to the nearest property line of the
premises of a church, synagogue, regular place of worship, or public or private
elementary or secondary school or to the nearest boundary of an affected public
park, residential district, or residential lot, or licensed day-care center.

establishment has been rented and vacated two or more times in a period of time
that is less than 10 hours creates a rebuttable presumption that the
establishment is an adult motel as that term is defined in this chapter.
2.   It is unlawful if a person, as the person in control of a sleeping room in
a hotel, motel, or similar commercial establishment that does not have a
sexually oriented business permit, rents or sub-rents a sleeping room to a

rents the same sleeping room again.

designated street or object and should be drawn to a designated scale or with
marked dimensions sufficient to show the various internal dimensions of all
areas of the interior of the premises to an accuracy of plus or minus six
inches. The Director may waive the foregoing diagram for renewal applications

3.   No alteration in the configuration or location of a manager’s station may

at least one employee is on duty and situated in each manager’s station at all
times that any patron is present inside the premises.
5.   The interior of the premises shall be configured in such a manner that
there is an unobstructed view from a manager’s station of every area of the
premises to which any patron is permitted access for any purpose excluding

premises has two or more manager’s stations designated, then the interior of
the premises shall be configured in such a manner that there is an unobstructed
view of each area of the premises to which any patron is permitted access for
any purpose from at least one of the manager’s stations. The view required in
this subsection must be by direct line of sight from the manager’s station.

duty of any agents and employees present in the premises, to ensure that the
illumination described above is maintained at all times that any patron is
present in the premises.

152.01   PURPOSE.
To permit residential and non-residential solar energy systems as an accessory
use to permitted, conditional, and special exception uses in any zoning
district.
This chapter aims to promote the accommodation of distributed, on-site
residential, and non-residential solar energy systems installed to reduce on-
site energy consumption and associated equipment, as well as adequate access to
sunlight necessary for such systems.
This chapter permits, as an accessory use, solar energy systems, while
protecting the safety and welfare of adjacent and surrounding land uses through
appropriate zoning and land use controls.
A solar energy system shall be permitted in any zoning district as an accessory
use, subject to specific criteria as set forth below. Where general standards
and specific criteria overlap, specific criteria shall supersede general
standards.
152.02   DEFINITIONS.
For use in this chapter, the following terms are defined:
1.   “Accessory use” means a use customarily incidental and subordinate to the
primary use or building and located on the same lot therewith. A use which
dominates the primary use or building in area, extent, or purpose shall not be
considered an accessory use.

connected, utility-interactive, grid-intertied, or grid-direct) means solar
photovoltaic electricity generation systems designed to serve the electricity
needs of the building to which it is connected, thus offsetting a home’s or
business’s electricity usage. Any excess electricity generated is sent to the
electric utility grid, credited via a customer’s net metering agreement with
their local utility. Grid-tied are typically installed without battery back-up
systems to store electricity. As such, these systems provide no power during an
outage. Typical system components: PV panels, inverter(s), and required
electrical safety gear.
10.   “Ground-mount system” means a solar energy system that is directly
installed on specialized solar racking systems, which are attached to an anchor

mount systems may be applicable when insufficient space, structural and shading
issues, or other restrictions prohibit rooftop solar.
11.   “Hybrid solar photovoltaic systems” (aka grid-tied PV with battery back-
up) means solar photovoltaic electricity generation systems designed to serve
the electricity needs of the building to which it is connected, thus offsetting
a home’s or business’s electricity usage, while also utilizing a battery back-
up in the event of a power outage. This is the only system that provides the
ability to have power when the utility grid is down. Typically system
components include: PV panels, inverter(s), and required electrical safety
gear, battery bank, and a charge controller.

south is the optimal direction for maximizing the power output of solar PV.
Although, systems can be oriented east, southeast, southwest, and west, while
still providing 75-85 percent of maximum production, depending on the tilt.
Proper orientation and access to sun are critical for achieving maximum energy
production potential (ideally, the orientation of the solar energy system
ensures that solar access is not obstructed by other buildings, shade trees,
chimneys, HVAC systems, or other equipment).
22.   “Passive solar” means techniques, design, and materials designed to take
advantage of the sun’s position throughout the year (and the local climate) to
heat, cool, and light a building with the sun. Passive solar incorporates the
following elements strategically to maximize the solar potential of any home or
building (namely, maximizing solar heat gain in winter months and minimizing
solar heat gain in summer months to reduce heating/cooling demand; and
maximizing the use of daylighting to reduce demand for electricity for
lighting): strategic design and architecture, building materials, east-west and
building lot orientation, windows, landscaping, awnings, ventilation.
23.   “Photovoltaic (PV) system” means a solar energy system that produces

systems with the fewest components (no battery back-up and not interconnected
with the utility) designed to only provide electricity when the sun is shining.
Typical system components include: PV panels, required electrical safety gear,
and wiring.
27.   “Racking” means solar energy systems are attached securely and anchored
to structural sections of the roof-mounted or pole-mounted systems. Specially
designed metal plates called flashings prevent leaks and are placed under
shingles and over bolts to create a water-tight seal.
28.   “Roof-mount system” (aka rooftop mounted, building mounted) means a solar
energy system consisting of solar panels are installed directly on the roof of
a home, commercial building, and/or an accessory structure such as a garage,
pergola, and/or shed. Solar panels are mounted and secured using racking
systems specifically designed to minimize the impact on the roof and prevent
any leaks or structural damage. Roof-mount systems can be mounted flush with
the roof or tilted toward the sun at an angle.
29.   “Solar access” means the ability of one property to continue to receive
sunlight across property lines without obstruction from another’s property
(buildings, foliage or other impediment).
30.   “Solar array” means multiple solar panels combined together to create one
system.
31.   “Solar collector” means a solar PV cell, or array, or solar thermal
collector device, that relies upon solar radiation as an energy source for the
generation of electricity or transfer of stored heat.
32.   “Solar easement” means an easement recorder pursuant to the Code of Iowa
Section 564A.7, the purpose of which is to secure the right to receive sunlight
across the real property of another for the continued access to sunlight
necessary to operate a solar energy system. According to Iowa law parties may
voluntarily enter into written solar easement contracts that are enforceable by
law. An easement must be create in writing and filed, duly recorded and indexed
in the office of the recorder of the County in which the easement is granted. A
solar easement, once created, runs with the land and does not terminate unless
specified by conditions of the easement.
33.   “Solar energy system” means a system capable of collection and converting
solar radiation into heat or mechanical or electrical energy and transferring
these forms of energy by a separate apparatus to storage or to point of use,
including but not limited to water heating, space heating or cooling, electric
energy generation, or mechanical energy generation. This definition shall
include thermal, photovoltaic, and passive solar systems.
34.   “Solar glare” means the potential for solar panels to reflect sunlight,
with an intensity sufficient to cause annoyance, discomfort, or loss in visual
performance and visibility.
35.   “Solar photovoltaic (solar PV) system” means solar systems consisting of
photovoltaic cells made with semiconducting materials, that produce electricity
(in the form of direct current (DC)) when they are exposed to sunlight. A
typical PV system consists of PV panels (or modules) that combine to form an
array; other system components may include mountain racks and hardware, wiring
for electrical connections, power conditioning equipment, such as an inverter
and/or batteries. For the purposes of this chapter, a solar PV system is
defined as generating capacity of not more than 25 kilowatts for residential
facilities and not more than two megawatts for non-residential facilities.
36.   “Solar panel” (or module) means a device for the direct conversion of
sunlight into usable solar energy (including electricity or heat).
37.   “Solar process heat” means technologies that provide industrial specific
application, including ventilation air preheating, solar process heating, and
solar cooling.
38.   “Solar-ready” means the concept of planning and building with the purpose
of enabling future use of solar energy generation systems. Solar-ready
buildings, lots, and developments make it easier and more cost-effective to
utilize passive solar techniques and adopt active solar technologies in the
future. Solar-ready buildings are built anticipating future installation of
active solar energy systems (including structural reinforcement, pre-wiring or
plumbing for solar, and east-west building orientation). Solar-ready
developments expand this concept to entire subdivisions.
39.   “Solar thermal system” (aka solar hot water or solar heating systems)
means a solar energy system that directly heats water or other liquid using
sunlight. Consist of a series of tubes that concentrate light to heat either
water or a heat-transfer fluid (such as food-grade propylene glycol, a non-
toxic substance) in one of two types of collector (flat-plate collectors and
evacuated tube collectors). The heated liquid is used for such purpose as space
heating and cooling, domestic hot water, and heating pool water.
40.   “Tilt” means the angle of the solar panels or solar collector relative to
their latitude. The optimal tilt to maximize solar production is perpendicular,
or 90 degrees, to the sun’s rays at true solar noon. True solar noon is when
the sun is at its highest during its daily east-west path across the sky (this
is also known as 0 degrees Azimuth). Solar energy systems can be naturally or
automatically adjusted throughout the year. Alternatively, fixed-tile systems
remain at a static tilt year-round.
41.   “Watts” (W) means a measure of the use of electrical power (power (watts)
= voltage (volts) x current (amps).
42.   “Wiring” means the method used to convey voltage and communication from

during a 10-year period, the cumulative cost of which, equals or exceeds 50
percent of the market value of the structure either: (i) before the start of
construction of the first improvement of the structure; or (ii) if the
structure has been substantially damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred.
   The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a
structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or
safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living
conditions. The term also does not include any alteration of a historic
structure, provided the alteration will not preclude the structure’s
designation as a historic structure.
   B.   Any addition which increases the original floor area of a building by
25 percent or more. All additions constructed after the effective date of the
first floodplain management regulations adopted by the community shall be added
to any proposed addition in determining whether the total increase in original
floor space would exceed 25 percent.
35.   “Variance” means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of the
floodplain management regulations.
36.   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations.
160.02   STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
1.   The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 414, Code of Iowa, as
amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure
safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
2.   Findings of Fact.
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation
which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community.
   B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by:
(i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
   C.   This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Paragraph 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
   A.   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows so
that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
   B.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
   C.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
   D.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
   E.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
1.   Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter shall apply
to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City shown on the Official
Floodplain Zoning Map as being within the boundaries of the Floodway, Floodway
Fringe, General Floodplain, and Shallow Flooding (Overlay) Districts, as
established in this section.
2.   Establishment of Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The Flood Insurance Rate
Maps (FIRM) for Tama County and Incorporated Areas, City of Toledo, Panels
19171C0315D and 19171C0430E, dated October 7, 2021, which were prepared as part
of the Flood Insurance Study for Tama County are hereby adopted by reference
and declared to be the Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The flood profiles and
all explanatory material contained with the Flood Insurance Study are also
declared to be a part of this chapter.
3.   Rules for Interpretation of District Boundaries. The boundaries of the
zoning district areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the Official
Floodplain Zoning Map. When an interpretation is needed as to the exact
location of a boundary, the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it
is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
4.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used, and no structure
shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered, without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
5.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provision of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with
this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
6.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
7.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated Floodplain (Overlay) District areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create
liability on the part of the City, or any officer or employee thereof, for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or on any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
8.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.

160.05   ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING (OVERLAY) DISTRICTS.
The floodplain areas within the jurisdiction of this chapter are hereby divided
into the following districts:
1.   Floodway (Overlay) District (FW) – those areas identified as Floodway on
the Official Floodplain Zoning Map.
2.   Floodway Fringe (Overlay) District (FF) – those areas identified as Zone
AE on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map but excluding those areas identified
as Floodway.
3.   General Floodplain (Overlay) District (GF) – those areas identified as
Zone A on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map.
The boundaries shall be as shown on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map. Within
these districts, all uses not allowed as permitted uses are prohibited unless a
variance to the terms of this chapter is granted after due consideration by the
Board of Adjustment.
160.06   FLOODWAY (OVERLAY) DISTRICT (FW).
1.   Permitted Uses. All development within the Floodway District shall be
permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance (or
underlying zoning district) and provided they meet applicable performance
standards of the Floodway District.
2.   Performance Standards. All Floodway District uses allowed as a permitted
use shall meet the following standards.
   A.   No development shall be permitted in the Floodway District that would
result in any increase in the base flood elevation. Consideration of the
effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption
that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly situated
lands.
   B.   All development within the Floodway District shall:
      (1)   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
      (2)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
      (3)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
   C.   No development shall affect the capacity or conveyance of the channel
or floodway of any tributary to the main stream, drainage ditch, or any other
drainage facility or system.
   D.   Structures, buildings, recreational vehicles, and sanitary and utility
systems, if permitted, shall meet the applicable performance standards of the
Floodway Fringe District, and shall be constructed or aligned to present the
minimum possible resistance to flood flows.
   E.   Structures, if permitted, shall have a low flood damage potential and
shall not be for human habitation.
   F.   Storage of materials or equipment that are buoyant, flammable,
explosive or injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited. Storage of
other material may be allowed if readily removable from the Floodway District
within the time available after flood warning.
   G.   Watercourse alterations or relocations (channel changes and
modifications) must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within
the altered or relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations
must be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
   H.   Any fill allowed in the floodway must be shown to have some beneficial
purpose and shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary.
   I.   Pipeline river or stream crossings shall be buried in the streambed and
banks or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due to channel
degradation and meandering or due to the action of flood flows.
160.07   FLOODWAY FRINGE (OVERLAY) DISTRICT FF.
1.   Permitted Uses. All development within the Floodway Fringe District shall
be permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance
(or underlying zoning district) and provided they meet applicable performance
standards of the Floodway Fringe District.
2.   Performance Standards. All development must be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance standards.
Where base flood elevation data has not been provided on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to
compute such data. Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no development
may increase the base flood elevation more than one foot. The applicant will be
responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient
technical information to make such determination.
   A.   All development shall:
      (1)   Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement.
      (2)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
      (3)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
   B.   Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the base flood elevation. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed, subject to favorable
consideration by the Board of Adjustment,   where existing topography, street
grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods
used must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various
forces and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential structures
located in areas that would become isolated due to flooding of surrounding
ground shall be provided with a means of access that will be passable by
wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this criterion shall not apply
where the Floodplain Administrator determines there is sufficient flood warning
time for the protection of life and property. When estimating flood warning
time, consideration shall be given to the criteria listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa
Administrative Code.
   C.   Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level. When
floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State of
Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and
other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the
base flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Floodplain
Administrator.
   D.   All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
      (1)   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including

160.10   ESTABLISHMENT OF APPEAL AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
The Board of Adjustment, hereinafter referred to as the Board, shall hear and
decide: (i) appeals; and (ii) requests for variances to the provisions of this
chapter, and shall take any other action which is required of the Board.
1.   Appeals. Where it is alleged that there is any error in any order,
requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in
the enforcement of this chapter, the aggrieved party may appeal such action.
The notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board and with the official from
whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason for the
appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to the Board
all the documents constituting the record upon which the action appealed from
was taken.
2.   Variance. The Board may authorize upon request in specific cases such
variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances
granted must meet the following applicable standards.
   A.   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
   B.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
   C.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   D.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection
for structures than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the applicant
shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Floodplain Administrator
that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance
coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
   E.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
3.   Hearings and Decisions of the Board.
   A.   Hearings. Upon the filing with the Board of an appeal or a request for
a variance, the Board shall hold a public hearing. The Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the hearing and give public notice thereof, as well as due
notice to parties in interest. At the hearing, any party may appear in person
or by agent or attorney and present written or oral evidence. The Board may
require the appellant or applicant to provide such information as is reasonably
deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or evaluation of
a professional engineer or other expert person or agency, including the
Department of Natural Resources.
   B.   Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal or
variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an appeal, the Board may, so
long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter,
reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in
writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision.
In granting a variance, the Board shall consider such factors as contained in
this section and all other relevant sections of this chapter and may prescribe
such conditions as contained in Subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
      (1)   Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board Shall Be Based. In
passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all relevant
factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
         a.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
         b.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
         c.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability
of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
         d.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         e.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the City.
         f.   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
         g.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.

and floodplain management program for the area.
         j.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         k.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.
         l.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer,
gas, electrical, and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
         m.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
chapter.
      (2)   Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances
as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such conditions
may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
         a.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
         b.   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
         c.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed
restrictions.

levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this chapter.
         e.   Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the
flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration,
rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated
with the regulatory flood. The Board shall require that the applicant submit a
plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
4.   Appeals to the Court. Any person or persons, jointly or severally,
aggrieved by any decision of the Board may present to a court of record a
petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole
or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be
presented to the court within 30 days after the filing of the decision in the
office of the Board.
160.11   NONCONFORMING USES.
1.   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before
the passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but which
is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be continued
subject to the following conditions:
   A.   If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any future use
of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
   B.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
2.   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means, including
flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50 percent of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless it is
reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
State or local health, sanitary, building, or safety codes or regulations, or
the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
designation
Except as provided in Subsection 1(B) of this section, any use which has been
permitted as a variance shall be considered a conforming use.
160.12   PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of

with the requirements of this Zoning Code, record and file all applications for
certificates and permits with accompanying plans and documents, and make such
reports as the City Council or the Board of Adjustment may require.
Certificates and permits for construction and uses which are a special
exception or variance to requirements of this Zoning Code shall be issued only
upon order by the Board of Adjustment. The Zoning Administrator may be a person
holding other public office in the City or in another city or other
governmental subdivision within the local area. ·The City Council is authorized
to pay such Zoning Administrator out of the general fund such compensation as
it shall deem fit.
165.26   BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
1.   Creation and Membership. A Board of Adjustment, to be hereinafter referred
to as the Board, is hereby established. The Board shall consist of five members
appointed by the City Council. The five members of the first Board appointed
shall serve terms of one, two, three, four, and five years, respectively.
Thereafter, terms shall be for five years and vacancies shall be filled for the
unexpired time of any member whose term becomes vacant. One member of the
Toledo Planning and Zoning Commission shall be appointed as an ex-official
member who shall have no vote in Board decisions. ·The City Council shall have
power to remove any member of the Board for cause upon written charges and
after public hearing.
2.   Chairman, Meetings, and Records. The Board hall adopt its own rules of
procedure, not in conflict with this chapter or the Code of Iowa, to enable it
to perform its functions and duties. The Board shall elect its own Chairman who
shall serve for one year. Such Chairman, or in his absence the acting Chairman,
may administer oaths and compel the attendance of Witnesses. All meetings of
the Board shall be held at the call of the Chairman and at such other times as
the Board may determine and at such time and place within the City as the Board
may determine. All meetings of the Board shall be open to the public. The Board
shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each member upon each
question; or if absent or falling to vote, indicating such fact and shall keep
records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be
immediately filed in the office of the Board and shall be of public record.
3.   Appeals. Appeals to the Board of Adjustment may be taken by any person
aggrieved or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the City affected
by any decision of the Zoning Administrator. Such appeal shall be taken within
a reasonable time of that grievance by filing with the Zoning Administrator
from whom the appeal is taken, and with the Board of Adjustment, a notice of
appeal specifying the grounds thereof. ·The Zoning Administrator shall
forthwith transmit to the Board of Adjustment all papers constituting the
record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An appeal stays all
proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Zoning
Administrator certifies to the Board of Adjustment after the notice of appeal
shall have been filed with them that by reason of facts stated in the
certificate a stay would, in their opinion, cause imminent peril to life or
property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a
restraining order which may be granted by the Board of Adjustment or by a court
of record on application on notice to the Officer from whom the appeal is taken
and on due cause shown.
4.   Powers of Board. The Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers:
   A.   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any
order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative
official in the enforcement of this Chapter or of any ordinance adopted
pursuant thereto.
   B.   To hear and decide the following special exceptions to the terms of
this Chapter:
      (1)   Those special exceptions of Use, Height, and Area Regulations which
are enumerated in Section
165.19 of this chapter.
      (2)   Yard variances for Lots of Record and conversion for dwellings as
enumerated in Subsections
165.14(1) and

165.22 of this chapter.

terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest, where
owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the provisions of this
Ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of this
Ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done. The Board shall be
satisfied, by the evidence heard before it, that the granting of such variance
will alleviate a hardship approaching confiscation as distinguished from
special privilege sought by the owner.
5.   Decision. In exercising the above mentioned powers, such Board may in
conformity with the provisions of this Chapter reverse or affirm wholly or
partly or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination
appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination
as ought to be made. Such order or requirement may include imposing conditions
on the variance or special exception requested. Any condition so imposed must
be specific in nature and must be complied with within the time period
specified by the Board. The Board shall determine if the conditions imposed
have been satisfactorily met. Each day any condition imposed is not met shall
be a separate violation of this Chapter.
6.   Relief From Decision. Any person or person jointly or severally aggrieved
by any decisions of the Board under the provisions of this Chapter; or any
taxpayer, or any officer, department, board, or bureau of the City may present
to a court of record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such
decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the
illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within 30 days after
the tiling of the decision in the office of the board, and in accordance with
the provisions of the Code of Iowa.
7.   Fee. Any appeal to the Board of Adjustment shall be accompanied by payment
of a fee of $100.00 payable to the City Clerk prior to any consideration of the
appeal.

may from time to time be amended, supplemented, changed, modified, or
reappealed by the City Council or by petition for change by any person or
corporation who owns some or all of the subject land to be affected by the
petition of change. But no such amendments shall be made by the City Council
without first having received a report on such amendment from the Planning and
Zoning Commission and without first having given official notice of and having
held a public hearing on such amendment as provided by the Code of Iowa. In
case of a protest against such change signed by the owners of 20 percent or
more, either of the area included in such proposed change or of the area
immediately adjacent in the rear thereof extending the depth of one lot or not
to exceed 200 feet therefrom, or of those directly opposite thereto extending
the depth of one lot or not to exceed 200 feet from the street frontage of such
opposite lots, such amendment shall not become effective except by the
favorable vote of at least three-fourths of all the members of the Council.
2.   Fees. Each petition for amendment, except those initiated by the Planning
and Zoning Commission or the City Council shall be accompanied by a check
payable to the City, or a cash payment sufficient in the amount to cover

of any other lawfully adopted rules, regulations, or ordinances, the most
restrictive or that imposing the higher standard shall govern.

reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted, or maintained, or any building,
structure, or land is used in violation of this chapter, the City Council, in
addition to other remedies, may institute any proper action or proceedings to
prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration,
repair, conversion, maintenance, or use to restrain, correct, or abate such
violation to prevent the occupancy of said building, structure, or land or to
prevent any illegal act, conduct business or use in or about such premises.
2.   Penalty. Any person, firm, or corporation who violates, disobeys, omits,
neglects, or refuses to comply with or who resists the enforcement of any of
the provisions of this chapter shall, upon conviction, be fined not more than
$100.00 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days for each offense, and each day
that a violation is permitted to exist shall constitute a separate offense.

outside the corporate limits of the City, the Clerk shall refer one copy of the
preliminary plat to the County Board of Supervisors.
170.12   REVIEW OF PRELIMINARY PLAT.
The preliminary plat shall be reviewed by the Commission to determine its
conformity with these regulations and all other ordinances and regulations in
force affecting subdivisions. Copies of the preliminary plat may be transmitted
to other City or school officials, as the Commission deems necessary, for their
recommendations concerning matters within their jurisdiction. Their
recommendations, along with those of the City Engineer, shall be transmitted to
the Commission within three weeks after the date the plat is filed. The
Commission may confer with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the
kind and extent of such improvements to be made.
170.13   ACTION BY THE COMMISSION.
The Commission, as soon as possible, but within 30 days after receiving the
preliminary plat, shall pass upon the preliminary plat as originally submitted
or modified. If the Commission does not act within 30 days, the preliminary
plat shall be deemed to be approved; provided, however, the subdivider may
agree to an extension of the time period, not to exceed an additional 60 days.
It shall then set forth its recommendations in writing, whether of approval,
modification, or disapproval.
1.   Reasons for Changes or Disapproval. In the event that substantial changes
or modifications are made by the Commission or the Commission recommends
disapproval of the plat, it shall give its reasons therefor and it may request
and cause the revised preliminary plat to be resubmitted in the same manner as
the original plat.
2.   Tentative Approval. If the Commission recommends approval, it shall
express its approval as “Tentative Approval” and state the conditions of such
approval, if any.
3.   Documenting Approval. The action of the Commission shall be documented on
seven copies of the preliminary plat, referenced and attached to any conditions
determined. One copy shall be returned to the subdivider, one copy shall be
retained by the Commission, and five copies shall be referred to the Council.
170.14   ACTION BY COUNCIL.
Within 30 days of its receipt of the preliminary plat, the Council shall, by
resolution, tentatively approve or disapprove the plat. If the preliminary plat
is disapproved, objections to it shall be returned to the Commission for
further review and the Clerk shall notify the subdivider of such action. If
approved, the Clerk shall affix his or her signature to five copies of the
preliminary plat with the notation of the date the preliminary plat received
the Council’s tentative approval. One copy shall be returned to the Commission
and three copies shall be returned to the subdivider. The “Tentative Approval”
by the Council shall not constitute final acceptance of the addition or
subdivision by the City but an authorization to proceed with preparation of the
final plat.
170.15   EFFECTIVE PERIOD OF TENTATIVE APPROVAL.
The tentative approval of a preliminary plat shall be effective for a period of
one year, at the end of which time final approval must have been obtained. Any
plat not receiving final approval within this period of time shall be void, and
the subdivider shall be required to resubmit a new plat for tentative approval
subject to all new zoning restrictions and subdivision regulations.
170.16   COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Before the Council will approve the final plat, all of the required
improvements shall be constructed and either accepted by formal resolution of
the Council. Before passage of said resolution of acceptance, the City Engineer
shall report that said improvements meet all City specifications and ordinances
or other City requirements, and the agreements between subdivider and the City.
170.17   PERFORMANCE BOND.
The completion requirement for improvements may be waived in whole or in part
if the subdivider will post a performance bond with the Council guaranteeing
that improvements not completed will be constructed within a period of one year
from final acceptance of the plat. However, final acceptance of the plat will
not constitute final acceptance by the City of any improvements to be
constructed. Improvements will be accepted only after their construction has
been completed. Such performance bond shall be satisfactory to the City
Attorney as to form, sufficiency, and manner of execution. Upon recommendation
of the Commission, the Council may extend the completion date set forth in the
bond for a maximum period of one additional year.
170.18   FINAL PLAT.
The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as approved,
and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that portion of the
approved preliminary plat which the subdivider proposes to record and develop
at the time, provided, however, that such portion conforms to all requirements
of these regulations.
170.19   REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINAL PLAT.
The following graphic and descriptive material is required to be provided on
the final plat and in the accompanying material.
1.   Contents of the Final Plat. Every plat of a subdivision offered for record
shall conform to all of the following provisions where applicable:
   A.   The plat shall be a permanent copy or a photographic print made on a
stable plastic film. Exact copies of the plat to be recorded shall be provided
to and filed with the County Recorder, Assessor, and Auditor. The original plat
drawing shall remain the property of the registered land surveyor.
   B.   The size of each sheet showing any portion of the subdivided lands
shall not be greater than 18 inches by 24 inches or less than 8 and one-half
inches by 11 inches.
   C.   Whenever more than one sheet is used to accurately portray the lands
subdivided, each sheet shall display the number of the sheet and the total
number of sheets included in the plat, as well as clearly labeled match lines
indicating where the other sheets adjoin. An index sheet shall be provided to
show the relationship between the sheets.
   D.   A maximum scale of 100 feet to one inch shall be used. The scale used
shall be clearly stated and graphically illustrated by a bar scale drawn on
every sheet showing any portion of the lands subdivided.
   E.   Subdivisions shall be designated, by name or as otherwise prescribed,
in bold letters inside the margin at the top of each sheet included in the
plat.
   F.   An arrow indicating the northern direction shall be drawn in a
prominent place on each sheet included in the plat, as well as the scale and
date.

by a direct bearing reference or by an angle between the boundary line and an
intersecting line having a shown bearing, except when the boundary line has an
irregular or constantly changing course, as along a body of water, or when a
description of the boundary line is better achieved by measurements shown at
points or intervals along a meander line having a shown course. All bearings
and angles shown shall be given to at least the nearest minute of arc.
   K.   Curve data shall be stated in terms of radius, central angle and
tangent, or length of curve. In all cases, the curve data must be shown for the
line affected.
   L.   The minimum unadjusted acceptable error of closure for all subdivision
boundaries shall be 1:10,000 and shall be 1:5,000 for any individual lot.
   M.   When any lot or portion of the subdivision is bounded by an irregular
line, the major portion of that lot or subdivision shall be enclosed by a
meander line showing complete data with distances along all lines extending
beyond the enclosure to the irregular boundary shown with as much certainty as
can be determined or as “more or less,” if variable. In all cases, the true
boundary shall be clearly indicated on the plat.
   N.   All interior excepted parcels shall be clearly indicated and labeled,
“not a part of this plat.”

whole of a previously recorded subdivision, sufficient ties shall be shown to
controlling lines appearing on the earlier plat to permit an overlay to be
made. Re-subdivisions shall be labeled as such in a subtitle following the name
of the subdivision wherever the name appears on the plat.
   P.   The purpose of any easement shown on the plat shall be clearly stated
and shall be confined to only those easements pertaining to public utilities
including gas, power, telephone, water, sewer, and such drainage easements as
are deemed necessary for the orderly development of the land encompassed within
the plat.
   Q.   A strip of land shall not be reserved by the subdivider unless the land

platted and shall note the encumbrances, along with any bonds securing the
encumbrances.
   D.   A resolution and certificate for approval by the Council and for
signatures of the Mayor and Clerk.

will provide the necessary improvements and installations and assess the costs
against the subdivider or future property owners in the subdivision.
   G.   The encumbrance bond, if any.
170.20   SUBMISSION OF FINAL PLAT.
The subdivider shall prepare a final plat in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter and applicable sections of the Code of Iowa, and shall file with
the Clerk an application in triplicate for the final approval of the plat. The
application shall:
1.   Forms and Fees. Be made on forms available from the Clerk together with a
fee of $10.00 per lot.
2.   Number of Copies of Plat. Be accompanied by a minimum of 10 copies of the

4.   Time of Submission. Be presented to the Clerk at least four weeks prior to
the regular meeting of the Commission.
170.21   REFERRAL OF FINAL PLAT.
The Clerk shall immediately refer two copies of the final plat to the City

outside the corporate limits of the City, the Clerk shall refer one copy of the
final plat to the County Board of Supervisors.
170.22   ACTION BY THE COMMISSION.
The Commission shall, upon receiving the final plat, as soon as possible, but
within 30 days of receiving the final plat, consider the final plat, and if the
same is recommended for approval, shall submit its recommendation of approval
to the Council together with a certified copy of its resolution showing the
action of the Commission. If the Commission recommends approval of the final
plat, such approval and the date thereof shall be noted on the plat over the

returned to the subdivider.
170.23   ACTION BY THE COUNCIL.
Upon receipt of the certification by the Commission, the Council shall, within
60 days, either approve or disapprove the final plat.
1.   Disapproval of Plat. In the event that said plat is disapproved by the
Council, such disapproval shall be expressed in writing and shall point out
wherein said proposed plat is objectionable.
2.   Acceptance of Plat. In the event that said plat is found to be acceptable
and in accordance with this chapter, the Council shall accept the same.
3.   Final Approval and Recording of Plat. The passage of a resolution by the
Council accepting the plat shall constitute final approval of the platting of
the area shown on the final plat, but the subdivider or owner shall cause such
plat to be recorded in the office of the County Recorder, and shall file
satisfactory evidence of such recording in the office of the Clerk before the
City shall recognize the plat as being in full force and effect.
170.24   RE-SUBDIVISION OF LAND.
The following requirements shall govern the re-subdividing of land.
1.   Procedure for Re-subdividing. For any change in a map of an approved or
recorded subdivision plat, if such change affects any street layout shown on
such map, or area reserved for public use indicated on the map, or any lot
line, or if it affects any map or plan legally established prior to the
adoption of any regulations controlling subdivisions, such parcel shall be
approved by the same procedure, rules, and regulations as for a subdivision.
2.   Acreage Lots. Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision
plat shows one or more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are
indications that such lots will eventually be re-subdivided into smaller
building sites, the Commission and Council may require that such parcel of land
allow for future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent
streets. Easements providing for the future opening and extension of such
streets may be made a requirement of the plat.
170.25   COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Before the final plat is approved by the Council, all applicants shall be
required to complete, in accordance with the Council’s decision and to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer, all the street, sanitary sewer, water, and
other improvements as required in these regulations, specified in the final
plat, and as approved by the Council, and to dedicate the same to the City,
free and clear of all liens and encumbrances on the property and public
improvements thus dedicated.
170.26   PERFORMANCE BOND.
The Council, in its discretion, may waive the requirement that the applicant
complete and dedicate all public improvements prior to approving the final
plat, and that, as an alternative, the applicant post a bond at the time of
application for final plat approval in an amount estimated by the Council as
sufficient to secure to the City the satisfactory construction, installation,
and dedication of the incomplete portion of required improvements. In addition:
1.   Approved By City Attorney. Such performance bond shall comply with all
statutory requirements and shall be satisfactory to the City Attorney as to
form, sufficiency, and manner of execution as set forth in these regulations.
2.   Completion Period. The period within which required improvements must be
completed shall be specified by the Council in the resolution approving the
final plat shall be incorporated in the bond, and shall not exceed one year
from date of final approval.
3.   Extension of Completion Period. The performance bond shall be approved by
the Council as to the amount and surety and conditions satisfactory to the
Council. The Commission may, upon proof of difficulty, recommend to the Council
an extension of the completion date set forth in such bond for a maximum period
of one additional year. The Council may at any time during the period of such
bond accept a substitution of principal or sureties on the bond.
4.   Temporary Improvements. The applicant shall build and pay for all costs of
temporary improvements required by the Council and shall maintain same for the
period specified by the Council. Prior to the construction of any temporary
facility or improvement, the developer shall file with the City a separate
suitable bond for temporary facilities, which bond shall insure that the
temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained, and removed.
5.   Failure to Complete Improvement. For subdivisions for which no performance
bond has been posted, if the improvements are not completed within the period
specified by the Council in the resolution approving the plat, the approval
shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases where a performance bond has
been posted and required improvements have not been installed within the terms
of such performance bond, the City may declare the bond to be in default and
require that all the improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the
building development at the time the bond is declared to be in default.
170.27   INSPECTION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
The Council shall provide for inspection of required improvements during
construction and insure their satisfactory completion. The applicant shall pay
to the City an inspection fee equal to the actual cost of inspection. These
fees shall be due and payable upon demand of the City and no building permits
or certificates of occupancy shall be issued until all fees are paid. The
subdivider shall furnish the Council with a construction schedule prior to the
commencement of any and all construction, and notify the City not less than 24
hours in advance of readiness for required inspections.
170.28   RELEASE OR REDUCTION OF PERFORMANCE BOND.
The performance bond may not be released or reduced except as follows:
1.   Certificate of Satisfactory Completion. The Council will not accept
dedication of required improvements, nor release or reduce a performance bond,
until the City Engineer has submitted a certificate stating that all required
improvements have been satisfactorily completed and until the applicant’s
engineer has certified to the City through submission of detailed “as built”
plans of the subdivision indicating location, dimensions, materials and other
information required by the City, that all public improvements are in
accordance with construction plans for the subdivision.
2.   Reduction of Performance Bond. A performance bond may be reduced upon
actual dedication of public improvements and then only to the ratio that the
public improvement dedicated bears to the total public improvements for the
plat.
170.29   MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Improvements shall be maintained and a maintenance bond provided as follows:
1.   Maintenance of Improvements Before Acceptance. The applicant shall be
required to maintain all improvements on the individual subdivided lots and
provide for snow removal on streets and sidewalks, if required, until
acceptance of said improvements by the Council. If there are any certificates
of occupancy on a street not dedicated to the City, the City may, on 12-hours’
notice, plow the street or effect emergency repairs and charge same to
applicant.
2.   Maintenance Bond. The applicant shall be required to file a maintenance
bond with the Council, prior to dedication, in an amount considered adequate by
the Council and in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney, in order to assure
the satisfactory condition of the required improvements for a period of two
years after the date of their acceptance by the Council and dedication of same
to the Council.
170.30   DEFERRAL OR WAIVER OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
Required improvements may be deferred or waived as follows:
1.   Waiver of Required Improvements. The Council may defer or waive at the
time of final approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any
or all such improvements as in its judgment are not requisite in the interests
of the public health, safety, and general welfare, or which are inappropriate
because of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities.
2.   Deferral of Required Improvements. Whenever it is deemed necessary by the
Council to defer the construction of any improvement required herein because of
incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate or lack of connecting
facilities, or for other reasons, the applicant shall pay his or her share of
the costs of the future improvements to the City prior to the approval of the
final plat, or the applicant may post a bond insuring completion of said
improvements upon demand of the City.
170.31   ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY.
No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the extent of street
improvement is adequate for vehicular access by the prospective occupant and by
police and fire equipment.
170.32   IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.
The subdivider shall install and construct all improvements required by these
regulations in accordance with the specifications and under the supervision of
the Council and to its satisfaction.
170.33   DESIGN STANDARDS ARE MINIMUM.
The standards and details of design herein contained are intended only as
minimum requirements so that the general arrangement and layout of a
subdivision may be adjusted to a wide variety of circumstances. However, in the
design and development of the subdivision, the subdivider shall use standards
consistent with the site conditions so as to assure an economical, pleasant,
and durable neighborhood.
170.34   CONFORMANCE TO APPLICABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS.
In addition to the requirements established herein, all subdividers shall

6.   Plat Approval and Conformity. Plat approval may be withheld if a
subdivision is not in conformance with the above guides or policy and purposes
of these regulations.
170.35   SUBDIVISION NAME.
The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate, or too closely
approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision in the area covered
by these regulations. The Council, after consultation with the Commission,
shall have the final authority to designate the name of the subdivision which
shall be determined at preliminary plat approval.
170.36   MONUMENTATION.
Monuments shall be in conformance with the following requirements:
1.   Establishment of Permanent Control Monuments. Prior to the offering of the
plat of any subdivision for record, the surveyor shall confirm the prior
establishment of permanent control monuments at each controlling corner on the
boundaries of the parcel or tract of land being subdivided. If no permanent
control monuments exist, the surveyor shall establish at least two permanent
control monuments for each block created, or if the area subdivided into lots
is less than a block in size, at least two permanent control monuments shall be
established for the subdivision. Permanent control monuments shall be
constructed of reasonably permanent material solidly embedded in the ground and
capable of being detected by commonly used magnetic or electronic equipment.
The surveyor shall affix a cap of reasonably inert material bearing an embossed
or stencil cut marking of the Iowa registration number of the surveyor to the
top of the monument.
2.   Other Monuments of Record. Other monuments established prior to the
recording of the plat of the subdivision and described on the plat shall be
considered monuments of record and shall be given the same weight as original
permanent control monuments if the monuments remain undisturbed in their
original positions. The additional monuments shall be constructed and embedded
according to the provisions for permanent control monuments prescribed in
Subsection 1 of this section.
3.   Establishment and Recording of Other Monuments. Monuments other than the
permanent control monuments required in Subsection 1 of this section shall not
be required to be established before the recording of the plat or the
conveyancing of lands by reference to the plat if the registered land surveyor
includes in the surveyor’s statement on the plat that the additional monuments
required by these regulations shall be established before a specified future
date.
4.   Additional Monuments Required. Additional monuments shall be constructed
and embedded according to the provisions for permanent control monuments
prescribed in Subsection 1 of this section, and shall be set in all of the
following locations whether set prior to the recording of the plat, or
subsequent to such recording:
   A.   At every corner and angle point of every lot, block, or parcel of land
created.
   B.   At every point of intersection of the outer boundary of the subdivision
with an existing or created right-of-way line of any street, railroad, or other
way.
   C.   At every point of curve, tangency, reversed curve, or compounded curve
on every right-of-way line established.
5.   Placement of Monument. When the placement of a monument required by this
chapter at the prescribed location is impractical, it is permissible to
establish a reference monument in close proximity to the prescribed location.
If the reference monument is established prior to the recording of the plat and
its location properly shown on the plat, the reference monument shall have the
same status as other monuments of record. Where any point requiring
monumentation has been previously monumented, the existence of the monument
shall be confirmed by the surveyor. The existing monument shall be considered a
monument of record when properly shown and described on the recorded plat.
170.37   CHARACTER OF THE LAND.
Land which the City finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or development due
to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth
formations or topography, utility easements, or other features which will
reasonably be harmful to the safety, health, and general welfare of the present
or future inhabitants of the subdivision or its surrounding areas or both,
shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are formulated by
the subdivider and approved by the Council, upon recommendation of the
Commission, to solve the problems created by the unsuitable land conditions.
Such land shall be set aside for uses as shall not involve such a danger.
170.38   LOTS.
The lot size, width, depth, shape, and orientation shall be appropriate for the
location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use
contemplated.
1.   Lot Size. Minimum lot dimensions and sizes shall conform to the
requirements of the zoning regulations where applicable, but in no case shall a
lot contain less than 5,000 square feet of area or be less than 50 feet wide
measured at the building line.
   A.   Residential lots where not served by public sewer shall be of
sufficient size, as determined by the City and subject to any applicable State
or County rules or regulations, to accommodate the type of private sewage
disposal system proposed by the developer.

industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service and
parking facilities required by the type of use and development contemplated.
   C.   Corner lots for residential use shall have an extra 20 feet of width to
permit appropriate building setback from and orientation to both streets.
2.   Street Access. Each lot shall be provided with satisfactory access to a
public street.
3.   Double Frontage and Reverse Frontage Lots. Double frontage and reverse
frontage lots shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of
residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific
disadvantages of topography and orientation. A planting screen easement of at
least 10 feet, and across which there shall be no right of access, shall be
provided along the line of lots abutting such a traffic artery or other
disadvantageous use.
4.   Side Lot Lines. Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles to
straight street lines or radial to curved street lines.
5.   Lot Drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage
away from all buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with
the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so
as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent
lots.
6.   Building Lines. Building lines conforming with zoning standards shall be
shown on all lots within the platted area. Where the subdivided area is not
under zoning control, the Council may require building lines in accordance with
the needs of each subdivision.
170.39   BLOCKS.
Blocks shall conform to the following requirements:
1.   Provision for Lots. Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two
tiers of lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions shall be permitted in blocks
adjacent to arterial streets, railroads, or waterways.
2.   Design Considerations. The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be
determined with due regard to:
   A.   Provision for adequate building sites.
   B.   Zoning requirements where applicable.
   C.   Topography.
   D.   Needs for convenient access, circulation, control, and safety of street
traffic.
3.   Block Lengths. The lengths of blocks shall be appropriate to the type of
development contemplated, but block lengths in residential developments shall
not exceed 2,000 feet, or be less than 500 feet. Wherever practicable, blocks
along arterials and collector streets shall not be less than 1,000 feet in
length.
4.   Easement Reservation. In blocks over 800 feet in length, the Council may
require the reservation of an easement to accommodate utilities, drainage
facilities, or pedestrian traffic.
5.   Pedestrian Crosswalks. Pedestrian crosswalks, not less than 10 feet wide,
may be required by the Council through the center of blocks more than 800 feet
in length. Pedestrian crosswalks shall not exceed 12 percent in grade unless
steps of an approved design are to be constructed.
170.40   STREETS – GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
Streets shall conform with the following general requirements:
1.   Frontage on Improved Roads. No subdivision shall be approved unless the
area to be subdivided shall have frontage on and access from an existing
street.
2.   Grading and Improvement Plan. Streets shall be graded and improved and
conform to the City construction standards and specifications and shall be
approved as to design and specifications by the City Engineer, in accordance
with the construction plans required to be submitted.
3.   Topography and Arrangement. Streets shall be in conformance with the
following requirements related to topography and arrangement:
   A.   Streets shall be related appropriately to be topography. All streets
shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as possible of the building sites at
or above the grades of the streets. Grades of streets shall conform as closely
as possible to the original topography. A combination of steep grades and
curves shall be avoided. Specific standards are contained in the design
standards of these regulations.
   B.   All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed
system of streets and dedicated right-of-way.
   C.   All arterials shall be properly related to special traffic generators
such as industries, business districts, schools, churches and shopping centers;
to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and proposed land uses.
   D.   Municipal service streets shall be laid out to conform as much as
possible to the topography to discourage use by through traffic, to permit
efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of
streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property.
   E.   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract
to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions,
or unless, in the opinion of the Council, such extension is not necessary or
desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the
existing layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts.
   F.   In business and industrial developments, the streets and other
accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings,
location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and
maneuvering areas, walks, and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of
movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian.
4.   Access to State or County Jurisdictional Roads. Whenever any part of a
subdivision is designed with access to a road under State or County
jurisdiction, permission for access to such roads shall be obtained from the
appropriate jurisdiction and such access shall be designed according to the
standards of the appropriate jurisdiction.
5.   Access to Arterial Streets. Where a subdivision borders on or contains an
existing or proposed arterial street, the Council may require that lot access
to such streets be limited by one of the following means:
   A.   Lots shall be designed so as to back onto the primary arterial and
front onto a parallel municipal service street; no access shall be provided
from the arterial street, and screening shall be provided in a strip of land
along the rear property line of such lots.
   B.   A series of culs-de-sac entered from, and designed generally at, right
angles to such a parallel street, with the rear lines of their terminal lots
backing onto the arterial street.
   C.   A frontage or service road, separated from the primary arterial by a
planting or grass strip and having access thereto at suitable points.
6.   Street Names. Streets that are in alignment with others already existing
shall bear the name of the existing streets. The proposed names of new streets
shall not duplicate or sound similar to existing street names. Street names
shall be subject to the approval of the Council and Commission.
7.   Street Name Signs. Street name signs are to be placed at all intersections
within or abutting the subdivision, the type and location of which to be
approved by the Council. The City shall install all street name signs. The
applicant shall deposit with the City at the time of final subdivision approval
the estimated cost of installation of each street sign required by the Council.
8.   Street Lights. Installation of street lights shall be required in
accordance with design and specification standards approved by the Council.
9.   Construction of Streets and Dead-end Streets. Streets and dead-end streets
shall be in conformance with the following requirements:
   A.   Construction of Streets. The arrangement of streets shall provide for
the continuation of principal streets between adjacent properties when such
continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire
protection, and for efficient provision of utilities. If the adjacent property
is undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right-
of-way shall be extended to the property line. A temporary T- or L-shaped
turnabout shall be provided on all temporary dead-end streets, with the
notation on the subdivision plat that land outside the normal street right-of-
way shall revert to abutters whenever the street is continued. The Council may
limit the length of temporary dead-end streets in accordance with the design
standards of these regulations.
   B.   Permanent Dead-end Streets. Where a road does not extend to the
boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by the Council
for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall normally not be nearer to
such boundary than 150 feet. However, the Council may require the reservation
of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian
traffic, or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be provided at the end of
a permanent dead-end street in accordance with City construction standards and
specifications. For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police
and fire protection, permanent dead-end streets shall, in general, be limited
in length in accordance with the design standards of these regulations.
170.41   STREETS – DESIGN STANDARDS.
The following design standards shall apply to the design of streets:
1.   General. In order to provide for streets of suitable location, width, and
improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access
to police, fire fighting, snow removal, sanitation, and street maintenance
equipment, and to coordinate streets so as to compose a convenient system and
avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, the following design standards
for streets are hereby required:
   A.   A tangent of at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse
curves on municipal arterial and municipal collector streets, and 75 feet on
municipal service streets.
   B.   When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point
by more than 10 degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius
adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than 100 feet for municipal
service and municipal collector streets, and of such greater radii as the
Council shall determine for special cases.
   C.   Minimum Roadway and Right-of-way Standards:
      (1)   Municipal arterial streets shall have a right-of-way width of not
less than 80 feet and a roadway width of not less than 44 feet.
      (2)   Municipal collector streets shall have a right-of-way width of not
less than 60 feet and a roadway width of not less than 36 feet.
      (3)    Municipal service streets shall have a right-of-way width of not
less than 50 feet and a roadway width of not less than 26 feet.
      (4)   Frontage streets shall have a right-of-way width of not less than
40 feet and a roadway width of not less than 26 feet.
      (5)   Culs-de-sac shall meet all the requirements for a municipal service
street and, in addition, shall provide a turnaround with a right-of-way radius
of 50 feet and a roadway radius of 40 feet. No cul-de-sac shall exceed 500 feet
in length.
   D.   Street grades, wherever feasible, shall not exceed the following:
      (1)   Municipal arterial streets - six percent.
      (2)   Municipal collector streets - eight percent.
      (3)   Municipal service streets - 10 percent.
      (4)   Frontage streets - six percent.
   E.   All changes in street grade shall be connected by vertical curves of
minimum length in feet equal to 20 times the algebraic difference in percent of
grade.
   F.   No street grade shall be less than one-half of one percent.
2.   Street Surfacing and Improvements. After sewer, water, and other utilities
to be located underground within the right-of-way have been installed by the
applicant, the applicant shall construct curbs and gutters and shall surface or
cause to be surfaced roadways to the widths prescribed in these regulations.
Said surfacing shall be of Portland concrete cement. Adequate provisions shall
be made for culverts, drains, and bridges. All road pavement, shoulders,
drainage improvements and structure, curbs, turnarounds, and sidewalks shall
conform to all construction standards and specifications adopted by the City,
and shall be incorporated into the construction plans required to be submitted
by the developer for plat approval.
3.   Excess Right-of-way. Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards
designated in these regulations shall be required whenever, due to topography,
additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes. Such slopes
shall not be in excess of three to one.
4.   Railroads and Limited Access Highways. Railroad rights-of-way and limited
access highways which were so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining
lands shall be treated as follows:
   A.   In residential districts, a buffer strip at least 25 feet in depth in
addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be
provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway. This
strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the plat:
“This strip is reserved for screening. The placement of structures hereon is
prohibited.”
   B.   In districts zoned for business, commercial, or industrial uses, the
nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad
shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure
suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
   C.   Streets parallel to the railroad when intersecting a street which
crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a
distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance
shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for
future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
5.   Intersections. The following standards shall apply to the design of
intersections:
   A.   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles. A proposed intersection of two new streets at an angle of less
than 75 degrees shall not be acceptable. An oblique street should be curved
approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right angles for at
least 100 feet therefrom. Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one
point unless specifically approved by the Council.
   B.   Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall,
wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite
side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet
shall not be permitted, except where the intersected street has separated dual
drives without median breaks at either intersection. Where streets intersect
major streets, their alignment shall be continuous. Intersection of major
streets shall be at least 800 feet apart.
   C.   Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two municipal service
streets shall be at least 20 feet; and minimum curb radius at an intersection
involving a municipal collector street shall be at least 25 feet. Abrupt
changes in alignment within a block shall have the corners cut off in
accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe vehicular
movement.
   D.   Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever practical.
In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a leveling area
shall be provided having not greater than a two percent rate at a distance of
60 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting
street.
   E.   Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing
vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting
visibility, the developer shall cut such ground or vegetation, including trees,
in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent deemed
necessary to provide an adequate sight distance.
   F.   The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall be
three percent or less.
6.   Bridges. Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined by the
Council, shall be constructed at the full expense of the applicant without
reimbursement from the City. The sharing expense for the construction of
bridges not of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined by the Council,
will be fixed by special agreement between the Council and the applicant. Said
cost shall be charged to the applicant pro rata as the percentage of his or her
land developed and so served.
7.   Alleys. The following design standards for alleys shall be required of all
subdividers:
   A.   Alleys shall be prohibited in residential districts.
   B.   Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts, except
that the Council may waive this requirement where other definite and assured
provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading and
parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed.
   C.   Alleys shall have a right-of-way of not less than 30 feet and a roadway
width of not less than 20 feet.
   D.   Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided,
but where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit safe
vehicular movement.
   E.   Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable,
shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead end, as
determined by the Council.
8.   Street Dedications and Reservations. The following provisions shall apply
to street dedications and reservations:
   A.   Street systems in new subdivisions shall be laid out so as to eliminate
or avoid new perimeter half streets. Where an existing half street is adjacent
to a new subdivision, the other half of the street shall be improved and
dedicated by the subdivider. The Council may authorize a new perimeter street
where the subdivider improves and dedicates the entire required street right-
of-way width within his or her own subdivision boundaries.
   B.   Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow street or when City
plans or zoning setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening
a road that would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the
applicant shall be required to improve and dedicate at his expense such areas
for widening or realignment of such roads. Such frontage roads and streets
shall be improved and dedicated by the applicant at his or her own expense to
the full width as required by these subdivision regulations. Land reserved for
any street purposes may not be counted in satisfying yard or area requirements
of the zoning regulations whether the land is to be dedicated to the City in
fee simple or an easement is granted to the City.
170.42   STORM SEWERS AND DRAINAGE.
The following requirements shall apply to the provision of storm sewers and
drainage:
1.   General Requirements. The Commission shall not recommend for approval any
plat of a subdivision which does not make adequate provision for storm or flood
water run-off channels or basins. The storm water drainage system shall be
separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers, where
required, shall be designed by methods as approved by the Council, and a copy
of design computations shall be submitted along with plans. Inlets shall be
provided so that surface water is not carried across or around any
intersection, or for a distance of more than 600 feet in the gutter. When
calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a point, no further
allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point, and basins shall be used to
intercept flow at that point. Surface water drainage patterns shall be shown
for each and every lot and block.
2.   Nature of Storm Water Facilities. The applicant may be required by the
Council to carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that
may exist either previously to, or as a result of, the subdivision. Such
drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible,
or in perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width, and shall be
constructed in accordance with the construction standards and specifications.
   A.   Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the applicant shall install
storm sewer facilities, or if no outlets are within a reasonable distance,
adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of storm waters, subject to
the specifications of the Council. However, in subdivisions containing lots
less than 15,000 square feet in area and in business and industrial districts,
underground storm sewer systems shall be constructed throughout the
subdivisions and be conducted to an approved outfall.
   B.   If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided eventually, as
determined by the Council, the subdivider shall make arrangement for future
storm water disposal by a public storm sewer system at the time the plat
receives final approval. Provision for such connection shall be incorporated by
inclusion in the performance bond required for the subdivision plat.
   C.   A culvert or other drainage facility shall, in each case, be large
enough to accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area,
whether inside or outside the subdivision. The Council shall determine the
necessary size of the facility based on the provisions of the construction
standards and specifications, assuming conditions of maximum potential
watershed development permitted by applicable zoning regulations.
   D.   The Council shall also study the effect of each subdivision on existing
downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision. City
drainage studies together with such other studies as shall be appropriate shall
serve as a guide to needed improvements. Where it is anticipated that the
additional runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will overload
an existing downstream drainage facility, the Council may withhold approval of
the subdivision until provision has been made for the recovery of the cost for
the improvement of said potential condition in such sum as the Council shall
determine. No subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be
provided to an adequate drainage watercourse or facility.
   E.   The Council may, when it deems it necessary for the health, safety, or
welfare of the present and future population of the area and necessary to the
conservation of water, drainage, and sanitary facilities, prohibit the
subdivision of any portion of the property which lies within the floodplain of
any stream or drainage course.
3.   Dedication of Drainage Easements. The following shall apply to the
dedication of drainage easements.
   A.   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel, or stream, there shall be provided a storm water easement or drainage
right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse, and of
such width and construction or both as will be adequate for the purpose.
Wherever possible, it is desirable that the drainage be maintained by an open
channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume
of flow.
   B.   Drainage easements:
      (1)   Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within street rights-of-way,
perpetual unobstructed easements at least 15 feet in width for such drainage
facilities shall be provided across property outside the street lines and with
satisfactory access to the road. Easements shall be indicated on the plat.
Drainage easements shall be carried from the street to a natural watercourse or
to other drainage facilities.
      (2)   When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and
indicated on the plat.
      (3)   The applicant shall dedicate, either in fee or by drainage or
conservation easement of land on both sides of existing watercourses, to a
distance to be determined by the Council.
      (4)   Low-lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or
overflowing during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for
dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their natural state as drainage
ways. Such land or lands subject to periodic flooding shall not be computed in
determining the area requirement of any lot.
170.43   WATER FACILITIES.
Water facilities shall be provided as follows:
1.   General Requirements. The following general requirements shall apply to
the provision of water facilities:
   A.   Where a public water main is accessible, the subdivider shall install
adequate water facilities, including fire hydrants, subject to City
specifications. All water mains shall be at least six inches in diameter.
   B.   Water main extensions shall be approved by the City.
   C.   To facilitate the above, the location of all fire hydrants and all
water supply improvements shall be shown on the preliminary plat.
2.   Individual Wells and Central Water Systems. The following requirements
shall apply to the provision of individual wells and central water systems:
   A.   In the discretion of the Council, if a public water system is not
available, individual wells may be used or a central water system provided in
such a manner that an adequate supply of potable water will be available to
every lot in the subdivision. Water samples shall be submitted to the
appropriate County or State agency for testing, and individual wells and
central water systems shall be approved by the appropriate County or State
health authorities. Orders of approval shall be submitted to the Council.
   B.   If the Council requires that a connection to a public water main be
eventually provided as a condition to approval of an individual well or central
water system, the applicant shall make arrangements for future water service at
the time the plat receives final approval. Performance or cash bonds may be
required to insure compliance.
3.   Fire Hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be required for all subdivisions except
those coming under Subsection 2 of this section. Fire hydrants shall be located
no more than 1,000 feet apart and within 500 feet of any structures and shall
be approved by the City.
170.44   SEWAGE FACILITIES.
Sewage facilities shall be provided as follows:
1.   General Requirements. The applicant shall install sanitary sewer
facilities in a manner prescribed by the City construction standards and
specifications. All plans shall be designed in accordance with the rules,
regulations and standards of the City and the State Department of Natural
Resources or State Department of Health. Plans shall be approved by the above
agencies.
2.   Construction of Sanitary Sewage Systems. Sanitary sewage systems shall be
constructed as follows:
   A.   Where a public sanitary sewage system is reasonably accessible, the
applicant shall connect with the same and provide sewers accessible to each lot
in the subdivision.
   B.   Where public sanitary sewer systems are not reasonably accessible but
will become available within a reasonable time, not to exceed 15 years, the
applicant may choose one of the following alternatives:
      (1)   Install a central sewage system, operated and maintained by the
benefited property owners. Where plans for future public sanitary sewage
systems exist, the applicant shall install the sewer lines, laterals, and mains
to be in permanent conformance with such plans and ready for connection to such
public sewer mains.
      (2)   Individual disposal systems, provided the applicant shall install
sanitary sewer lines, laterals, and mains from the street curb to a point in
the subdivision boundary where a future connection with the public sewer main
shall be made. Sewer lines shall be laid from the house to the street line, and
a connection shall be available in the home to connect from the individual
disposal system to the sewer system when the public sewers become available.
Such sewer systems shall be capped until ready for use and shall conform to all
plans for installation of the public sewer system, where such exist, and shall
be ready for connection to such public sewer main.
   C.   Where sanitary sewer systems are not reasonably accessible and will not
become available for a period in excess of 15 years, the applicant shall
install individual disposal systems or central sewage systems.
3.   Individual Disposal System Requirements. If public sewer facilities are
not available and individual disposal systems are proposed, minimum lot areas
shall conform to the requirements of applicable zoning regulations and these
regulations. Percolation tests and test holes shall be made as directed by the
City and the results submitted to the local Board of Health.
4.   Water Supply Interconnections. There shall be no physical connection
between a public or private potable water supply system and a sewer which will
permit the passage of any sewage or polluted water into the potable supply.
Sewers shall be kept removed from water supply wells or other water supply
sources and structures.
170.45   SIDEWALKS.
The following requirements shall apply to the provision of sidewalks:
1.   Location. Sidewalks shall be included within the dedicated non-pavement
right-of-way of all streets.
2.   Construction. Sidewalks shall be improved as required by this Code of
Ordinances.
170.46   UTILITIES.
The following shall apply to the provision of utilities:
1.   Location. The Council may require that all utility facilities, including,
but not limited to, gas, electric power, telephone, and CATV cables, be located
underground through the subdivision. All utility facilities existing and
proposed throughout the subdivision shall be shown on the preliminary plat.
Underground service connections to the street property line of each platted lot
shall be installed at the subdivider’s expense. At the discretion of the
Council, the requirement for service connections to each lot may be waived in
the case of adjoining lots to be retained in single ownership and intended to
be developed for the same primary use.
2.   Easements. Easements shall be provided as follows:
   A.   Easements centered on rear lot lines shall be provided for utilities.
Such easements shall be at least 10 feet wide. Proper coordination shall be
established between the subdivider and the applicable utility companies for the
establishment of utility easements established in adjoining properties.
   B.   Where topographical or other conditions are such as to make impractical
the inclusion of utilities within the rear lot lines, perpetual unobstructed
easements at least 10 feet in width shall be provided alongside lot lines with
satisfactory access to the street or rear lot lines. Easements shall be
indicated on the plat.
170.47   PRESERVATION OF NATURAL FEATURES AND AMENITIES.
Existing features which would add value to residential development or to the
City as a whole, such as trees, watercourses and falls, beaches, historic
spots, and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved in the design of
the subdivision. No trees shall be removed from any subdivision nor any change
of grade of the land effected until approval of the preliminary plat has been
granted. All trees on the plat required to be retained shall be preserved, and
all trees where required shall be protected against change of grade.
170.48   NONRESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
The following provisions shall apply to nonresidential subdivisions:
1.   General. If a proposed subdivision includes land that is used for
commercial or industrial purposes, the layout of the subdivision with respect
to such land shall make such provision as the Council may require. A
nonresidential subdivision shall be subject to all the requirements of these
regulations, as well as such additional standards required by the Council, and
shall conform to the proposed land use and standards established in City plans
and regulations.
2.   Standards. In addition to the principles and standards in these
regulations, which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the
applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the street,
parcel, and block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the uses
anticipated and takes into account other uses in the vicinity. The following
principles and standards shall be observed:
   A.   Proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and dimensions to
the types of industrial development anticipated.
   B.   Streets rights-of-way and pavement shall be adequate to accommodate the
type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated thereupon.
   C.   Special requirements may be imposed by the City with respect to the
installation of public utilities, including water, sewer, and storm water
drainage.
   D.   Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas from
potential nuisance from a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision,
including the provision of extra depth in parcels backing up on existing or
potential residential development and provisions for a permanently landscaped
buffer strip when necessary.
   E.   Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic,
shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or
potential residential areas.
170.49   SCHOOL AND PARK RESERVATIONS.
If land to be subdivided contains sites that are designated in City plans or
plans of other public bodies to be used for schools or parks, the developer
shall reserve such site for such use. If sites which have been reserved are not
acquired by the City or other public body within two years of the date of the
preliminary plat approval, then such sites may be subdivided by the developer.
The appropriate public body may release the reserved site sooner by certifying
to the Council that it does not intend to acquire such site within the two-year
period.
170.50   IMPROVEMENTS WITHIN UNINCORPORATED JURISDICTION.
Improvements in the two-mile unincorporated area under the jurisdiction of
these regulations shall be the same as required herein, provided they are not
less than that required by the applicable County subdivision regulations, and
provided further that all construction plans shall be approved by the County,
and completed public roads shall be accepted by the Board of Supervisors for
public maintenance.
170.51   VARIATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.
The following shall apply to the granting of variations and exceptions:
1.   Hardships. Where the Council finds that extraordinary hardships or
particular difficulties regarding the physical development of land may result
from strict compliance with these regulations, it may make variations or
exceptions to the regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the
public interest secured, provided that such variation or exception shall not
have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations; and
further provided, the Council shall not grant variations or exceptions to these
regulations unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to
it in each specific case that:
   A.   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public
health, safety, or welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in
the neighborhood in which the property is located.
   B.   The conditions upon which the request for a variation is based are
unique to the property for which the variation is sought, and are not
applicable, generally, to other property.
   C.   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical
conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the
owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict
letter of the regulations were carried out.
   D.   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to
make more money out of the property.
2.   Conditions. In granting variations and exceptions the Council may require
such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives
of the standards or requirements of these regulations.
3.   Procedure for a Variance. A petition for any such variance shall be
submitted in writing by the developer at the time when the preliminary plat is
filed. The petition shall state fully the grounds for the application and all
of the facts relied upon by the petitioner.
170.52   CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.
Any provisions of these regulations may be changed and amended from time to
time by the Council; provided, however, that such changes or amendments shall
not become effective until after a public hearing has been held, public notice
of which shall have been given as required by law. Such proposed amendments
shall first be submitted to the Commission for study and recommendation before
the hearing is held. The Commission shall forward its recommendations to the
Council within 30 days, after which the Council shall give notice of and hold a
public hearing on the proposed amendment.
170.53   ENFORCEMENT, VIOLATIONS, AND PENALTIES.
No plat or subdivision within the City, or within two miles thereof, shall be
filed or recorded with the County, nor shall any plat or subdivision have any
validity until it complies with the provision of these regulations, has been
approved by the Council as herein set forth, and further:
1.   Issuance of Building Permits. No more than two building permits for each
separate tract existing at the time of the effective date of these regulations
shall be issued unless the tract has been platted in accordance with these
regulations; except that this provision shall not limit the number of building
permits that may be issued for accessory buildings as defined by applicable
land use regulations such as zoning and restricted residence regulations or
additions or improvements to a main or accessory building already legally
located upon said tract.
2.   Sale or Lease Without Plat. Any person who shall dispose of or offer for
sale or lease any lots in the City or addition to the City until the plat
thereof has been acknowledged and recorded as provided in these regulations,
shall forfeit and pay a civil penalty of $1,000.00 for each lot and part of lot
sold or disposed of, leased, or offered for sale.
