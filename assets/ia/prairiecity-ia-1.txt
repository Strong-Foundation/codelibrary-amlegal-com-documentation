46.01 Curfew                 46.03 Contributing to Delinquency
46.02 Cigarettes and Tobacco
 
46.01   CURFEW.
   1.   Purpose. The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is
necessary to promote the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of
the City and specifically to achieve the following purposes:
      A.   Reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults
responsible for minors;
      B.   Protect the public from the illegal acts of minors committed
individually and in groups after the curfew hour; and
      C.   Protect minors from improper influences and criminal activity by
individuals and groups that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.
   2.   Definitions. For use in this section, the following terms are defined:
      A.   “Curfew hours” means 12:00 midnight on any Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday until 6:00 a.m. of the

or conduct or whereabouts of the minor.

group of the public has access and includes but is not limited to streets,
highways and the common areas of schools, hospitals, apartment houses, office
buildings, transport facilities and shops.
      J.   “Remain” means:
         (1)   To linger or stay; or
         (2)   To fail to leave the premises when requested to do so by a
police officer or the owner, operator or other person in control of the
premises.
      K.   “Serious bodily injury” means bodily injury that creates a
substantial risk of death or that causes death, serious permanent disfigurement
or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ.
   3.   Offenses.
      A.   A minor commits an offense if he or she remains in any public place
or on the premises of any establishment within the City during curfew hours.
      B.   A parent or guardian commits an offense if he or she knowingly
permits or by insufficient control allows the minor to remain in any public
place or on the premises of any establishment within the City during curfew
hours.
      C.   The owner, operator or any employee of an establishment commits an
offense if he or she knowingly allows a minor to remain upon the premises of
the establishment during curfew hours.
   4.   Defenses.

that the minor was:
         (1)   Accompanied by the minor’s parent or guardian;

residence of a next-door neighbor if the neighbor did not complain to the
Police Department about the minor’s presence;

activity supervised by adults and sponsored by the City, a civic organization
or another similar entity that takes responsibility for the minor, or going to
or returning home from, without any detour or stop, an official school,
religious or other recreational activity supervised by adults and sponsored by
the City, a civic organization or other similar entity that takes
responsibility for the minor;
         (8)   Exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States
Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the
right of assembly; or
         (9)   Married or previously married or if said minor had disabilities
of minority removed in accordance with Section 599 of the Code of Iowa.
      B.   It is a defense to prosecution under subsection 3(C) of this section
that the owner, operator or employee of an establishment promptly notified the
Police Department that a minor was present on the premises of the establishment
during curfew hours and refused to leave.
   5.   Enforcement.
      A.   Before taking any enforcement action under this section, a police
officer shall ask the apparent offender’s age and reason for being in the
public place. In the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate
or driver’s license, a police officer on the street shall, in the first
instance, use his or her best judgment in determining age. The officer shall
not issue a citation or take a minor into custody under this section unless the
officer reasonably believes that an offense has occurred and that, based on the
minor’s response and other circumstances, no defense in subsection 4 of this
section is present.
      B.   A peace officer may take a minor into custody for violation of this
section pursuant to Section 232.19 of the Code of Iowa for the limited purpose
of detaining the minor until he or she can be reunited with the minor’s family
or guardian or other responsible adult or if the peace officer has probable
cause to believe that the minor has committed a delinquent act which if
committed by an adult would constitute a public offense. A peace officer who
takes a minor into custody shall not place bodily restraints such as handcuffs
on the minor unless the minor physically resists or threatens physical violence
when being taken into custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention
following a curfew violation.
      C.   After a minor is taken into custody, the peace officer shall notify
the adult responsible for the minor as soon as possible. The minor shall be
released to the adult responsible for the minor upon the promise of such person
to produce the child in court at such time as the court may direct.
      D.   If a peace officer determines that a minor does not have adult
supervision because the peace officer cannot locate the minor’s parent,
guardian or other person legally responsible for the care of the minor within a
reasonable time, the peace officer shall attempt to place the minor with an
adult relative of the minor, an adult person who cares for the minor or another
adult person who is known to the minor.
   6.   Penalties.
      A.   Responsible Adult’s First Violation. In the case of a first
violation by a minor, the peace officer shall, by certified mail or personal
service, deliver to the adult responsible for the minor written notice of the
violation with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full
enforcement of the curfew ordinance against both the responsible adult and
minor, with applicable penalties.
      B.   Responsible Adult’s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as
defined in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows
the minor to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a
simple misdemeanor.
      C.   Minor’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a
minor, the peace officer shall give the minor a written warning, which states
that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew
ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with applicable

the minor to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a
simple misdemeanor.

possess, purchase, or attempt to purchase any tobacco, tobacco products,
alternative nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes. Possession of
tobacco, tobacco products, alternative nicotine products, vapor products, or

demolisher and to disposal of the personal property by sale or destruction. If
the abandoned vehicle was taken into custody by a private entity without a

93.01   WATER SHORTAGES.
From time to time during and following drought conditions, or due to equipment
failure, the City water supply may become significantly and seriously depleted
so that there will not then be a sufficient supply of water to meet all
customary and usual demands. Under these conditions, the City Council may find,
and declare by resolution, a public Water Watch, Water Warning or Water
Emergency during which time the following measures and provisions shall be in
effect to produce an orderly and equitable reduction of water consumption
until, by resolution, the Council finds and declares the water shortage
condition to be ended.
93.02   CONDITIONS.
   1.   Water Watch. A Water Watch may be declared when a water shortage or
equipment failure poses a potential threat to the ability of the water system
to meet the needs of its customers currently or in the foreseeable future.
Indicators of the need to impose a Water Watch include:
      A.   System operating at seventy-five percent (75%) of pumping capacity;
      B.   Moderate decrease in the pumping water level of wells or moderate
decrease in recovery rate of water level in wells;
      C.   Moderate decrease in reservoir levels measured in number of feet
below spillway or number of feet above intake.
   2.   Water Warning. A Level 1 or Level 2 Water Warning may be declared when
a water shortage or equipment failure poses a serious threat to the ability of
the water system to meet the needs of its customers currently and in the
foreseeable future. Indicators of the need to impose a Level 1 Water Warning
include:
      A.   System operating at eighty-five percent (85%) of pumping capacity;
      B.   Significant decrease in the pumping water level of wells or
significant decrease in recovery rate of water level in wells;

A second or subsequent violation of the Water Warning or Water Emergency use
restrictions by any person within a 12-month period constitutes a municipal
infraction. Any person who, in making application to the Water Appeal Board for
adjustment of the base allocation or premium charges, intentionally provides
false or incorrect statements or information commits a municipal infraction.
93.14   REDUCTION IN FLOW OF WATER TO ANY PERSON.
The Water Superintendent is authorized, after giving notice and opportunity for
hearing before the Water Appeal Board, to reduce the flow of water to any
person determined to be using water in any manner not in accordance with this

There is hereby granted to MidAmerican Energy Company, an Iowa corporation,
hereinafter called “Company”, and to its successors and assigns the right and
franchise to acquire, construct, erect, maintain and operate in the City of
Prairie City, Iowa, hereinafter called the “City”, a gas distribution system,
to furnish natural gas along, under and upon the streets, avenues, alleys and
public places to serve customers within and without the City and to furnish and
sell natural gas to the City and its inhabitants. For the term of this
franchise, the Company is granted the right of eminent domain, the exercise of
which is subject to City Council approval upon application by the Company. This
franchise shall be effective for a twenty-five (25) year period from and after
the effective date of the ordinance codified by this chapter.† 2
 
Notes
2 † EDITOR’S NOTE: Ordinance No. 299, adopting a natural gas franchise for the
  City, was passed and adopted on April 9, 2012.
110.02   RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES.
The rights and privileges hereby granted are subject to the restrictions and
limitations of Chapter 364 of the Code of Iowa, 2011, or as subsequently
amended or changed.
110.03   PIPES AND MAINS.
Company shall have the right to excavate in any public street for the purpose
of laying, relaying, repairing or extending gas pipes, mains, conduits, and
other facilities provided that the same shall be so placed as not to
unreasonably interfere with the construction of any water pipes, drain or sewer
or the flow of water therefrom, which have been or may hereafter be located by
authority of the City.
110.04   CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE.
The Company shall, excluding facilities located in private easements (whether
titled in Company exclusively or in Company and other entities), in accordance
with Iowa law including Company’s tariff on file with and made effective by the
Iowa Utilities Board as may subsequently be amended (“Tariff”) , at its cost
and expense, locate and relocate its existing facilities or equipment in, on,
over or under any public street or alley in the City in such a manner as the
City may reasonably require for the purposes of facilitating the construction,
reconstruction, maintenance or repair of the street or alley. If the City has a
reasonable alternative route for the street, alley or public improvements or an
alternative construction method, which would not cause the relocation of the
Company installations, the City shall select said alternative route, or
construction method. The City shall be responsible for surveying and staking
the right-of-way for City projects that require the Company to relocate Company
facilities. If requested the City shall provide, at no cost to the Company,
copies of its relocation plan and profile and cross section drawings. If tree
removals must be completed by the City as part of the City’s project and are
necessary whether or not utility facilities must be relocated, the City at its
own cost shall be responsible for said removals. If the timing of the tree
removals does not coincide with the Company facilities relocation schedule and
Company must remove trees that are included in the City’s portion of the
project, the City shall either remove the trees at its cost or reimburse the
Company for the expenses incurred to remove said trees. If project funds from a
source other than the City are available to pay for the relocation of utility
facilities, the City shall attempt to secure said funds and provide them to the
Company to compensate the Company for the costs of relocation.
110.05   EXCAVATIONS.
In making excavations in any streets, avenues, alleys and public places for the
installation of gas pipes, conduits or apparatus, Company shall not
unreasonably obstruct the use of the streets and shall replace the surface,
restoring it to the condition as existed immediately prior to excavation.
Company agrees any replacement of road surface shall conform to current City
code regarding its depth and composition. The Company shall not be required to
restore or modify public right-of-way, sidewalks or other areas in or adjacent
to the Company project to a condition superior to its immediate previously
existing condition or to a condition exceeding its previously existing
condition to the extent any alterations are required for the City to comply
with city, state or federal rules, regulations or laws.
110.06   UTILITY EASEMENTS.  
Vacating a street, avenue, alley, public ground or public right-of-way shall
not deprive the Company of its right to operate and maintain existing
facilities on, below, above, or beneath the vacated property. Prior to the City
abandoning or vacating any street, avenue, alley or public ground where the
Company has facilities in the vicinity, the City shall provide Company with not
less than sixty (60) days advance notice of the City’s proposed action and,
upon request grant the Company a utility easement covering existing and future
facilities and activities. If the City fails to grant the Company a utility
easement for said facilities prior to abandoning or vacating a street, avenue,
alley or public ground, the City shall at its cost and expense obtain easements
for existing Company facilities.
110.07   RELOCATION NOT REQUIRED.  
The Company shall not be required to relocate, at its cost and expense, Company
facilities in the public right-of-way that have been relocated at Company
expense at the direction of the City at any time during the previous 10 years.
110.08   RELOCATION REIMBURSEMENT.  
Pursuant to relocation of Company facilities as may be required by Sections
110.03,
110.04,
110.05,
110.06 and
110.07 of this chapter, if the City orders or requests the Company to relocate
its existing facilities or equipment in order to directly or indirectly
facilitate the project of a commercial or private developer or other non-public
entity, City shall reimburse or the City shall require the developer or non-
public entity to reimburse the Company for the cost of such relocation as a
precondition to relocation. The Company shall not be required to relocate in
order to facilitate such private project at its expense.
110.09   INDEMNIFICATION.
The Company shall indemnify and save harmless the City from any and all claims,
suits, losses, damages, costs or expenses, on account of injury or damage to
any person or property, to the extent caused or occasioned by the Company’s
negligence in construction, reconstruction, excavation, operation or
maintenance of the natural gas facilities authorized by this franchise;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to defend, indemnify
and save harmless the City for any costs or damages to the extent arising from
the negligence of the City, its officers, employees or agents.
110.10   INFORMATION.  
Upon reasonable request the Company shall provide the City, on a project
specific basis, information indicating the horizontal location, relative to
boundaries of the right-of-way, of all equipment which it owns or over which it
has control that is located in City right-of-way, including documents, maps and
other information in paper or electronic or other forms (“information”). The
Company and City recognize the information may in whole or part be considered a
confidential record under state or federal law or both. Therefore, the City
shall not release any information without prior consent of the Company and
shall return the information to Company upon request. City recognizes that
Company claims the information may constitute a trade secret or is otherwise
protected from public disclosure by state or federal law on other grounds and
agrees to retain the information in its non-public files. Furthermore, the City
agrees that no documents, maps or information provided to the City by the
Company shall be made available to the public or other entities if such
documents or information are exempt from disclosure under the provisions of the
Freedom of Information Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Critical
Energy Infrastructure requirements pursuant to 18 CFR 388.112 and 388.113, or
Chapter 22 of the Code of Iowa, as such statutes and regulations may be amended
from time to time.
110.11   APPLICABLE REGULATIONS.
The Company shall extend its mains and pipes and operate, and maintain the
system in accordance with the applicable regulations of the Iowa Utilities
Board or its successors and Iowa law.
110.12   QUALITY AND QUANTITY. During the term of this franchise, the Company
shall furnish natural gas in the quantity and quality consistent and in
accordance with the applicable regulations of the Iowa Utilities Board, the
Company’s tariff made effective by the Iowa Utilities Board or its successors
and Iowa law.
110.13   POLICE REGULATIONS.  
All reasonable and proper police regulations shall be adopted and enforced by
the City for the protection of the facilities of the Company.
110.14   FRANCHISE FEE.  
A franchise fee of one percent (1 %) is imposed upon, and shall be collected
from, the natural gas customers of the Company receiving service and located
within the corporate limits of the City. The franchise fee shall be imposed
upon the gross receipts, minus uncollectible accounts, generated from sales of
natural gas and distribution services.
(Ord. 343 - May 17 Supp.)
110.15   FEE EXEMPTIONS.  
The City may, as allowed by Iowa law, exempt customer classes of sales from
imposition of the franchise fee, or modify, decrease or eliminate the franchise
fee. The City reserves the right to cancel any or all the franchise fee
exemptions and also reserves the right to grant exemptions to customer classes
in compliance with Iowa law and Section
110.17 of this chapter. The City does therefore exempt the customer classes in
Section
110.14 from paying franchise fees.
   ·   Customer classes exempted by the City at time of imposing a franchise
fee percentage greater than zero (0) percent:
110.16   COLLECTION OF FEES.  
The City recognizes the administrative burden collecting franchise fees imposes
upon the Company and the Company requires lead time to commence collecting said
franchise fees. The Company will commence collecting franchise fees on or
before the first Company billing cycle of the first calendar month following 90
days of receipt of information required of the City to implement the franchise
fee, including the City’s documentation of customer classes subject to or
exempted from City-imposed franchise fee. The City shall provide the
information and data required in a form and format acceptable to the Company.
The Company will, if requested by the City, provide the City with a list of
premises considered by the Company to be within the corporate limits of the
City.
110.17   IDENTIFYING CUSTOMERS.  
The City shall be solely responsible for identifying customer classes subject
to or exempt from paying the City imposed franchise fee. The City shall be
solely responsible for notifying Company of its corporate limits, including,
over time, annexations or other alterations thereto, and customer classes that
it wishes to subject to, or to the extent permitted by law, exempt from paying
the franchise fee. The City shall provide to the Company, by certified mail,
copies of annexation ordinances in a timely manner to ensure appropriate
franchise fee collection from customers within the corporate limits of the
City. The Company shall have no obligation to collect franchise fees from
customers in annexed areas until and unless such ordinances have been provided
to the Company by certified mail. The Company shall commence collecting
franchise fees in the annexed areas no sooner than 60 days after receiving
annexation ordinances from the City.
110.18   MODIFYING FEES.  
The City agrees to modify the level of franchise fees imposed only once in any
24-month period. Any such ordinance exempting classes of customers, increasing,
decreasing, modifying or eliminating the franchise fee shall become effective,
and billings reflecting the change shall commence on an agreed upon date which
is not less than 60 days following written notice to the Company by certified
mail. The Company shall not be required to implement such new ordinance unless
and until it determines that it has received appropriate official documentation
of final action by the City Council.
110.19   FRANCHISE FEE INDEMNIFICATION.  
The City shall indemnify the Company from claims of any nature arising out of
or related to the imposition and collection of the franchise fee. In addition,
the Company shall not be liable for collecting franchise fees from any customer
originally or subsequently identified, or incorrectly identified, by the City
as being subject to the franchise fee or being subject to a different level of
franchise fees or being exempt from the imposition of franchise fees.
110.20   FEE REMITTANCE.  
The Company shall remit franchise fee revenues to the City no more frequently
than on or before the last business day of the month following each quarter as
follows.
·   January, February and March
·   April, May and June
·   July, August and September, and
·   October, November and December
MidAmerican shall provide City with notice at least 30 days in advance of any
changes made in this collection schedule, including any alterations in the
calendar quarters or any other changes in the remittance periods.
110.21   FEE ADMINISTRATION.  
The City recognizes that the costs of franchise fee administration are not
charged directly to the City and agrees it shall, if required by the Company,
reimburse the Company for any initial or ongoing costs incurred by the Company
in collecting franchise fees that Company in its sole opinion deems to be in
excess of typical costs of franchise fee administration.
110.22   FEE REFUNDS.  
MidAmerican Energy Company shall not, under any circumstances be required to
return or refund any franchise fees that have been collected from City
customers and remitted to the City. In the event the Company is required to
provide data or information in defense of the City’s imposition of franchise
fees or the Company is required to assist the City in identifying customers or
calculating any franchise fee refunds for groups of or individual customers the
City shall reimburse the Company for the expenses incurred by the Company to
provide such data or information.
110.23   OBLIGATION TO COLLECT.  
The obligation to collect and remit the fee imposed by this chapter is modified
or repealed if:
   1.   Any other person is authorized to sell natural gas at retail to City
consumers and the City imposes a franchise fee or its lawful equivalent at zero
or a lesser rate than provided in this chapter, in which case the obligation of
Company to collect and remit franchise fee shall be modified to zero or the
lesser rate;
   2.   The City adds additional territory by annexation or consolidation and
is unable or unwilling to impose the franchise fee upon all persons selling
natural gas at retail to consumers within the additional territory, in which
case the franchise fee imposed on the revenue from sales by Company in the
additional territory shall be zero or equal to that of the lowest fee being
paid by any other retail seller of natural gas within the City; or
   3.   Legislation is enacted by the Iowa General Assembly or the Supreme
Court of Iowa issues a final ruling regarding franchise fees or the Iowa
Utilities Board issues a final nonappealable order (collectively, “final
franchise fee action”) that modifies, but does not repeal, the ability of the
City to impose a franchise fee or the ability of Company to collect from City
customers and remit franchise fees to City. Within 60 days of final franchise
fee action, the City shall notify Company and the parties shall meet to
determine whether this chapter can be revised, and, if so, how to revise the
franchise fee on a continuing basis to meet revised legal requirements. After
final franchise fee action and until passage by the City of revisions to the
franchise fee ordinance, Company may temporarily discontinue collection and
remittance of the franchise fee if in its sole opinion it believes it is
required to do so in order to comply with revised legal requirements.
110.24   OBLIGATION RELIEVED.  
The other provisions of this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Company shall be completely relieved of its obligation to collect and remit to
the City the franchise fee effective as of the date specified below with no
liability therefor under each of any of the following circumstances as
determined to exist in the sole discretion of Company:
   1.   Any of the imposition, collection or remittance of a franchise fee is
ruled to be unlawful by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date of
such ruling or as may be specified by that Court.
   2.   The Iowa General Assembly enacts legislation making imposition,
collection or remittance of a franchise fee unlawful, effective as of the date
lawfully specified by the General Assembly.
   3.   The Iowa Utilities Board, or its successor agency, denies the Company
the right to impose, collect or remit a franchise fee provided such denial is
affirmed by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date of the final
agency order from which the appeal is taken.
110.25   MANAGEMENT FEES. 
Upon implementation of a franchise fee the City shall not, pursuant to Chapter
480A.6 of the Code of Iowa, impose or charge Company right-of-way management
fees for permits for Company construction, maintenance, repairs, excavation,
pavement cutting or inspections of Company work sites and projects or related
matters.
110.26   TERMINATION.  
Either City or Company (“party”) may terminate this franchise if the other
party shall be materially in breach of its provisions. Upon the occurrence of a
material breach, the non-breaching party shall provide the breaching party with
notification by certified mail specifying the alleged breach. The breaching
party shall have 60 days to cure the breach, unless it notifies the non-
breaching party, and the parties agree upon a shorter or longer period for
cure. If the breach is not cured within the cure period, the non-breaching
party may terminate this franchise. A party shall not be considered to be in
breach of this franchise if it has operated in compliance with state or federal
law. A party shall not be considered to have breached this franchise if the
alleged breach is the result of the actions of a third party or the other
party.

There is hereby granted to MidAmerican Energy Company, an Iowa corporation,
hereinafter called the “Company,” and its successors and assigns, the right and
franchise to acquire, construct, erect, maintain and operate in the City of
Prairie City, Iowa, hereinafter called the “City,” a system for the
transmission and distribution of electric energy and communications signals
along, under, over and upon the streets, avenues, alleys and public places to
serve customers within and without the City, and to furnish and sell electric
energy to the City and its inhabitants. For the term of this franchise, the
Company is granted the right of eminent domain, the exercise of which is
subject to City Council approval upon application by the Company. This
franchise shall be effective for a twenty-five (25) year period from and after
the effective date of the ordinance codified by this chapter.† 3
 
Notes
3 † EDITOR’S NOTE: Ordinance No. 298, adopting an electric franchise for the
  City, was passed and adopted on April 9, 2012.
111.02   RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES.
The rights and privileges hereby granted are subject to the restrictions and
limitations of Chapter 364 of the Code of Iowa, 2011, or as subsequently
amended or changed.
111.03   POLES AND WIRES.
The Company shall have the right to erect all necessary poles and to place
thereon the necessary wires, fixtures and accessories as well as excavate and
bury conductors for the distribution of electric energy and communications
signals in and through the City, but all said conduits and poles shall be
placed as not to unreasonably interfere with the construction of any water
pipes, drain or sewer, or the flow of water therefrom, which have been or may
hereafter be located by authority of the City.
111.04   TRIMMING TREES.
The Company is authorized and empowered to prune or remove at Company expense
any tree extending into any street, alley or public grounds to maintain
electric reliability, safety, to restore utility service and to prevent limbs,
branches or trunks from interfering with the wires and facilities of the
Company. The pruning and removal of trees shall be done in accordance with
current nationally accepted safety and utility industry standards and federal
and state law, rules and regulations.
111.05   CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE.
The Company shall, excluding facilities located in private easements (whether
titled in Company exclusively or in Company and other entities), in accordance
with Iowa law including Company’s tariff on file with and made effective by the
Iowa Utilities Board as may subsequently be amended (“Tariff”), at its cost and
expense, locate and relocate its existing facilities or equipment in, on, over
or under any public street or alley in the City in such a manner as the City
may reasonably require for the purposes of facilitating the construction,
reconstruction, maintenance or repair of the street or alley of such street or
alley. The City and the Company shall work together to develop a suitable
alternative route or construction method so as to eliminate or minimize the
cost and expense to the company of relocation of company installations.  The
City shall be responsible for surveying and staking the right-of-way for City
projects that require the Company to relocate Company facilities. If requested,
the City shall provide, at no cost to the Company, copies of the relocation
plan and profile and cross section drawings. If tree removals must be completed
by the City as part of the City’s project and are necessary whether or not
utility facilities must be relocated, the City at its own cost shall be
responsible for said removals. If the timing of the tree removals does not
coincide with the Company facilities relocation schedule and the Company must
remove trees that are included in the City’s portion of the project, the City
shall either remove the trees or reimburse the Company for the expenses
incurred to remove said trees. If project funds from a source other than the
City are available to pay for the relocation of utility facilities, the City
shall attempt to secure said funds and provide them to the Company to
compensate the Company for the costs of relocation.
111.06   EXCAVATIONS.
In making excavations in any streets, avenues, alleys and public places for the
installation, maintenance or repair of conductor, conduits or the erection of
poles and wires or other appliances, the Company shall not unreasonably
obstruct the use of the streets, and shall replace the surface, restoring the
condition as existed prior to the Company excavation. The Company shall not be
required to restore or modify public right-of-way, sidewalks or other areas in
or adjacent to the Company project to a condition superior to its immediate
previously existing condition or to a condition required for the City to comply
with city, state or federal rules, regulations or law. Company agrees any
replacement of road surface shall conform to current City code regarding its
depth and composition.
111.07   UTILITY EASEMENTS. Vacating a street, avenue, alley, public ground or
public right-of-way shall not deprive the Company of its right to operate and
maintain existing facilities on, below, above, or beneath the vacated property.
Prior to the City abandoning or vacating any street, avenue, alley or public
ground where the Company has electric facilities in the vicinity, the City
shall provide Company with not less than sixty (60) days advance notice of the
City’s proposed action and, upon request grant the Company a utility easement
covering existing and future facilities and activities. If the City fails to
grant the Company a utility easement for said facilities prior to abandoning or
vacating a street, avenue, alley or public ground, the City shall at its cost
and expense obtain easements for existing Company facilities.
111.08   RELOCATION NOT REQUIRED.  
The Company shall not be required to relocate, at its cost and expense, Company
facilities in the public right-of-way that have been relocated at Company
expense at the direction of the City in the previous ten years.
111.09   RELOCATION REIMBURSEMENT.  
Pursuant to relocation of Company facilities as may be required by Sections
111.03,
111.05,
111.06,
111.07 and
111.08, if the City orders or requests the Company to relocate its existing
facilities or equipment in order to facilitate the project of a commercial or
private developer or other non-public entity, the City shall reimburse or the
City shall require the developer or non-public entity to reimburse the Company
for the cost of such relocation as a precondition to relocation of its existing
facilities or equipment. The Company shall not be required to relocate in order
to facilitate such private project at its expense.
111.10   INDEMNIFICATION.
The Company shall indemnify and save harmless the City from any and all claims,
suits, losses, damages, costs or expenses, on account of injury or damage to
any person or property, to the extent caused or occasioned by the Company’s
negligence in construction, reconstruction, excavation, operation or
maintenance of the electric facilities authorized by this franchise; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be obligated to defend, indemnify and save
harmless the City for any costs or damages to the extent arising from the
negligence of the City, its officers, employees or agents.
111.11   INFORMATION.  
Upon reasonable request the Company shall provide the City, on a project
specific basis, information indicating the horizontal location, relative to
boundaries of the right-of-way, of all equipment which it owns or over which it
has control that is located in City right-of-way. The Company and City
recognize the information provided will, under current Iowa law, constitute
public records, but that nonetheless, some information provided will be
confidential under state or federal law or both. Therefore, the City shall not
release any information with respect to the location or type of equipment which
the Company owns or controls in the right-of-way which may constitute a trade
secret or which may otherwise be protected from public disclosure by state or
federal law. Furthermore, the City agrees that no documents, maps or
information provided to the City by the Company shall be made available to the
public or other entities if such documents or information are exempt from
disclosure under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission Critical Energy Infrastructure requirements
pursuant to 18 CFR 388.112 and 388.113, or Chapter 22 of the Code of Iowa, as
such statutes and regulations may be amended from time to time.

The Company shall construct, operate and maintain its facilities in accordance
with the applicable regulations of the Iowa Utilities Board or its successors
and Iowa law.

the quantity and quality consistent with and in accordance with the applicable
regulations of the Iowa Utilities Board, the Company’s tariff and made
effective by the Iowa Utilities Board or its successors and Iowa law.
111.14   FRANCHISE FEE.  
There is hereby imposed upon the customers a franchise fee of one percent (1 %)
upon the gross receipts, less uncollectible accounts, derived by the delivery
and sale of electric energy to customers within the corporate limits of the
City. The franchise fee shall be remitted by the Company to the City on or
before the last business day of the calendar quarter following the close of the
calendar quarter in which the franchise fee is charged.
(Ord. 343 - May 17 Supp.)
111.15   FEE EXEMPTIONS.  
The City may, as allowed by Iowa law, exempt customer classes of sales from
imposition of the franchise fee, or modify, decrease or eliminate the franchise
fee. The City reserves the right to cancel any or all the franchise fee
exemptions and also reserves the right to grant exemptions to customer classes
in compliance with Iowa law and Section
111.16 of this chapter. The City does therefore exempt the customer classes or
customer groups shown below franchise fees.
   ·   Customer classes initially exempted by the City:
111.16   MODIFYING FEES.  
The City agrees to modify the level of franchise fees imposed only once in any
24-month period. Any such ordinance exempting classes of customers, increasing,
decreasing, modifying or eliminating the franchise fee shall become effective,
and billings reflecting the change shall commence on an agreed upon date which
is not less than 60 days following written notice to the Company by certified
mail. The Company shall not be required to implement such new ordinance unless
and until it determines that it has received appropriate official documentation
of final action by the City Council.
111.17   COLLECTION OF FEES.  
The City recognizes the administrative burden collecting franchise fees imposes
upon the Company and the Company requires lead time to commence collecting said
franchise fees. The Company will commence collecting franchise fees on or
before the first Company billing cycle of the first calendar month following 90
days of receipt of information required of the City to implement the franchise
fee, including the City’s documentation of customer classes subject to or
exempted from City-imposed franchise fee. The City shall provide the
information and data required in a form and format acceptable to the Company.
The Company will, if requested by the City, provide the City with a list of
premises considered by the Company to be within the corporate limits of the
City.
111.18   IDENTIFYING CUSTOMERS.  
The City shall be solely responsible for identifying customer classes subject
to or exempt from paying the City imposed franchise fee. The City shall be
solely responsible for notifying Company of its corporate limits, including,
over time, annexations or other alterations thereto, and customer classes that

the franchise fee. The City shall provide to the Company, by certified mail,
copies of annexation ordinances in a timely manner to ensure appropriate
franchise fee collection from customers within the corporate limits of the
City. The Company shall have no obligation to collect franchise fees from
customers in annexed areas until and unless such ordinances have been provided
to the Company by certified mail. The Company shall commence collecting
franchise fees in the annexed areas no sooner than 60 days after receiving
annexation ordinances from the City.
111.19   FRANCHISE FEE INDEMNIFICATION.  
The City shall indemnify the Company from claims of any nature arising out of
or related to the imposition and collection of the franchise fee. In addition,
the Company shall not be liable for collecting franchise fees from any customer
originally or subsequently identified, or incorrectly identified, by the City
as being subject to the franchise fee or being subject to a different level of
franchise fees or being exempt from the imposition of franchise fees.
111.20   FEE REMITTANCE.  
The Company shall remit franchise fee revenues to the City no more frequently

changes made in this collection schedule, including any alterations in the
calendar quarters or any other changes in the remittance periods.
111.21   FEE ADMINISTRATION.  
The City recognizes that the costs of franchise fee administration are not
charged directly to the City and agrees it shall, if required by the Company,
reimburse the Company for any initial or ongoing costs incurred by the Company
in collecting franchise fees that Company in its sole opinion deems to be in
excess of typical costs of franchise fee administration.
111.22   FEE REFUNDS.  
MidAmerican Energy Company shall not, under any circumstances be required to
return or refund any franchise fees that have been collected from City
customers and remitted to the City. In the event the Company is required to
provide data or information in defense of the City’s imposition of franchise
fees or the Company is required to assist the City in identifying customers or
calculating any franchise fee refunds for groups of or individual customers the
City shall reimburse the Company for the expenses incurred by the Company to
provide such data or information.
111.23   OBLIGATION TO COLLECT.  
The obligation to collect and remit the fee imposed by this chapter is modified
or repealed if:
   1.   Any other person is authorized to sell electricity at retail to City
consumers and the City imposes a franchise fee or its lawful equivalent at zero
or a lesser rate than provided in this chapter, in which case the obligation of
Company to collect and remit franchise fee shall be modified to zero or the
lesser rate;
   2.   The City adds additional territory by annexation or consolidation and
is unable or unwilling to impose the franchise fee upon all persons selling
electricity at retail to consumers within the additional territory, in which
case the franchise fee imposed on the revenue from sales by Company in the
additional territory shall be zero or equal to that of the lowest fee being
paid by any other retail seller of electricity within the City; or
   3.   Legislation is enacted by the Iowa General Assembly or the Supreme
Court of Iowa issues a final ruling regarding franchise fees or the Iowa
Utilities Board issues a final nonappealable order (collectively, “final
franchise fee action”) that modifies, but does not repeal, the ability of the
City to impose a franchise fee or the ability of Company to collect from City
customers and remit franchise fees to City. Within 60 days of final franchise
fee action, the City shall notify Company and the parties shall meet to
determine whether this chapter can be revised, and, if so, how to revise the
franchise fee on a continuing basis to meet revised legal requirements. After
final franchise fee action and until passage by the City of revisions to the
franchise fee ordinance, Company may temporarily discontinue collection and
remittance of the franchise fee if in its sole opinion it believes it is
required to do so in order to comply with revised legal requirements.
111.24   OBLIGATION RELIEVED.  
The other provisions of this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Company shall be completely relieved of its obligation to collect and remit to
the City the franchise fee effective as of the date specified below with no
liability therefore under each of any of the following circumstances as
determined to exist in the sole discretion of Company:
   1.   Any of the imposition, collection or remittance of a franchise fee is
ruled to be unlawful by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date of
such ruling or as may be specified by that Court
   2.   The Iowa General Assembly enacts legislation making imposition,
collection or remittance of a franchise fee unlawful, effective as of the date
lawfully specified by the General Assembly.
   3.   The Iowa Utilities Board, or its successor agency, denies the Company
the right to impose, collect or remit a franchise fee provided such denial is
affirmed by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date of the final
agency order from which the appeal is taken.
111.25   MANAGEMENT FEES. 
The City shall not, pursuant to Chapter 480A.6 of the Code of Iowa, impose or
charge right-of-way management fees upon the Company or fees for permits for
Company construction, maintenance, repairs, excavation, pavement cutting or
inspections of Company work sites and projects or related matters.
111.26   TERMINATION.  
Either City or Company (“party”) may terminate this franchise if the other
party shall be materially in breach of its provisions. Upon the occurrence of a
material breach, the non-breaching party shall provide the breaching party with
notification by certified mail specifying the alleged breach. The breaching
party shall have 60 days to cure the breach, unless it notifies the non-
breaching party, and the parties agree upon a longer period for cure. If the
breach is not cured within the cure period, the non-breaching party may
terminate this franchise. A party shall not be considered to be in breach of
this franchise if it has operated in compliance with state or federal law. A
party shall not be considered to have breached this franchise if the alleged
breach is the result of the actions of a third party or the other party.

with reasonable notice, to review at Grantee’s local office its gross revenue
records as may be necessary to monitor compliance with this section.

conduct a public hearing and shall grant an opportunity to the Grantee to
discuss the proposed increase in franchise fee.

commercial or revenue-generating services or services that may compete,
directly or indirectly, with services provided by the Grantee, provided,
however, that the City or its designee may cablecast acknowledgments of funding
sources and the underwriting of programming costs. Such acknowledgements will
be deemed non-commercial if they are within the standards for underwriting
applicable to the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) or the standards necessary
to maintain tax exempt status within the applicable regulations of the Internal
Revenue Service. Programming shall not lose its non-commercial character by
reason of including public or charitable fund-raising events or activities, or

or non-profit entities for PEG programming in accordance with the provisions of
47 C.F.R. 73.621 of the FCC’s Rules. The Educational and Governmental Access

facilities as the City deems necessary to operate the Government and
Educational Access channel. The City agrees that this initial grant may be
passed through to subscribers, as allowed by Federal law.
   2.   Prepaid Franchise Fees. The Grantee will provide the City with a
prepayment of franchise fees not to exceed ten percent (10%) of the Grantee’s
Gross Revenues received from the service area in the previous calendar to
purchase video and audio production equipment necessary to operate the access
channel no later than January 31, 2006. The City shall retain ownership and
shall be responsible for maintenance of all equipment purchased pursuant to
this section. The equipment purchase amount shall be considered a prepayment of
franchise fees as referenced in Section
112.07 of this chapter. The Grantee shall collect and retain franchise fees
from subscribers until the full amount of the prepayment has been recouped. The
Grantee shall provide the City with a statement of franchise fees collected to
recoup the amount of prepayment quarterly as required in Section
112.07(2). The Grantee shall pay all franchise fees to the City following
reimbursement for the PEG access equipment for the remaining term of the
agreement.
   3.   Optional Additional Prepayment of Franchise Fees. At the City’s option,
the Grantee shall make two additional prepayments of franchise fees during the
term of the agreement, provided: (i) all prepaid fees from the prior prepayment

written request no later than September 30 of the existing calendar year to
allow the Grantee to budget for the fee prepayment; and (iii) the prepayment

112.09   SERVICE TO PUBLIC BUILDINGS.

112.10   SERVICE AREA.
The Grantee shall, at its expense, promptly extend its system to have service
available to all potential subscribers of:
   1.    The corporate limits of the City and newly annexed areas to the City,
not then served by a cable system, where the average density is at least eight
(8) potential subscribers per lineal one-quarter (1/4) mile of the proposed
trunk and feeder cable route.
   2.   Any new single-family dwelling unit, commercial establishment, or
potential subscriber within 200 feet of the existing distribution system in the
City, upon request of the potential subscriber.
   3.   No customer shall be refused service arbitrarily. However, for unusual
circumstances, such as existence of more than 300 feet of distance from the
distribution cable to the connection point of service to the customers or a
density of less than eight potential subscribers per 1,320 cable-bearing strand
feet of trunk or distribution cable, service may be made available on the basis
of a capital contribution in aid of construction, including cost of material,
labor, and easements. For the purpose of determining the amount of capital
contribution in the aid of construction to be borne by the Grantee and the
customers in the area in which service may be expanded, the Grantee will
contribute an amount equal to the construction and other costs per one-quarter
mile, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of
residences per 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet of its trunks or distribution
cable, and whose denominator equals six potential subscribers. Customers who
request service hereunder will bear the remainder of the construction and other
costs on a pro rata basis. The Grantee may require that the payment of the
capital contribution in aid of the construction borne by such potential
customers be paid in advance.
112.11   TEMPORARY DROPS.
Temporary drops shall be buried within two months of installation, except
during the winter months (November 15 to April 1). In the event that the
Grantee fails to bury any cable drops, within the two-month period, the Grantee
shall provide basic and expanded basic cable service without charge to the
affected cable subscriber from the last date that the drop was to have been
buried to that actual date that it is buried.
112.12   ANNUAL REPORT.
No later than ninety (90) days after the close of a Grantee’s fiscal year, and
upon written request, the Grantee shall submit a detailed written informative
report to the City, including the following information:
   1.   A summary of the previous year’s activities in development of the cable
system, including, but not limited to, services begun or dropped and newly
served geographic areas within the City limits.
   2.   A summary of complaints, identifying the number and specific nature of
complaints and their disposition.
   3.   A list of key management for the Prairie City franchise along with

arrangement, along with the total estimated number of persons who are provided
cable services in the service area without charge or under a barter agreement.

construed as any limitation upon the right of the City to grant to other
persons rights, privileges, or authorities similar to the rights, privileges,
and authorities herein set forth, in the same or other streets, alleys, or
other public ways or public places. The City specifically reserves the right to
grant at any time during the term of the franchise or renewal thereof, if any,
such additional franchises for a cable system as it deems appropriate.

ordinances necessary for the safety and welfare of the public and it agrees to

pursuant to such powers.

The Grantee’s right, title, or interest in the franchise shall not be sold,
transferred, assigned, or otherwise encumbered, other than to an entity,
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Grantee, without
the prior consent of the City. Such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. No
such consent shall be required, however, for a transfer in trust, by mortgage,
by other hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title, or interest of
the Grantee in the franchise in order to secure indebtedness. Within 30 days of
receiving the request for transfer, the City shall, in accordance with FCC
rules and regulations, notify the Grantee in writing of the information it
requires to determine the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the
transferee.
112.16   INDEMNIFICATION.
The Grantee shall defend, indemnify, protect, and hold harmless the City from
and against any and all liability, losses, and damage to property or bodily
injury or death to any person, including payments made under worker’s
compensation laws, which may arise out of or be caused by the erection,
construction, replacement, removal, maintenance, or operation of Grantee’s
cable system and caused by any act or failure to act on the part of the
Grantee, its agents, officers, servants, or employees. The City shall give the
Grantee written notice of its obligation to indemnify, within 30 days following
service of a petition or other similar pleading. If the City determines that it
is necessary for it to employ separate counsel, the costs for such separate
counsel shall be the responsibility of the City.

days from receipt of the notice described in subsection 1: (i) to respond to
the City, contesting the assertion of noncompliance; or (ii) to cure such
default; or (iii) in the event that, by the nature of default, such default
cannot be cured within the 30-day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy
such default and notify the Franchising Authority of the steps being taken and
the projected date that they will be completed.
   3.   Public Hearing. In the event that the Grantee fails to respond to the
notice described in subsection 1 pursuant to the procedures set forth in
subsection 2, or in the event that the alleged default is not remedied within

a public hearing to investigate the default. The City shall notify the Grantee
in writing of the time and place of such meeting no less than five business
days in advance and provide the Grantee with an opportunity to be heard.
   4.   Enforcement. Subject to applicable Federal and State law, in the event
the City, after such public hearing, determines that the Grantee is in default
of any provision of the franchise, the City may:
      A.   Seek specific performance of any provision, which reasonably lends
itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages;
      B.   Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other

instances of substantial noncompliance with a material provision of the
franchise. The notice shall set forth the exact nature of the noncompliance.
The Grantee shall have ninety (90) days from such notice to object in writing
and to state its reasons for such objection. In the event the City has not
received a response satisfactory from the Grantee, it may then seek termination
of the franchise at a public meeting. The City shall cause to be served upon
the Grantee, at least ten (10) days prior to such public meeting, a written
notice specifying the time and place of such meeting and stating its intent to
request such termination. At the designated meeting, the City shall give the
Grantee an opportunity to state its position on the matter, after which it
shall determine whether or not the franchise shall be revoked. The Grantee may
appeal such determination to an appropriate court, which shall have the power
to review the decision of the City de novo and to modify or reverse such
decision as justice may require. Such appeal to the appropriate court must be
taken within sixty (60) days of the issuance of the determination of the City.
The City may, at its sole discretion, take any lawful action which it deems
appropriate to enforce the City’s rights under the franchise in lieu of
revocation of the franchise.

default within sixty (60) days after receipt of written notice of the default
from the City, or such longer time as specified by the City.

or appointed for all or part of the Grantee’s assets.
      D.   If the Grantee makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors.

of such order or ruling and has received a stay from a Court of appropriate
jurisdiction.

equipment, the Grantee shall refill at its own expense any excavation that
shall be made by it and shall leave all public ways and places in as good
condition as that prevailing prior to the Grantee’s removal of its equipment
and appliances, without affecting the electric or telephone cables, wires or
attachments. The City shall inspect and approve the condition of the public
ways and public places and cables, wires, attachments and poles after removal.
Liability insurance indemnity provided in Section
112.21 and the performance bond in Section

reasonable satisfaction of the City, after due notice and opportunity to curve,
the City may cause such work to be done and the Grantee shall reimburse the

Grantee to enter into the City’s streets and public ways for the purpose of
constructing or operating a cable system or providing cable service to any part
of the service area, the material provisions thereof shall be reasonably
comparable to those contained herein, in order that one operator not be granted
an unfair competitive advantage over another, and to provide all parties equal

manner as to pass and provide adequate tap off facilities for every single-
family dwelling unit, multiple dwelling unit or other residential unit within
the service area, subject to the provisions of the Franchise Agreement.
   2.   Conditions of Street Occupancy. All transmission and distribution
structures, poles, other lines, and equipment installed or erected by the
Grantee pursuant to the terms hereof shall be located so as to cause a minimum
of interference with the proper use of public ways and with the rights and
reasonable convenience of property owners who own property that adjoins any of
such public ways. A Grantee shall first obtain a permit from the City prior to
commencing construction on the streets, alleys, public grounds or places and
shall be on a form provided by the City. A Grantee shall not open or disturb
the surface of any street, sidewalk, driveway, or public place for any purpose
without having first obtained a permit to do so in the manner provided by
ordinance. All excavation shall be coordinated with other utility excavation or
construction so as to minimize disruption to the public.

construction, operation, or maintenance of the cable system there occurs a
disturbance of any public way by the Grantee, it shall, at its expense, replace

   4.   Relocation at Request of the City. Upon its receipt of reasonable
advance notice, not to be less than ten (10) business days, the Grantee shall,
at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate in the

street abandonment, freeway, and street construction, change or establishment
of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, gas or water pipes, or any
other type of structures or improvements by the City; but, the Grantee shall in
all cases have the right of abandonment of its property. If public funds are
available to any person using such street, easement, or right of way for the
purpose of defraying the cost of any of the foregoing, the City shall provide
notice to the Grantee of the City’s application for such funds and shall allow
the Grantee to apply on its own behalf for such funds.
   5.   Safety Requirements. Construction, installation, and maintenance of the
system shall be performed in an orderly and worker like manner. All such work

by mutual agreement obtain the use of towers, poles, lines, cables, and other
equipment and facilities from utility companies operating within the City, and
use towers, poles, lines, cables, and other equipment and facilities for the
system. When and where practicable, the poles used by the Grantee’s
distribution system shall be those erected and maintained by such utility
companies operating within the City, provided mutually satisfactory rental
agreements can be reached. It is the City’s desire that all holders of public
franchises in the City cooperate with the Grantee and allow the Grantee the use
of their poles and pole line facilities whenever possible so that the number of
new or additional poles installed in the City may be minimized.
      B.   Grantee’s Poles. The Grantee shall have the right to erect, install,
and maintain its own towers, poles, guys, anchors, underground conduits, and
manholes as may be necessary for the proper construction and maintenance of the

at the worksite the necessary City permit or copy thereof, for scheduled work,
obtained in advance from the appropriate Department of the City.
      C.   Rent of Grantee’s Poles. A Grantee shall have the right to establish
terms, conditions, and specifications governing the form, type, size, quantity,
and location of equipment of others on its poles, and shall have the further
right to charge a fair rental for attachment space or spaces occupied by the
said equipment and plant of others, except that no rent shall be paid by the
City for its attachment to the Grantee’s poles and such use shall be non-
commercial and may not be supplied for any municipal use directly competing
with the Grantee. The City shall pay any costs incurred by a Grantee in
providing space for a City’s attachments, including any necessary
rearrangements of a Grantee’s equipment and plant to provide room for City’s
attachments. Upon expiration, termination, or revocation of a franchise, or
should a Grantee wish to dispose of any of its poles, conduit or manholes,
being used by the City, the City shall have the option to purchase them in
place for their fair market value.
      D.   Underground Facilities. In those areas of the City where
transmission or distribution facilities of both telephone and power companies
are underground or hereafter may be placed underground, the Grantee shall
likewise construct, operate, and maintain all of its transmission and
distribution facilities underground to the maximum extent the then existing
technology permits, in accordance with the most recent National Electrical
Code, and its successor document, as well as in conformance with all applicable
State and municipal ordinances and codes. If and when necessary, amplifiers
and/or transformers in the Grantee’s transmission and distribution lines shall
be in appropriate housings on the surface of the ground. The Grantee shall
obtain a permit from the City for such underground construction of all work
required or pursuant to this section. Even when not required, underground
installation is preferable to the placing of additional poles.
      E.   Compliance To Codes. All transmission and distribution structures,
lines, and equipment erected by the Grantee in the City shall be located so as
not to endanger or interfere with the normal use of streets, alleys, or other
public ways and places so as to cause minimum interference with the rights or
reasonable convenience of the general public and adjoining property owners and
so as not to interfere with existing public utility installations and so as to
comply with the most recent National Electrical Code, as amended, as well as in
conformance with all applicable State and municipal ordinances and codes of
general applicability. In the case of any disturbance by the Grantee or its
equipment of pavement, sidewalks, driveway, lawn, or other surfacing the
Grantee shall, at its expense and in the manner required by the City, promptly
replace and restore all such surfacing to a reasonably comparable condition.
The construction, installation, operation, maintenance, and/or removal of the
Cable Communications System shall meet all of the following safety,
construction, and technical specifications and codes and standards:

above or below ground shall be so placed as to comply with all the lawful
requirements of the City.
      G.   Moving Permits. The Grantee shall, on request of any persons holding
a moving permit issued by the City, temporarily move its wires or fixtures to
permit the moving of buildings. The expense of such temporary removal shall be
paid in advance by the person requesting the same, and the Grantee shall be
given not less than seven (7) business days’ advance notice to arrange for such
temporary changes.
      H.   Authority To Trim Trees and Shrubbery. The Grantee shall have the
authority under the supervision and direction of the City to trim trees or
other natural growth overhanging any of its cable system in the street or alley
right-of-way so as to prevent branches from coming in contact with the
Grantee’s wires, cables, or other equipment. The Grantee shall reasonably
compensate the City or property owner for any damages caused by such trimming,
or shall, in its sole discretion, and at its own cost and expense, reasonably
replace all trees or shrubs damaged as a result of any construction of the
cable system undertaken by Grantee. Such replacement shall satisfy any and all
obligations Grantee may have to the City pursuant to the terms of this section.
      I.   Service Area. The Grantee shall design and construct the cable
system in such a manner as to pass by and provide adequate tap-off facilities
for every single family dwelling, multiple family dwelling, apartment, school
and government building located within the City limits, based upon the
corporate boundaries at the time of the granting of the franchise, provided
that such locations meet the density requirements pursuant to subsection 7 -
Extension of Service.
      J.   Underground Construction. Grantee shall participate in and use Iowa
One Call and ensure that cable is buried pursuant to standards established by
Iowa One Call or any State-mandated successor agency.
      K.   Temporary Drops. Temporary drops shall be buried within two months
of installation, except during the winter months which shall be defined as
November 15 to April 1. In the event that the Grantee fails to bury any cable
drops, within the two-month period, the Grantee shall provide basic and
expanded basic cable service without charge to the affected cable subscriber
from the last date that the drop was to have been buried to that actual date
that it is buried.
      L.   Closing of Streets. The Grantee shall not be entitled to damages
from the City sustained by the virtue of the closing, vacation, or relocation
of any streets or alleys.
      M.   Private Easements. No cable, line, wire, amplifier, converter, or
other pieces of equipment owned by the Grantee shall be installed by the
Grantee within private easements without first securing the written permission
of the owner, lessee, or tenant of the property involved, unless a private
easement is determined to be available for use by the Grantee in accordance
with applicable law.
   7.   Extension of Service. Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter
shall require that a Grantee shall, at its expense, promptly extend its system
to have service available to all potential subscribers of:
      A.   The corporate limits of the City and newly annexed areas to the
City, not then served by a cable system, where the average density is at least
eight (8) potential subscribers per lineal one quarter (1/4) mile of the
proposed trunk and feeder cable route.
      B.   Any new single-family dwelling unit, commercial establishment, or
potential subscriber within 200 feet of the existing distribution system in the
City, upon request of the potential subscriber.
      C.   No customer shall be refused service arbitrarily. However, for
unusual circumstances, such as (i) existence of more than 200 feet of distance
from the distribution cable to the connection point of service to the
customers, or a (ii) density of less than eight potential subscribers per 1,320
cable-bearing strand feet of trunk or distribution cable, service may be made
available on the basis of a capital contribution in aid of construction,
including cost of material, labor, and easements. For the purpose of
determining the amount of capital contribution in the aid of construction to be
borne by the Grantee and the customers in the area in which service may be
expanded, the Grantee will contribute an amount equal to the construction and
other costs per one quarter (1/4) mile, multiplied by a fraction whose
numerator equals the actual number of residences per 1,320 cable-bearing strand
feet of its trunks or distribution cable, and whose denominator equals eight
potential subscribers. Customers who request service hereunder will bear the
remainder of the construction and other costs on a pro rata basis. The Grantee
may require that the payment of the capital contribution in aid of the
construction borne by such potential customers be paid in advance.
   8.   Service to Public Buildings. A Grantee shall upon request, provide
without charge, one outlet of basic service and expanded basic service to those
public buildings identified in the Franchise Agreement in accordance with the
terms set forth in the Franchise Agreement.

FCC’s customer service standards. Such standards are set out in
Chapter 115 of this Code of Ordinances.

located in the Service Area on a site readily accessible to the general public
or at the City Hall.

potential or existing subscriber's antenna as a condition of provision of
service, except with the consent of the cable subscriber.
   13.   Disconnection. There shall be no charge for a disconnection of cable
service. The Grantee may prescribe advance disconnect notice requirements for
use when a subscriber voluntary elects to disconnect cable service, provided
that the Grantee advises subscribers of the policy on rate cards which are
included in new customer packets. If any subscriber fails to pay a fee or
charge, a Grantee may disconnect the subscriber’s service. Such disconnection
shall not be effected until the subscriber has been given 10 days’ advance
written notice of the intention to disconnect. After disconnection, upon
payment of any required delinquent fee or reconnection charge, the Grantee
shall reinstate the subscriber’s service.
   14.   Reconnections. A Grantee shall restore service to customers wishing
restoration of service provided customer shall first satisfy any previous
obligations owed.
   15.   Downgrades. Subscribers shall have the right to have cable service
disconnected or downgraded in accordance with FCC rules. The reduced billing
for such service will be effective immediately and such disconnection or
downgrade shall be made as soon as practicable. A refund of unused service
charges shall be paid to the customer within thirty (30) days from the date of
termination of service.
   16.   Termination of Service. Within 30 days of termination of service to
any subscriber for any reason, a Grantee may, upon the subscriber’s written
request, promptly remove all its aerial facilities and equipment from the
subscriber’s premises, pursuant to FCC rules and regulations.

promptly notify the City, in writing, or, if appropriate, by oral
communication, of any significant interruption in the operation of the system.

of the system” means any interruption of audio or video on one or more channels
for a duration of at least one hour to at least one fiber optic node in the
service area, or an interruption of audio or video on at least one or more
channels initiated by the Grantee of at least four hours to any single
subscriber. The Grantee shall not be required to provide specific notice to the
City of service interruptions in the case of a cable system upgrade.
   18.   Subscriber Credit For Service Interruptions. Upon service interruption
of subscriber’s cable service, the following shall apply:
      A.   For service interruptions of over four hours and up to seven days,
the Grantee shall provide, at the subscriber’s verbal or written request, a

shortest time possible. Scheduled service interruptions, insofar as possible,
shall occur during periods of minimum use of the cable system. A written log or
an equivalent stored in computer memory and capable of access and reproduction,
shall be maintained for all service interruptions, as required by this chapter.
   20.   Refunds To Subscribers.
      A.   If a Grantee fails to provide any material service requested by a
subscriber in accordance with the current FCC standards, the Grantee shall,
after adequate notification and being afforded the opportunity to provide the
service, promptly refund all deposits or advance charges paid for the service
in question by the subscriber.
      B.   If any subscriber terminates for any other reason, a Grantee shall
refund the unused portion of any prepaid subscriber service fee on a daily pro
rata basis. The effective date used to pro rate such refunds shall be the date
that the subscriber contacts the Grantee or a mutually agreed upon date.
      C.   Any disputes arising under this section shall be resolved in
accordance with Section
113.12(5) of this chapter.
   21.   Channel Card. The Grantee shall distribute to all subscribers via
direct mail or bill stuffers no less than annually an accurate and up-to-date
channel card listing the cable channels and services available over the cable
system. A revised channel card shall be distributed via a newspaper of record
within thirty (30) days after a change or additional in channels or services
offered affecting two or fewer channels. Whenever changes in channels or
services have affected three or more channels since the last channel card
distributed via direct mail or bill stuffers, then a new channel card shall be
distributed to every subscriber within thirty (30) days via direct mail or bill
stuffers.
   22.   Customer Handbook. A Grantee shall provide written customer policies

making available the services or facilities of its cable system, or in its
rules or regulations, or in any other manner, make or grant preferences or
advantages to any subscriber or potential subscriber, or to any user or
potential user, and shall not subject any person to any prejudice or
disadvantage, based on their race, color, national origin or gender. This
provision shall not prohibit promotional campaigns to stimulate subscriptions
to the cable system or other legitimate uses thereof, nor the establishment of
a graduated scale of charges and classified rate schedules to which any
subscriber coming within such classification shall be entitled.
   25.   Identification of Employees. Every field service and installation
employee of the Grantee shall be clearly identified by an identification card,
badge or uniform shirt. All employees of Grantee shall display proper
identification upon request of a subscriber, provided that the Grantor requires
all utilities operating in the City to do the same. Every field service and
installation vehicle of the Grantee shall be clearly marked by logo or decals.
113.10   SYSTEM DESIGN AND EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   1.   All Channels Emergency Alert System. The Grantee shall, in the case of
any emergency or disaster, make its entire cable system available without
charge to the City or to any other governmental or civil defense agency that
the City shall designate. The cable system shall be engineered to provide an
audio and video alert system to allow authorized officials to automatically
override the audio and video signal on all channels and transmit and report
emergency information pursuant to FCC regulations. The City shall hold the
Grantee, its agents, employees, officers, and assigns hereunder, harmless from
any claims arising out of the emergency use of its facilities by the City,
including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, provided
that the emergency alert system is in good repair and is operational as
required by FCC regulations and the Franchise Agreement. The Grantee will

are unintelligible. The lockout device described herein shall be made available
to all subscribers requesting it beginning on the first day that any cable
service is provided.
   4.   Public, Educational and Governmental Channels. The Grantee shall
provide specially dedicated, non-commercial education and government access
channels to be made available to the public, groups, and individuals on a
first-come, non-discriminatory basis, as required by a franchise agreement.

month for the entire term of this franchise payable in the same manner as the
franchise fee payment pursuant to Section
113.11(1) hereof. The City acknowledges that this amount shall not be
considered gross revenues subject to the payment of franchise fees pursuant to
Section
113.11(1) hereof. Furthermore, payments of this ongoing support shall not be
deemed to be “franchise fees” within the meaning of Section 622 of the Cable
Act and such payment shall not be deemed to be “payments-in-kind” or any
involuntary payments chargeable against the compensation to be paid to the City
by a Grantee pursuant to Section
113.11(1) hereof. A Grantee shall be allowed to collect such fee as a pass
through to cable subscribers. This fee shall be revised on an annual basis in
accordance with the consumer price index.

remaining unused channels available for lease as required by Section 612 of the
Cable Act.
   7.   Interference. The Grantee’s cable system shall be designed, engineered,
and maintained so as not to interfere with the television and radio reception
of residents of the City who are not subscribers on the cable system.
   8.   Additional Services. The Grantee is encouraged to make available such
additional video, audio, radio, digital, point-to-point service, and other
services as are requested by subscribers and programmers who are willing to pay
for such services, provided that such services are technologically and
economically feasible. If no applicable rate exists when such a service is
requested, the rate change procedures established in Section
113.11(2) shall be followed.
   9.   Technical Standards. The cable system shall be operated and maintained

City an annual amount equal to five percent of the Grantee’s gross revenues as
defined in Section
113.01 of this chapter.
      B.   Quarterly Payments. Payment due to the City under the Franchise
Agreement shall be made quarterly at the City Clerk’s office not later than 45
days following March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year.
Any fee not paid when due shall bear interest at a rate of 1½ percent per month
from the date due. Each payment shall be accompanied with a detailed report
signed by an officer or authorized representative of the Grantee, showing the
basis for the computation, and shall include but not be limited to, a specific
breakdown of the following items: basic tier service charges, expanded basic
service charges, installation charges, reconnection fees, premium channel
revenues, revenue from other sources such as contracted or subleased cable
services, pay per view, miscellaneous revenue, and such other relevant facts,
as may be required by the City, necessary to determine the accuracy of the
franchise payment as specified in of this chapter. The acceptance of any
payment shall not be construed as an accord that the amount paid is, in fact,
the correct amount; nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a
release of any claim the City may have for additional sums payable by the
Grantee. All amounts paid shall be subject to audit and recomputation by the
City. The Grantee shall permit the City, upon request with reasonable notice,
to review at Grantee’s local office its gross revenue records as may be
necessary to monitor compliance with this section.
      C.   Franchise Fee Audit. A Grantee will fully cooperate with a franchise
fee audit performed by a professional firm that is chosen by the City. The
costs associated with the audit will be paid for by the City, except that the
Grantee shall pay for the costs if the audit shows an underpayment of franchise
fees in excess of five percent (5%) or more for a reporting period. The Grantee
agrees to permit the City, upon request with reasonable notice, to review at
Grantee’s local office its gross revenue records as may be necessary to monitor
compliance with this section.
      D.   Franchise Fee Increases. The City may request an increase in
franchise fees at any time during the term of the franchise, equal to the
maximum percentage allowed by federal law. However, such request shall be made
in writing and the Grantee will not be liable for said increase until proper
notice, as defined by Federal law, is given to its subscriber. Prior to making
a final decision regarding an increase in franchise fees, the City shall
conduct a public hearing and shall grant an opportunity to the Grantee to
discuss the proposed increase in franchise fee.
      E.   Limitation on Franchise Fee Actions. The period of limitation for
recovery of any franchise fee payable hereunder shall be five years from the
date on which payment by a Grantee is due.
   2.   Rates and Charges. The City may regulate rates for the provision of
basic cable and equipment as permitted by of the Cable Act. Any rate
adjustments shall be filed with the City Clerk not later than 30 days prior to
the implementation of the adjustment.
   3.   Franchise Renewal. Any proceedings undertaken by the City which relate
to the renewal of a Grantee’s franchise shall be governed by and comply with
the provisions of Section 626 of the Cable Act, as amended, unless the
procedures and substantive protections set forth therein shall be deemed to be
preempted and superseded by the provisions of any subsequent provision of
Federal or State law.
   4.   Conditions of Sale. If a renewal or extension of a Grantee’s franchise
is denied or the franchise is lawfully terminated, and the City either lawfully
acquires ownership of the cable system or by its actions lawfully effects a
transfer of ownership of the cable system to another person, any such
acquisition or transfer shall be at a price determined pursuant to the
provisions set forth in Section 627 of the Cable Act. In the case of a final
determination of a lawful revocation of the franchise, at the Grantee’s
request, which shall be made in its sole discretion, the Grantee shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to effectuate a transfer of its system to a qualified
third party. During such a period of time the City shall authorize the Grantee
to continue to operate pursuant to the terms of its prior franchise. However,
in no event shall such authorization exceed a period of time greater than six
(6) months from the effective date of such revocation. If, at the end of that
time, the Grantee is unsuccessful in procuring a qualified transferee or
assignee of its system which is reasonably acceptable to the City, the Grantee
and the City may avail themselves of any rights they may have pursuant to
Federal or State law. The Grantee may continue to operate of its system during
the six-month period and it shall not be deemed to be a waiver or
extinguishments of any right of either the City or the Grantee.
   5.   Transfer of Franchise.
      A.   Transfer of Franchise. Any franchise granted under this chapter
shall be a privilege to be held for the benefit of the public. Any franchise so
granted cannot, in any event, be sold, transferred, leased, assigned or
disposed of, including, but not limited to, by forced or voluntary sale, except
to entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Grantee,
without the prior written consent of the City. Such consent, as required by the
City, shall be given or denied no later than 120 days following any request and
shall not be unreasonably withheld. Prior consent shall not be required when
transferring the franchise between wholly owned subsidiaries of the same
entity. Nor shall such consent be required for a transfer in trust, by
mortgage, by other hypothecation, or assignment of any rights, title, or
interest of the Grantee in the cable system in order to secure indebtedness.
      B.   Ownership or Control. In the event that the Grantee sells or
otherwise transfers ownership in the cable system, such sale or transfer shall
conform with Section 617 of the Cable Act. For the purpose of determining
whether it shall consent to such change, transfer or acquisition of control,
the City may, in accordance with Section 617, inquire into the qualifications
of the prospective controlling party, and the Grantee shall assist the City in
any such inquiry. In seeking the City’s consent to any change in ownership or
control, the transferee shall have the responsibility:
         (1)   To show to the satisfaction of the City whether the proposed
purchaser, transferee, or assignee (the “proposed transferee”), which, in the
case of a corporation, shall include all directors and all persons having a
legal or equitable interest of 50 percent or more of the voting stock:
            a.   Has ever been convicted or held liable for acts involving
moral turpitude, including, but not limited to, any violation of Federal, State
or local law or regulations, or is presently under an indictment, investigation
or complaint charging such acts;
            b.   Has ever had a judgment in an action for fraud, deceit or
misrepresentation entered against it, her, him, or them by any court of
competent jurisdiction; or
            c.   Has pending any legal claim, lawsuit or administrative
proceeding arising out of or involving a cable system. The City retains the
right to withhold approval of the transfer until the transferee has provided
the information required in this subsection.
         (2)   To establish the financial solvency of the proposed transferee
by submitting all current financial data for the proposed transferee and such
other data to determine the legal, financial, and technical qualification of
the transferee.
         (3)   To establish that the technical capability of the proposed
transferee is such as shall enable it to maintain and operate the cable system
for the remaining term of the franchise under the existing franchise terms.
      C.   Any financial institution having a pledge of the franchise or its
assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of
the franchise shall have the right to notify the City that the financial
institution, or its designee, as approved in writing by the City, shall take
control and operate the cable system in the event of a Grantee default in its
financial obligations. Further, said financial institution shall also submit a
plan for such operation that will ensure continued service and compliance with
all franchise requirements during the term the financial institution exercises
control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise control
over the cable system for a period exceeding one year, unless extended by the
City at its discretion, but during said period of time it shall have the right
to petition the City to transfer the franchise to another Grantee. Except
insofar as the enforceability of this subsection may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting
creditors rights generally, and further subject to applicable Federal, State or
local law, if the City finds that such transfer, after considering the legal,
financial, character, technical and other public interest qualities of the
proposed transferee, is satisfactory, the City shall transfer and assign the
right and obligations of such franchise as in the public interest.
      D.   The consent or approval of the City to any transfer by the Grantee
shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the City in and to
the streets, and any transfer shall by its terms, be expressly subject to the
terms and conditions of any franchise.
      E.   In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved
without the successor in interest becoming a signatory of the Franchise
Agreement.
      F.   The City may approve the transfer or deny the transfer pursuant to
Section 617 of the Cable Act.
      G.   When the City approves a transfer under this section, the new
Grantee shall indicate acceptance of the franchise as specified in Section
113.08, including the filing of all necessary bonds, funds, proofs of insurance
and certifications. The restrictions of this section shall be effective
immediately upon execution of a franchise agreement.
   6.   Right of Inspection of Construction. The City shall have the right to
visually inspect all construction or installation work performed subject to the
provisions of this chapter and to make such visual inspections as it shall find
necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of this chapter and other
pertinent provision of law.
   7.   New Developments. The Grantee is encouraged to upgrade its facilities,
equipment, and service so that its cable system is as advanced as the current
state of production technology will allow. New developments shall be a topic of
discussion at all review sessions and shall be a factor to be considered in
connection with requests for rate adjustments, pursuant to FCC rules and
regulations.
   8.   City’s Right To Purchase System. The City shall be entitled to a right
of first refusal of any bona fide offer to purchase the cable system made to
Grantee if the cable system is being sold separately and such sale is not
linked in any way to the sale of any other cable system in a separate franchise
area. “Bona fide offer,” as used in this section, means a written offer which
has been accepted by Grantee subject to the City’s rights under this chapter.
The City shall notify Grantee of its interest in purchasing the cable system
within 30 days of the City’s receipt from Grantee of copy of the written bona
fide offer. Payment shall be made upon closing in readily available funds
within 120 days of the City’s receipt from Grantee of a copy of the written
bona fide offer. The price to be paid by the City shall be the fair market
value of the cable system or the actual price that has been negotiated at arm’s
length between the parties, whichever is greater, or the amount offered in the
bona fide offer if only the Prairie City franchise is to be purchased.
113.12   COMPLIANCE AND MONITORING.
   1.   Testing For Compliance. The Grantee shall meet or exceed all FCC
minimum performance and technical standards. The City shall have the right to
compel the Grantee to provide results of Grantee’s testing of the cable system.
In the event that the City has evidence of noncompliance, the City may also
perform technical tests of the cable system during reasonable times and in a
manner which does not unreasonably interfere with the normal business
operations of the Grantee or the cable system in order to determine whether or
not the Grantee is in compliance with the terms hereof and applicable State or
Federal laws. Such tests may be undertaken only after giving the Grantee
reasonable notice thereof, not to be less than ten business days, and providing
a representative of the Grantee has an opportunity to be present during such
tests. In the event that such testing demonstrates that the Grantee has
substantially failed to comply with a material requirement hereof, the
reasonable costs of such tests shall be borne by the Grantee. In the event that
such testing demonstrates that the Grantee has substantially complied with such
material provisions hereof, the cost of such testing shall be borne by the
City. Except in emergency circumstances, the City agrees that such testing
shall be undertaken no more than once a year, and that the results thereof
shall be made available to the Grantee. Any such special performance tests or
measurements required by the City shall be reported to the City within 14
business days after such test or measurements are performed. Such report shall
include the following information: the nature of the complaint that
precipitated the special tests; what system component was tested, the equipment
used, and procedures employed in said testing; the results of such tests; and
the method in which such complaints were resolved. Any other information
pertinent to the special test shall be recorded.
   2.   Books and Records. The City or its certified public accountant, upon
reasonable notice to the Grantee, may review such of its books and records at
the Grantee’s business office, during normal business hours and on a non-
disruptive basis, as is reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the
terms hereof. Such records shall include, but shall not be limited to, any
public records required to be kept by the Grantee pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the FCC.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Grantee shall
not be required to disclose information which it reasonably deems to be
proprietary or confidential in nature under State and Federal rules of
evidence. The City agrees to treat any information disclosed by the Grantee as
confidential and only to disclose it to employees, representatives, and agents
thereof that have a need to know, or in order to enforce the provisions hereof.
The Grantee shall not be required to provide subscriber information in
violation of Section 631 of the Cable Act.
   3.   Communications with Regulatory Agencies. Copies of all petitions,
applications, communications, reports, and all other documents pertaining to
the Prairie City cable system and franchise submitted by the Grantee or its
parent companies to the FCC, Securities Exchange Commission, or any other
Federal or State regulatory commission or agency shall be made available to the
City upon written request to the Grantee.
   4.   Complaint Records. A written log or an equivalent stored in computer
memory and capable of access and reproduction, shall be maintained for all
service interruptions or complaints regarding system service problems. The
Grantee shall maintain detailed logs setting forth the date and substance of
each service interruption or complaint regarding the system service problems
received by phone, mail or other means during the preceding calendar month, and
the date and nature of action taken by the Grantee to respond to such
complaints, or, if still pending, the status thereof. Such logs shall be
available to the City for review for two years thereafter. A “complaint” as
used herein shall be a written complaint from a subscriber regarding signal
quality or service, but not regarding programming or rates which, in the case
of oral complaints is not resolved within the original telephone call or visit
from the subscriber.
   5.   City Role In Complaints. Unresolved complaints concerning the system or
its operation or maintenance may be directed to the City Clerk. The procedure
to handle complaints shall be as follows:
      A.   Within 30 days from the occurrence of the facts and circumstances
giving rise to a complaint or grievance, the complainant shall state his or her
complaint or grievance to the Grantee in writing. In the event such a complaint
or grievance is received by the City, the same shall be forwarded to Grantee in
writing.
      B.   Within five (5) business days after the receipt by the Grantee of a
complaint from the City, the Grantee shall state to complainant its intentions
with respect to the complaint in writing.
      C.   Unresolved complaints concerning the system or its operation or
maintenance shall be directed to the City. The City shall promptly forward the
complaint to the Grantee or shall take the question up by correspondence with
the Grantee. Within such time as may be reasonably prescribed by the City, the
Grantee shall resolve the complaint or advise the City of its refusal or
inability to do so. When the Grantee resolves the complaint, it shall so notify
the City. If a complaint has not been resolved, the City may take any
appropriate action authorized by this chapter.
      D.   All subscribers shall be notified by the Grantee that the City is
the local franchising authority.
      E.   Nothing herein shall limit or alter the requirement or requirements
contained in this chapter for customer service standards as contained in
Chapter 115 of this Code of Ordinances.
      F.   The City shall be notified of action taken to resolve grievances or
complaints.
   6.   Performance Testing. Grantee shall perform all cable system tests and
maintenance procedures as required by the FCC and this chapter.
   7.   Review Sessions.
      A.   Purpose of Review Sessions. In recognition of the fact that a great
many technical, financial, marketing and legal uncertainties are associated
with all aspects of cable communications at the present time, it is the intent
of the City to provide for a maximum feasible degree of flexibility in a
franchise throughout its term to achieve an advanced and modern cable system
for the City. The principal means for accomplishing this flexibility will be
the scheduled review sessions provided for in this chapter. It is intended that
such review sessions will serve as a means of cooperatively working out
solutions to problems that develop. Furthermore, such review sessions shall be
two-way processes. For example, if either party has perceived that some major
problem has developed, the session shall be devoted primarily to working out
solutions acceptable to both parties.
      B.   Topics to be Covered. The City and the Grantee shall hold scheduled
review sessions on the third, sixth, and ninth anniversary dates of the
effective date of the franchise agreement. All such review sessions shall be
open to the public and notice thereof shall be published once, not less than
four (4) days or more than twenty (20) days before each review session, as
provided by law. The published notice shall specify the topics to be discussed.
The review sessions may be canceled by mutual agreement of the City and
Grantee. The following topics may be discussed at every scheduled review
session:
         Recent and Developing Judicial and Federal Communications Rulings
         Service Rate Structures
         Free and Discounted Services
         Application of New Technology or New Developments
         Cable System Performance
         Cable System Extension Policy
         Services Provided
         Programming Offered
         Customer Complaints Review
         Community Development and Education
         Interconnection
         New Services
         Subscriber privacy abuse issues
         New developments
         Franchise Fees
         Other topics, in addition to those listed, may be added by either
party. Members of the general public may also request additional topics.
   8.   Regulatory Responsibility. The City, acting alone or acting jointly
with other franchising authorities, may exercise or delegate the following
responsibilities:
      A.   Administering the provision of a cable system franchise,
      B.   Coordinating the operation of a local access channel and facilities,
      C.   Providing technical, programming and operational support to public
agency users, such as government departments, schools and health care
institutions,
      D.   Establishing jointly with a Grantee, or as otherwise specified in
the Franchise Agreement, procedures and standards for use of channels dedicated
to public use and the sharing of public facilities, if provided for in any
Franchise Agreement,
      E.   Planning the expansion and growth of public benefit cable services,
      F.   Analyzing the possibility of integrating cable systems with other
local, regional or national telecommunications networks,
      G.   Formulating and recommending long-range telecommunications policy.
   9.   Annual Report. No later than 90 days after the close of a Grantee’s
fiscal year, and upon written request, the Grantee shall submit a detailed
written informative report to the City, including the following information:
      A.   A summary of the previous year’s activities in development of the
cable system, including, but not limited to, services begun or dropped and
newly served geographic areas within the City limits.
      B.   A summary of complaints, identifying the number and specific nature
of complaints and their disposition.
      C.   A list of key management for the Prairie City franchise along with
their addresses and job titles.
      D.   The annual report of the parent company, if a public corporation.
Such report shall be construed to mean the report of the previous year.
      E.   The total estimated annual value of the potential revenue from cable
services provided in the service area without charge or provided under a barter
arrangement, along with the total estimated number of persons who are provided
cable services in the service area without charge or under a barter agreement.
113.13   INSURANCE AND INDEMINIFICATION.
   1.   Indemnification. Any Grantee shall defend, indemnify, protect, and hold
harmless the City from and against any and all liability, losses, and damage to
property or bodily injury or death to any person, including payments made under
worker's compensation laws, which may arise out of or be caused by the
erection, construction, replacement, removal, maintenance, or operation of
Grantee’s cable system and caused by any act or failure to act on the part of
the Grantee, its agents, officers, servants, or employees. The City shall give
the Grantee written notice of its obligation to indemnify, within 30 days
following service of a petition or other similar pleading. If the City
determines that it is necessary for it to employ separate counsel, the costs
for such separate counsel shall be the responsibility of the City.
   2.   Insurance Coverage and Notifications. A Grantee shall maintain
insurance in such amounts and kinds of coverage as may be specified by the City
in the Franchise Agreement. Such coverage may be reasonably adjusted by the
City with 90-day notification, provided that the City demonstrates the need for
increases in coverage. The Grantee shall maintain such insurance with insurance
underwriters authorized to do business in the State of Iowa. All policies shall
name the City, its employees, servants, agents, and officers as additional
insured parties. Each policy shall provide that it may not be canceled or the
amount of coverage altered until 30 days after receipt by the City Clerk of a
registered mail notice of such intent to cancel or alter coverage. The Grantee
shall provide a certificate of insurance designating the City as an “additional
insured.” The Grantee shall maintain and provide to the City proof of public
liability insurance for not less than the amounts specified in the Franchise
Agreement.
   3.   Insurance For Contractors and Subcontractors. Any Grantee shall provide
coverage for any contractor or subcontractor involved in the construction,
installation, maintenance or operation of its cable system by either obtaining
the necessary endorsements to its insurance policies or requiring such
contractor or subcontractor to obtain appropriate insurance coverage consistent
with this section and appropriate to the extent of its involvement in the
construction, installation, maintenance or operation of the Grantee’s cable
system.
   4.   Foreclosure. A foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or part of the
system shall be treated as a change in control of the Grantee and the
provisions of Section
113.14(7) of this chapter shall apply.
   5.   Receivership. The City shall have the right to cancel this franchise
120 days after the appointment of a receiver or trustee, to take over and
conduct the business of the Grantee, whether in receivership, reorganization,
bankruptcy, or other action or proceedings, unless such receivership or
trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of said 120 days,
or unless:
      A.   Within 120 days after being elected or appointed, such receiver or
trustee shall have fully complied with all provisions of this chapter and
remedied all defaults thereunder; and
      B.   Such receiver or trustee shall have executed an agreement, approved
by the court having jurisdiction, whereby such receiver or trustee agrees to be
bound by this chapter and the franchise granted to the Grantee.
   6.   Continuity of Service.
      A.   Right to Continuous Service. It shall be the right of all
subscribers to continue receiving service insofar as their financial and other
obligations to the Grantee are honored. In the event that the Grantee elects to
rebuild, modify, or sell the cable system, or the City gives notice in
accordance with the franchise or this chapter of intent to terminate or fails
to renew this franchise, the Grantee shall act so as to ensure that all
subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted service for six months. In the
event of a change of Grantee, or in the event a new operator acquires the cable
system, the original Grantee shall cooperate with the City, new Grantee or
operator in maintaining continuity of service to all subscribers. During such
period, Grantee shall be entitled to the revenue for any period during which it
operates the cable system, and shall be entitled to reasonable costs for its
services when it no longer operates the cable system.
      B.   Right of City to operate Cable System. In the event Grantee fails to
operate the system for seven (7) consecutive days without prior approval of the
City or without just cause, the City may, working in conjunction with any
financial institution having a pledge of the franchise or its assets for the
advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the franchise,
operate the system or designate an operator until such time as Grantee restores
service under conditions acceptable to the City or a permanent operator is
selected. If the City is required to fulfill this obligation for the Grantee,
then during such period as the City fulfills such obligation, the City shall be
entitled to a reasonable management fee.
   7.   Franchise Processing Costs.
      A.   Initial Franchises. For an initial franchise awarded, the costs to
be borne by the Grantee shall include, but shall not be limited to, all costs
of publication of notices prior to any public meeting, publication of relevant
ordinances and franchise agreements, incurred by the City.
      B.   Franchise Renewal. For a franchise renewal, the Grantee shall
reimburse the City cost of publication of notices, publication of relevant
ordinances, and publication of franchise agreements.
      C.   Franchise Transfer. For a franchise transfer, the transferee shall
reimburse the City the cost of publication of notices, publication of relevant
ordinances, and publication of franchise agreements. The City reserves the
right to withhold approval of such transfer until all costs have been
reimbursed by the transferee.
      D.   Other Costs. The publication costs provided for in this section
shall be in addition to any other inspection or permit fee or other fees due to
the City under any other ordinance of general applicability.
   8.   Taxes. Subject to Federal and State law, the Grantee shall pay all real
estate taxes, special assessments, personal property taxes, license fees,
permit fees, and other generally applicable charges of a like nature which may
be taxed, charged, assessed, levied, or imposed upon the property of the
Grantee and upon any services rendered by the Grantee.
113.14   ENFORCEMENT AND TERMINATION OF FRANCHISE.
   1.   Notice of Violation. In the event that the City believes that the
Grantee has not complied with the terms of the franchise, it shall notify the
Grantee in writing of the exact nature of the alleged noncompliance.
   2.   Grantee’s Right To Cure or Respond. The Grantee shall have thirty (30)
days from receipt of the notice described in subsection 1: (i) to respond to
the City, contesting the assertion of noncompliance; or (ii) to cure such
default; or (iii) in the event that, by the nature of default, such default
cannot be cured within the 30-day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy
such default and notify the City of the steps being taken and the projected
date that they will be completed.
   3.   Public Hearing. In the event that the Grantee fails to respond to the
notice described in subsection 1 pursuant to the procedures set forth in
subsection 2, or in the event that the alleged default is not remedied within
30 days or the date projected pursuant to subsection 2 above, the City shall
schedule a public hearing to investigate the default. The City shall notify the
Grantee in writing of the time and place of such meeting no less than five
business days in advance and provide the Grantee with an opportunity to be
heard.
   4.   Enforcement. Subject to applicable Federal and State law, in the event
the City, after such public hearing, determines that the Grantee is in default
of any provision of the franchise, the City may:
      A.   Seek specific performance of any provision, which reasonably lends
itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages;
      B.   Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other
equitable relief; or
      C.   In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the
franchise, declare the Franchise Agreement to be revoked in accordance with the
procedures outlined in this section.
The City shall give written notice to the Grantee of its intent to revoke the
franchise on the basis of noncompliance by the Grantee, including one or more
instances of substantial noncompliance with a material provision of the
franchise. The notice shall set forth the exact nature of the noncompliance.
The Grantee shall have ninety (90) days from such notice to object in writing
and to state its reasons for such objection. In the event the City has not
received a response satisfactory from the Grantee, it may then seek termination
of the franchise at a public meeting. The City shall cause to be served upon
the Grantee, at least ten (10) days prior to such public meeting, a written
notice specifying the time and place of such meeting and stating its intent to
request such termination. At the designated meeting, the City shall give the
Grantee an opportunity to state its position on the matter, after which it
shall determine whether or not the franchise shall be revoked. The Grantee may
appeal such determination to an appropriate court, which shall have the power
to review the decision of the City de novo and to modify or reverse such
decision as justice may require. Such appeal to the appropriate court must be
taken within sixty (60) days of the issuance of the determination of the City.
The City may, at its sole discretion, take any lawful action which it deems
appropriate to enforce the City’s rights under the franchise in lieu of
revocation of the franchise.
   5.   Prompt Compliance. The Grantee shall not be relieved of its obligation
to comply with this chapter by reason of the City’s failure to enforce prompt
compliance.
   6.   Impossibility of Performance. A Grantee shall not be held in default or
noncompliance with the provisions of the franchise, nor suffer any enforcement
or penalty relating thereto, where such noncompliance or alleged defaults are
caused by the following circumstances if reasonably beyond its control:
      A.   Necessary utility rearrangements, pole change-outs or obtainment of
easement rights,
      B.   Governmental or regulatory restrictions,
      C.   Lockouts,
      D.   War,
      E.   National emergencies,
      F.   Fire,
      G.   Acts of God,
      H.   Strikes.

      A.   Grounds for Revocation. The City reserves the right to revoke any
franchise and rescind all rights and privileges associated with the franchise
in the following circumstances:
         (1)   If the Grantee should default in the performance of any of its
material obligations under this chapter or the franchise and fails to cure the
default within sixty (60) days after receipt of written notice of the default
from the City, or such longer time as specified by the City.
         (2)   If a petition is filed by or against the Grantee under the
Bankruptcy Act or any other insolvency or creditors’ rights law, State or
Federal, and the Grantee shall fail to have it dismissed.
         (3)   If a receiver, trustee or liquidator of the Grantee is applied
for or appointed for all or part of the Grantee’s assets.
         (4)   If the Grantee makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors.
         (5)   If the Grantee violates any order or ruling of any State or
Federal regulatory body having jurisdiction over the Grantee, unless the
Grantee or any party similarly affected is lawfully contesting the legality or
applicability of such order or ruling and has received a stay from a Court of
appropriate jurisdiction.
         (6)   If the Grantee evades any of the provisions of this chapter or
the Franchise Agreement.
         (7)   If the Grantee practices any intentional fraud or deceit upon
the City or cable subscribers.
         (8)   If the Grantee materially misrepresents facts in the application
for a franchise.
         (9)   If the Grantee ceases to provide services over the cable system
for seven (7) consecutive days for any reason within the control of the
Grantee.
      B.   Restoration of Property. In removing its plant, structures and
equipment, the Grantee shall refill at its own expense any excavation that
shall be made by it and shall leave all public ways and places in as good
condition as that prevailing prior to the Grantee’s removal of its equipment
and appliances, without affecting the electric or telephone cables, wires, or
attachments. The City shall inspect and approve the condition of the public
ways and public places and cables, wires, attachments and poles after removal.
Liability insurance indemnity provided in Section
113.13 and the performance bond in subsection 9 of this section shall continue
in full force and effect during the period of removal.
      C.   Reimbursement of Costs Pursuant to Paragraphs A and B of this
Subsection. In the event of a failure by the Grantee to complete any work as
required above or any work required by law or ordinance within the time
established and to the reasonable satisfaction of the City, after due notice
and opportunity to cure, the City may cause such work to be done and the
Grantee shall reimburse the City the costs thereof within thirty (30) days
after receipt of an itemized list of such costs or the City may recover such
costs as provided in subsection 8.
   8.   Security Fund.
      A.   Within ten (10) days after execution of the Franchise Agreement, the
Grantee shall deposit with the City Clerk, and maintain on deposit through the
term of the franchise, the sum of $10,000.00 as security for the faithful
performance by it of all the provisions of the franchise and compliance with
all orders, permits, and directions of any agency of the City having
jurisdiction over its acts or defaults under the franchise, and the payment by
the Grantee of any claims, liens, and taxes due the City which arise by reason
of the construction, operation, or maintenance of the system.
      B.   Within ten (10) days after notice that any amount has been withdrawn
from the security fund deposited pursuant to paragraph A of this subsection,
the Grantee shall pay to, or deposit with, the City Clerk a sum of money
sufficient to restore such security fund to the original amount of $10,000.00.
      C.   If the Grantee fails to pay to the City any compensation within the
time fixed herein; or fails after ten (10) days’ notice to pay to the City any
taxes due and unpaid; or fails to repay to the City within such ten (10) days,
any damages, costs, or expenses which the City shall be compelled to pay by
reason of any act or default of the Grantee in connection with the franchise;
or fails after three (3) days’ notice of such failure by the City to comply
with any provision of the franchise which the City reasonably determines can be
remedied by an expenditure of the security, the City Clerk may immediately
withdraw the amount thereof, with interest and any penalties, from the security
fund. Upon such withdrawal, the City Clerk shall notify the company of the
amount and date thereof.
      D.   The security fund deposited pursuant to this section shall become
the property of the City in the event that the franchise is canceled by reason
of the default of the Grantee. The Grantee, however, shall be entitled to the
return of such security fund, or portion thereof, as remains on deposit at the
expiration of the term of the franchise, provided that there is then no
outstanding default on the part of the Grantee. Interest earned by the
investment of the security fund will accrue to the Grantee.
      E.   The rights reserved to the City with respect to the security fund
are in addition to all other rights of the City, whether reserved by the
franchise or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding, or exercise of a
right with respect to such security fund shall affect any other right the City
may have.
   9.   Faithful Performance Bond. Upon acceptance of a franchise, the Grantee
shall submit and maintain throughout the term of the franchise, a faithful
performance bond in the amount of $100,000.00. The bond shall insure compliance
with all applicable laws, regulations, ordinances and provisions of this
permit, shall provide for recoverable loss or damages, compensation,
indemnification, reasonable attorney fees, cost of removal or abandonment of
Grantee’s property, and shall cover penalties of $100.00 per day for failure to
meet the construction requirements of any franchise agreement.
   10.   Violations and Penalties. If the Grantee fails to comply with the
requirements of this chapter, and a cable franchise agreement, then the City
may invoke and secure compliance in accordance with this Code of Ordinances and
as authorized by Section 364.22 of the Code of Iowa by following the due
process contained in subsections 1 through 4 of this section or as specified in
the enforcement provisions of the Franchise Agreement.
113.15   MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
   1.   In any action by the City or the Grantee that is mandated or permitted
under the terms hereof, such party shall act in a reasonable, expeditious, and
timely manner. Furthermore, in any instance where approval or consent is
required under the terms hereof, such approval or consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.
   2.   Equal Protection. In the event the City enters into a franchise,
permit, license, authorization, or other agreement of any kind with any other
person or entity other than the Grantee to enter into the City’s streets and
public ways for the purpose of constructing or operating a cable system or
providing cable service to any part of the service area, the material
provisions thereof shall be reasonably comparable to those contained herein, in
order that one operator not be granted an unfair competitive advantage over
another, and to provide all parties equal protection under the law.
   3.   Notices. Unless expressly otherwise agreed between the parties, every
notice or response required by a franchise to be served upon the City or the
Grantee shall be in writing, and shall be deemed to have been duly given to the
required party five business days after having been posted in a properly sealed
and correctly addressed envelope when hand delivered or sent by certified or
registered mail, postage prepaid or express mail service.
   4.   Waiver or Exemption. The City reserves the right to waive provisions of
this chapter or exempt all Grantees from meeting provisions of this ordinance,
if the City determines such waiver or exemption is in the public interest.

114.02 Rate Regulation Proceedings 114.05 Delegation of Power
114.03 Certification
 
114.01   AUTHORITY.
The City has the legal authority to administer and shall enforce against any
non-municipally owned cable television system operator, as permitted therein,
the provisions of Part 76, Subpart N of the Rules and Regulations of the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC), concerning Cable Rate Regulation, 47
C.F.R. §§76.900 et. seq., as they currently read and hereafter may be amended,
which are herewith incorporated by reference.
114.02   RATE REGULATION PROCEEDINGS.
Any rate regulation proceedings conducted hereunder shall provide a reasonable
opportunity for consideration of the views of any interested party, including
but not limited to, the City or its designee, the Cable Operator, subscribers,
and residents of the franchise area. In addition to all other provisions
required by the laws of the State of Iowa and by the City, and in order to
provide for such opportunity for consideration of the views of any interested
party, the City shall take the following actions:
   1.   The City shall publish notice as provided in Section 362.3 of the Code
of Iowa and shall mail, by certified mail, to the Cable Operator a notice of
the intent to conduct a public proceeding on basic service tier rates and/or
charges for equipment to receive such basic service tier, as defined by the
FCC.
   2.   The public notice shall state, among other things, that cable
television rates are subject to municipal review and explain the nature of the
rate review in question; that any interested party has a right to participate
in the proceeding; that public views may be submitted in the proceeding,
explaining how they are to be submitted and the deadline for submitting any
such views; that a decision concerning the reasonableness of the cable
television rates in question will be governed by the Rules and Regulations of
the FCC; and that the decision of the City is subject to review by the FCC.
   3.   The City shall conduct a public proceeding to determine whether or not
the rates or proposed rate increases are reasonable. The City may delegate the
responsibility to conduct the proceeding to any duly qualified and eligible
individual or entity. If the City or its designee cannot determine the
reasonableness of a proposed rate increase within the time period permitted by
the FCC Rules and Regulations, it may announce the effective date of the
proposed rates for an additional period of time as permitted by the FCC Rules
and Regulations, and issue any other necessary or appropriate order and give
public notice accordingly.
   4.   In the course of the rate regulation proceeding, the City may request
additional information from the Cable Operator that is reasonably necessary to
determine the reasonableness of the basic service tier rates and equipment
charges. Any such additional information submitted to the City shall be
verified by an appropriate official of the cable television system supervising
the preparation of the response on behalf of the entity, and submitted by way
of affidavit or under penalty of perjury, stating that the response is true and
accurate to the best of that person’s knowledge, information and belief formed
after reasonable inquiry.
   5.   The City may request proprietary information, provided that the City
shall consider a timely request from the Cable Operator that said proprietary
information shall not be made available for public information, consistent with
the procedures set forth in Section 0.459 of the FCC Rules and Regulations.
Furthermore, said proprietary information may be used only for the purpose of
determining the reasonableness of the rates and charges or the appropriate rate
level based on a cost-of-service showing submitted by the Cable Operator.
   6.   The City may exercise all powers under the laws of evidence applicable
to administrative proceedings under the laws of the State of Iowa and by the
City to discover any information relevant to the rate regulation proceeding,
including, but not limited to, subpoena, interrogatories, production of
documents, and deposition.
   7.   Upon termination of the rate regulation proceeding, the City shall
adopt and release a written decision as to whether or not the rate or proposed
rate increase is reasonable or unreasonable, and, if unreasonable, its remedy,
including prospective rate reduction, rate prescription, and refunds.
   8.   The City may not impose any fines, penalties, forfeitures or other
sanctions, other than permitted by the FCC Rules and Regulations, for charging

any dwelling (one family, two family or multiple dwelling), hotels/motels or

of the City. The establishment of more than two (2) adult uses within one
thousand (1,000) feet of each other compounds this damaging effect. Control of

licensed day care facility, church, public park or any dwelling (one family,
two family or multiple dwelling), hotels/motels or within one thousand (1,000)
feet of City Hall. Measurement of the one thousand (1,000) foot restriction
shall be taken on a direct line from the property line of such other business,
regularly scheduled school bus stop, public or parochial school, licensed day
care facility, church, public park or any dwelling (one family, two family or
multiple dwelling), hotels/motels or within one thousand (1,000) feet of City
Hall.
   2.   Concealment. All building openings, entries, windows, etc., of an adult
use shall be covered or screened in such a manner as to prevent a view into the
interior from any public or semi-public area. Advertisements, displays or other
promotional materials shall not be shown or exhibited so as to be visible to
the public from pedestrian sidewalks, walkways or from other public or semi-
public areas.
   3.   Minors. No minor (a person under age of 18 years) shall be permitted in
any establishment in which adult uses are permitted.

ordinances of the City. Any dead, diseased, or damaged tree or shrub that may
harbor serious insect or disease pests or disease injurious to other trees is
hereby declared to be a nuisance. The City shall have the authority to remove

160.01   STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
   1.   The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 414, Code of Iowa,
as amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure
safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
   2.   Findings of Fact.
      A.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Prairie City are subject to
periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare of the community.
      B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by: (i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the flood plain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
   3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City of Prairie City and
its residents and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare,

      B.   All factory-built homes, including those placed in existing factory-
built home parks or subdivisions, shall be anchored to resist flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not
limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
   6.   Utility and Sanitary Systems.
      A.   On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located or
designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
      B.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system as well as
the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment facilities
(other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood protection
equal to or greater than one foot above the 100-year flood elevation.
      C.   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to

transactions and correspondence pertaining to the administration of this
chapter.
   2.   Flood Plain Development Permit.
      A.   Permit Required. A Flood Plain Development Permit issued by the
Administrator shall be secured prior to any flood plain development (any man-
made change to improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited
to buildings or other structures, mining, filling, grading, paving, excavation
or drilling operations), including the placement of factory-built homes.
      B.   Application for Permit. Application shall be made on forms furnished
by the Administrator and shall include the following:
         (1)   Description of the work to be covered by the permit for which
application is to be made.
         (2)   Description of the land on which the proposed work is to be done
(i.e., lot, block, track, street address or similar description) that will
readily identify and locate the work to be done.
         (3)   Indication of the use or occupancy for which the proposed work
is intended.
         (4)   Elevation of the 100-year flood.
         (6)   Elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) of
the lowest floor (including basement) of buildings or of the level to which a
building is to be floodproofed.

improvements and market value of the building prior to the improvements.
         (8)   Such other information as the Administrator deems reasonably
necessary (e.g., drawings or a site plan) for the purpose of this chapter.
      C.   Action on Permit Application. The Administrator shall, within a
reasonable time, make a determination as to whether the proposed flood plain
development meets the applicable standards of this chapter and shall approve or
disapprove the application. For disapprovals, the applicant shall be informed,
in writing, of the specific reasons therefore. The Administrator shall not
issue permits for variances except as directed by the City Board of Adjustment.
      D.   Construction and Use to be as Provided in Application and Plans.
Flood Plain Development Permits based on the basis of approved plans and
applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in
such approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement or
construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. The applicant shall be
required to submit certification by a professional engineer or land surveyor,
as appropriate, registered in the State of Iowa, that the finished fill,
building floor elevations, floodproofing, or other flood protection measures
were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to
the use or occupancy of any structure.
   3.   Variance.
      A.   The City Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in specific
cases such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary
hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.
         (1)   Variances shall only be granted upon: (a) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (b) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (c) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
         (2)   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         (3)   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that: (a) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and
(b) such construction increases risks to life and property.
      B.   Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board of Adjustment Shall be
Based. In passing upon applications for Variances, the Board shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
         (1)   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights
or velocities caused by encroachments.
         (2)   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
         (3)   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability
of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.
         (4)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         (5)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the City.
         (6)   The requirements of the facility for a flood plain location.
         (7)   The availability of alternative locations not subject to
flooding for the proposed use.
         (8)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development
and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
         (9)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and flood plain management program for the area.
         (10)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.

The Official Zoning Map is identified by the signature of the Mayor, under the
following words: This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map
referred to in Ordinance 133 of the City of Prairie City, adopted on June 5,

   2.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall
be construed as following such lot lines.
   3.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following section lines, quarter

   6.   Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated
in paragraphs A through E above shall be so construed. Distances not
specifically indicated on the Official Zoning Map shall be determined by the
scale of the map.
   7.   Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at
variance with those shown on the Official Zoning Map, or in other circumstances
not covered by subsections A through E above, the Board of Adjustment shall
interpret the district boundaries.
165.07   NONCONFORMING LOTS AND USES.
   1.   Statement of Intent. Within the districts established by this chapter
or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures, and uses
of land and structures which were lawful before the ordinance codified herein
was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted
under the terms of this chapter or future amendment. It is the intent of this
chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed. It
is the further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall not be
enlarged upon, expanded, or extended, or used as grounds for adding other
structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. Nothing in this
chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or
designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun
prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of the Zoning Ordinance
and upon which actual building construction has been continuously carried on.
Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction
materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner; except that
where demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially
begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to
be actual construction, provided that such work shall be continuously carried
on until completion of the building involved.
   2.   Nonconforming Lots of Record. In any district in which residential
dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other
provisions of this chapter, a residential dwelling and customary accessory
buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of these regulations. Such lots must be in separate
ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership.
This provision shall apply even though such lots fail to meet the requirements,
for area or width or both that are generally applicable in the district,
provided that yard dimensions and other requirements not involving area or
width or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in
which such lot is located. Variance of area, width, and yard requirements shall
be obtained only through action of the board. If two or more lots or
combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single
ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of these
regulations, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements for
lot width and area as established by this chapter, the land involved shall be
considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of these regulations and
no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold which does not meet lot width
and area requirements established by these regulations, nor shall any division
of the parcel be made which leaves remaining any lot with width or area below
requirements stated in this chapter.
   3.   Nonconforming Use of Land, Use of Structures, and Structures in any
Residential District.
      A.   Nonconforming Use of Land in a Residential District. In any
residential district in which dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding
limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter, lawful use of land
exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of the Zoning
Ordinance as enacted or amended, such use may be continued, subject to the
following provisions.
         (1)   No such nonconforming use of land shall be enlarged or increased
or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance.
         (2)   No such nonconforming use of land shall be moved in whole or in
part to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance.
         (3)   If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for
a period of more than one year, any subsequent use of such land shall conform
to the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which such
land is located.
      B.   Nonconforming Use of Structures in a Residential District. If a
lawful use of a structure, or of structure and premises in combination, exists
at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the Zoning Ordinance, which
would not be allowed in the district under the terms of the Zoning Ordinance,
the lawful use may be continued subject to the following provisions:
         (1)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this
chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, or structurally altered except in changing the use
of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
         (2)   Any nonconforming use of a structure may be extended throughout
any of the parts of a building that were manifestly arranged or designed for
such use at the time of adoption or amendment of the Zoning Ordinance, but no
such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
         (3)   Wherever a nonconforming use of a structure has been changed to
a more restricted use or to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be
changed to a less restrictive use.
         (4)   When a nonconforming use of a structure or structure and
premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for one year, the
structure or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be
used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is
located.
         (5)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and
premises in combination, removal, or destruction of the structure shall
eliminate the nonconforming status of the land.
         (6)   Any structure devoted to a use made nonconforming by this
chapter which is destroyed by any means to an extent that it cannot be
reconstructed to a structurally sound condition in the judgment of the City
Council, exclusive of the foundations, shall not be reconstructed and used as
before such happening. If the structure can be reconstructed to a structurally
sound condition in the judgment of the City Council, it may be reconstructed
and used as before provided reconstruction be started within six (6) months of
such happening and be completed within one year, and be built of like or
similar materials.
      C.   Nonconforming Structures in a Residential District. Where a
structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning
Ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this Zoning Ordinance by
reason or restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other
characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may
be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
         (1)   No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way that
increases its nonconformity; and
         (2)   Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent
that it cannot be reconstructed to a structurally sound condition in the
judgment of the City Council, it shall not be reconstructed except in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
   4.   Nonconforming Use of Land, Use of Structures, and Structures in Any
District Other Than a Residential District.
      A.   Nonconforming Use of Land in a District Other Than in Residential.
The regulations governing nonconforming use of land in any residential
districts as described in subsection 3 of this section shall also apply to this
subsection.
      B.   Nonconforming Use of Structures in a District other than
Residential. The regulations governing nonconforming use of structures in any
residential district as described in subsection 3 of this section shall also
apply to this subsection with the following exception: Any structure in any
district other than a residential district devoted to a use made nonconforming
by this chapter may be structurally altered or enlarged in conformity with the
lot area, lot coverage, frontage, yard, height, and parking requirements of the
district in which located, provided such construction shall be limited to
buildings on land owned, of record, by the owner of the land devoted to the
nonconforming use prior to the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance. Such
structural alteration or enlargement shall not authorize the substitution of a
nonconforming use that is less restrictive than the one to which the structure
was devoted at the time of passage of this Zoning Ordinance.
      C.   Nonconforming Structures in a District Other Than Residential. The
regulations governing nonconforming structures in any residential district as
described in subsection 3 of this section shall also apply to this subsection.
   5.   Required Repairs and Unauthorized Nonconformity. On any building
devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work may be done on
ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixture,
wiring, or plumbing, provided that the cubic content of the building as it
existed at the time of passage or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance shall not
be increased. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof
declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public
safety, upon order of such official. Any use of land, use of structure, or use
of land and structure, in existence at the time of adoption of this Zoning
Ordinance which was not an authorized nonconformity under the previous zoning
ordinance shall not be authorized to continue its nonconforming status pursuant
to this Zoning Ordinance or amendments thereto.
   6.   Uses Under “Exceptions to Prohibited Uses” Are Nonconforming Uses. Any
use for which a special exception is permitted as provided in Section
165.27 of this chapter shall not be deemed a nonconforming use, but shall,
without further action, be deemed a conforming use in such district.
165.08   GENERAL REGULATIONS.
   1.   Visibility at Intersections. On any corner lot in any district, where
front yard and side yard setbacks are required, nothing shall be erected,
placed, planted, or allowed to grow in such a manner as to materially impede
vision between a height of 2½ and 7 feet above the centerline grades of the
intersecting streets in the area bounded by the street lines of such corner
lots and a line joining points along said street lines 10 feet from the point
of intersection of said street lines.
   2.   Fences or Walls. Fences, walls, and hedges shall be permitted in any
required yard, or along the edge of any yard; provided that no fence, wall, or
hedge along the street side or front edge of any front yard shall be over four
(4) feet in height, further provided that a property line fence, wall, hedge,
or any combination thereof shall in no case exceed eight (8) feet in height.
The finished side of any fence within or adjoining a residence district shall
face the abutting property. The side opposite the posts and or braces shall be
deemed the finished side.
   3.   Street Frontage Required. Lots containing any building used in whole or
in part for resident purposes shall abut for at least 40 feet on at least one
street, and there shall not be more than one single-family dwelling for such
frontage. The City Council may also allow, at its own discretion, the
construction of a building to be used in whole or part for residence purposes
on a lot which has an exclusively unobstructed private easement of access at
least 20 feet wide to a street, for each single-family dwelling, if the Council
determines that such construction is not in conflict with the intent of this
chapter.
   4.   Dwellings – Minimum Length and Width. All dwellings shall have a
minimum length and width not less than 20 feet, except dwellings placed in a
mobile home park.
   5.   Footing/Foundations. When structures are placed on other than a
permanent frost depth perimeter footing/foundation, the vertical space between
the perimeter of the first floor and grade level shall be in filled with like
material as is utilized in the construction of those permanent perimeter frost
depth footing/foundations.
   6.   Accessory Buildings. No accessory building shall be erected in any
front yard. Accessory buildings shall be a distance of at least five (5) feet
from alley lines or five feet from rear property lines, and five feet from lot
lines of adjoining lots which are in any "R" district, and on a corner lot they
shall conform to the setback regulations on the side street; however, in no
case shall any eave or overhang extend closer than 12 inches to a rear or side
yard lines, or an easement line. Accessory buildings connected by a breezeway
or similar structure to the principal building shall be considered a part of
the said principal building and must meet space requirements thereof. Accessory
buildings shall not occupy more than 30 percent of the rear yard, shall not be
more than 1,000 square feet in area, and shall not exceed 15 feet in height in
any "R" district. This regulation shall not be interpreted to prohibit the
construction of a 550 square foot garage on a minimum yard. No accessory
building shall be constructed upon a lot until the construction of the
principal building has been actually commenced, and no accessory building shall
be used unless the principal building on the lot is also being used, provided
that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as prohibiting a permitted
accessory use on a lot contiguous to and in the same ownership as a lot on
which a permitted principal use is located.
(Ord. 353 - Nov. 18 Supp.)
      A.   Accessory Building Exemption: Nonconforming preexisting structures
that lie within the five (5) feet setback of an alley line may be rebuilt or
replaced. The rebuilt or replaced structure must in no way further encroach on
the five (5) feet setback of an alley line more than the preexisting
nonconforming structure and shall comply with all other rules and regulations
set forth by the City of Prairie City.
(Ord. 354 - Nov. 18 Supp.)
   7.   Building Lines on Approved Plats. Whenever the plat of a land
subdivision approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and on record in the
Office of the County Recorder shows a building line along any frontage for the
purpose of creating a front yard or side street yard line, the building line
thus shown shall apply along such frontage in place of any yard line required
in this chapter unless specific yard requirements in this chapter require a
greater setback.
   8.   Corner Lots. For corner lots, platted or of record after the effective
date of this Zoning Ordinance, the front yard regulation shall apply to each
street side of the corner lot.
   9.   Front Yard. In all residential districts there shall be a minimum front
yard required as stated in the yard requirements for that particular district;
provided, however, where lots comprising 30 percent or more of the frontage
within 200 feet of either side lot line are developed with buildings at a
greater or lesser setback, the front yard requirement shall be the average of
these building setbacks and the minimum front yard required for the undeveloped
lots. In computing the average setback, buildings located on reverse corner
lots or entirely on the rear half of lots shall not be counted. The required
front yard as computed herein need not exceed 50 feet in any case.
   10.   Building Permits Previously Issued. Nothing herein contained shall
require any change in the overall layout, plans, construction, size, or
designated use of any building, or part thereof, for which approvals and
required building permits have been granted before the enactment of this Zoning
Ordinance, the construction of which in conformance with such plans shall have
been started prior to the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance and
completion thereof carried on in a normal manner and not discontinued for
reasons other than those beyond the builder’s control.
   11.   Zoning Districts Dividing Property. Where one parcel of property is
divided into two or more portions by reason of different zoning district
classifications, each of these portions shall be used independently of the
others in its respective zoning classification, and for the purpose of applying
the regulations of this chapter, each portion shall be considered as if in
separate and different ownership.

buildings, use of natural drainage ways and common open space, and such
management and ownership options as condominium, cooperative, and leasehold
agreements. Uses within a Planned Development may include both permitted and
conditional uses as provided for in this chapter.
   2.   Ownership Control. A planned development must be developed under single
ownership or control.
   3.   Authorization. Planned Developments shall be authorized by a permit

spaces, plantings, and all other structures.
      C.   Ownership and management plan (condominium, co-operative, leasehold,
subdivision) and supporting documents demonstrating how control of use and
maintenance will be accomplished.
   5.   Review Process. Upon receipt of an application for a planned
development permit, the Zoning Administrator shall, without delay, make copies
of said application available to all members of the Planning and Zoning
Commission and to the following City officials: City Engineer, Building
Official, Water Department Manager, Fire Chief, Police Chief, City Attorney,
and City Administrator/Clerk. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review
the proposal at the next regular meeting, provided there is a minimum of ten
(10) days between the date of application and the date of the meeting. Prior to
the time of such meeting said City officials shall review the development
proposal and prepare reports to be rendered to the Commission at said meeting,
either in writing or in person, as follows:
      A.   The City Attorney, City Engineer, Building Official, and City Clerk
shall report on apparent problems or efficiencies in the proposal within the
scope of their respective disciplines or areas of responsibility.

provide an evaluation of the effect that the proposed development might have on
the operation of their respective departments, particularly with respect to
capital or operating expenditures that may be required to provide customary and
necessary services to such development.
After receiving the reports of City officials, the Planning and Zoning
Commission may recommend, or the applicant offer, amendments to the plan. Any
amendments agreed to by both the applicant and the Commission shall be in
writing and attested to by the applicant. For the purpose of preparing such
documents, the meeting may be adjourned to a certain time. In the event the
applicant and the Zoning Commission fail to reach agreement, the applicant may
withdraw the application or make a written request that the application be
forwarded to the Council, along with the Zoning Commission recommended
amendments, for final determination by the Council. In the event amendments to
the plan are jointly recommended by the applicant and the Zoning Commission,
the Zoning Administrator shall also have the right to make a written request
that such recommended amendments be forwarded to the Council for public hearing
prior to approval or denial. In the absence of such a request by the Zoning
Administrator, such joint recommendations shall be deemed final.
   6.   Criteria For Planned Developments. No Planned Development shall be
approved by the Commission unless it shall substantially meet all of the
following criteria:
      A.   It shall be so designed, located, and proposed to be operated that
the public health, safety, and welfare will be protected.

open for future additions, the applicant may so indicate on the plan submitted,
showing the interim use to which the undeveloped portion will be put. However,
no additions, modification, or change of use not provided for in the original
development permit will be authorized until an amended or supplemental
application has been filed and approved in the same manner and subject to the
same criteria as the original plan.

same ownership or whose ownership had beneficial interest in said lot, unless
said lots are combined into one lot meeting the requirements of the Zoning
District which is applicable.

requirements and criteria in making its determination:
         (1)   A communication tower that does not comply with the height
limitations in the district bulk regulations shall be located on a lot of at

Commission for compatibility with the surrounding area.
         (9)   Any tower shall be of a monopole design without guy wires, or of
an ornamental design compatible with the surrounding area.

of the lease term or when the antenna thereon is no longer used, and that the
site will be sodded unless otherwise approved by the Planning and Zoning
Commission for compatibility with the surrounding area.
Before issuance of any special permit for any of the above buildings or uses,
the Board of Adjustment shall refer the application to the Planning and Zoning
Commission for study and report. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall,
within 45 days, review the conformity of the proposal with the standards of the
Comprehensive Plan, and with recognized principles of urban design, land use
planning architecture, and landscape architecture. The Commission may approve
or disapprove the special permit as submitted or, before approval, may require
that the applicant modify, alter, adjust, or amend the proposal as the
Commission deems necessary to the end that it preserve the intent and purpose
of this Zoning Ordinance to promote health, safety, morals, and the general
welfare; provided, however, if the Commission has not taken action on an
application within 45 days of its receipt, it shall be assumed that the
Commission has given its approval of said application. The request as approved
or disapproved by the Commission shall then be reported to the Board of
Adjustment, whereupon the Board of Adjustment may, after notice and public
hearing, approve or disapprove said special permit as reported or may require
such changes thereto as it deems necessary to effectuate the intent and purpose
of this Zoning Ordinance. Applications for a special permit under the terms of
this section shall be accompanied by evidence concerning the feasibility of the
proposed request and its effect on surrounding property and shall include a
site plan defining the areas to be developed for buildings, the areas to be
developed for parking, the locations of sidewalks and driveways, and the points
of ingress and egress, including access streets where required, the location
and heights of walls, the location and type of landscaping, and the location,
size, and number of signs, and other information as may be required by the
Planning and Zoning Commission or Board of Adjustment. In the event a special
permit is granted under the terms of this section, any change thereafter in the
approved use or site plan shall be resubmitted and considered in the same
manner as the original proposal.
165.26   BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
   1.   Board Created. A Board of Adjustment is hereby established which shall
consist of five (5) members appointed by the City Council. The terms of office
of the members of the Board of Adjustment and the manner of their appointment
shall be as provided by statute.
   2.   Meetings. The meetings of the Board shall be held at the call of the
Chairperson and at such other times as the Board may determine. Such
Chairperson or, in the absence of the Chairperson, the acting Chairperson may
administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the
Board shall be open to the public. The Board shall keep minutes of its
proceedings, showing the vote of each member on each question, or if absent or
failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its
examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately
filed in the office of the Board and shall be a public record. The presence of
three (3) members shall be necessary to constitute a quorum.
   3.   Appeals. Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person aggrieved or
by an officer, department board, or bureau of the City of Prairie City affected
by any decision of the Zoning Administrator. Such appeal shall be taken within
ten (10) days by filing with the Zoning Administrator, the City Council, and
the Board a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The Zoning
Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Board all papers constituting the
record upon which the action appealed from is taken. An appeal stays all
proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Zoning
Administrator certifies to the Board, after notice of appeal shall have been
filed with the Zoning Administrator, that by reason of the facts stated in the
certificate, a stay would, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator, cause
imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be
stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board
or by a court of record on application, on notice to the Zoning Administrator,
and on due cause shown. The Board shall fix within sixty (60) days a time for
the hearing on the appeal, give public notice thereof as well as due notice to
the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. At the
hearing any party may appear in person, by agent, or by attorney.
   4.   Powers and Duties. The Board shall have the following powers and
duties:
      A.   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in
any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the Zoning
Administrator in enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance.
      B.   To grant a variation from the terms of this chapter when a property
owner can show that his or her property was acquired in good faith and where by
reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a specific piece of
property, or where by reason of exceptional topographical conditions or other
extraordinary or exceptional situation, the strict application of the terms of
this chapter actually prohibits the use of this property in a manner reasonably
similar to that of other property in the same district, and where the Board is
satisfied under the evidence before it that:
         (1)   The land in question cannot yield a reasonable return if used
only for a purpose allowed in the district in which it is located;
         (2)   Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to
the land, structure, or building involved, and which are not applicable to
other lands, structures, or buildings, in the same district;
         (3)   The plight of the owner of the land in question is due to the
unique circumstances shown to the Board and is not of said owner’s own making;
         (4)   Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant
any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other land, structures,
or buildings in the same district;
         (5)   The use to be authorized by the variation will not alter the
essential character of the locality of the land in question. Provided, however,
that all variations granted under this clause shall be in harmony with the
intended spirit and purpose of this Ordinance and shall not be injurious to the
surrounding property or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
A variance shall not be granted by the Board unless and until a public hearing
is held. Notice of said public hearing shall be published, as provided by law,
in advance in a newspaper of general circulation in the City prior to such
hearing. Further provided, no variance shall be granted unless the Board shall
make findings that the requirements of this section have been met by the
applicant for the variance and that the reasons set forth in the application
justify the granting of the variance. In granting any variance, the Board may
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this
chapter. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the
terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this
chapter and punishable as provided in
Chapter 4 of this Code of Ordinances. Under no circumstances shall the Board
grant a variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this chapter
in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by
the terms of this chapter in said district.
      C.   To permit the following exceptions to the district regulations set
forth in this chapter, provided all exceptions shall be by their design,
construction, and operation adequately safeguard the health, safety, and
welfare of the occupants of adjoining and surrounding property, shall not
impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, shall not
increase congestion in the public streets, shall not increase public danger of
fire or flood, and shall not diminish or impair established property values in
surrounding areas:
         (1)   To permit erection and use of a building or the use of premises
or vary the height, yard, or area regulations in any location for a public
service corporation, for public utility purposes, or for purpose of public
communication, which the Board determines is reasonably necessary for the
public convenience or welfare.
         (2)   To permit the extension of a Zoning District where the boundary
line of a district divides a lot in single ownership as shown of record or by
existing contract or purchase at the time of the passage of this Zoning
Ordinance, but in no case shall such extension of the district boundary line
exceed 40 feet in any direction.
      D.   To hear and decide only such other special exceptions as the Board
is specifically authorized to pass on by the terms of this chapter; to decide
such questions as are involved in determining whether special exceptions should
be granted; and to grant special exceptions with such conditions and safeguards
as are appropriate under this chapter, or to deny special exceptions when not
in harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter. A special exception
shall not be granted by the Board unless and until:
         (1)   A written application for special exception is submitted
indicating the section of this chapter under which the special exception is
sought and stating the grounds on which it is requested.
         (2)   Notice of public hearing shall be published in advance of public
hearing by notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the City 15 days
prior to such hearing. The owner of the property for which special exception is
sought or said owner’s agent and owners of any other affected property within

affect the public interest. In granting any special exception, the Board may
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this
chapter. Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the
terms under which the special exception is granted, shall be deemed a violation
of this chapter. The Board may prescribe a time limit within which the action
for which the special exception is required shall be begun, completed, or both.
Failure to begin, complete, or both, such action within the time limit set,
shall void the special exception.
   5.   Decisions of the Board of Adjustment. In exercising the above mentioned
powers, the Board may, in conformity, with the provisions of law, reverse or
affirm, wholly or partly, or modify the order, requirement, decision, or
determinations appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision, or
determinations as it believes proper, and to that end shall have all the powers
of the Zoning Administrator. The concurring vote of three (3) of the members of
the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or
determination of the Zoning Administrator, or to decide in favor of the
applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this chapter;
provided, however, the action of the Board shall not become effective until

therewith. Any taxpayer, officer, department, board, or bureau of the City or
any person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of the
Board may present to a court of record a petition, duly verified, setting forth
that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of
the illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within 30 days
after the filing of the decision in the office of the Board. If any application
for a variance or exception shall have been denied by the Board, then no new
application for the same relief shall be considered by the Board unless the
Board shall find that conditions have changed.

165.29   SITE PLANS REQUIRED.
To assure that the design and location of multiple-family residential,
commercial and industrial developments will be in conformance with the zoning
standards of this Zoning Code and are properly related to and in harmony with
the existing and future development of the City, including generally accepted
principles of civic design, a detailed site plan shall be submitted for all
proposed development projects, with the exception of one- or two-family

Council for their approval. A site plan shall be submitted as outlined in this
chapter for all proposed improvement installations, including new building
construction, building addition construction, accessory building construction,
parking facilities construction, for proposed or existing structures in any of
the zoning districts, with the exception of one- or two-family dwellings.
   1.   Submittal Requirements For One- and Two-Family Dwellings. In the event
a zoning compliance permit is required for the construction of a one- or two-
family dwelling, an addition to a one- or two-family dwelling, an accessory use
building for a one- or two-family dwelling, or an addition or expansion of
parking or driveway facilities for each units, the applicant shall submit to

         (2)   Drainage arrows depicting direction of drainage.
   2.   Procedure. The following is an outline of the process by which a site
plan must be submitted, reviewed, and subsequently approved or denied.
      A.   A site plan review is required whenever a person or other group
wishes to develop any tract or parcel of land within all zoning districts,
except for any detached single-family residence and two-family residences
including any accessory structure thereto; agriculturally zoned property; new
construction of nonresidential accessory buildings less than 1,000 square feet
in gross floor area; and additions to existing non-residential buildings when
the addition is less than 10 percent of the existing building’s gross floor
area or the addition does not exceed 1,000 square feet, whichever is more
restrictive. Also, where no new curb cuts are required and where new
construction does not reduce existing parking or significantly modify existing
on-site circulation as determined by the City Engineer. A site plan shall be
prepared for every other type of development and 14 copies at a minimum scale
of 1" = 50' and one 11" x 17" copy shall be submitted to the City Clerk along
with the appropriate filing fee. The provisions of this section shall be
applicable to the redevelopment, enlargement, or extension of any applicable
uses and structures existing at the time of adoption of the Zoning Ordinance.
The site plan shall contain such information and data as outlined herein.
      B.   The Clerk shall refer a copy of the site plan to the City Engineer,
or such other persons (Building Official, Water Department Manager, Fire Chief,
Police Chief, City Attorney, and City Administrator) as shall be designated
from time to time by the Council, who shall review said site plan as to its
compliance with the Ordinances of the City, its effect upon public utilities
and the public street system, and submit findings as soon as possible to the
Planning and Zoning Commission.
      C.   The Clerk shall also forward a copy of the site plan to each member
of the Planning and Zoning Commission. The Commission shall, after receiving
the engineer’s report, review the site plan for conformity with the regulations
and design standards contained herein, and may confer with the developer on
changes deemed advisable in such site plan.
      D.   The Commission shall forward its recommendation of action to the
Clerk within 45 days of the date of submission of the site plan. If the
Commission does not act within 45 days, the site plan shall be deemed to be
approved by the Commission unless the developer agrees to an extension of time.
      E.   The Commission may, in its discretion, hold a public hearing on the
site plan of the proposed development and prescribe the notice thereof and to
whom such notice shall be given.
      F.   The Council shall, upon receipt of the recommendation of the
Commission, either approve or disapprove the site plan of the proposed
development.
      G.   No building permit or certificate of occupancy for any structure
within any distance within which a site plan is required shall be issued until
the site plan has been approved as provided herein.
      H.   Upon final action by the Commission on any site plan, a copy of said
site plan with the action of the Commission noted thereon and signed by the
Chair of the Commission shall be filed with the Clerk.
      I.   If the administrative official finds that any construction or
proposed construction or occupancy of a development on a tract of land for
which a site plan has been approved will not substantially comply with the site
plan as approved, or if the administrative official finds that the construction
and development of the tract is not being carried out in accordance with the
development schedule filed with the site plan, the administrative official
shall suspend all building permits for the development and order all
construction stopped until such time as the owner of the project or any
successors in interest shall have provided the administrative official with
proof satisfactory to said administrative official that the site plan will be
complied with. The administrative official shall not issue a certificate of
occupancy for any structure within the development while the building permit
for the development has been suspended pursuant to this paragraph. Any person
aggrieved by any decision or action of the administrative official under this
paragraph may appeal such action or decision to the Board of Adjustment.
      J.   If the owner or developer of a tract of land for which a site plan
has been approved determines that an extension of time is necessary or that a
modification of the site plan would provide for a more appropriate or more
practicable development of the site, the owner or developer may apply for an
amendment of the site plan. The Commission may grant an extension of time or a
modification of a previously approved site plan if it determines that such
modification of the site plan would provide for a more appropriate development
of the site.
      K.   Pre-Application Conference. Whenever any person, partnership,
corporation or any other group, public or private, propose to develop any tract
or parcel of land or modify any existing development which requires a site plan
submittal, a request may be made to the Zoning Administrator for a pre-
application conference. The conference shall include the applicant or
representative, the Zoning Administrator, the City Engineer and the City
Building Inspector. The purpose of the conference shall be to acquaint the City
Staff with proposed development and to acquaint the applicant or representative
with the procedures and with any special problems that might relate to the
development. The applicant shall furnish a legal description of the property to
be developed at the time of requesting the pre-application conference, and the
conference shall be held within 15 days of such request.
   3.   Appeals. If the site plan is disapproved, the applicant may, upon
written application to the Planning and Zoning Commission, appeal in whole or
in part any condition or requirement the Commission would require for its
approval. The application for appeal and the site plan as submitted shall be
presented to the City Council at its next regular meeting for their action. The
application for appeal must include specific reasons and conditions that exist
for variance from the applicable codes or ordinances and variations from the
Planning and Zoning Commission recommendations.
   4.   City Council Action. Upon submittal to the Planning and Zoning
Commission, the City Council in its regular meeting shall review the
Commission’s recommendations for disapproval, accompanied with the applicant’s
appeal request. The City Council shall also review the Building Department and
City Engineer’s review, comments, and recommendations. The City Council shall
thereupon take action either approving or disapproving the site plan. Upon
approval, the City Council shall direct the Building Department to issue the
proper building permits. The applicant shall submit a copy of the approved site
plan on a reproducible medium to the City Engineer. A site plan that has been
denied by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council may be
resubmitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission by the applicant with respect
to the terms of this chapter and upon payment of the appropriate fees.

affect on such adjoining properties from automobile headlights, illumination of
required peripheral yards, refuge containers, and imperilment of light and air.
For purposes of this section, the term “use and enjoyment” means the use and
enjoyment presently being made of such adjoining property, unless such property
is vacant. If vacant, the term “use and enjoyment of adjoining property” means
those uses permitted under the zoning district in which adjoining property is
located.
      C.   The architectural theme of any proposed development requiring
submittal of a site plan shall be dominated with permanency and strength of
materials in proportion to the aesthetic characteristics of the architectural
bulk, shape, and materials. To provide sufficient permanency and strength of
materials, only the following materials shall be approved:

doorways, and similar architectural features.
         (10)   Flat roof systems, when in character with the proposed
architectural characteristics of the proposed structure.
      D.   The following shall not be deemed sufficient to provide permanency
and strength of materials in proportion to the aesthetic characteristics of the
architectural bulk, shape, and materials when not used in conjunction with the
previous list or when not specifically a part of an architectural character or
theme:
         (1)   Plywood and similar sheet, untextured wood coverings.
         (2)   Particle board, pressed board, and similar composite siding
materials including lap siding.

flagpoles or the building itself. The flood light fixture must be screened from
view with landscape materials. Lighting billiards with diffusers are allowed.
   9.   Lighting Standards Generally Applicable. The lighting design standards
set forth in subsection 8 shall be applicable to any proposed modification,
change, erection, or construction of lighting on any property within the City
after the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance whether or not such change,
modification, erection, or construction is made or proposed in connection with
a development of property for which the submission of a site plan is required.
It is the intent and purpose of this provision that all lighting in the City
conforms with the provisions of this chapter.
   10.   Screening. The intent of screening regulations is to lessen the
transmission from one lot to another of noise, dust, and glare; to lessen
visual pollution by providing an impression of separation of spaces or entirely
shielding one land use from another; and/or establishing a sense of privacy
from visual or physical intrusion. The provisions of this chapter are necessary
to safeguard the public health, safety, and welfare.
      A.   General Screening. Every development shall provide sufficient
screening so that neighboring properties are shielded from any adverse external
effects of that development; and the development is shielded from the negative
impacts of adjacent uses including streets and railroads.
      B.   Compliance. The following table illustrates the type of screen
required between zoning classifications. Where such screening is required the
applicant or burdened use is responsible for installation prior to receiving an
occupancy permit for the use in questions. A description of the screen types
(A, B, and C) are described in the following subsection. Where screening is to
be approved at site plan review (*), the screening objectives described are to
be adhered. The City Council may require additional screening where deemed
appropriate.

      C.   Descriptions of Screens. The following three basic types of screens
are established and are used as the basis for the table of screening
requirements.
         (1)   Broken Screen, Type A.
            A screen composed of intermittent visual obstructions from the
ground to a height of not less than 20 feet. The broken screen is intended to
create the impression of a separation of spaces without necessarily eliminating
visual contact between the spaces. It may be composed of a wall, fence,
landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance
of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetations will be judged on the
basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject
species, or field observation of existing vegetation. The screen may contain
deciduous plants.
         (2)   Semi-Opaque Screen, Type B.
            A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of not less
than three feet, with intermittent visual obstruction from above the opaque
portion to a height of at least 20 feet. The semi-opaque screen is intended to
partially block visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression
of the separation of spaces. The semi-opaque screen may be composed of a wall,
fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation.
Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged
on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject
species, or field observation of existing vegetation. At maturity, the portion
of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely
unobstructed openings more than ten feet wide. The zone of intermittent visual
obstruction may contain deciduous plants.
         (3)   Opaque Screen, Type C.
            A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of not less
than six feet, with intermittent visual obstructions from the opaque portion to
a height of at least 20 feet. An opaque screen is intended to exclude all
visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of spatial
separation. The opaque screen may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped
earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance of planted
vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the
average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field
observation of existing vegetation. The opaque portion of the screen must be
opaque in all seasons of the year. At maturity, the portion of intermittent
visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings
more than ten feet wide. The portion of intermittent visual obstructions may
contain deciduous plants.
      D.   Storage Areas. The outdoor storage of materials, equipment, or
supplies, when permitted in any commercial or industrial district, shall be so
located or screened, fenced, or landscaped so as to effectively prevent
visibility of such storage from all abutting Residential Zoning Districts or
abutting existing residential uses. Such screening shall be sufficient if it
prevents visibility of such storage area by persons traveling on public right-
of-ways or standing at grade level on the side or rear lot lines of such
property. Such screening shall comply with the standard for an opaque screen
Type C as described in this section.
      E.   Mechanical Units. The following standards apply to the location and
screening of mechanical equipment.
         (1)   Screening of Ground-Mounted Mechanical Units. For all uses
requiring the submittal of a site plan, all ground-mounted mechanical units,
including (but not limited to) air-conditioning condensers, heat pumps,
ventilation units, computer cooling equipment, etc., and any related utility
structures and equipment, which are visible from any adjacent public
thoroughfare shall be visibly screened from public view by the use of a
screening wall built out of materials compatible and consistent with the
architecture and materials of the principal building, landscape plantings of
predominantly evergreen materials to provide year-round screening, or a
combination of the above. The type of screening shall be identified as part of
the site plan.
         (2)   Screening of Roof-Mounted Mechanical Units. All roof-mounted
mechanical units shall be screened from adjacent public thoroughfares by the
use of an opaque screening material compatible with the architecture of the
building or architecturally designed screening, such as a parapet wall. The
screening of the roof-mounted units shall be designed to blend with the
building and roof materials. Additional screening may be required due to
topographic differences in adjoining properties.
         (3)   Screening of Trash Receptacles. For any development of
properties where three or more residential dwelling units are using a common
trash receptacle, and for all nonresidential uses, trash receptacles and
dumpsters shall be screened on all sides by the use of a permanent enclosure,
with gates for disposal truck access.
            (a)   The enclosure shall be constructed to visibly screen the
receptacle from public view and views from the adjoining properties.
            (b)   The screening wall shall be constructed of permanent
materials, such as block or brick (wood is not permitted), compatible and
consistent with the architecture and materials of the principal building.
            (c)   The enclosure shall be landscaped to minimize the visual
impact of the enclosure on surrounding properties and public thoroughfares.
            (d)   A gate is required for all enclosures. The gate must be
constructed with a metal frame (wood is not permitted). The gate must be
covered with an opaque material, such as wood, to screen the contents of the
enclosure.
            (e)   Concrete-filled steel pipe bollards must be used to protect
the enclosure.
   11.   Signage. A sign is defined as any structure, device, or contrivance,
electric or non-electric, and all parts thereof, which is erected or used for
advertising or identification or on which any poster, bill, bulletin, printing,
lettering, painting, device, or other advertising of any kind whatsoever is
used, placed, projected, posted, tacked, nailed, pasted, or otherwise fastened
or affixed. No sign shall be erected or maintained on any site requiring the
submittal of a site plan except in conformity with the following:
      A.   Freestanding signs shall conform to the building setback
requirements of the Zoning District in which they are located. Where a sign is
adjacent to Highway 163, Highway 117, or otherwise required, a DOT sign permit
shall be obtained. The freestanding sign shall conform to the greater of the
setback requirements.
      B.   Signs visible from the exterior of any building may be lighted, but
no signs or other contrivance may be devised or constructed so as to rotate,
gyrate, blink, flash, or move in any animated fashion.
      C.   Signs shall be restricted to advertising only the firm, person,
company, corporation, or other entity using the lot.
      D.   Signs with reader boards, changeable copy (either manual or
electronic), or running lighted messages are not allowed except as follows:
         (1)   Gasoline pricing information signs at gas stations and
convenience stores when approved on the site plan.
         (2)   Churches, schools, or public buildings or use signs located in
residential districts.
      E.   No signs painted directly on any building shall be permitted. All
signs shall be professionally constructed and made of weatherproof materials.
Each sign shall be either:
         (1)   Building mounted;
         (2)   A ground sign; or
         (3)   A pole sign.
      F.   A building mounted sign shall:
         (1)   Be a fixture sign attached to a vertical surface of a building,
which shall not extend above the roof line of such building and which shall be
mounted flush with the surface of the building; or
         (2)   Individual letters applied directly to a vertical surface of a
building, which shall not extend above the roofline of the building and which
shall be mounted flush with the surface of the building. The size of a sign
comprised of such individual letters shall be deemed to be the area within the
smallest rectangle that could be drawn outside the letters of symbols of such a
sign.
      G.   A ground sign shall be affixed to the ground on a concrete or stone
foundation. No ground sign shall exceed five feet above grade in vertical
height.
      H.   A pole sign shall be a fixture sign affixed to a vertical metal
pole. A pole sign shall not exceed 25 feet in vertical height.
      I.   Only one ground or pole sign (single or double faced) and one
building mounted sign shall be permitted per lot, except special purpose signs,
described in paragraph K below.
      J.   No sign face shall exceed one square foot in area for each 600
square feet of area of the lot on which the sign is located. In no case shall
any sign face exceed 400 square feet. Provided however, an additional sign
(single or double faced) of up to 50 square feet (per face) shall be allowed
for each additional business (in excess of one) conducted on each lot.
      K.   The following special purpose signs shall be permitted as specified:
         (1)   The owner of each lot, at such time as the lot is improved with
a building, shall display the street address of such building, in a manner
legible from the nearest street.
         (2)   Any number of traffic, directional and instructional signs
indicating loading or delivery areas, various building entries, parking lots,
and the like, shall be permitted, but no such sign shall exceed 12 square feet
or employ lettering larger than 8 inches in height.
         (3)   The following special purpose signs shall be permitted on a
temporary basis:
            (a)   Signs advertising the sale or lease of a lot, the building
thereon, or the business conducted therein.
            (b)   Signs identifying or describing the construction of
improvements to a lot.
            (c)   Signs identifying or describing the future owner, lessee, or
other occupant of a particular lot or building.
            (d)   Signs identifying a business park or industrial park,
directional signs, traffic signs and other special purpose signs in common
areas.
   12.   Site Grading and Drainage. Each lot shall be graded such that there is
no material storm water runoff onto another lot. Storm water shall be directed
into the public storm water system or to a location approved by the City
Engineer. The developer must submit sufficient information on the site plan for
a determination regarding the direction of storm water flows and compatibility
with existing infrastructure. Information regarding measures to control soil
erosion must also be provided on the site plan.
   13.   Approval and Penalties. No building permits shall be issued for any
building or development construction that is subject to this chapter within any
Zoning District, until a site plan has been submitted and approved for each
development in accordance with this chapter. No certification of occupancy
shall be issued for such construction or development until all terms and
conditions of the approved site plan have been satisfactorily completed or
provided for with the approval of the City. Construction, grading, or other
development activities for those uses listed above shall hereafter be carried
out only in substantial compliance with the approved site plan and any
conditions or restrictions attached thereto. A site plan shall become effective
upon approval by the City Council, pursuant to this chapter. The approval of
any site plan required by this section shall remain valid for one year after
the date of approval, after which time the site plan shall be deemed null and
void if the development has not been established or actual construction
commenced. For the purpose of this section, “actual construction” means that
the permanent placement of construction materials has started and is proceeding
without undue delay. Preparation of plans, securing financial arrangements,
issuance of additional building permits, letting of contracts, grading of the
property, or stockpiling of materials on the site shall not constitute actual
construction. Appropriate actions and proceeding may be taken by law or in
equity to prevent any violations of these regulations, to prevent unlawful
construction, to recover damages, to restrain, to correct, or abate a
violation, to prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure, or premises.
   14.   Violations and Penalties. It is unlawful to locate, erect, construct,
reconstruct, enlarge, change, maintain, or use any building or land in
violation of any regulation in or any provisions of this chapter, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, shall constitute a municipal infraction and
shall be punishable as provided in
Chapter 4 of this Code of Ordinances.
165.30   SCHEDULE OF FEES.
All fees for permits, plan review, and any other fee consistent with this Code,
as well as fee refunds, shall be set by resolution of the Council.
165.31   COMPLAINTS REGARDING VIOLATIONS.
Whenever a violation of this chapter occurs, or is alleged to have occurred,
any person or persons may file a written complaint, stating fully the causes
and basis thereof with the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall
record such complaints and immediately investigate and take action thereon as
provided by this chapter.
165.32   ZONING ADMINISTRATOR.
   1.   Position Created; Duties and Powers. There is hereby created the

(1) with the County Auditor, and one (1) print and one (1) electronic version,
for GIS updates, with the County Zoning Office.
   4.   Approval of the final plat shall become null and void ninety (90) days
from the date of City Council approval, if the developer does not file the
final plat with the County Recorder as provided above. It shall be the
responsibility of the developer to furnish the City Administrator documentation
of compliance within the ninety (90) day period. One extension may be granted
for a thirty (30) day period, by the City Council upon written request of the
developer and submittal of the required fee to the City Administrator.
170.19   MINOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   1.   Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this section is to simplify the
approval procedures in those subdivisions for which all required public
improvements are in place. The purpose of the minor subdivision is to waive the
preliminary plat procedure when the conditions in subsection 2 below have been
met.
   2.   Minor Subdivisions Defined. For purposes of this chapter, the developer
may be eligible to seek subdivision approval as a minor subdivision if all of
the following conditions are met:
      A.   All of the lots of the subdivision abut an existing dedicated public
road, highway, or street.
      B.   No new street, public or private, within the subdivision is
proposed, nor is any new street, public or private, required by the City in
order to assure adequate access to an existing public road, highway, or street
from any of the lots of the subdivision.
      C.   All City service systems and public improvements are already
extended so that each system is readily accessible for direct and individual
service connection thereto from each lot in the subdivision.
   3.   Minor Subdivision Procedures. Upon the determination of the City's
Planning and Zoning Commission that the proposed subdivision meets the
conditions as specified subsection 2 above, a developer may be permitted to
proceed with a minor subdivision.
   4.   Minor Subdivision Application. An application for minor subdivision
shall be submitted to the City Clerk at least three (3) weeks prior to the
Planning and Zoning Commission's meeting at which the plat is to be heard. The
following shall be submitted with the application:
      A   Application Fee.

all properties within two hundred (200) feet of the exterior boundaries of the
plat, obtained from an appropriate County office.
      G.   Any other supplemental material as specified in this chapter.
   5.   Application Acceptance or Refusal. Upon submittal of the application
for minor subdivision plat, the Clerk shall immediately transmit two (2) prints
and one (1) electronic version of the plat to the Planning and Zoning
Commission which shall review the application to ensure all data required has
been provided. Specifically, the Planning and Zoning Commission may refuse to
process a minor subdivision plat if one or more of the following conditions are
present:
      A.   The proposed lots violate the City Zoning or Subdivision Ordinance.
      B.   The plat would require the dedication or vacation of any public
right-of-way.
      C.   The plat would require the vacation of any necessary easements.
      D.   In the opinion of the Planning and Zoning Commission, additional
public right-of-way should be dedicated.
      E.   In the opinion of the Planning and Zoning Commission, the plat does
not conform to the Comprehensive Plan or other plans for the area.
      F.   If any of the above conditions are found and the developer wishes to
proceed to subdivide, the plat shall follow the full platting procedure
requirements of this chapter.
   6.   Planning Review. Upon acceptance of the application by the Planning and
Zoning Commission, the Clerk shall immediately transmit one (1) electronic copy
of the plat to the following City departments and agencies for review, with a
request for written comments in seven (7) days:

plat for accuracy and compliance with the regulations and conditions herein and
other regulations that may apply, and submit, in writing, any comments to the
Planning and Zoning Commission.
   8.   Planning and Zoning Commission Review. The minor subdivision plat and
agency comments shall be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission in
accordance with the Planning and Zoning Commission's review of a final plat in
charge of this chapter.
   9.   Planning and Zoning Commission Action. The Planning and Zoning
Commission shall act on the minor subdivision plat in accordance with the
Planning and Zoning Commission's action of a final plat in charge of this
chapter.
   10   City Council Action. The minor subdivision plat presented to the City
Council shall be identical to the plat acted upon by the Planning and Zoning
Commission. It shall be the developer's responsibility to submit to the City
Clerk's department, ten (10) 11" x 17" copies and one (1) electronic version of
said plat at least ten (10) days prior to the City Council hearing of the minor
subdivision plat. Upon approval of the minor subdivision plat by the City
Council, a certificate of recommended approval by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and approval by the Mayor and City Council, shall be signed by the
Chairperson and Secretary of the Planning and Zoning Commission, Mayor, and
City Clerk.
   11.   Approved Minor Subdivision Plat Recording. The minor subdivision plat
shall be recorded in accordance with this chapter.
   12.   Minor Subdivision Plat Time Limit. Minor subdivision plats shall
become null and void in accordance with this chapter, unless an extension is
granted as per said section.
   13.   Minor Subdivision Plat Information. The minor subdivision plat shall
be prepared in accordance with this chapter.
170.20   VACATION OF PLATS.
The proprietors of lots within an official plat who wish to vacate any portion
of the official plat shall file a petition for vacation with the City Clerk.
After the petition has been filed, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall fix
the time and place for public hearing on the petition. Upon approval by the
Planning and Zoning Commission, the City Council shall fix the time and place
of public hearing on the petition. Written notice of the proposed vacation
shall be served in the manner of original notices as provided in Iowa Rules of
Civil Procedure and be served upon proprietors and mortgagees within the
official plat that are within three hundred (300) feet of the area to be
vacated. If a portion of the official plat adjoins a river or State-owned lake,
the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be served written notice of the
proposed vacation. Notice of the proposed vacation shall be published twice,
with fourteen (14) days between publications, stating the date, time, and place
of hearing.
   1.   Required Documents. The official plat or portion of the official plat
can be vacated upon recording of all of the following documents:
      A.   An instrument signed, executed, and acknowledged by all the
proprietors and mortgagees within the area of the official plat to be vacated,
declaring the plat to be vacated. The instrument shall state the existing lot
description for each proprietor along with an accurate description to be used
to describe the land after the lots are vacated.
      B.   A resolution by the City Council, after appraisal by the Planning
and Zoning Commission, approving the vacation and providing for the conveyance
of those areas included in the vacation that were previously set aside or
dedicated for public use.
      C.   A certificate of the Auditor that the vacated part of the plat can
be adequately described for assessment and taxation purposes without reference
to the vacated lots.
   2.   Public Highways. No part of this section authorizes the closing or
obstructing of public highways.
   3.   Vacation of Streets or Other Public Lands.
      A.   The City may vacate part of an official plat that had been conveyed
to the City that is deemed by the governing body to be of no benefit to the
public.
      B.   The City shall vacate by resolution following a public hearing or by
ordinance and the vacating instrument shall be recorded. The City may convey
the vacated property by deed or may convey the property to adjoining
proprietors through the vacation instrument. If the vacating instrument is used
to convey property then the instrument shall include a list of adjoining
proprietors to whom the vacated property is being conveyed along with the
corresponding description of each parcel being conveyed. A recorded vacation
instrument that conforms to this Section is equivalent to a deed of conveyance,
and the instrument shall be filed and indexed as a conveyance by the Recorder
and Auditor.
      C.   A vacation instrument recorded pursuant to this section shall not
operate to annul any part of an official plat except as provided for in this
subsection.
170.21   BUILDING PERMIT ISSUANCE AND CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
   1.   Building permits will not be issued to allow construction on lots
fronting platted streets until all adjacent dedicated public improvements are
in place and ready for connection thereto, and the final plat has been recorded
in conformance with this article.
   2.   The following is at the discretion of City Council and only if the
extent of street improvements is adequate for vehicular access by the
prospective occupant, by police, and fire equipment. Building permits may be
issued prior to all public improvements being completed as required by the City
Council; however, no building permit shall be issued for the final ten (10)
percent of lots in a subdivision or for the final five (5) lots of a
subdivision, whichever is greater, until all public improvements required by
the City Council for the plat have been fully completed and dedicated to the
City of Prairie City. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until all
public improvements required by the City Council for the plat have been fully
completed and dedicated to the City of Prairie City.
170.22   PERFORMANCE BOND.
   1.   The City Council at its discretion may waive the requirement that the
applicant complete and dedicate all public improvements prior to the signing of
the final subdivision plat, and that, as an alternative, the applicant post a
bond at the time of application for final subdivision plat approval in an
amount estimated by the City Council as sufficient to secure to the City the
satisfactory construction, installation, and dedication of the incomplete
portion of required improvements. The performance bond shall also secure all
lot improvements on individual lots of the subdivision as required in these
regulations.
   2.   The performance bond shall name the City as obligee and shall be
written upon an approved bonding company by an authorized representative of the
bonding company. Such performance bond shall comply with all statutory
requirements and shall be satisfactory to the City Attorney as to form,
sufficiency, and manner of execution as set forth in these regulations. The
period within which required improvements must be completed shall be specified
by the City Council in the resolution approving the final subdivision plat and
shall be incorporated in the bond and shall not in any event exceed two (2)
years from date of approval of the final plat. The City Council, may, upon
proof of difficulty, extend the completion date set forth in such bond for a
maximum period of one (1) additional year. The Council may at any time during
the period of such bond accept a substitution of principal or sureties on the
bond upon recommendation of the Commission. In the event the improvements are
not completed within the periods specified above, the City of Prairie City may
pursue any and all remedies available by law including but not limited to
collection on the bond.
   3.   The performance bond shall include an amount to guarantee completion of
all required lot improvements, including but not limited to, soil preservation,
final grading, lot drainage, lawn grass seeding or sodding, shade tree
planting, removal of debris and waste, fencing and any other lot improvements
required by the City Council.
170.23   REDUCTION OR RELEASE OF PERFORMANCE BOND.
Return of the performance bond to the subdivider by the City Council shall be
subject to the conditions set forth below.
   1.   Reduction of Performance Bond.
      A.   Reduction of Performance Bond. A performance bond shall be reduced
upon actual dedication of public improvements and then only to the ratio that
the public improvement dedicated bears to the total public improvement for the
plat. In no event shall a performance bond be reduced below twenty-five (25)
percent of the principal amount.
   2.   Release of Performance Bond.
      A.   Prior to the release of the performance guarantee, the subdivider
shall file with the City a maintenance bond, to be approved by the City Council
on an approved bonding company in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney
naming the City of Prairie City as obligee, conditioned that the subdivider
shall maintain such improvements in good repair for the periods specified by
this chapter.
170.24   GOVERNMENTAL UNITS.
Governmental units to which these bonds and contract provisions apply may file
in lieu of said contract of bond a certified resolution or ordinance from
officers or agencies authorized to act on their behalf, agreeing to comply with
the provisions of this chapter.
170.25   ACCEPTANCE OF DEDICATION OFFERS.
Acceptance of formal offers of dedication of streets, public areas, easements,
and parks shall be by resolution of the City Council. The approval by the City
Council of a subdivision plat shall not be deemed to constitute or imply the
acceptance by the City of Prairie City of any street, easement, or park shown
on said plat. The City Council may require said plat to be endorsed with
appropriate notes to this effect.
170.26   ESCROW DEPOSITS FOR LOT IMPROVEMENTS.
   1.   Acceptance of Escrow Funds. Whenever, by reason of the season of the
year, any lot improvements required by the subdivision regulations cannot be
performed, the Administrator may, nevertheless, issue a certificate of
occupancy, provided there is no danger to health, safety, or general welfare
upon accepting a cash escrow deposit in an amount to be determined by the City
Engineer for the cost of said improvements. The performance bond covering such
lot improvements shall remain in full force and effect.
   2.   Procedures on Escrow Fund. All required improvements, for which escrow
monies have been accepted by the Administrator at the time of issuance of a
certificate of occupancy, shall be installed by the developer within a period
of time of nine (9) months from the date of deposit and issuance of the
certificate of occupancy. In the event that the improvements have not been
properly installed at the end of the time period, the Administrator shall give
two (2) weeks' written notice to the developer requiring the developer to
install same in the event that same are not installed properly in the
discretion of the Administrator. The Administrator may request the City Council
to authorize to contract out the work for the installation of the necessary
improvements in a sum not to exceed the amount of the escrow deposit. At the
time of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy for which escrow monies
are being deposited with the Administrator, the applicant shall obtain and file
with the Administrator prior to obtaining the certificate of occupancy a
notarized statement from the purchaser or purchasers of the premises
authorizing the City of Prairie City to install the improvements at the end of
the nine (9) month period in the event that the same have not been duly
installed by the developer.
170.27   MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   1.   The applicant shall be required to maintain all improvements on the
individual subdivided lots and provide for snow removal on streets and
sidewalks, if required, until acceptance of said improvements by the City of
Prairie City. If there are any occupant permits on a street not dedicated to
the City, the City may on twelve (12) hours' notice plow the street or effect
emergency repairs and charge same to applicant.
   2.   The applicant shall be required to file a maintenance bond with the
City Council, prior to dedication in an amount considered adequate by the City
Engineer and in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney, in order to assure
the satisfactory condition of the required improvements for a period of time in
accordance with the schedule below. Said time shall run from the date of their
acceptance by the City Council and dedication of same to the City.
   3.   The Maintenance Bond shall name the City as obligee, shall be written
upon an approved bonding company by an authorized representative of the bonding
company.
      Pavements - 4 years
      Storm sewer/secondary storm sewer - 4 years
      Sidewalks - 4 years
      Water mains and apparatus - 2 years
      Sanitary sewer and apparatus - 2 years
   4.   The Council may require that shade trees be maintained through one
growing season prior to their acceptance.
170.28   DEFERRAL OR WAIVER OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
   1.   The City Council may defer or waive at the time of final approval,
subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any or all such
improvements as, in its judgment are not requisite in the interest of the
public health, safety, and general welfare, or which are inappropriate because
of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities.
   2.   Whenever it is deemed necessary by the City Council to defer the
construction of any improvement required herein because of incompatible grades,
future planning, inadequate or lack of connecting facilities, or for other
reasons, the applicant shall pay their share of the costs of the future
improvements to the City prior to signing of the final subdivision plat, or the
applicant may post a bond insuring completion of said improvements upon demand
of the City. Said bond must meet the requirements for a maintenance bond shown
in Section 170.27 above.
170.29   FAILURE TO COMPLETE IMPROVEMENT.
For subdivisions for which no performance bond has been posted, or where, for
whatever reason, the bonding company refuses to pay a claim on said bond, if
the improvements are not completed within the period specified by the City
Council in the resolution approving the plat, the approval shall be deemed to
have expired. In those cases where a performance bond has been posted and
required improvements have not been installed within the terms of such
performance bond, the City of Prairie City shall be entitled to any and all
remedies provided by contract and by law including but not limited to:
requiring that all improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the
building development at the time the bond is declared to be in default,
vacation of the plat or any portion hereof, and suit against developer for
money judgments.
170.30   INTERPRETATION OF STANDARDS.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall
be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health,
safety, and general welfare. These regulations are not intended to interfere
with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, regulation, statute, or other
provision of law. Where any provision of these regulations imposes restrictions
different from those imposed by any other provision of these regulations or any
other ordinance, rule, or regulation, or other provision of law, whichever
provisions are more restrictive shall control.
170.31   REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPROVEMENTS.
In addition to the standards set forth in this chapter, all improvements shall
be designed and constructed to at least meet the Development Standards as
defined in this chapter and as amended and adopted by the City of Prairie City,
hereby incorporated by reference and made part of this chapter and shall be
completed by the subdivider prior to final plat approval, or completed under
performance bond.
170.32   COSTS OF IMPROVEMENTS.
All required improvements shall be made by the applicant, at their expense,
without reimbursement by the City of Prairie City, except as provided in the
Prairie City Urban Renewal Area Ordinance, pursuant to Section 403.19 of the
Code of Iowa.
170.33   TEMPORARY IMPROVEMENT.
The applicant shall build and pay for all costs of temporary improvement
required by the Commission and/or City Council and shall maintain same for the
period specified by the Commission and Council. Prior to construction of any
temporary facility or improvement, the developer shall file with the City of
Prairie City a separate suitable bond for temporary facilities, which bond
shall insure that the temporary facilities will be properly constructed,
maintained, and removed.
170.34   MONUMENTS.
The subdivider shall place permanent reference monuments in the subdivision as
required herein and as approved by a Registered Land Surveyor.
   1.   Monuments shall be located on street right-of-way lines, at street
intersections, angle points of curve, and block corners. They shall be spaced
so as to be within sight of each other, the sight lines generally being
contained wholly within the street limits.
   2.   The external boundaries of a subdivision shall be monumented in the
field by monuments of stone or concrete, not less than thirty (30) inches in
length, not less than four (4) inches square or five (5) inches in diameter,
and marked on top with a cross, brass plug, iron rod, and other durable,
metallic, material securely embedded; or by iron rods or pipes at least thirty
(30) inches long and two (2) inches in diameter. All monuments shall provide
magnetic attraction for location by a metal detector. These monuments shall be
placed not more than one-thousand four hundred (1,400) feet apart in any
straight line and at all corners, at each end of all curves, at the point where
a curve changes its radius, at all angle points in any line, and at all angle
points along the meander line, said points to be not less than twenty (20) feet
back from the bank of any river or stream, except that when such corners or
points fall within a street, or proposed future street, the monuments shall be
placed in the side line of the street.
   3.   All internal boundaries and those corners and points not referred to in
the preceding paragraph, shall be monumented in a field by like monuments as
described above. These monuments shall be placed at all block corners, at each
end of all curves, and at all angle points in any line.
   4.   The lines of lots that extend to streams shall be monumented in the
field by iron pipes at least thirty (30) inches long and seven-eighths (7/8)
inch in diameter or by round or square iron bars at least thirty (30) inches
long. These monuments shall be placed at the point of intersection of the
stream lot line with a meander line established not less than twenty (20) feet
back from the bank of the stream.
   5.   All such monuments shall be set flush with the ground and planted in
such a manner that they will not be removed by frost.
   6.   All monuments shall be properly set in the ground and approved by a
Registered Land Surveyor prior to approval of the final plat.
170.35   BLOCKS.
   1.   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two (2) tiers of lots
of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be
permitted in blocks adjacent to major streets, railroads, or waterways.
   2.   The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be such as are
appropriate so as to serve cross traffic adequately and to meet existing
streets and customary subdivision practice in the immediate area, and the type
of development contemplated. Block lengths in residential areas shall not
exceed one thousand three hundred twenty (1,320) feet, or be less than three
hundred (300) feet in length. Block lengths longer than six hundred (600) feet
should be avoided in business districts. Blocks designed for industrial uses
shall be of such length and width as may be determined suitable by the
Commission for prospective use.
   3.   In long blocks the reservation of an easement through the block to
accommodate utilities, drainage facilities, or pedestrian traffic may be
required.
   4.   Pedestrian ways or crosswalks, not less than ten (10) feet wide, may be
required through the center of blocks more than eight hundred (800) feet long
where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to schools,
playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, or other community facilities.
170.36   LOT DESIGN.
   1.   Arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no
foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in
securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with the Zoning
Ordinance and Health Regulations and in providing driveway access to buildings
on such lots from an approved street.
   2.   Dimensions. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of
the Zoning Ordinance. Where lots are more than double the minimum required area
for the zoning district, the Commission may require that such lots be arranged
so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets where they
would be necessary to serve such potential lots, all in compliance with the
Zoning Ordinance and these regulations. In general, side lot lines shall be at
right angles to street lines (or radial to curving street lines) unless a
variation from this rule will give a better street or lot plan. Dimensions or
corner lots shall be large enough to allow for erection of buildings, observing
the minimum front yard setback from both streets. Depth and width of properties
reserved or laid out for business, commercial, or industrial purposes shall be
adequate to provide for the street parking and loading facilities required for
the type of use and development contemplated, as established in the Zoning
Ordinance.
   3.   Double Frontage Lots. Double frontage and reversed frontage lots shall
be avoided except where necessary to provide separation of residential
development from traffic arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of
topography and orientation.
   4.   Access from Arterial and Collector Streets. Lots should not, in
general, derive access exclusively from a collector or arterial street. Where
driveway access from such streets may be necessary for several adjoining lots,
the Commission may require that such lots be served by a combined access drive
in order to limit possible traffic hazard on such streets. Where possible,
driveways should be designed and arranged so as to avoid requiring vehicles to
back into traffic on collector or arterial streets.
170.37   DESIGN STANDARDS FOR STREETS.
   1.   Roads shall be graded to conform to the Development Standards as
defined in this chapter.
    2.   Topography and Arrangements.
      A.   Roads shall be related appropriately to the topography. Local roads
should be curved wherever possible to avoid conformity of lot appearance. All
streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as possible of the building
sites at, or above, the grades of the streets. Grades of streets shall conform
as closely as possible to the original topography. A combination of steep
grades and curves shall be avoided. (See Development Standards as defined in
this).
      B.   All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and
proposed system of streets and dedicated right-of-way as established by the
Comprehensive Plan.
      C.   All streets shall be properly related to special traffic generators
such as industries, business districts, schools, churches and shopping centers;
to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and proposed land use.
      D.   Minor or local streets should be laid out to discourage use by
through traffic and to permit efficient drainage and utility systems. The use
of curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, and loop streets, shall be encouraged
where such use will result in a more desirable layout.
      E.   In business and industrial developments, the streets and other
access ways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings,
location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and
maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of
movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian.
   3.   The arrangement of streets shall provide for the continuation of
principal streets between adjacent properties when such continuation is
necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire protection, for
efficient provision of utilities, and where such a continuation is in
accordance with the Comprehensive Plan.
      A.   If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the streets must be
dead-end streets temporarily, the right-of-way shall be extended to the
property line. A temporary T, or L-shaped turn-about shall be provided on all
temporary dead-end streets, with the notation on the subdivision plat that land
outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert to abutters whenever the
street is continued. The Commission may limit the length of temporary dead-end
streets in accordance with the design standards of these regulations. The size
of these temporary turn-abouts shall be as per the City Agencies.
      B.   Temporary turn-abouts shall be paved. Granular temporary turn-abouts
shall not be allowed.
      C.   Temporary dead-end streets shall not exceed one thousand (1,000)
feet in length or serve more than twenty-five (25) dwelling units, and shall be
provided with a temporary turnabout.
   4.   Where a cul-de-sac is permitted, its terminus shall normally not be
nearer to the boundary of the subdivision than the minimum lot depth required
of the Zoning area in which it is located. The Commission may require the
reservation of an appropriate easement at the closed end of the cul-de-sac to
accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian traffic, and/or utilities. Minimum
turnaround radii and maximum length shall be limited as provided in this
chapter.
   5.   Permanent cul-de-sacs may be permitted if such arrangement will improve
the subdivision design, but shall in no case exceed five hundred (500) feet in
length or serve more than fourteen (14) dwelling units. Minimum pavement width
shall be thirty-one (31) feet measured from back of curb to back of curb. A
circular turnaround shall be provided having a minimum right-of-way radius of
fifty-five (55) feet and a minimum pavement curb radius of forty-five (45) feet
measured at the back of curb.
    6.   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary line of the tract
to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions,
or unless in the opinion of the Commission such extension is not necessary or
desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the
existing layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts.
   7.   New Perimeter Streets. Street systems shall be laid out so as to avoid
perimeter half-streets. The Commission may authorize a new perimeter street
where the subdivider improves and dedicates the entire required street right-
of-way width within their own subdivision boundaries.
   8.   Reserve Strips. The creation of reserve strips shall not be permitted
adjacent to a proposed street in such a manner as to deny access from adjacent
property to such street.
   9.   Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow road or when the
Comprehensive Plan indicates plans for realignment or widening a road that
would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the applicant shall
be required to dedicate such areas as are required for widening or realignment
of such roads. The City Council may at its discretion require that such streets
also be improved by the subdivider at the subdivider's own expense to the full
width as required by these subdivision regulations. Land reserve for any road
purposes shall not be counted in satisfying yard or area requirements of the
Zoning Ordinance.
   10.   Alleys may be required in business and industrial subdivisions for
adequate access to block interiors and to off-street loading and parking
spaces, but shall as a rule, not be permitted in residential subdivisions.
   11.   Where a subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed
arterial street, the Commission may require that access to such streets be
limited by one of the following means:
      A.   The subdivision of lots so as to back onto the arterial and front
onto a parallel local street; no access shall be provided from the arterial
street, and screening shall be provided in a strip of land along the rear
property line of such lots.
      B.   A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered
from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel street, with the
real lines of their terminal lots backing on the major arterial.
      C.   A marginal access or service road (separated from the arterial
street by a planting or grass strip and having access thereto at suitable
points.)
   12.   Railroad rights-of-ways where so located as to affect the subdivision
of adjoining lands shall be treated as follows:
      A.   In residential districts, a buffer strip at least twenty-five (25)
feet in depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the
district shall be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited
access highway. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be
designated on the Plat: "This strip is reserved for screening. The placement of
structures hereon is prohibited."
      B.   In districts zoned by business, commercial, or industrial uses the
nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad
shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance there from to ensure
suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
      C.   Streets parallel to the railroad when intersecting a street that
crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a
distance of at least one hundred fifty (150) feet from the railroad right-of-
way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum
distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate
approach gradients.
   13.   Bridges of primary benefit to the subdivider, as determined by the
City Council, shall be constructed at the full expense of the applicant without
reimbursement from the City. The sharing expense for the construction of
bridges not of primary benefit to the applicant as determined by the City
Council will be fixed by special agreement between the City Council and the
subdivider pro rata as the percentage of their land developed and so served.
   14.   Street names shall be determined by the City and should be
sufficiently different in sound and spelling from other street names in the
City so as not to cause confusion. A road, which is or is planned as a
continuation of an existing road, shall bear the same name.
   15.   The applicant shall provide, at the applicant's own expense, road
regulatory signs required by the City Engineer at all road intersections. The
subdivider shall install all road signs before issuance of certificates of
occupancy for any residence on the street approved.
   16.   Street name signs shall be provided, at the subdivider's expense, at
all intersections within or abutting the subdivision. The type and location of
said signs shall be recommended by the City Engineer and approved by the City
Council.
   17.   Street lights shall be installed, at the subdivider's expense, in
accordance with the Development Standards and recommended by the City Engineer
and approved by the City Council.
   18.   Street right-of-ways shall have a minimum width of sixty-six (66) feet
for major streets and sixty-six (66) feet for minor streets unless otherwise
specified in the Comprehensive Plan or as directed by the City Council.
   19.   All roadways to be dedicated to the City shall be hot-mix asphalt
streets with Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) curb and gutter or Portland Cement
Concrete (PCC) with integral PCC curb and gutter.
    20.   Streets shall be a minimum of six (6) inches thick PCC with six (6)
inches of granular material subbase or the asphalt equivalent unless otherwise
directed by the City Engineer or site conditions.
   21.   Minimum pavement width for local streets shall generally be twenty-
seven (27) feet measured from the back of curb to the back of curb, but
pavement widths of thirty-six (36) feet may be required by the City Council
where such additional width is deemed to be in the public's interest. Hard
surfaced widths shall be as provided by the Comprehensive Plan and approved by
the City Council for collector and arterial streets.
   22.   Intersections.
      A.   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible
at right angles. A proposed intersection of two (2) new streets at an angle of
less than seventy five (75) degrees shall not be acceptable. An oblique street
should be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at
right angles for at least one-hundred (100) feet there from. Not more than two
streets shall intersect at any one point unless specifically approved by the
City Council.
      B.   Proposed new intersections along one side of any existing street
should, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the
opposite side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than
one hundred fifty (150) feet shall not be permitted, except where specifically
approved by the City Council. Where any major street is intersected by any
other street, the alignment of said intersecting street shall generally be
continuous.
      C.   Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two (2) local streets
shall be at least twenty (20) feet and shall be twenty-five (25) feet wherever
possible; and minimum curb radius at an intersection involving a collector or
arterial street shall be at least twenty-five (25) feet; provided that at any
intersection where a curb radius has been previously established, such radius
shall be used as standard. Alley intersections and abrupt changes in alignment
within a block shall have the corners cut off in accordance with standard
engineering practice to permit safe vehicular movement.
      D.   Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever practical
and shall meet the Development Standards.
      E.   Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing
vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting
visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation (including
trees) in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to provide an
adequate sight distance as specified in the Development Standards approved in
this chapter.
170.38   DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWERS.
No subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be provided to
an adequate drainage watercourse or facility.
   1.   General Requirements.
      A.   The City Council shall not approve any plat or subdivision that does
not make adequate provision for drainage of storm or floodwater runoff. The
storm water drainage system shall be separate and independent of any sanitary
sewer system. Storm sewers, where required, shall be designed according to the
Development Standards, and a copy of design computations shall be submitted
along with plans. Surface water drainage patterns shall be shown for each and
every lot and block.
      B.   The applicant may be required by the City Council to carry away by
pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist either previously
to, or as a result of the subdivision. Such drainage facilities shall be
constructed in accordance with the Development Standards.
      C.   Underground storm sewer system shall be constructed throughout the
subdivision and connected to an existing storm sewer if feasible. If no
suitable outlets are available within a reasonable distance but a public storm
sewer will be provided eventually, as determined by the City Engineer and the
City Council, the developer shall make arrangements for future storm water
disposal by a public utility system at the time the plat receives final
approval. Provision for such connection shall be included in the performance
bond or escrow agreement required for the subdivision plat. The subdivider
shall also provide a suitable interim outfall or drainage system as approved by
the City Council.
      D.   The storm design, frequency and duration used in computations shall
be as per the Development Standards or as recommended by the City Engineer.
   2.   All streets shall have longitudinal subdrains installed on both sides
of the street as per the Development Standards and in locations as recommended
by the City Engineer.
   3.   Accommodation of Upstream Drainage Areas. A culvert or other drainage
facility should in each case be large enough to accommodate potential runoff
from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the
subdivision. The developer shall determine the necessary size of the facility,
based on the provision of the Development Standards assuming conditions of
maximum potential watershed development as established by land uses projected
in the Comprehensive Plan, and as permitted by the zoning regulations
applicable to such land uses and shall be reviewed by the City Engineer.
   4.   Effect on Downstream Drainage Areas. The developer shall also study the
effect of each subdivision on existing downstream drainage facilities outside
the area of the subdivision and shall be reviewed by the City Engineer. Local
government drainage studies, together with such other studies as shall be
appropriate, shall serve as a guide to needed improvements. Where it is
anticipated that the additional runoff incident to the development of the
subdivision will overload an existing downstream drainage facility, the City
Council may withhold approval of the subdivision until provision has been made
for the improvement of said potential condition in such sum as the City Council
may determine.
   5.   Dedication of Drainage Easements.
      A.   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way,
channel, or stream there shall be provided a storm water easement or drainage
right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse, and of
such width and construction as will be adequate for the purpose. Wherever
possible, it is desirable that the drainage be maintained by an open channel
with landscaped banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume of flow.
      B.   Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impractical
the inclusion of drainage facilities within the road rights-of-way, perpetual
unobstructed easements at least fifteen (15) feet in width for such drainage
facilities shall be provided across property outside the road lines and with
satisfactory access to the road. Easements shall be indicated on the plat.
Drainage easements shall be carried from the road to a natural watercourse or
to other drainage facilities.
      C.   When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private land
outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights shall be secured and
indicated on the plat.
      D.   The City Council may require dedication to the City, either in fee
or by drainage or conservation easement, of land on both sides of existing
watercourses, to a distance to be determined by the Planning and Zoning
Commission or the City Engineer, if such dedication is deemed necessary to
assure preservation of said watercourses, drainage ways, channels, or streams.
      E.   Low-lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or
overflowing during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for
dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their natural state as drainage
ways. Such land or lands subject to periodic flooding shall not be computed in
determining the number of lots to be utilized for planned unit development nor
for computing the area requirement of any lot.
170.39   WATER FACILITIES.
   1.   Public Water.
      A.   Where a public water main is accessible, the subdivider shall
install adequate water facilities (including fire hydrants) in accordance with
the Development Standards. All water mains shall be at least eight (8) inches
in diameter, and shall be properly valved and looped where feasible to insure
adequate water pressure.
      B.   To facilitate the above, the location of all fire hydrants, all
water supply improvements and all developments proposed to be served shall be
shown on the preliminary plat, and the cost of installing same shall be
included in the performance bond to be furnished by the subdivider.
   2.   Individual Wells and Central Water Systems.
      A.   In low-density zoning districts, in the discretion of the City
Council, if a public water system is not available, individual wells may be
used or a central water system provided in such a manner that an adequate
supply of potable water will be available to every lot in the subdivision.
Water samples shall be submitted to the Health Department for its approval.
Individual wells and central water systems shall be approved by the appropriate
health authorities. Orders of approval shall be submitted to the City Council.
      B.   If the City Council requires that a connection to a public water
main be eventually provided as a condition to approval of an individual well or
central water system, the applicant shall make arrangements for future water
service at the time the plat receives final approval. Performance or cash bonds
in form and substance provided for performance bonds generally may be required
to insure compliance.
   3.   Fire Hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be required for all subdivisions
except those with approved individual wells. Fire hydrants shall be located as
per the Development Standards and approved by the City Council, after
recommendation from the City Engineer and Prairie City Fire Department. To
eliminate future street openings, all underground utilities for fire hydrants,
together with the fire hydrants themselves and all other supply improvements,
shall be installed before any final paving of a street shown on the subdivision
plat.
170.40   SANITARY SEWER FACILITIES.
Sanitary sewer facilities shall be provided by the subdivider for each lot in
accordance with the general regulations listed below and with the Development
Standards. Where a public sanitary sewerage system is reasonably accessible,
the subdivider shall connect and provide sewers accessible to each lot in the
subdivision. Design criteria for slope, size, manhole locations, manhole and
pipe elevations, materials, construction techniques, and other considerations
shall be reviewed by the City Engineer and shall be consistent with the
Development Standards.
   1.   Sanitary sewer systems should be designed for the ultimate tributary
population. Due consideration should be given to current zoning regulations and
approved planning and zoning reports where applicable. Sewer capacities should
be adequate to handle the anticipated maximum hourly quantity of sewerage and
industrial waste together with an adequate allowance for infiltration and other
extraneous flow.
   2.   Sewers shall generally be located within street or alley rights-of-way
unless topography dictates otherwise. Where sewers are located in easements on
private property, access shall be provided to all manholes.
   3.   Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent any sewage from entering
any source of potable water.
   4.   Storm sewage, foundation drains, roof drains, and similar installations
shall not be connected to the sanitary sewer system.
170.41   FRANCHISE UTILITIES.
The City Council may require all franchise utilities facilities, including but
not limited to gas, electrical lines of nominal voltage not in excess of 15,000
volts, telephone, fiber optic, and CATV cables, to be located underground
throughout the subdivision. Wherever existing utilities are located above
ground, except where existing on public roads and rights-of-way, they shall be
removed and placed underground. All utility facilities existing and proposed
and their easements throughout the subdivision shall be shown on the plat. The
subdivider shall be responsible for making the necessary arrangements with the
utility companies for installation of such facilities. Said utility lines shall
be installed prior to the improvement of any such street, alley, or right-of-
way. Incidental appurtenances, such as transformers and their enclosures,
pedestal mounted terminal boxes, meters, and meter boxes may be placed above
ground but shall be located so as not to be unsightly or hazardous to the
public. If overhead utility lines or wires are permitted, they shall be placed
in the easements provided in the rear of the lots. In their determination on
whether or not to require underground utilities, the Council and Commission may
consider that soil, topographical, or other conditions make such installations
within the subdivision unreasonable or impractical. Easements for utilities
(private and public) may be required along rear or side lot lines where deemed
necessary. Such easements shall be at least ten (10) feet wide.
170.42   SIDEWALKS.
   1.   Sidewalks shall be required along both sides of any street being
dedicated for public use. Sidewalks shall be five (5) feet wide when located
along a local street, and may be required to be five feet (5) wide or more when
along any collector or arterial street. Sidewalks shall be Portland cement
concrete and be a minimum of four (4) inches thick, except where crossing
driveways or at curb ramp locations, where they shall be six (6) inches thick.
Said walks shall be located one (1) foot inside the street right-of-way line
and shall be constructed according to the Development Standards.
   2.   The Commission or Council may require, in order to facilitate
pedestrian access from the roads to schools, parks, playground, or other nearby
roads, perpetual unobstructed easements or dedicated rights-of-way at least ten
(10) feet in width for provision of sidewalks. Such easements or rights-of-way
shall be indicated on the plat.
170.43   DRIVEWAYS.  
Driveways shall be paved Portland cement concrete (PCC) from the traveled
portion of the street to the property line and shall be installed when the lot
is developed. Maximum and minimum driveway widths shall be as per the
Development Standards unless otherwise approved by City Council. Driveways
shall be a minimum of six (6) inches thick PCC. Driveway flares shall be as per
the Development Standards.
170.44   DEBRIS AND WASTE.
No cut trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks, stones, soil, junk, rubbish, or
other waste materials of any kind shall be buried in any land, or left or
deposited on any lot or street at the time of the issuance of an occupancy
permit and removal of same shall be required prior to issuance of any occupancy
permit on a subdivision. Nor shall any be left or deposited in any area of the
subdivision at the time of expiration of the performance bond or dedication of
public improvements, whichever is sooner.
170.45   SOIL PRESERVATION, GRADING AND SEEDING.
   1.   Soil Preservation and Final Grading. No certificate of occupancy shall
be issued for any one lot until final grading of said lot has been completed,
consistent with the Development Standards.
   2.   Lot Drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage
away from all buildings and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with
the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so
as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent
lots.
170.46   PRESERVATION OF NATURAL FEATURES AND AMENITIES
Existing features that would add value to residential development or to the
City as a whole, such as trees, watercourses, historic spots, and semi
irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved in the design of the subdivision. No
trees shall be removed from any subdivision nor any change of grade of the land
effected until approval of the preliminary plat has been granted. All trees on
the plat required to be retained shall be preserved, and all trees where
required shall be welled and protected against change of grade. The preliminary
plat shall show the number and location of existing trees, as required by these
regulations and shall further indicate all those marked for retention.
170.47   MAIL SERVICE.
Each subdivision shall be designed to accommodate mobile U.S. Postal Mail
service. The developer shall furnish and install mail units as required by the
U.S. Post Office. The design and location of mail service shall be submitted to
the local U.S. Post Office and the City for approval.
170.48   DEDICATION AND RESERVATION OF LAND FOR OPEN SPACE AND RECREATIONAL
FACILITIES.  
In order to provide for the proper location and preservation of adequate open
spaces and sites for public uses, to safeguard the health, safety, and welfare
of the public by providing safe places for children to play and for adequate
recreational areas within new subdivisions and developments in the City; and to
most equitably apportion the cost of providing the public school, park, and
recreational sites and facilities necessary to serve the additional number of
people brought into the community by subdivision development on the basis of
the additional need created by such developments, the following provisions are
established.
   1.   Procedure.
      A   Consideration shall be given in the design of a residential
subdivision plat to the provision of adequate and suitable open space and
recreation areas for use by the inhabitants of the subdivision. The owner or
subdivider of the land to be subdivided, at the time of filing a preliminary
plat with the City Clerk for consideration by the Planning and Zoning
Commission, shall indicate whether they desire to dedicate or reserve property
for open space and recreational purposes, or whether they desire to pay a fee
in lieu thereof. If the owner or subdivider desires to dedicate or reserve land
for this purpose, they shall designate the area thereof on the preliminary plat
as submitted.
      B.   The Commission and Council shall review such plat, and where the
Commission and Council determine pursuant to paragraph 4 of this section that
open space and recreational areas are necessary and required and are feasible
and compatible with the comprehensive plan for development of the City, the
subdivider shall provide and dedicate to the public adequate land to provide
for said open space and recreational needs of the subdivision.
      C.   Where such dedication is not feasible or compatible with the
Comprehensive Plan as determined by the City Council upon recommendation by the
Commission, the subdivider shall, in lieu thereof, pay to the City a fee or
combination of fee and land, equivalent to the value of the required dedication
as provided by paragraph 2(B) of this section.
      D.   Such dedication or payment of fees in lieu thereof shall be made as
condition of final plat approval and shall be accomplished prior to endorsement
of the final plat and recording of same. Where dedication is required, it shall
be accomplished by providing abstract of title to the dedicated property to the
City Attorney for examination, and if, upon examination of the abstract and
finding of marketable title by the City Attorney, free of all liens and
encumbrances, the developer shall provide to the City Council a properly
executed warranty deed dedicating the required land to the City without cost to
the City. Where fees in lieu of dedication are required, the same shall be
deposited with the City Clerk for deposit in a special fund as provided by
paragraph 2(B) of this section.
   2.   Amount of Dedication. Dedication of land or payment of fees in lieu
thereof for public open space and recreational facilities shall be required for
all residential subdivision, but shall not be required for any agricultural,
commercial, or industrial subdivision. The provisions of the section are
minimum standards and shall not be construed as prohibiting a developer from
dedicating or reserving other land for recreational or open space purposes in
addition to these requirements.
      A.   The amount of land to be dedicated by the subdivider for public open
space and recreation facilities as provided by this section shall not be less
than seven hundred (700) square feet per dwelling unit.
      B.   Where the City Council determines that a suitable park or parks
cannot be properly located in the area covered by any such plat, or if the
application of the standard for dedication of lands would result in open space
sites too small to be used, or if the Comprehensive Plan calls for such
neighborhood open space to be located elsewhere, the subdivider shall in lieu
thereof pay to the City a fee, the amount of such to be based upon the fair
market value of the amount of land which would otherwise be required to be
dedicated. "Fair market value" shall be determined as of the time of filing the
final plat in accordance with the following: (i) the fair market value as
determined by the City Council based on current appraisals; or (ii) if the
subdivider objects to such amount of evaluation, the subdivider may, at the
subdivider's own expense, obtain an appraisal of property by a qualified real
estate appraiser approved by the City, which appraisal may be accepted by the
City Council if found reasonable; or (iii) the City and subdivider may agree as
to the fair market value. All funds so levied, assessed, and collected by the
City shall be directed to the Parks & Recreation Board or the City and shall be
designated to park improvements within the City. Said funds shall be used only
for the purpose of providing open space and recreational facilities that will
be available to and benefit the inhabitants of the City. Any and all interest
accumulated upon such funds shall be used only for acquisition and development
of open space and recreational facilities.
      C.   Where private open space for park and recreational purposes is
provided in a proposed subdivision or planned unit development, and such space
is to be privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the
subdivision, such areas shall be credited against the requirement of dedication
for park and recreation purposes, as set forth in paragraph 2(B) above,
provided the City Council finds it is in the public interest to do so, and that
the following standards are met:
         (1)   Yards, court areas, setbacks, and other open areas required to
be maintained by the Zoning and Building Regulations shall not be included in
the computation of such private open space; and
         (2)   The private ownership and maintenance of the open space is
adequately provided for by written agreement; and
         (3)   The use of the private open space is restricted for park and
recreational purposes by recorded covenants which run with the land in favor of
the future owners of property within the tract and which cannot be defeated or
eliminated without the consent of the City Council; and
         (4)   The proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use
for park and recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors as
size, shape, topography, geology, access, and location of the private open
space land; and
         (5)   Facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial
accordance with the provisions of the recreational element of the Comprehensive
Plan, and are approved by the City Council.
   3.   Reservation of Open Space, Recreational Facilities and School Sites. If
the Comprehensive Plan requires public open space and or recreation facilities
larger than that area required to be dedicated, or a proposed school site is
located within the area to be subdivided, the City Council may require the
subdivider to reserve additional area in excess of the dedication requirements
of this Article for purchase within two (2) years of the recording date of the
subdivision. School sites shall be reserved for four (4) years, giving the PCM
School District or its successor in interest, the option of purchase. The
purchase price in all cases shall be at the appraised raw land value prior to
subdivision plus one-half (1/2) of the cost of grading and paving, including
curb, of that portion of any street contiguous to the site. Should the park or
school sites not be purchased within the time limits specified above, the
subdivider may then sell them for an alternate purpose as shown on the approved
subdivision plat.
   4.   Location and Design Criteria. The City Council shall determine whether
dedication, reservation, or payment of fees in lieu of dedication or a
combination of cash, dedication, and reservation shall be required. In making
such decisions, the Council shall consider the following:
      A.   Recreation element of the City's Comprehensive Plan.
      B.   The size and shape of the land available for dedication. The
dedicated land shall form a single parcel of land except where the Council
determines that two (2) or more parcels would be in the public interest, in
which case the Council may require that the parcels be connected by a path or
strip of land not less than fifteen (15) feet wide. In general, no parcel less
than two (2) acres should be reserved for recreational purposes if it will be
impractical or impossible to secure additional lands to increase its area. The
shape of the dedicated parcel should accommodate development of recreational
facilities suitable to the subdivision said parcel is intended to serve.
      C.   The dedicated land shall be located so as to be reasonably
accessible to all inhabitants of the subdivision it is intended to serve.
Public access to the dedicated land shall be provided either by adjoining
street frontage or public easements to the dedicated parcel. The easements
shall be sufficiently wide so that maintenance equipment will have reasonable
convenient access to the land and shall be approved by Council.
      D.   A minimum of sixty (60) percent of the parcel to be dedicated shall
be suitable for dry ground recreational use. Fifty (50) percent of the area
suitable for dry ground recreational use should not exceed three (3) percent
grade, and the remainder of such area should not exceed five (5) percent grade.
Exceptions to the preceding may be given in cases of exceptional topography or
natural amenities.
      E.   Existing or proposed open space and recreational facilities in
adjoining lands which may serve in whole or in part the open space and
recreational needs of the development.
      F.   Any and all other relevant information.
      G.   The determination of the City Council as to whether land shall be
dedicated or reserved or a fee paid, or combination thereof, shall be final and
conclusive.
   5.   Development and Maintenance. It shall be the duty of the City to
properly develop and maintain the dedicated area for open space and
recreational facilities, and the subdivider shall in no way be responsible for
development, maintenance, or liability thereof except that said subdivider
shall not develop the surrounding area in a manner which would unduly
depreciate the purpose, use, or value of the dedicated property. Where the land
required for open space and recreational purposes and facilities is retained in
private ownership, it shall be the owners' responsibility to properly develop
and maintain said area.
   6.   Time of Commencement. At the time the final plat is approved and
requirements of this section met, the City Council shall establish a reasonable
timetable for the development of the park and recreational facilities.
170.49   SUITABILITY OF THE LAND.  
Land which the Planning and Zoning Commission or City Council finds to be
unsuitable for subdivision or development due to flooding, improper drainage,
adverse earth formations or topography, utility easements, or other features
that will reasonably be harmful to the safety, health, and general welfare of
the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its surrounding
areas, shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are
formulated by the subdivider and approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission
and City Council, to solve the problems created by the unsuitable land
conditions. Such land shall be set aside for uses as shall not involve such a
danger.
170.50   FEES.
All fees for filing of the preliminary and final plat with the City Clerk,
inspection fees and any other fees consistent with this Code, as well as fee
refunds, shall be set by resolution of the Council or as identified in this
Code.
   1.   Before a preliminary plat, final plat or plat of survey shall be
considered by the Commission, the applicant or agent shall deposit with the
Clerk a fee according to a schedule adopted from time to time by resolution of
the Council. The appropriate fees shall be deposited prior to Council action on
the preliminary plat, final plat or plat of survey. In the event that said fees
are insufficient to reimburse the City for engineering charges incurred by the
City in the examination and review of the preliminary plat, final plat or plat
of survey, the subdivider shall be responsible for any additional fees incurred
by the City for such engineering charges.
   2.   In addition to the plat filing fees, the subdivider shall be
responsible for just and reasonable costs incurred by the City during the
course of construction of the improvements for inspection, testing, or other
work deemed necessary by the City to assure proper construction in accordance
with the approved construction drawings and applicable standards and
ordinances.
   3.   The City shall annually, by resolution, determine the hourly rate which
it shall pay for professional engineering services which shall be deemed to be
the maximum rate which may be imposed upon any subdivider during such annual
period.
   4.   In general, the following fees are applicable to this Chapter and are
identified below. The amounts of each fee are set by resolution of the Council.
The list of fees below is not intended to be all inclusive; however, it is to
be used as a guide to identify possible fees. Not all fees will be applicable
to every subdivision and there may be fees not identified below that are
required.
      A.   Subdivision Plat Application Fee
      B.   Construction Document Review Fee
      C.   Construction Observation Fee
      D.   Minor Subdivision Plat Application Fee
      E.   Dedication of Park Land or Land Fee
170.51   VARIATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.
   1.   General. Where the City Council, upon recommendation by the Planning
and Zoning Commission, finds that extraordinary hardships or practical
difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations and/or
the purposes of these regulations may be served to a greater extent by an
alternative proposal, it may approve variances to these subdivision regulations
so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured,
provided that such variance shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent
and purpose of these regulations; and further provided the City Council shall
not approve variances unless it shall make findings based up on the evidence
presented to it in each specific case that:
      A.   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other property.
      B.   The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable
generally to other property.
      C.   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, topography,
or other unique conditions of the specific property involved, a particular

this chapter.
   3.   Proof of Liability Insurance. As part of the permit process, the owner
of the UTV must provide proof of liability insurance with minimum limits of
$100,000 each person, $300,000 each accident before a permit will be issued.
The proof of insurance must be with the UTV whenever said UTV is in operation.

(Ch. 171 - Ord. 387 - Jan. 22 Supp.)
USE AND MAINTENANCE OF THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
The following information is provided to assist in the use and proper
maintenance of this Code of Ordinances.
DISTRIBUTION OF COPIES
   1.   OFFICIAL COPY. The “OFFICIAL COPY” of the Code of Ordinances must be
kept by the City Clerk and should be identified as the “OFFICIAL COPY.”
   2.   DISTRIBUTION. Other copies of the Code of Ordinances should be made
available to all persons having a relatively frequent and continuing need to
have access to ordinances which are in effect in the City as well as reference
centers such as the City Library, County Law Library, and perhaps the schools.
   3.   SALE. The sale or distribution of copies in a general fashion is not
recommended as experience indicates that indiscriminate distribution tends to
result in outdated codes being used or misused.
   4.   RECORD OF DISTRIBUTION. The City Clerk should be responsible for
maintaining an accurate and current record of persons having a copy of the Code
of Ordinances. Each official, elected or appointed, should return to the City,
upon leaving office, all documents, records and other materials pertaining to
the office, including this Code of Ordinances.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 372.13[4])
NUMBERING OF ORDINANCES AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
It is recommended that a simple numerical sequence be used in assigning
ordinance numbers to ordinances as they are passed. For example, if the
ordinance adopting the Code of Ordinances is No. 163, we would suggest that the
first ordinance passed changing, adding to, or deleting from the Code be
assigned the number 164, the next ordinance be assigned the number 165, and so
on. We advise against using the Code of Ordinances numbering system for the
numbering of ordinances.
RETENTION OF AMENDING ORDINANCES
Please note that two books should be maintained: (1) the Code of Ordinances;
and (2) an ordinance book. We will assist in the maintenance of the Code of
Ordinances book, per the Supplement Agreement, by revising and returning
appropriate pages for the Code of Ordinances book as required to accommodate
ordinances amending the Code. The City Clerk is responsible for maintaining the
ordinance book and must be sure that an original copy of each ordinance
adopted, bearing the signatures of the Mayor and Clerk, is inserted in the
ordinance book and preserved in a safe place.
SUPPLEMENT RECORD
A record of all supplements prepared for the Code of Ordinances is provided in
the front of the Code. This record will indicate the number and date of the
ordinances adopting the original Code and of each subsequently adopted
ordinance which has been incorporated in the Code. For each supplemented
ordinance, the Supplement Record will list the ordinance number, date, topic,
and chapter or section number of the Code affected by the amending ordinance. A
periodic review of the Supplement Record and ordinances passed will assure that
all ordinances amending the Code have been incorporated therein.
DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPLEMENTS
Supplements containing revised pages for insertion in each Code will be sent to
the Clerk. It is the responsibility of the Clerk to see that each person having
a Code of Ordinances receives each supplement so that each Code may be properly
updated to reflect action of the Council in amending the Code.
AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
The Code of Ordinances contains most of the laws of the City as of the date of
its adoption and is continually subject to amendment to reflect changing
policies of the Council, mandates of the State, or decisions of the Courts.
Amendments to the Code of Ordinances can only be accomplished by the adoption
of an ordinance.
