following causes:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Gross neglect or refusal to serve by failure to attend regular Council
meetings by missing three of the twelve meetings in a twelve month period,
excusable illness or emergencies excepted, or neglect or refusal to sign
papers, or other failure to serve.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Inability to attend any official meetings or to carry out duties due to
physical or mental infirmities that appear, upon careful inquiry, to be of such
severe or chronic character as to preclude rendering necessary services
expected of the office for two months or more.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Inability to properly exercise official duties due to such mental or
physical incapacity even when present or on the job.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Commission of such acts as would be grounds for an equitable action for
removal in the District Court.
2.Â Â Â Council Hearing. The Council, upon adopting a motion setting a public
hearing, shall cause notice to be given by certified mail to the officer for
which removal is sought. Such notice shall be mailed not less than ten (10) or
more than twenty (20) days before said hearing. In the case of severe physical
or mental disability, said notice may be given to said personâ€™s attorney, or to
a person holding the power of attorney, or to the next of kin if there is no
known attorney, if notice to the person would not be of practical effect.
Refusal by the person to accept notice, inability to deliver notice because of
frequent absence from his usual place of abode for extended periods, or other
cause of failure to complete notice may be noted by hearings, but shall not bar
the proceedings if notice had been diligently tried and the efforts recited in
the record.
3.Â Â Â Presentation of Case for Removal. The Council shall constitute the hearing
body for other than Council Members, but where removal of a Council Member is
sought, the remaining members of the Council shall constitute the hearing body.
The Council at the time of making motion to hold a hearing for considering the
removal of an elected officer, shall designate the president of the hearing,
who shall be the Mayor in all cases except when removal of the Mayor is sought,
and then the Mayor Pro Tem shall be designated as president of the hearing. The
Council shall name one of its members to present the cause for removal, and
municipal officers possessing pertinent facts shall provide such data upon
request, including attendance record and testimony of negligent acts or of
disabilities. All charges shall be in writing and the above data shall be
presented as written affidavits. If medical or other professional evaluations
are needed, depositions may be taken and presented unless personal testimony of
such authorities is deemed necessary to more fully understand the
circumstances.
4.Â Â Â Declaration of Vacancy. If it appears from the facts established at the
hearing that grounds for removal exist, the Council may order removal of the
person from office and declare the office vacant, but only upon a two-thirds
vote of the entire Council. Said removal shall take effect the day after said
vote and order unless the person shall have within said time appealed to the
district court under provisions of Chapter 66, Code of Iowa. Where removal is
consummated, the vacancy shall be filled promptly in the manner prescribed by
Section
5.10 of
Chapter 5. The record of the hearing shall be entered in the proceedings of the
Council and the written changes, data and affidavits safely filed with the
municipal records.

35.03Â Â Â CLEANUP REQUIRED.
Whenever a hazardous condition is created by the deposit, injection, dumping,

substance or a constituent of the hazardous substance may enter the environment
or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters, including ground
waters, the responsible person shall cause the condition to be remedied by a
cleanup, as defined in the preceding section, as rapidly as feasible to an

on the character of the hazardous condition, said notice setting a deadline for
accomplishing the cleanup and stating that the City will proceed to procure
cleanup services and bill the responsible person for all costs associated with
the cleanup if the cleanup is not accomplished within the deadline. In the
event that it is determined that immediate cleanup is necessary as a result of
the present danger to the public health, safety and welfare, then no notice
shall be required and the City may proceed to procure the cleanup and bill the
responsible person for all costs associated with the cleanup. If the bill for
those services is not paid within thirty (30) days, the City Attorney shall

condition or discovery of the hazardous condition. The County Sheriff shall
immediately notify the Department of Natural Resources.

beverages shall participate in and complete a free alcohol training program
(in-person or online) offered by the Iowa Alcoholic Beverage Division's
approved training, Jones County Sheriff's Office, or its designee. All persons
required to complete training shall do so within ninety (90) days of the date
on which the person becomes subject to the training requirement (date of hire
or enactment of this ordinance). If such training is not offered within ninety
days, the person subject to the requirements of this ordinance shall notify the
Wyoming City Hall of that fact and the date upon which the employee can
complete the required training. All persons completing the training required by
this section shall maintain active certification. Approval of liquor license
applications is contingent on all servers/sellers completing the required
training within the 90 day timeframe mentioned above. If a business fails a
compliance check, all servers/sellers who do not hold the in-person
certification must complete the in-person classroom training with the Jones
County Sheriff's Office, or its designee, within 90 days of the violation.
1.Â Â Â AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE. Establishments that participate in either training
are granted an affirmative defense, which may be used once in a four-year
period. A business may avoid civil prosecution if an alcohol sale-to-minor
violation occurs in their establishment. In order for the business to take
advantage of the affirmative defense, the employee guilty of the violation must
have been certified prior to the time the offense occurred.
However, the affirmative defense cannot be used if the employee sold to a minor
under the age of 18. Only the business is eligible to avoid a civil penalty;
the guilty employee will still be subject to a criminal fine and the Iowa
Alcoholic Beverage Division (IA ABD) will automatically revoke the employee's
online certification (in accordance with the administrative rules of IA ABD).
Upon the business's failure of the alcohol compliance check, the in- person
training from the Jones County Sheriff's Office, or its designee, will be
required for all servers/sellers of that business who are not currently
certified in the in-person training at-cost paid to the Jones County Sheriffs
Office, or it's designee.
2.Â Â Â SPECIAL EVENTS.Â Persons involved in the selling, serving, or dispensing of
alcoholic beverages at festivals, carnivals, fundraisers, and other temporary
events are not required to take the training, but is strongly recommended.
45.05Â Â Â CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION.
All persons completing the training shall receive a certificate of completion,
which shall be kept on file at the location where the person sells, serves, or
dispenses alcoholic beverages, and maintained by that person's employer. The
certificate shall remain on file as long as the person is employed at that
location, and shall be returned to the employee when his or her employment
ends. These certificates shall be available for inspection during business
hours to law enforcement personnel authorized to enforce Federal, State, and
local liquor laws and regulations.
45.06Â Â Â PENALTIES.
Consistent with the provisions of the Wyoming City Ordinances, the Jones County
Sheriff's Office is charged with primary responsibility for enforcement of this
ordinance. Penalties for violation of this ordinance shall be assessed against
the person or entity holding a license for the sale of alcoholic beverages
under the State of Iowa. The penalties assessed against the licensee for
violations of this Ordinance are as follows:
1.Â Â Â For the first violation, a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100).
2.Â Â Â For subsequent violations within a two year period, a fine not exceeding
two hundred dollars ($200) and a written report sent to the Iowa Alcoholic
Beverages Division for possible suspension of the liquor license.

Â 
1 Deep and shallow wells, as defined in 567â€”40.2(455B): A deep well is a well
located and constructed in such a manner that there is a continuous layer of
low permeability soil or rock at least 5 feet thick located at least 25 feet
below the normal ground surface and above the aquifer from which water is to be
drawn. A shallow well is a well located and constructed in such a manner that
there is not a continuous layer of low permeability soil or rock (or equivalent
retarding mechanism acceptable to the department) at least 5 feet thick, the
top of which is located at least 25 feet below the normal ground surface and
above the aquifer from which water is to be drawn.
2 The separation distances are dependent upon two factors: the type of piping
that is in the existing sewer or drain, as noted in the table, and that the
piping was properly installed in accordance with the standards.
3 Solid wastes are those derived from the treatment of water or wastewater.
Certain types of solid wastes from water treatment processes may be
landâ€“applied within the separation distance on an individual, caseâ€“byâ€“case
basis.
4 Solid waste means garbage, refuse, rubbish, and other similar discarded solid
or semisolid materials, including but not limited to such materials resulting
from industrial, commercial, agricultural, and domestic activities.

extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer.
3.Â Â Â Installation. The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer
shall conform to the requirements of Division 4, Plumbing Rules and
Regulations, of the State Building Code, applicable rules and regulations of
the City, or the procedures set forth in A.S.T.M. Specification C-12. All such
connections shall be made gastight and watertight. Any deviation from the
prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the Superintendent
before installation.
4.Â Â Â Water Lines. When possible, building sewers should be laid at least ten
(10) feet horizontally from a water service. The horizontal separation may be
less, provided the water service line is located at one side and at least
twelve (12) inches above the top of the building sewer.
5.Â Â Â Size. Building sewers shall be sized for the peak expected sewage flow
from the building with a minimum building sewer size of four (4) inches.
6.Â Â Â Alignment and Grade. All building sewers shall be laid to a straight line

Superintendent. Solvent-welded joints are not permitted.
12.Â Â Â Unstable Soil. No sewer connection shall be laid so that it is exposed
when crossing any watercourse. Where an old watercourse must of necessity be
crossed or where there is any danger of undermining or settlement, cast iron
soil pipe or vitrified clay sewer pipe thoroughly encased in concrete shall be
required for such crossings. Such encasement shall extend at least six (6)
inches on all sides of the pipe. The cast iron pipe or encased clay pipe shall
rest on firm, solid material at either end.
13.Â Â Â Preparation of Basement or Crawl Space. No connection for any residence,
business or other structure with any sanitary sewer shall be made unless the
basement floor is poured, or in the case of a building with a slab or crawl
space, unless the ground floor is installed with the area adjacent to the
foundation of such building cleared of debris and backfilled. The backfill
shall be well compacted and graded so that the drainage is away from the
foundation. Prior to the time the basement floor is poured, or the first floor
is installed in buildings without basements, the sewer shall be plugged and the

accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a twenty- four (24) hour composite of all
outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken. Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses
are obtained from twenty-four (24) hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHâ€™s
are determined from periodic grab samples).

chapter.
113.03Â Â Â GRANTING OF FRANCHISE.
The regulatory ordinance codified herein which grants to the Company the
nonexclusive right to construct, operate and maintain a cable television system
in the City was passed and adopted by the Council after a full, open and public
proceeding. The proceeding was held after public notice was given and afforded
all interested parties the opportunity to comment. Therefore, the City grants
to the Company a nonexclusive franchise, right and privilege to construct,
erect, operate, modify and maintain in, upon, among, across, above and over and
under the highways, streets, alleys, sidewalks, public ways and public places
now laid out or dedicated and all extensions thereof, and additions thereto in
the City, poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and other
television conductors and fixtures necessary for the maintenance and operation
in the City of a cable television system for the purpose of distributing
television and radio signals, and other electronic impulses in order to furnish
television and radio programs, and various communications and other electronic
services to the public. The right so granted includes the right to use and
occupy said streets, alleys, public ways and public places and all manner of
easements for the purposes set forth in this chapter.
113.04Â Â Â COMPLIANCE REQUIRED GENERALLY.
The Company shall, at all times during the life of the regulatory ordinance
codified in this chapter, be subject to all lawful exercise of the police power
by the City and to such reasonable regulations as the City shall hereafter by
resolution or ordinance provide. The construction, operation and maintenance of
the system by the Company shall be in full compliance with such portions of the
National Electrical Safety Code as may be applicable and as the same may be
amended and revised from time to time, and in full compliance with all other
applicable rules and regulations now in effect or hereafter adopted by the
Federal Communications Commission, the City or any other agency of the State or
the United States, which may hereafter acquire jurisdiction of the operations
of the Company authorized in this chapter. The Company will provide a minimum
of 5 satellite signals with an additional 4 off-air channels.
113.05Â Â Â NATIONAL ELECTRIC SAFETY CODE.
All facilities and equipment of the Company shall be constructed and maintained
in accordance with the requirements of the National Electrical Safety Code, and
such applicable ordinances and regulations set forth by the City and/or any
local, State or Federal agencies.
113.06Â Â Â FCC REGULATIONS.
The Company shall, at all times, comply with the rules and regulations
governing CATV operations promulgated by the FCC, specifically those set out in

involved in the construction of the CATV system and signal carriage therein.
113.07Â Â Â MODIFICATION OF FCC RULES.

at the time of renewal of the ordinance codified in this chapter, whichever
occurs first.
113.08Â Â Â TRANSFER.
The Company shall not sell or transfer its system to another, or alter the
composition of its individual partners or stockholders, or transfer any rights
granted under this chapter to another without written notice and approval by

City an instrument duly executed, reciting the fact of such sale, assignment or
lease, accepting the terms of this chapter and agreeing to perform all
conditions thereof.
113.09Â Â Â COMPANY RULES AND REGULATIONS.
The Company shall have the authority to promulgate such rules, regulations,
terms and conditions governing the conduct of its business as shall be
reasonably necessary to enable the Company to exercise its rights and perform
its obligations under this chapter and to assure uninterrupted service to each
and all of its customers; provided, however, that such rules, regulations,
terms and conditions shall not be in conflict with the provisions hereof or of
Federal and State law.
113.10Â Â Â FRANCHISE TERM.
The franchise granted under this chapter shall terminate twenty-five (25) years
from the date of grant, subject to renewal for period of reasonable duration on
the same terms and conditions as contained in this chapter, or on such
different or additional terms and conditions as may be lawfully specified by
the Council and as are consistent with the requirements of Rule 76.31 of the
FCC. This franchise shall not be exclusive and shall neither restrict the
Council in the exercise of its regulatory power, nor prevent it from granting
any other cable television system franchise.
113.11Â Â Â FRANCHISE RENEWAL.
No renewal of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall be effective except
pursuant to a public proceeding affording due process. The Company shall be a
party to any such proceedings and any other proceedings in which its rights,
privileges or interests would be affected and shall be fully entitled to such
due process rights as may be available under applicable laws, ordinances, rules
and regulations.
113.12Â Â Â SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION, MAINTENANCE AND PROCEDURES.
1.Â Â Â In furtherance of the Companyâ€™s execution of contracts with public utility
companies or any other owner or lessee of any poles located within or without
the City to whatever extent such contract or contracts may be expedient and of
advantage to the Company for use of poles and posts necessary for proper
installation of the system, the Company may obtain right-of-way permits from
appropriate State, County and Federal officials necessary to cross highways or
roads under their respective jurisdictions, to supply main trunk lines from the
Companyâ€™s receiving antennas, obtain permission from the Federal Aviation
Authority to erect and maintain antennas suitable to the needs of the system
and its subscribers and obtain whatever other permits a City, County, State or
Federal agency may require. The Company shall construct its cable system using
material of good and durable quality and all work involved in the construction,
installation, maintenance and repair of the cable system shall be performed in
a safe, thorough and reliable manner. Any municipal property damaged or
destroyed shall be promptly repaired or replaced by the Company and restored to
serviceable condition.
2.Â Â Â The Companyâ€™s system, poles, wires and appurtenances shall be located,
erected and maintained so that none of its facilities shall endanger or
interfere with the lives of persons or interfere with any improvements the City
may deem proper to make or unnecessarily hinder or obstruct the free use of the
streets, alleys, bridges, easements or public property.
3.Â Â Â In the event that the City annexes further territory as authorized by the
law, the Company shall extend energized trunk cable to the remaining portions
of the City so annexed within an acceptable time thereafter, unless additional
time is granted by the Council upon request of the Company for good cause
shown. Extension of service shall not be one of the requirements as set forth
in this section.
4.Â Â Â All transmission and distribution structures, lines and equipment erected
by the Company within the City shall be so located as to cause minimum
interference with the proper use of streets, alleys and other public ways and
places, and to cause minimum interference with the rights of reasonable
convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the said streets, alleys or
other public ways and places. In the event the electrical and phone lines are
buried to the subscriberâ€™s residence, the Company shall be required to bury the
cable also.
5.Â Â Â In case of any disturbance of pavement, sidewalk, driveway, grass or other
surfacing, the Company shall, at its own cost and expense and in a manner
approved by the City, replace and restore all paving, sidewalk, driveway,
grass, shrubs, trees, fences or surface of any street or alley or other public
or private property in as good condition as before said work was commenced.
6.Â Â Â In the event that at any time during the period of the franchise the City
lawfully elects to alter or change the grade of any street, alley or other
public way, the Company, upon reasonable notice by the City, shall remove,
relay or relocate its poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and
other fixtures at its own expense.
7.Â Â Â The Company shall not place poles or other fixtures where the same will
interfere with any gas, electric or telephone fixtures, water hydrants or mains
and all such poles or other fixtures placed in any street shall be placed at
the outer edge of the sidewalk and inside the curb line, and those placed in
alleys shall be placed close to the line of the lot abutting on said alley, and
then in such manner as not to interfere with the usual travel on said streets,
alleys and public ways.
8.Â Â Â The Company shall, on the request of any person holding a building moving
permit issued by the City temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the
moving of buildings. The expense of such temporary removal, raising or lowering
of wires shall be paid by the person requesting the same and the Company shall
have the authority to require such payment in advance. The Company shall be
given no less than forty-eight (48) hoursâ€™ advance notice to arrange for such
temporary wire changes.
9.Â Â Â The Company shall have the authority to trim trees upon and overhanging
streets, alleys, sidewalks and public places of the City so as to prevent the
branches of such trees from coming in contact with the wires and cables. All
tree trimming is to be done under the direction of the City and at the expense
of the Company.
10.Â Â Â The Company shall provide, upon request and without charge, service to
any municipal buildings owned and operated by the City and to any public or
parochial elementary or secondary school. This shall mean only an energized
cable to such building. The cost of any internal wiring shall be borne by the
institution.
113.13Â Â Â LINE EXTENSIONS.
It shall be the obligation of the Company to serve all residents of the City
except to the extent that density of homes, adverse terrain or other factors
render providing service impracticable, technically infeasible or economically
noncompensatory. For purposes of determining compliance with the provisions of
this section, and to provide for a reasonable and nondiscriminatory policy
governing extensions of cable service within the City, the Company shall extend
service to new subscribers at the normal installation charge and monthly rate
for customers of that classification where there is an average of fifty-five
(55) homes per each linear mile of new cable construction. In the event that
the requirements of this section are not met, extensions of service shall be
required only on a basis which is reasonable and compensatory.
113.14Â Â Â CITY RIGHTS.
1.Â Â Â City Rules. The right is reserved by the City to adopt, in addition to the
provisions contained in this chapter and existing applicable ordinances, such
additional regulations as it shall find necessary in the exercise of its police
power; provided, that such regulations, by ordinance or otherwise, shall be
reasonable and not in conflict with the rights granted in this chapter, and
shall not be in conflict with the applicable laws of the State or the United
States.
2.Â Â Â Use of System by City. The City shall have the right, during the life of
the franchise, of maintaining upon the poles or in the underground conduits of
the Company within the City limits wire and fixtures necessary for a traffic
control system and/or a police and fire alarm system. Such wires and fixtures
shall be installed and maintained at the sole expense of the City and shall at
all times comply with all reasonable rules and regulations of the Company so
that there may be a minimum danger of contact or conflict between the wires and
fixtures of the Company and the wires and fixtures used by the City.
3.Â Â Â Emergency or Disaster. In the case of any emergency or disaster, the
Company shall, upon request of the City, make available its facilities to the
City for emergency use during the emergency or disaster period.

property of the Company caused by employees of the City in the performance of
their duties, except for damage caused to the Companyâ€™s facilities by the
negligence of the Cityâ€™s employees. The City shall not be liable for the
interruption of service by actions of City employees in the performance of
their duties, nor shall the City be liable for the failure of the Company to be
able to perform normal services due to acts of God or other factors beyond the
control of the City.
5.Â Â Â No Property Right. Nothing in this chapter shall grant to the Company any
right of property in the City-owned property, nor shall the City be compelled
to maintain any of its property any longer than or in any fashion other than in
the Cityâ€™s judgment, its own business or needs may require.
6.Â Â Â Construction Approval by City. Except for individual service drops, the
Company shall not erect any pole, install any underground lines or conduits,
run any line, make any attachment, nor shall any construction of any kind be
commenced without the prior approval of the director of engineering or
appropriate department of the City, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, and the City shall have and maintain the right to inspect the
construction, operation and maintenance of the system by the Company to insure
the proper performance of the terms of this chapter.
7.Â Â Â Correction of Defects. In the event the Company should violate any of the
terms of this chapter, or any of the rules and regulations as may be from time
to time lawfully adopted, the City shall immediately give to the Company thirty
(30) daysâ€™ written notice to correct such violation and in the event the
Company does not make such correction within thirty (30) days after the receipt
of such written notice, the City may make such correction itself and charge the
cost of same to the Company, and the Company shall pay such charges within
thirty (30) days after the receipt of a statement for such charge from the
City.
113.15Â Â Â PAYMENTS TO THE CITY.
The Company shall, commencing one (1) year from the date of the first service
and during each year of operation under the franchise, pay to the City three
percent (3%) of the annual gross subscriber revenues received by the Company
for basic monthly cable television services rendered to customers located
within the City. At the time of this annual payment, the Company shall furnish
the City with an operating report showing the Companyâ€™s annual gross subscriber
revenues during the preceding year and such other information as the City shall
reasonably require with respect to properties and expenses related to the
Companyâ€™s services within the City for such period. All payments as required by
the Company to the City shall be made annually and shall be due ninety (90)
days after the close of the twelve- month period.
113.16Â Â Â RATES AND CHARGES.
In consideration for services rendered to subscribers, the Company shall have
the right to charge and collect reasonable and just compensation which shall
reflect, among other things, the Companyâ€™s need to attract new capital and
provide a reasonable return on invested capital.
113.17Â Â Â RECORD KEEPING.
The Company shall keep full, true, accurate and current books of account, which
books and records and all other pertinent books, records, maps, plans,
financial statements and other like materials, shall be made available for
inspection and copying by the City upon reasonable notice and during normal
business hours.
113.18Â Â Â SERVICE PROCEDURES.
During the term of the franchise, and any renewal thereof, the Company shall

Companyâ€™s agent to receive complaints regarding quality of service, equipment
malfunctions and similar matters. Any complaints from subscribers shall be
investigated and acted upon as soon as possible, but at least within four (4)
business days of their receipt. The Company shall keep a maintenance service
log which will indicate the nature of each service complaint, the date and time
it was received, the disposition of said complaint and the time and date
thereof. This log shall be made available for periodic inspection by the City.
The Company shall by appropriate means, such as a card or brochure, as
subscribers are connected or reconnected to the system, furnish information
concerning the procedures for making inquiries and/or complaints, including the
name, address and telephone numbers of the employee or employees or agent to
whom such inquiries or complaints are to be addressed.
113.19Â Â Â PROTECTION OF PRIVACY.
The Company shall not permit the transmission of any signal, aural, visual or
digital, including â€œpollingâ€ the channel selection, from any subscriberâ€™s
premises without first obtaining written permission of the subscriber. This
provision is not intended to prohibit the use of transmission signals useful
only for the control or measurement of system performance. The Company shall
not permit the installation of any special terminal equipment in any
subscriberâ€™s premises that will permit transmission from subscriberâ€™s premises
of two-way services utilizing aural, visual or digital signals without first
obtaining written permission of the subscriber. It is unlawful for any person
to attach or affix or cause to be attached or affixed any equipment or device
which allows access or use of the cable television service without payment to
the Company for same. Such action shall be a simple misdemeanor.
113.20Â Â Â PROGRAM CONTENT RESTRICTIONS.
In addition to providing basic cable television service consisting of
broadcast, locally originated, access and automated signals, the Company may
offer subscribers optional services on a per-program or per-channel basis.
However, the Company shall not display X- rated motion pictures either as part
of its basic cable or pay cable services.
113.21Â Â Â DISCRIMINATION PROHIBITED.
The Company shall not refuse to hire or discharge from employment, or

privileges of employment because of sex, age, race, color, creed or national
origin. The Company shall take affirmative action to insure that employees are
treated, during employment, without regard to their sex, age, race, color,
creed or national origin.
113.22Â Â Â LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION.
The Company shall indemnify the City and hold it harmless from all liability,
damage, cost or expense arising from claims of injury to persons or damage to
property occasioned by reason of any conduct undertaken pursuant to this
chapter. The City shall notify the Companyâ€™s representative within fifteen (15)
days after the presentation of any claim or demand to the City, either by suit,

date of the ordinance codified by this chapter, post a performance bond with
the City, written by an approved corporate surety in the amount of five
thousand dollars ($5,000.00) and in a form satisfactory to the City
guaranteeing the Companyâ€™s continued operation of the cable television system
within the City and Company shall well and truly observe, fulfill and perform
each term and condition of the bond. All damages which may be directly
occasioned by the failure of the Company to perform under the chapter, up to
the principal amount of the bond, shall be recoverable from the principals and
sureties of said bond by the City.
5.Â Â Â If the Company should commit a minor breach of this chapter and not remedy
such breach within thirty (30) days after having received written notice from
the City to do so, then the City, at its discretion, may declare a portion of
the bond equivalent to the amount of damages sustained by the City which are
directly attributable to such breach forfeited and Company shall thereupon be
required:

Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Within thirty (30) days of such forfeiture replace the forfeited
portion of the bond. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this
subsection shall serve to absolve the Company of any of its obligations under
this chapter or the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications
Commission.
6.Â Â Â The Company shall pay all premiums chargeable for the bond and shall keep
the same in full force and effect at all times throughout the term of the
ordinance codified by this chapter and during removal of all poles, wires,
cables, underground conduit, manholes and other conductors, converters,
equipment and fixtures subsequent to the termination of the ordinance codified
in this chapter. The bond shall contain a provision that it shall not be
terminated or otherwise allowed to expire prior to sixty (60) days after
written notice to that effect is given to the Clerk or similar official of the
City.
7.Â Â Â All insurance policies and bonds as are required of the Company in the
regulatory ordinance codified in this chapter shall be written by a company or
companies authorized and qualified to do business in the State. Certificates of

Commission such request, petition or other application as is then proper to
secure from said Federal Communications Commission and all necessary permits,
licenses, waivers or the like as may be necessary to be secured from said
Federal Communications Commission to fully comply with the terms of this
chapter. The Company shall thereafter diligently pursue such application with
the Federal Communications Commission and shall do all reasonable things
necessary and proper to secure any such permit, license, waiver, approval or
the like from it. The Company shall keep the City advised, from time to time,
of the progress of such application.

Should the Company, its successors or assigns violate any of the provisions of
this chapter or any reasonable rules and regulations established by the City

the franchise and the termination of all rights hereunder; provided, however,
any delay in correcting such violation which is caused by factors beyond the

Â 
155.01Â Â Â PURPOSE AND RULE OF INTERPRETATION.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish uniform rules and controls to
ensure public safety and provide efficient delivery of services by the City and
others wishing to utilize streets and other public property for the delivery of
utility or other services, in order to protect public and private investment,
ensure orderly use of public property and ensure the health, safety and welfare
of the population, to provide for the regulation and administration of the
public streets and other public property and secure the rights of the City to a
return on its investment in public property. This chapter is to be interpreted
in light of these findings for the benefit of the public and users of the
streets and other public property.
155.02Â Â Â FRANCHISE, LICENSE OR LEASE REQUIRED.
No person or other entity shall use the public right-of-way or other public
property without first obtaining a franchise, license or lease from the City.
The City shall not enter into or issue any franchise, license or lease that
grants exclusive rights. An application for a license or lease shall be filed
with the Clerk on a form provided by the City â€   and shall include as a minimum
the following information: the name, address and telephone number of the
applicant; the name, address and telephone number of a person whom the City may
notify or contact at any time concerning the license or lease; an engineering
site plan showing the proposed location of the facilities including any
manholes, the size, type and proposed depth of any conduit or other enclosures;
and any additional information the City may require. All licenses or leases
required by this section shall be granted by the Council.
Â 
Notes
â€â€ Â EDITORâ€™S NOTE: See Appendix to this Code of Ordinances for form of
  application.
155.03Â Â Â FEES REQUIRED.
No franchise, license or lease for the use of public right-of-way or other
public property shall be granted without requiring the grantee thereof to pay a
reasonable and competitively neutral fee for the use of public right-of-way or
other public property. The fees will be as follows:
1.Â Â Â All new franchises shall be assessed a franchise fee of up to five percent
(5%) of the gross receipts of customers within the City limits.
2.Â Â Â A license or lease fee will be assessed on all new licenses or leases for
space in the right-of-way. This license or lease fee is a one- time fee for the
term of the license or lease. Payment is expected when the license or lease is
signed; however, a payment schedule may be entered into between the City and
the licensee or lessee. Any payment schedule must require full payment of the
fee by the end of the fifth year of the license or lease. If the license or
lease is renewed, a new license or lease fee will be assessed. The fee shall be
based on actual administrative cost to the City for processing application and
issuance of any license or lease and is established as follows:
NEW LICENSE OR LEASE FEE
$250.00 per application filed
$250.00 per license or lease issued
In addition to the license or lease fee, an annual right-of-way management fee
will be assessed on July 1 of each year that the license or lease is in force.
The fee is based on the number of linear feet of wire laid in the City right-
of-way, and reflects the actual management cost the City incurs while managing
the right-of-way. The fee is established as follows:
RIGHT-OF-WAY MANAGEMENT FEES
Buried Lines
All Carriers
$0.30 per linear foot
Non-buried Lines
Telephone Service Only
All Carriers
$2.00 per pole
Electronic Network Services
All Carriers
$3.25 per pole
CATV Service Only
All Carriers
$4.50 per pole
In addition to the license or lease fee and annual management fee, any person
or other entity shall pay a fee every time their facility requires excavation
in the right-of-way. This fee will cover costs for street degradation and
replacement, inspection and obstruction and routing of pedestrian and vehicle
traffic. The fee schedule is established as follows:
EXCAVATION FEES
All Surfaces
$100.00 excavation permit fee
Non-surfaced Right-of-way
$0.50 per linear foot of open trench
Surfaced Right-of-way
Roads, Highways and Streets
$14.00 per square yard of asphaltic surface
Curbs and Gutters
$16.00 per linear foot of concrete surface
Sidewalks
$8.00 per linear foot of concrete surface
All or part of this fee may be waived if work is done in conjunction with City
construction.
155.04Â Â Â LIMIT ON TERM.
No franchise, license or lease for use of the public right-of-way or other
public property shall be granted for a term in excess of twenty-five (25)
years.
155.05Â Â Â PLACEMENT OF FACILITIES.
The facilities, fixtures and equipment of the distribution, transmission or
sale of any utility services, or services provided under license or lease or
easement, shall be placed and maintained so as not to unnecessarily or
unreasonably interfere with the travel on the streets, highways, avenues,
alleys, bridges and public places in the City, nor shall such facilities,
fixtures and equipment interfere with the proper use of the same, including,
but not limited to, ordinary drainage, or the functioning of the sewers,
underground pipe or other property of the City. In the event that facilities,
fixtures and equipment of any person or other entity located within a public
right-of-way must be relocated because of paving, road construction or road
reconstruction, sewer construction or sewer reconstruction or the construction
or reconstruction of public drainage systems or similar public works or the
construction or reconstruction of the facilities of any City-owned utility,
such relocation, at the written request of the City, shall be completed by the
owner of such facilities at the ownerâ€™s cost. The City shall upon request of
any person or other entity holding a franchise, license or lease, review any
plans for the construction of facilities, fixtures and equipment within the
public right-of-way and advise the person or other entity of any conflict such
construction may have with planned or anticipated public improvements, but
failure of the City to so advise such person or other entity will not relieve
the owner of such facilities of its obligations under this chapter.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Council may require placement of equipment
or facilities belonging to any holder of a franchise, license or lease be
limited to locations designated by the Council if such limitation is deemed by
the Council to be necessary to protect the integrity of use of present and
future users of the public right-of-way or other public property.
155.06Â Â Â INDEMNIFICATION AND BOND.
The holder of any franchise, license or lease shall indemnify and hold the City
harmless at all times during the term of the franchise, license or lease from
and against all claims for injury or damage to any person or property,
including payments under workerâ€™s compensation laws, caused by the
construction, erection, operation or maintenance of its facilities, fixtures or
equipment, or the negligence of its contractors or its employees. In case of
any suit or action at law being commenced against the City, upon any claim for
damage arising out of any loss, injury or damage claimed to have been caused by
any installation, improvement, obstruction or excavation made or left in, under
or upon such street, sidewalk, alley or public place by the holder of a
franchise, license or lease, its agents, contractors or employees, upon being
notified in writing by the City of such action or proceeding, the holder of
said franchise, license or lease shall appear and make proper defense thereto
at the expense of the holder of the franchise, license or lease; and if any
judgment or decree shall in any such case be rendered against the City therein,
the holder of said franchise, license or lease shall assume, pay and satisfy
such judgment or decree, with the cost thereof. Immediately upon issuance of
the franchise, license or lease, the holder of the franchise, license or lease
shall purchase general liability insurance. The amount of insurance shall be a
minimum of $1,000,000 with a maximum deductible of $5,000. The holder of the
franchise, license or lease shall file with the Clerk a certificate of
insurance which clearly discloses on its face coverage in conformity with these
requirements. Upon request of the City, the holder of the franchise, license or
lease shall submit a certified copy of the policy.
155.07Â Â Â REGULATION BY THE CITY.
The City reserves the right to make reasonable general regulations for the use
of streets and other public property which unless otherwise specifically
provided shall apply to any holder of a franchise, license or lease.
155.08Â Â Â CONSTRUCTION AND EXCAVATION BY HOLDERS.
A written permit will be obtained from the Clerk whenever it becomes necessary
for the holder of any franchise, license or lease to excavate in streets or
public grounds of the City. Such permits shall state a particular part or point
of the street where the excavation is to be made and the length of time in
which such permit shall authorize the work to be done. An exception to a
requirement for a permit shall be made in cases of emergency involving public
safety, in which case a permit will be obtained at the earliest opportunity
after the work has started. In making excavations in the streets, the holder of
any franchise, license or lease shall proceed with such work as to cause the
least possible inconvenience to the public. The holder of any franchise,
license or lease shall properly protect, according to safety standards
generally accepted at the time of placement as may be determined from time to
time by the Street Superintendent, all excavations and obstructions by proper
placement of shoring, surface plates, barricades, warning lights and such other
or additional devices as circumstances may warrant. If in the opinion of the
Street Superintendent such excavation or obstruction is not properly and safely
protected, the Street Superintendent shall notify such holder of a franchise,
license or lease, who shall immediately comply with such reasonable
instructions. Immediately after use, any trenches for excavations which the
holder of a franchise, license or lease has opened shall be filled. However, no
trench or excavation in the streets shall be filled or covered without giving
the City the right to inspect the same. All backfilling in streets will be
according to City specifications. Temporary street surfacing will be placed in
such excavations as soon as the same has been backfilled. Pavements, sidewalks,
curbs and gutters or other portions of streets and public places opened,
disturbed or damaged shall be promptly restored and replaced with like
materials at the expense of the holder of a franchise, license or lease and
left in as good condition as before the opening, disturbance or damage
occurred. In the event like replacement materials are not available, the holder
of the franchise, license or lease shall notify the Street Superintendent, who
must approve the use of any alternate materials. In the event that the holder
of a franchise, license or lease fails to comply with the provision of this
section, after having been given reasonable notice, the City may do such work
as may be needed to properly repair such pavements, sidewalks, curbs and
gutters or other portions of streets and public places and the cost thereof
shall be repaired to the City by the holder of the franchise, license or lease.
In cases where a cut or disturbance is made in a section of street paving or
sidewalks, but causes greater disturbance than to just the area cut, rather
than replace only the area cut, the holder of a franchise, license or lease
shall replace that area as may be ordered by the Street Superintendent, which
in no event shall exceed the panel or panels disturbed.
155.09Â Â Â CITY CONSTRUCTION AND PAVING.
Whenever the City shall pave or repave any street or shall change the grade
line of any street or public place or shall construct or reconstruct any
conduit, water main service or water connection, sewer or other City-owned
public works or City-owned utility, it shall be the duty of the holder of any
franchise, license or lease, when so ordered by the City, to relocate its
service lines and other property in the streets or other public places at its
own expense so as to conform to the established grade or line of such street or
public place and so as not to interfere with the public improvements so
constructed or reconstructed. In the case of other public improvements,
including but not limited to urban renewal projects, the City may require the
holder of a franchise, license or lease to relocate its poles, service lines
and appurtenances in the streets at the ownerâ€™s expense. The City may at its
discretion assign personnel for inspection of excavation and related work being
performed by the holder of a franchise, license or lease. Should the holder of
the franchise, license or lease fail or refuse to do and perform the things
provided in this section, the City may, after reasonable notice, perform the
work and charge the expense thereof to the holder of the franchise, license or
lease and the holder of the franchise, license or lease shall promptly pay said
charges.
155.10Â Â Â DESIGN NOTICE TO CITY.
The holder of a franchise, license or lease shall promptly, upon request,
furnish the Council a detailed map or maps of its distribution system both
within the City limits and the area within two miles surrounding the City
unless that area is within another City. The holder of a franchise, license or
lease shall thereafter update the map or maps at least annually or upon
request, showing all subsequent additions or deletions to the distribution
system. Prior to any excavation by the City or its agents, a representative
must contact the holder of any franchise, license or lease regarding current
information on the location of underground lines or facilities in the area
concerned. The obligation to contact the holder of a franchise, license or
lease under this section shall be satisfied if contact is made with the
corporation organized pursuant to Code of Iowa Chapter 480 or an entity with a
similar function utilized by both the City and the company, currently the Iowa
One Call System.
155.11Â Â Â ABOVE-GROUND CABLES, WIRES, CONDUITS AND POLES.
All cables, wires, and conduits shall be placed underground except where above-
ground connection to buildings or other locations above ground are reasonably
necessary. Such above-ground connection shall be by means of poles located, as
far as reasonably practical, within alleys. No such poles shall be installed or
erected until the Council has approved the proposed location, construction and
pole heights.
155.12Â Â Â ASSIGNMENT.
No sale or assignment of any franchise, license or lease of the use of the
public right-of-way or other public property shall be effective until it is
approved by the Council and until the holder thereof has filed in the office of
the Clerk written notice of the proposed sale, transfer, disposition or
assignment, such notice to clearly summarize the proposed procedure and the
terms and conditions thereof. Such approval by the City shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The proposed vendee, assignee or lessee shall similarly
file an instrument, duly executed, reciting such proposal, accepting the terms
of the franchise, license or lease and agreeing to perform all of the
conditions thereof.
155.13Â Â Â FORFEITURE.
The violation of any material portion of a franchise, license or lease by the
holder thereof or its successors or assigns or its failure promptly to perform
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be cause for forfeiture of said
franchise, license or lease and the termination of all rights thereunder. Such
forfeiture shall be accomplished by ordinance of the City after written notice
to the holder thereof and a continuation of the violation, failure or default
specified on the notice for at least thirty (30) days from the date the notice
was served.
155.14Â Â Â APPLICATION.
This chapter shall apply to all franchises, licenses or leases and easements
granted by the City, including all existing franchises, licenses or leases and
easements.
155.15Â Â Â HOME RULE.
This chapter is intended to be and shall be construed as consistent with the
reservation of local authority contained in the 25th Amendment to the Iowa
Constitution granting cities Home Rule powers. To such end, any limitation on
the power of the City contained herein is to be strictly construed and the City
reserves to itself the right to exercise all power and authority to regulate
and control its local affairs and all ordinances and regulations of the City
shall be enforceable against the holder of any franchise, license or lease.
155.16Â Â Â NEW TECHNOLOGIES.
Should, within the term of any franchise, license or lease, developments within
the field for which the grant was made offer to the holder thereof the
opportunity to effectively, efficiently and economically serve its customers
through use of a substance or material other than those for which the grant was
originally made, then the holder of the franchise, license or lease may
petition the Council, which, with such requirements or limitation as it deems
necessary to protect public health, safety and welfare, may allow the use of
such substances under the terms and conditions of the franchise, license or
lease.

160.02Â Â Â STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSE.
1.Â Â Â The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 414, Code of Iowa, as
amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure
safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
2.Â Â Â Findings of Fact.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation
which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of
the community.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by:
(i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
3.Â Â Â Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Paragraph 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows so
that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03Â Â Â GENMERAL PROVISIONS.
1.Â Â Â Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter shall apply
to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City which are located within the
boundaries of the Floodplain (Overlay) District as established in Section
160.05 of this chapter.
2.Â Â Â Establishment of Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM) for Jones County and Incorporated Areas, City of Wyoming, Panels
19105C0259F, 0267F, 0278F, and 0286F dated November 19, 2021, which were
prepared as part of the Flood Insurance Study for Jones County, is (are) hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be the Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The
Jones County Flood Insurance Study is hereby adopted by reference and is made a
part of this chapter for the purpose of administering floodplain management
regulations.
3.Â Â Â Rules for Interpretation of District Boundaries. The boundaries of the
zoning district areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the official
Flood Insurance Rate Map. When an interpretation is needed as to the exact
location of a boundary, the Administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it
is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
4.Â Â Â Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure
shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
5.Â Â Â Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provision of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with
this chapter are hereby repealed to the extend of the inconsistency only.
6.Â Â Â Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
7.Â Â Â Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated Floodplain (Overlay) District areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create
liability on the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
8.Â Â Â Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.

the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to
make such determination.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All development shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the base flood elevation. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundation) may be allowed, subject to favorable
consideration by the Board of Adjustment, where existing topography, street
grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods
used must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various
forces and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential structures
located in areas that would become isolated due to flooding of surrounding
ground shall be provided with a means of access that will be passable by
wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this criterion shall not apply
where the Administrator determines there is sufficient flood warning time for
the protection of life and property. When estimating flood warning time,
consideration shall be given to the criteria listed in 567.75.2(3), Iowa
Administrative Code.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level. When
floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State of
Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and
other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the
base flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â A minimum of two openings, with positioning on at least two
walls, having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access and
low damage potential storage. Where the distance between the floor and ceiling
of the fully enclosed area below the â€œlowest floorâ€ is five (5) feet or more,
the applicant shall be required to sign and record with the Jones County
Recorder a Non-Conversion Agreement that ensures the lower enclosed area
remains compliant with the criteria outlined in this subsection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
electric meter, electrical service panel box, hot water heater, heating, air
conditioning, ventilation equipment (including ductwork), and other similar
machinery and equipment elevated (or in the case on non- residential
structures, optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one (1) foot above the
base flood elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
plumbing, gas lines water/gas meters and other similar service utilities either
elevated (or in the case of non-residential structures, optionally floodproofed
to) a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation or designed to be
watertight and withstand inundation to such a level.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Factory-Built Homes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the structure
is a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivision, shall be
anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Anchorage systems
may include, but are not limited to, use of over- the-top or frame ties to
ground anchors as required by the State Building Code.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Utility and Sanitary Systems.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located or
designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system as well
as the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment facilities
(other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood protection
equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â New or replacement water supply systems hall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water
supply treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with
a level of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood
elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Storage of Equipment and Materials. Storage of equipment and materials
that are flammable, explosive, or injurious to human, animal, or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or:
(i) not subject to major flood damage and anchored to prevent movement due to
flood waters; or (ii) readily removable from the area within the time available
after flood warning.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as
levees, flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the base
flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for
adequate interior drainage. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources
shall approve structural flood control works.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must be
designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources must
approve such alterations or relocations.

subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the base flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50 lots
(whichever is less) shall include base flood elevation data for those areas
located within the Floodplain (Overlay) District.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Accessory Structures to Residential Uses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Detached garages, sheds, and similar structures that are incidental
to a residential use are required to comply with the elevations requirements
outlined in Section
160.06(2)(C).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Exemption from the base flood elevation requirements for such a
structure may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of
the structure and its contents.
Â Â Â L.Â Â Â Recreational Vehicles. Recreational vehicles are exempt from the
requirements of Paragraph E of this subsection regarding anchoring and
elevation of factory-built homes when the following criteria are satisfied.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less than
180 consecutive days, and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The recreational vehicle mut be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than 180
consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements of
Paragraph E of this subsection regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-
built homes.
Â Â Â M.Â Â Â Pipeline Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossing shall be buried
in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent
rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
Â Â Â N.Â Â Â Maximum Damage Potential Development. All new or substantially improved
maximum damage potential development shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the elevation of the 500-
year flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be
floodproofed to such a level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional
engineer registered in the State of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing
methods used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities,
impact and uplift forces and other factors associated with the 0.2% annual
chance flood; and that the structure, below the 0.2% annual chance flood
elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water. A record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in
relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator. Where 0.2% change flood
elevation data has not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The
applicant will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources
with sufficient technical information to make such determinations.
160.07Â Â Â ESTABLISHMENT OF APPEAL AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide: (i) appeals; and (ii) request
for variances to the provisions of this chapter, and shall take any other
action which is required of the Board.
1.Â Â Â Appeals. Where it is alleged there is any error in any order, requirement,
decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the
enforcement of this chapter, the aggrieved party may appeal such action. The
notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board and with the official from whom
the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason for the appeal. The
official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to the Board all the
documents constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was
taken.
2.Â Â Â Variance. The Board may authorize upon request in specific cases such
variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variance
granted must meet the following applicable standards.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection
for structures than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the applicant
shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator that: (i)
the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage;
and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
3.Â Â Â Hearings and Decisions of The Board.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Hearings. Upon the filing with the Board of an appeal or a request for
a variance, the Board shall hold a public hearing. The Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the hearing and give public notice thereof, as well as due
notice to parties in interest. At the hearing, any party may appear in person
or by agent or attorney and present written or oral evidence. The Board may
require the appellant or applicant to provide such information as is reasonably
deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or evaluation of
a professional engineer or other expert person or agency, including the
Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal or
variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an appeal, the Board may, so
long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter,
reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in
writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision.
In granting a variance, the Board shall consider such factors as contained in
this section and all other relevant sections of this chapter and may prescribe
such conditions as contained in Subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board Shall Be Based. In
passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all relevant
factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability
of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the City.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â h.Â Â Â The compatibility of the proposed use with the existing
development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â i.Â Â Â The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for the area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â j.Â Â Â The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â k.Â Â Â The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â l.Â Â Â The cost of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer,
gas, electrical, and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â m.Â Â Â Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances
as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such conditions
may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.

restrictions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Floodproofing measure shall be designed consistent with the flood
protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration, rate
of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated with
the regulatory flood. The Board shall require that the applicant submit a plan
or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
4.Â Â Â Appeals to the Court. Any person or persons, jointly or severally,
aggrieved by any decision of the Board may present to a court of record a
petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole
or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be
presented to the court within thirty days after the filing of the decision in
the office of the Board.
160.08Â Â Â NONCONFORMING USES.
A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before the
passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but which is
not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be continued subject
to the following conditions:
1.Â Â Â If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any future use of
the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
2.Â Â Â Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
3.Â Â Â If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means, including
flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50 percent of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless it is
reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
State or local health, sanitary, building or safety codes or regulations or the
cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
designation.
Except as provided in Subsection 2 of this section, any use which has been
permitted as a variance shall be considered a conforming use.
160.09Â Â Â PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS.
Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with grants of variances) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any
person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its
requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $500.00 or
imprisoned for not more than 30 days. Each day such violation continues shall
be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained prevent the City

(20) or less than seven (7) days before the hearing in a newspaper of general

reasonable, return if permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by
the regulations in that zone; (b) the plight of the owner is due to unique

power or authority to permit a use not generally permitted in the district

review such decision of the Board of Adjustment and shall prescribe therein the
time within which a return thereto must be made and served, which shall not be
less than ten (10) days and may be extended by the court. The allowance of the

The subdivider shall prepare a preliminary plat in accordance with the
provisions of Section
166.04 and shall file with the Clerk an application in triplicate for the
tentative approval of the plat. The application shall:
1.Â Â Â Forms and Fees. Be made on forms available from the Clerk together with a
fee of ten dollars ($10.00) per lot.
2.Â Â Â Number of Plats. Be accompanied by a minimum of ten (10) copies of the
preliminary plat.
3.Â Â Â Time of Submission. Be presented to the Clerk at least four (4) weeks
prior to the regular meeting of the Commission.
166.06Â Â Â REFERRAL OF PRELIMINARY PLAT.
The Clerk shall immediately refer two (2) copies of the preliminary plat to the
City Engineer and seven (7) copies to the Commission. In the case of a
subdivision outside the corporate limits of the City, the Clerk shall refer one
copy of the preliminary plat to the County Board of Supervisors.
166.07Â Â Â REVIEW OF PRELIMINARY PLAT.
The preliminary plat shall be reviewed by the Commission to determine its
conformity with these regulations and all other ordinances and regulations in
force affecting subdivisions. Copies of the preliminary plat may be transmitted
to other City or school officials, as the Commission deems necessary, for their
recommendations concerning matters within their jurisdiction. Their
recommendations, along with those of the City Engineer shall be transmitted to
the Commission within three (3) weeks from the date the plat is filed. The
Commission may confer with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the
kind and extent of such improvements to be made.
166.08Â Â Â ACTION BY THE COMMISSION.
The Commission shall, as soon as possible, but not more than thirty (30) days
thereafter, pass upon the preliminary plat as originally submitted or modified.
If the Commission does not act within thirty (30) days, the preliminary plat
shall be deemed to be approved; provided, however, the subdivider may agree to
an extension of the time period not to exceed an additional sixty (60) days. It
shall then set forth its recommendations in writing, whether of approval,
modification or disapproval.
1.Â Â Â Reasons for Changes or Disapproval. In the event that substantial changes
or modifications are made by the Commission or the Commission recommends
disapproval of the plat, it shall give its reasons therefor and it may request
and cause the revised preliminary plat to be re-submitted in the same manner as
the original plat.
2.Â Â Â Tentative Approval. If the Commission recommends approval, it shall
express its approval as â€œTentative Approvalâ€ and state the conditions of such
approval, if any.
3.Â Â Â Documenting Approval. The action of the Commission shall be documented on
seven (7) copies of the preliminary plat, referenced and attached to any
conditions determined. One copy shall be returned to the subdivider, one copy
shall be retained by the Commission, and five (5) copies shall be referred to
the Council.
166.09Â Â Â ACTION BY COUNCIL.
Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the preliminary plat, the Council
shall, by resolution, tentatively approve or disapprove the plat. If the
preliminary plat is disapproved, objections to it shall be returned to the
Commission for further review and the Clerk shall notify the subdivider of such
action. If approved, the Clerk shall affix his or her signature to five (5)
copies of the preliminary plat with the notation of the date the preliminary
plat received the Councilâ€™s tentative approval. One copy shall be returned to
the Commission and three (3) copies shall be returned to the subdivider. The
â€œTentative Approvalâ€ by the Council shall not constitute final acceptance of
the addition or subdivision by the City but an authorization to proceed with
preparation of the final plat.
166.10Â Â Â EFFECTIVE PERIOD OF TENTATIVE APPROVAL.
The tentative approval of a preliminary plat shall be effective for a period of
one year at the end of which time final approval must have been obtained. Any
plat not receiving final approval within this period of time shall be void, and
the subdivider shall be required to resubmit a new plat for tentative approval
subject to all new zoning restrictions and subdivision regulations.
166.11Â Â Â COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Before the Council will approve the final plat, all of the required
improvements shall be constructed and accepted by formal resolution of the
Council. Before passage of said resolution of acceptance, the City Engineer
shall report that said improvements meet all City specifications and ordinances
or other City requirements, and the agreements between the subdivider and the
City.
166.12Â Â Â PERFORMANCE BOND.
The completion requirement for improvements may be waived in whole or in part
if the subdivider will post a performance bond with the Council guaranteeing
that improvements not completed will be constructed within a period of one year
from final acceptance of the plat; but final acceptance of the plat will not
constitute final acceptance by the City of any improvements to be constructed.
Improvements will be accepted only after their construction has been completed.
Such performance bond shall be satisfactory to the City Attorney as to form,
sufficiency, and manner of execution. Upon recommendation of the Commission,
the Council may extend the completion date set forth in the bond for a maximum
period of one additional year.
166.13Â Â Â FINAL PLAT.
The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as approved,
and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that portion of the
approved preliminary plat which the subdivider proposes to record and develop
at the time, provided, however, that such portion conforms to all requirements
of these regulations.
166.14Â Â Â REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINAL PLAT.
The following graphic and descriptive material is required to be provided on
the final plat and in the accompanying material.

subdivided, each sheet shall display both the number of the sheet and the total
number of sheets included in the plat, as well as clearly labeled match lines
indicating where the other sheets adjoin. An index sheet shall be provided to
show the relationship between the sheets.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â A maximum scale of one hundred (100) feet to one inch shall be used.
The scale used shall be clearly stated and graphically illustrated by a bar
scale drawn on every sheet showing any portion of the lands subdivided.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Subdivisions shall be designated, by name or as otherwise prescribed,

Â Â Â J.Â Â Â The course of every boundary line shown on the plat shall be indicated
by a direct bearing reference or by an angle between the boundary line and an
intersecting line having a shown bearing, except when the boundary line has an
irregular or constantly changing course, as along a body of water, or when a
description of the boundary line is better achieved by measurements shown at
points or intervals along a meander line having a shown course. All bearings
and angles shown shall be given to at least the nearest minute of arc.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Curve data shall be stated in terms of radius, central angle, and
tangent, or length of curve. In all cases, the curve data must be shown for the
line affected.
Â Â Â L.Â Â Â The minimum unadjusted acceptable error of closure for all subdivision
boundaries shall be 1:10,000 and shall be 1:5,000 for any individual lot.
Â Â Â M.Â Â Â When any lot or portion of the subdivision is bounded by an irregular
line, the major portion of that lot or subdivision shall be enclosed by a
meander line showing complete data with distances along all lines extending
beyond the enclosure to the irregular boundary shown with as much certainty as
can be determined or as â€œmore or less,â€ if variable. In all cases, the true
boundary shall be clearly indicated on the plat.
Â Â Â N.Â Â Â All interior excepted parcels shall be clearly indicated and labeled,
Not a Part of This Plat.
Â Â Â O.Â Â Â All adjoining properties shall be identified, and where such adjoining
properties are a part of a recorded subdivision, the name of that subdivision
shall be shown. If the subdivision platted is a resubdivision of a part or the
whole of a previously recorded subdivision, sufficient ties shall be shown to
controlling lines appearing on the earlier plat to permit an overlay to be
made. Re- subdivisions shall be labeled as such in a subtitle following the
name of the subdivision wherever the name appears on the plat.
Â Â Â P.Â Â Â The purpose of any easement shown on the plat shall be clearly stated
and shall be confined to only those easements pertaining to public utilities
including gas, power, telephone, water, sewer, and such drainage easements as
are deemed necessary for the orderly development of the land encompassed within
the plat.
Â Â Â Q.Â Â Â A strip of land shall not be reserved by the subdivider unless the land
is of sufficient size and shape to be of some practical use or service as
determined by the Council.
Â Â Â R.Â Â Â The purpose of all areas dedicated to the public must be clearly

The Commission shall, upon receiving the final plat, as soon as possible, but
not more than thirty (30) days thereafter, consider the final plat, and if the
same is recommended for approval, shall submit its recommendation of approval
to the Council together with a certified copy of its resolution showing the
action of the Commission. If the Commission recommends approval of the final
plat, such approval and the date thereof shall be noted on the plat over the
signature of both the Chairperson and Secretary of the Commission and the plat
and five (5) copies shall be transmitted to the Council, and one copy shall be
returned to the subdivider.
166.18Â Â Â ACTION BY THE COUNCIL.
Upon receipt of the certification by the Commission, the Council shall, within
sixty (60) days, either approve or disapprove the final plat.
1.Â Â Â Disapproval of Plat. In the event that said plat is disapproved by the
Council, such disapproval shall be expressed in writing and shall point out
wherein said proposed plat is objectionable.
2.Â Â Â Acceptance of Plat. In the event that said plat is found to be acceptable
and in accordance with these regulations, the Council shall accept same.
3.Â Â Â Final Approval and Recording of Plat. The passage of a resolution by the
Council accepting the plat shall constitute final approval of the platting of
the area shown on the final plat, but the subdivider or owner shall cause such
plat to be recorded in the office of the County Recorder of the County where
the land to be subdivided is located, and shall file satisfactory evidence of
such recording in the office of the Clerk before the City shall recognize the
plat as being in full force and effect.
166.19Â Â Â RESUBDIVISION OF LAND.
The following requirements shall govern the resubdividing of land.
1.Â Â Â Procedure for Resubdividing. For any change in a map of an approved or
recorded subdivision plat, if such change affects any street layout shown on
such map, or area reserved for public use indicated on the map, or any lot
line, or if it affects any map or plan legally established prior to the
adoption of any regulations controlling subdivisions, such parcel shall be
approved by the same procedure, rules, and regulations as for a subdivision.
2.Â Â Â Acreage Lots. Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision
plat shows one or more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are
indications that such lots will eventually be resubdivided into smaller
building sites, the Commission and Council may require that such parcel of land
allow for future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent
streets. Easements providing for the future opening and extension of such
streets may be made a requirement of the plat.
166.20Â Â Â COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Before the final plat is approved by the Council, all applicants shall be
required to complete, in accordance with the Councilâ€™s decision and to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer, all the street, sanitary, and other
improvements as required in these regulations, specified in the preliminary
plat, and as approved by the Council, and to dedicate same to the City, free
and clear of all liens and encumbrances on the property and public improvements
thus dedicated.
166.21Â Â Â PERFORMANCE BOND.
The Council in its discretion may waive the requirement that the applicant
complete and dedicate all public improvements prior to approving the final
plat, and that, as an alternative, the applicant post a bond at the time of
application for final plat approval in an amount estimated by the Council as
sufficient to secure to the City the satisfactory construction, installation,
and dedication of the uncompleted portion of required improvements. In
addition:
1.Â Â Â Approved by City Attorney. Such performance bond shall comply with all
statutory requirements and shall be satisfactory to the City Attorney as to
form, sufficiency, and manner of execution as set forth in these regulations.
2.Â Â Â Completion Period. The period within which required improvements must be
completed shall be specified by the Council in the resolution approving the
final plat shall be incorporated in the bond, and shall not exceed one year
from date of final approval.
3.Â Â Â Extension of Completion Period. The performance bond shall be approved by
the Council as to the amount and surety and conditions satisfactory to the
Council. The Commission may, upon proof of difficulty, recommend to the Council
extension of the completion date set forth in such bond for a maximum period of
one additional year. The Council may at any time during the period of such bond
accept a substitution of principal or sureties on the bond.
4.Â Â Â Temporary Improvements. The applicant shall build and pay for all costs of
temporary improvements required by the Council and shall maintain same for the
period specified by the Council. Prior to construction of any temporary
facility or improvement, the developer shall file with the City a separate
suitable bond for temporary facilities, which bond shall insure that the
temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained and removed.
5.Â Â Â Failure to Complete Improvement. For subdivisions for which no performance
bond has been posted, if the improvements are not completed within the period
specified by the Council in the resolution approving the plat, the approval
shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases where a performance bond has
been posted and required improvements have not been installed within the terms
of such performance bond, the City may declare the bond to be in default and
require that all the improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the
building development at the time the bond is declared to be in default.
166.22Â Â Â INSPECTION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
The Council shall provide for inspection of required improvements during
construction and insure their satisfactory completion. The applicant shall pay
to the City an inspection fee equal to the actual cost of inspection. These
fees shall be due and payable upon demand of the City and no building permits
or certificates of occupancy shall be issued until all fees are paid. The
subdivider shall furnish the Council with a construction schedule prior to the
commencement of any and all construction, and notify the City not less than
twenty-four (24) hours in advance of readiness for required inspections.

1.Â Â Â Certificate of Satisfactory Completion. The Council will not accept
dedication of required improvements or release or reduce a performance bond
until the City Engineer has submitted a certificate stating that all required
improvements have been satisfactorily completed and until the applicantâ€™s
engineer has certified to the City through submission of detailed â€œas-builtâ€
plans of the subdivision indicating location, dimensions, materials, and other
information required by the City, that all public improvements are in
accordance with construction plans for the subdivision.
2.Â Â Â Reduction of Performance Bond. A performance bond may be reduced upon
actual dedication of public improvements and then only to the ratio that the
public improvement dedicated bears to the total public improvements for the
plat.
166.24Â Â Â MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Improvements shall be maintained and a maintenance bond provided as follows:
1.Â Â Â Maintenance of Improvements Before Acceptance. The applicant shall be
required to maintain all improvements on the individual subdivided lots and
provide for snow removal on streets and sidewalks, if required, until

body and dedication of same to the local government.
166.25Â Â Â DEFERRAL OR WAIVER OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
Required improvements may be deferred or waived as follows:
1.Â Â Â Waiver of Required Improvements. The Council may defer or waive at the
time of final approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any
or all such improvements as in its judgment are not requisite in the interests
of the public health, safety and general welfare, or which are inappropriate
because of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities.
2.Â Â Â Deferral of Required Improvements. Whenever it is deemed necessary by the
Council to defer the construction of any improvement required herein because of
incompatible grades, future planning inadequate or lack of connecting
facilities, or for other reasons, the applicant shall pay his or her share of
the costs of the future improvements to the City prior to the approval of the
final plat, or the applicant may post a bond insuring completion of said
improvements upon demand of the City.

of these regulations.
166.30Â Â Â SUBDIVISION NAME.
The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate, or too closely
approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision in the area covered
by these regulations. The Council, after consultation with the Commission,
shall have the final authority to designate the name of the subdivision, which
shall be determined at preliminary plat approval.
166.31Â Â Â MONUMENTATION.
Monuments shall be in conformance with the following requirements:
1.Â Â Â Establishment of Permanent Control Monuments. Prior to the offering of the
plat of any subdivision for record, the surveyor shall confirm the prior
establishment of permanent control monuments at each controlling corner on the
boundaries of the parcel or tract of land being subdivided. If no permanent
control monuments exist, the surveyor shall establish at least two (2)
permanent control monuments for each block created, or if the area subdivided
into lots is less than a block in size, at least two (2) permanent control
monuments shall be established for the subdivision. Permanent control monuments
shall be constructed of reasonably permanent material solidly embedded in the
ground and capable of being detected by commonly used magnetic or electronic
equipment. The surveyor shall affix a cap of reasonably inert material bearing
an embossed or stencil cut marking of the Iowa registration number of the
surveyor to the top of the monument.
2.Â Â Â Other Monuments of Record. Other monuments established prior to the
recording of the plat of the subdivision and described on the plat shall be
considered monuments of record and shall be given the same weight as original
permanent control monuments if the monuments remain undisturbed in their
original positions. The additional monuments shall be constructed and embedded
according to the provisions for permanent control monuments prescribed in
subsection 1 of this section.
3.Â Â Â Establishment and Recording of Other Monuments. Monuments other than the
permanent control monuments required in subsection 1 of this section shall not
be required to be established before the recording of the plat or the
conveyancing of lands by reference to the plat if the surveyor includes in the
certification of the plat that the additional monuments required by these
regulations shall be established before a specified future date.
4.Â Â Â Additional Monuments Required. Additional monuments shall be constructed
and embedded according to the provisions for permanent control monuments
prescribed in subsection 1 of this section, and shall be set all of the
following locations whether set prior to the recording of the plat, or
subsequent to such recording:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â At every corner and angle point of every lot, block or parcel of land
created.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â At every point of intersection of the outer boundary of the subdivision
with an existing or created right-of-way line of any street, railroad, or other
way.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â At every point of curve, tangency, reversed curve, or compounded curve
on every right-of-way line established.
5.Â Â Â Placement of Monument. When the placement of a monument required by this
chapter at the prescribed location is impractical, it is permissible to
establish a reference monument in close proximity to the prescribed location.
If the reference monument is established prior to the recording of the plat and
its location properly shown on the plat, the reference monument shall have the
same status as other monuments of record. Where any point requiring
monumentation has been previously monumented, the existence of the monument
shall be confirmed by the surveyor. The existing monument shall be considered a
monument of record when properly shown and described on the recorded plat.
166.32Â Â Â CHARACTER OF THE LAND.
Land which the City finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or development due
to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth
formations or topography, utility easements, or other features which will
reasonably be harmful to the safety, health, and general welfare of the present
or future inhabitants of the subdivision or its surrounding areas or both,
shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are formulated by
the subdivider and approved by the Council, upon recommendation of the
Commission, to solve the problems created by the unsuitable land conditions.
Such land shall be set aside for uses as shall not involve such a danger.

width to permit appropriate building setback from and orientation to both
streets.
2.Â Â Â Street Access. Each lot shall be provided with satisfactory access to a
public street.
3.Â Â Â Double Frontage and Reverse Frontage Lots. Double frontage and reverse
frontage lots shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of
residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific
disadvantages of topography and orientation. A planting screen easement of at
least ten (10) feet, and across which there shall be no right of access, shall
be provided along the line of lots abutting such a traffic artery or other
disadvantageous use.
4.Â Â Â Side Lot Lines. Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles to
straight street lines or radial to curved street lines.
5.Â Â Â Lot Drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage
away from all buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with
the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so
as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent
lots.
6.Â Â Â Building Lines. Building lines conforming with zoning standards shall be
shown on all lots within the platted area. Where the subdivided area is not
under zoning control, the Council may require building lines in accordance with
the needs of each subdivision.
166.34Â Â Â BLOCKS.
Blocks shall conform to the following requirements:
1.Â Â Â Provision for Lots. Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two
(2) tiers of lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions shall be permitted in
blocks adjacent to arterial streets, railroads, or waterways.

less than one thousand (1,000) feet in length.
4.Â Â Â Easement Reservation. In blocks over eight hundred (800) feet in length,
the Council may require the reservation of an easement to accommodate
utilities, drainage facilities, or pedestrian traffic.
5.Â Â Â Pedestrian Crosswalks. Pedestrian crosswalks, not less than ten (10) feet
wide, may be required by the Council through the center of blocks more than
eight hundred (800) feet in length. Pedestrian crosswalks shall not exceed
twelve percent (12%) in grade unless steps of an approved design are to be
constructed.
166.35Â Â Â STREETS â€“ GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
Streets shall conform with the following general requirements:
1.Â Â Â Frontage on Improved Roads. No subdivision shall be approved unless the
area to be subdivided shall have frontage on and access from an existing
street.
2.Â Â Â Grading and Improvement Plan. Streets shall be graded and improved and
conform to the City construction standards and specifications and shall be
approved as to design and specifications by the City Engineer, in accordance
with the construction plans required to be submitted.
3.Â Â Â Topography and Arrangement. Streets shall be in conformance with the
following requirements related to topography and arrangement:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography. All streets
shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as possible of the building sites at,
or above, the grades of the streets. Grades of streets shall conform as closely
as possible to the original topography. A combination of steep grades and
curves shall be avoided. Specific standards are contained in the design
standards of these regulations.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed
system of streets and dedicated right-of-way.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â All arterials shall be properly related to special traffic generators
such as industries, business districts, schools, churches, and shopping
centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and proposed
land uses.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Municipal service streets shall be laid out to conform as much as
possible to the topography to discourage use by through traffic, to permit
efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of
streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract
to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions,
or unless in the opinion of the Council such extension is not necessary or
desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the
existing layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â In business and industrial developments, the streets and other
accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings,
location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and
maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of
movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian.
4.Â Â Â Access to State or County Jurisdictional Roads. Whenever any part of a
subdivision is designed with access to a road under State or County
jurisdiction, permission for access to such roads shall be obtained from the
appropriate jurisdiction and such access shall be designed according to the
standards of the appropriate jurisdiction.
5.Â Â Â Access to Arterial Streets. Where a subdivision borders on or contains an
existing or proposed arterial street, the Council may require that lot access
to such streets be limited by one of the following means:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Lots shall be designed so as to back onto the primary arterial and
front onto a parallel municipal service street; no access shall be provided
from the arterial street, and screening shall be provided in a strip of land
along the rear property line of such lots.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A series of cul-de-sacs entered from and designed generally at right
angles to such a parallel street, with the rear lines of their terminal lots
backing onto the arterial street.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â A frontage or service road, separated from the primary arterial by a
planting or grass strip and having access thereto at suitable points.
6.Â Â Â Street Names. Streets that are in alignment with others already existing
shall bear the name of the existing streets. The proposed names of new streets
shall not duplicate or sound similar to existing street names. Street names
shall be subject to the approval of the Council and Commission.
7.Â Â Â Street Name Signs. Street name signs are to be placed at all intersections
within or abutting the subdivision, the type and location of which to be
approved by the Council. The City shall install all street name signs. The
applicant shall deposit with the City at the time of final subdivision
approval, the estimated cost of installation of each street sign required by
the Council.
8.Â Â Â Street Lights. Installation of street lights shall be required in
accordance with design and specification standards approved by the Council.
9.Â Â Â Construction of Streets and Dead-end Streets. Streets and dead- end
streets shall be in conformance with the following requirements:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Construction of Streets. The arrangement of streets shall provide for
the continuation of principal streets between adjacent properties when such
continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire
protection, and for efficient provision of utilities. If the adjacent property
is undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right-
of-way shall be extended to the property line. A temporary T- or L- shaped
turnabout shall be provided on all temporary dead-end streets, with the
notation on the subdivision plat that land outside the normal street right-of-
way shall revert to abuttors whenever the street is continued. The Council may
limit the length of temporary dead-end streets in accordance with the design
standards of these regulations.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Permanent Dead-end Streets. Where a road does not extend to the
boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by the Council
for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall normally not be nearer to
such boundary than one hundred fifty (150) feet. However, the Council may
require the reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage
facilities, pedestrian traffic, or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be
provided at the end of a permanent dead-end street in accordance with City
construction standards and specifications. For greater convenience to traffic
and more effective police and fire protection, permanent dead-end streets
shall, in general, be limited in length in accordance with the design standards
of these regulations.
166.36Â Â Â STREETS â€“ DESIGN STANDARDS.
The following design standards shall apply to the design of streets:
1.Â Â Â General. In order to provide for streets of suitable location, width and
improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access
to police, fire fighting, snow removal, sanitation, and street maintenance
equipment, and to coordinate streets so as to compose a convenient system and
avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties the following design standards
for streets are hereby required:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A tangent at least one hundred (100) feet long shall be introduced
between reverse curves on municipal arterial and municipal collector streets,
and seventy-five (75) feet on municipal service streets.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point
by more than ten (10) degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius
adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than one hundred (100) feet for
municipal service and municipal collector streets, and of such greater radii as
the Council shall determine for special cases.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Minimum Roadway and Right-of-Way Standards:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Municipal arterial streets shall have a right-of-way width of not
less than eighty (80) feet and a roadway width of not less than forty-four (44)
feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Municipal collector streets shall have a right-of-way width of not
less than sixty (60) feet and a roadway width of not less than thirty-six (36)
feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Municipal service streets shall have a right-of-way of not less
than fifty (50) feet and a roadway width of not less than twenty-six (26) feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Frontage streets shall have a right-of-way width of not less than
forty (40) feet and a roadway width of not less than twenty-six (26) feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Cul-de-sacs shall meet all the requirements for a municipal service
street and, in addition, shall provide a turnaround with a right-of-way radius
of fifty (50) feet and a roadway radius of forty (40) feet. No cul-de-sac shall
exceed five hundred (500) feet in length.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Street grades, wherever feasible shall not exceed the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Municipal arterial streets â€“ 6%
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Municipal collector streets â€“ 8%
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Municipal service streets â€“ 10%
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Frontage streets â€“ 6%
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â All changes in street grade shall be connected by vertical curves of
minimum length in feet equal to twenty (20) times the algebraic difference in
percents of grade.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â No street grade shall be less than one half of one percent.
2.Â Â Â Street Surfacing and Improvements. After sewer, water and other utilities
to be located underground within the right-of-way have been installed by the
applicant, the applicant shall construct curbs and gutters and shall surface or
cause to be surfaced roadways to the widths prescribed in these regulations.
Said surfacing shall be of Portland concrete cement. Adequate provision shall
be made for culverts, drains and bridges. All road pavement, shoulders,
drainage improvements and structures, curbs, turnarounds and sidewalks shall
conform to all construction standards and specifications adopted by the City,
and shall be incorporated into the construction plans required to be submitted
by the developer for plat approval.
3.Â Â Â Excess Right-of-Way. Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards
designated in these regulations shall be required whenever, due to topography,
additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes. Such slopes
shall not be in excess of three (3) to one.
4.Â Â Â Railroads and Limited Access Highways. Railroad rights-of-way and limited
access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining
lands shall be treated as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â In residential districts a buffer strip at least twenty-five (25) feet
in depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district
shall be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access
highway. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated
on the plat: This strip is reserved for screening. The placement of structures
hereon is prohibited.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In districts zoned for business, commercial or industrial uses, the
nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad
shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure
suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Streets parallel to the railroad when intersecting a street which
crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a
distance of at least one hundred fifty (150) feet from the railroad right-of-
way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum
distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate
approach gradients.
5.Â Â Â Intersections. The following standards shall apply to the design of
intersections:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles. A proposed intersection of two (2) new streets at an angle of
less than seventy-five (75) degrees shall not be acceptable. An oblique street
should be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at
right angles for at least one hundred (100) feet therefrom. Not more than two
(2) streets shall intersect at any one point unless specifically approved by
the Council.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall,
wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite
side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one
hundred fifty (150) feet shall not be permitted, except where the intersected
street has separated dual drives without median breaks at either intersection.
Where streets intersect major streets, their alignment shall be continuous.
Intersection of major streets shall be at least eight hundred (800) feet apart.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two (2) municipal service
streets shall be at least twenty (20) feet; and minimum curb radius at an
intersection involving a municipal collector street shall be at least twenty-
five (25) feet. Abrupt changes in alignment within a block shall have the
corners cut off in accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe
vehicular movement.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever practical.
In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a leveling area
shall be provided having no greater than a two percent (2%) rate at a distance
of sixty (60) feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the
intersecting street.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing
vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting
visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation, including
trees, in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent
deemed necessary to provide an adequate sight distance.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall be
three percent (3%) or less.
6.Â Â Â Bridges. Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined by the
Council, shall be constructed at the full expense of the applicant without
reimbursement from the City. The sharing expense for the construction of
bridges not of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined by the Council,
will be fixed by special agreement between the Council and the applicant. Said
cost shall be charged to the applicant pro rata as the percentage of the land
developed and so served.
7.Â Â Â Alleys. The following design standards for alleys shall be required of all
subdividers:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Alleys are prohibited in residential districts.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts, except
that the Council may waive this requirement where other definite and assured
provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading and
parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Alleys shall have a right-of-way of not less than thirty (30) feet and
a roadway width of not less than twenty (20) feet.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Alley intersecting and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided, but
where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit safe vehicular
movement.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable,
shall be provided with adequate turn-around facilities at the dead end, as
determined by the Council.
8.Â Â Â Street Dedications and Reservations. The following provisions apply to
street dedications and reservations:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Street systems in new subdivisions shall be laid out so as to eliminate
or avoid new perimeter half-streets. Where an existing half street is adjacent
to a new subdivision, the other half of the street shall be improved and
dedicated by the subdivider. The Council may authorize a new perimeter street
where the subdivider improves and dedicates the entire required street right-
of-way width within the subdividerâ€™s own subdivision boundaries.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow street or when City
plans or zoning setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening
a road that would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the
applicant shall be required to improve and dedicate at the subdividerâ€™s expense
such areas for widening or realignment of such roads. Such frontage roads and
streets shall be improved and dedicated by the applicant at the subdividerâ€™s
own expense to the full width as required by these subdivision regulations.
Land reserved for any street purposes may not be counted in satisfying yard or
area requirements of the zoning regulations whether the land is to be dedicated
to the City in fee simple or an easement is granted to the City.
166.37Â Â Â STORM SEWERS AND DRAINAGE.
The following requirements shall apply to the provision of storm sewers and
drainage:
1.Â Â Â General Requirements. The Commission shall not recommend for approval any
plat of a subdivision which does not make adequate provision for storm or flood
water run-off channels or basins. The storm water drainage system shall be
separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers, where
required, shall be designed by methods as approved by the Council, and a copy
of design computations shall be submitted along with plans. Inlets shall be
provided so that surface water is not carried across or around any
intersection, or for a distance of more than six hundred (600) feet in the
gutter. When calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a
point, no further allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point, and
basins shall be used to intercept flow at that point. Surface water drainage
patterns shall be shown for each and every lot and block.
2.Â Â Â Nature of Storm Water Facilities. The applicant may be required by the
Council to carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that
may exist either previously to, or as a result of the subdivision. Such
drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible,
or in perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width, and shall be
constructed in accordance with the construction standards and specifications.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the applicant shall install
storm sewer facilities, or if no outlets are within a reasonable distance,
adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of storm waters, subject to
the specifications of the Council. However, in subdivisions containing lots
less than fifteen thousand (15,060) square feet in area and in business and
industrial districts, underground storm sewer systems shall be constructed
throughout the subdivisions and be conducted to an approved out-fall.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided eventually, as
determined by the Council, the subdivider shall make arrangements for future
storm water disposal by a public storm sewer system at the time the plat
receives final approval. Provision for such connection shall be incorporated by
inclusion in the performance bond required for the subdivision plat.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â A culvert or other drainage facility shall in each case be large enough
to accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether
inside or outside the subdivision. The Council shall determine the necessary
size of the facility, based on the provisions of the construction standards and
specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed development
permitted by applicable zoning regulations.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The Council shall also study the effect of each subdivision on existing
downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision. City
drainage studies together with such other studies as shall be appropriate shall
serve as a guide to needed improvements. Where it is anticipated that the
additional runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will overload
an existing downstream drainage facility, the Council may withhold approval of
the subdivision until provision has been made for the recovery of the cost for
the improvement of said potential condition in such sum as the Council shall
determine. No subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be
provided to an adequate drainage watercourse or facility.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The Council may, when it deems it necessary for the health, safety, or
welfare of the present and future population of the area and necessary to the
conservation of water, drainage, and sanitary facilities, prohibit the
subdivision of any portion of the property which lies within the flood plain of
any stream or drainage course.
3.Â Â Â Dedication of Drainage Easements. The following shall apply to the
dedication of drainage easements.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel, or stream, there shall be provided a storm water easement or drainage
right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse, and of
such width and construction or both as will be adequate for the purpose.
Wherever possible, it is desirable that the drainage be maintained by an open
channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume
of flow.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Drainage easements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within street rights-of-way,
perpetual unobstructed easements at least fifteen (15) feet in width for such
drainage facilities shall be provided across property outside the street lines
and with satisfactory access to the road. Easements shall be indicated on the
plat. Drainage easements shall be carried from the street to a natural
watercourse or to other drainage facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and
indicated on the plat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The applicant shall dedicate, either in fee or by drainage or
conservation easement of land on both sides of existing watercourses, to a
distance to be determined by the Council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Low-lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or
overflowing during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for
dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their natural state as drainage
ways. Such land or lands subject to periodic flooding shall not be computed in
determining the area requirement of any lot.
166.38Â Â Â WATER FACILITIES.
Water facilities shall be provided as follows:
1.Â Â Â General Requirements. The following general requirements apply to the
provision of water facilities:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where a public water main is accessible the subdivider shall install
adequate water facilities, including fire hydrants, subject to City
specifications. All water mains shall be at least six (6) inches in diameter.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Water main extensions shall be approved by the City.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â To facilitate the above, the location of all fire hydrants and all
water supply improvements shall be shown on the preliminary plat.
2.Â Â Â Individual Wells and Central Water Systems. The following requirements
shall apply to the provision of individual wells and central water systems.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â In the discretion of the Council, if a public water system is not
available, individual wells may be used or a central water system provided in
such a manner that an adequate supply of potable water will be available to
every lot in the subdivision. Water samples shall be submitted to the
appropriate County or State agency for testing, and individual wells and
central water systems shall be approved by the appropriate County or State
health authorities. Orders of approval shall be submitted to the Council.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If the Council requires that a connection to a public water main be
eventually provided as a condition to approval of an individual well or central
water system, the applicant shall make arrangements for future water service at
the time the plat receives final approval. Performance or cash bonds may be
required to insure compliance.
3.Â Â Â Fire Hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be required for all subdivisions except
those coming under subsection 2 of this section. Fire hydrants shall be located
no more than one thousand (1,000) feet apart and within five hundred (500) feet
of any structure and shall be approved by the City.

facilities in a manner prescribed by the City construction standards and
specifications. All plans shall be designed in accordance with the rules,
regulations, and standards of the City and the State Department of Natural
Resources or State Department of Health. Plans shall be approved by the above
agencies.
2.Â Â Â Construction of Sanitary Sewage Systems. Sanitary sewage systems shall be
constructed as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where a public sanitary sewerage system is reasonably accessible, the
applicant shall connect with same and provide sewers accessible to each lot in
the subdivision.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where public sanitary sewage systems are not reasonably accessible but
will become available within a reasonable time, not to exceed fifteen (15)
years, the applicant may choose one of the following alternatives:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Install a central sewage system, operated and maintained by the
benefited property owners. Where plans for future public sanitary sewage
systems exist, the applicant shall install the sewer lines, laterals, and mains
to be in permanent conformance with such plans and ready for connection to such
public sewer mains.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Individual disposal systems, provided the applicant shall install
sanitary sewer lines, laterals, and mains from the street curb to a point in
the subdivision boundary where a future connection with the public sewer main
shall be made. Sewer lines shall be laid from the house to the street line, and
a connection shall be available in the home to connect from the individual
disposal system to the sewer system when the public sewers become available.
Such sewer systems shall be capped until ready for use and shall conform to all
plans for installation of the public sewer system, where such exist, and shall
be ready for connection to such public sewer main.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Where sanitary sewer systems are not reasonably accessible and will not
become available for period in excess of fifteen (15) years, the applicant
shall install individual disposal systems or central sewage systems.
3.Â Â Â Individual Disposal System Requirements. If public sewer facilities are
not available and individual disposal systems are proposed, minimum lot areas
shall conform to the requirements of applicable zoning regulations and these
regulations. Percolation tests and test holes shall be made as directed by the
City and the results submitted to the local board of health.
4.Â Â Â Water Supply Interconnections. There shall be no physical connection
between a public or private potable water supply system and a sewer which will
permit the passage of any sewage or polluted water into the potable supply.
Sewers shall be kept removed from water supply wells or other water supply
sources and structures.
166.40Â Â Â SIDEWALKS.
The following requirements shall apply to the provision of sidewalks:
1.Â Â Â Location of Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be included within the dedicated
non-pavement right-of-way of all streets.
2.Â Â Â Construction of Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be improved as required in
subsection 2 of Section
166.36 of these regulations.
166.41Â Â Â UTILITIES.
The following shall apply to the provision of utilities:
1.Â Â Â Location. The Council may require that all utility facilities, including,
but not limited to gas, electric power, telephone, and CATV cables, be located
underground throughout the subdivision. All utility facilities existing and
proposed throughout the subdivision shall be shown on the preliminary plat.
Underground service connections to the street property line of each platted lot
shall be installed at the subdividerâ€™s expense. At the discretion of the
Council, the requirement for service connections to each lot may be waived in
the case of adjoining lots to be retained in single ownership and intended to
be developed for the same primary use.
2.Â Â Â Easements. Easements shall be provided as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Easements centered on rear lot lines shall be provided for utilities.
Such easements shall be at least ten (10) feet wide. Proper coordination shall
be established between the subdivider and the applicable utility companies for
the establishment of utility easements established in adjoining properties.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where topographical or other conditions are such as to make impractical
the inclusion of utilities within the rear lot lines, perpetual unobstructed
easements at least ten (10) feet in width shall be provided along side lot
lines with satisfactory access to the street or rear lot lines. Easements shall
be indicated on the plat.
166.42Â Â Â PRESERVATION OF NATURAL FEATURES AND AMENITIES.
Existing features which would add value to residential development or to the
City as a whole, such as trees, watercourses and falls, beaches, historic
spots, and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved in the design of
the subdivision. No trees shall be removed from any subdivision nor any change
of grade of the land effected until approval of the preliminary plat has been
granted. All trees on the plat required to be retained shall be preserved, and
all trees where required shall be protected against change of grade.
166.43Â Â Â NONRESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
The following provisions shall apply to nonresidential subdivisions:
1.Â Â Â General. If a proposed subdivision includes land that is used for
commercial or industrial purposes, the layout of the subdivision with respect
to such land shall make such provision as the Council may require. A
nonresidential subdivision shall be subject to all the requirements of these
regulations, as well as such additional standards required by the Council, and
shall conform to the proposed land use and standards established in City plans
and regulations.
2.Â Â Â Standards. In addition to the principles and standards in these
regulations, which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the
applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the street,
parcel, and block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the uses
anticipated and takes into account other uses in the vicinity. The following
principles and standards shall be observed:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and dimensions to
the types of industrial development anticipated.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Street rights-of-way and pavement shall be adequate to accommodate the

installation of public utilities, including water, sewer, and storm water
drainage.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas from
potential nuisance from a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision,
including the provision of extra depth in parcels backing up on existing or
potential residential development and provisions for a permanently landscaped
buffer strip when necessary.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic,
shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or
potential residential areas.
166.44Â Â Â SCHOOL AND PARK RESERVATIONS.
If land to be subdivided contains sites that are designated in City plans or
plans of other public bodies to be used for schools or parks, the developer
shall reserve such site for such use. If sites which have been reserved are not
acquired by the City or other public body within two (2) years of the date of
the preliminary plat approval, then such sites may be subdivided by the
developer. The appropriate public body may release the reserved site sooner by
certifying to the Council that it does not intend to acquire such site within
the two (2) year period.
166.45Â Â Â IMPROVEMENTS WITHIN UNINCORPORATED JURISDICTION.
Pursuant to Section 354.9 of the Code of Iowa, improvements in the two (2) mile
unincorporated area under the jurisdiction of these regulations shall be the
same as required herein, provided they are not less than that required by the
applicable County subdivision regulations, and provided further that all
construction plans shall be approved by the County, and completed public roads
shall be accepted by the Board of Supervisors for public maintenance.
166.46Â Â Â VARIATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.
The following shall apply to the granting of variations and exceptions:
1.Â Â Â Hardships. Where the Council finds that extraordinary hardships or
particular difficulties regarding the physical development of land may result
from strict compliance with these regulations, it may make variations or
exceptions to the regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the
public interest secured, provided that such variation or exception shall not
have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations; and
further provided, the Council shall not grant variations or exceptions to these
regulations unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to
it in each specific case that:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health or welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The conditions upon which the request for a variation is based are
unique to the property for which the variation is sought, and are not
applicable, generally, to other property.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical
conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the
owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict
letter of the regulations were carried out.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to
make more money out of the property.
2.Â Â Â Conditions. In granting variations and exceptions the Council may require
such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives
of the standards or requirements of these regulations.
3.Â Â Â Procedure for a Variance. A petition for any such variance shall be
submitted in writing by the developer at the time when the preliminary plat is
filed. The petition shall state fully the grounds for the application and all
of the facts relied upon by the petitioner.
166.47Â Â Â CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.
Any provisions of these regulations may be changed and amended from time to
time by the Council; provided, however, that such changes or amendments shall
not become effective until after a public hearing has been held, public notice
of which shall have been given as required by law. Such proposed amendments
shall first be submitted to the Commission for study and recommendation before
the hearing is held. The Commission shall forward its recommendations to the
Council within thirty (30) days, after which the Council shall give notice of
and hold a public hearing on the proposed amendment.
166.48Â Â Â ENFORCEMENT, VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
No plat or subdivision within the City or within two (2) miles thereof shall be
filed or recorded with the County, nor shall any plat or subdivision have any
validity until it complies with the provision of these regulations, has been
approved by the Council as herein set forth, and further:
1.Â Â Â Issuance of Building Permits. No more than two (2) building permits for
each separate tract existing at the time of the effective date of these
regulations shall be issued unless the tract has been platted in accordance
with these regulations; except that this provision shall not limit the number
of building permits that may be issued for accessory buildings as defined by
applicable land use regulations such as zoning and restricted residence
regulations or additions or improvements to a main or accessory building
already legally located upon said tract.
2.Â Â Â Sale or Lease Without Plat. Any person who shall dispose of or offer for
sale or lease any lots in the City or addition to the City, until the plat
thereof has been acknowledged and recorded as provided in these regulations,
shall forfeit and pay fifty dollars ($50.00) for each lot and part of lot sold
or disposed of, leased or offered for sale.
