or structures. â€œNew constructionâ€ also includes reconstruction or renovation of
an existing building or structure that constitutes complete replacement of an

subject to the following:
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 727.2)
1.Â Â Â Definitions.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Consumer Fireworks - (American Pyrotechnics Association (APA) Standard
87-1, Chapter 3) Any device, other than a novelty or theatrical pyrotechnic
article, intended to produce visible and/or audible effects by combustion,
deflagration, or detonation. Fireworks are further described as Fireworks
UN0336 (formerly Common Fireworks and now referred to in this Standard as
Consumer Fireworks,) or Fireworks UN0335 (formerly Special Fireworks and now
referred to in this Standard as Display Fireworks.) Fireworks may also be
described as Fireworks UN0337 if examination and testing in accordance with
Title 49 CFR, Â§ 173.56 is performed that warrants that classification.
For purposes of this section, the term â€œfireworksâ€ includes any explosive
composition, or combination of explosive substances, or article prepared for
the purpose of producing a visible or audible effect by combustion, explosion,
deflagration, or detonation, and includes blank cartridges, firecrackers,
torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other fireworks of like construction
and fireworks containing any explosive or flammable compound, or other device
containing any explosive substance. The term â€œfireworksâ€ does not include
Goldstar-producing sparklers on wires which contain no magnesium or chlorate or
perchlorate, flitter sparklers in paper tubes that do not exceed one-eighth of
an inch in diameter, toy snakes which contain no mercury, or caps used in cap
pistols.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Novelty Fireworks - (American Pyrotechnics Association (APA) Standard
87-1) A device containing small amounts of pyrotechnic and/or explosive
composition. Such devices produce limited visible or audible effects. These
items must be approved by DOT, and are normally classed as 1.4G. A different
classification may be assigned based on testing and examination as specified in
Title 49 CFR Â§CFR, Â§ 173.56. Certain novelties which meet the criteria
specified in Section 3.2 are not regulated as explosives, and approval by DOT
is not required for those specific items. Novelty fireworks typically produce a
much weaker explosion and sound. A few examples include:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Party Poppers - once a string is pulled to activate the charge,
confetti is thrust into the air and produces a report.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Snaps - a small paper bag typically filled with gravel and a few
milligrams of silver fulminate will produce a report when thrown at a hard
surface or stepped on.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Flying Lanterns (Sky Lantern) - these paper lanterns float into the
sky when lit. They emit a slight glow and are very commonly used at weddings
and celebrations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Paper Tanks & Vehicles - when lit, these small paper vehicles emit
sparks that cause them to move around on the ground and commonly produce a loud
bang at the end.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Ground Bloom Flowers - a small cylinder that spins on the ground
and changes color, spinning in such a way that it resembles a flower. Could be
described as a large Jumping Jack.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Snakes (Black Snake and Pharaoh's serpent) - a small compressed
pellet that, when lit, expands into a long snake-like object.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Display or Theatrical Fireworks/Pyrotechnics. (American Pyrotechnics
Association (APA) Standard 87-1) Pyrotechnic devices for professional use in
the entertainment industry similar to consumer fireworks in chemical
composition and construction but not intended for consumer use. Such articles,
meeting the lift and effect powder weight limits for similar consumer fireworks
but not labeled as such, and containing only chemicals listed in Table 4.3-
1 may be approved under the provisions of this Standard and classified as
Articles, Pyrotechnic, 1.4G, UN0431.
Note: Theatrical pyrotechnic devices may be classed by DOT as Articles,
Pyrotechnic, 1.4S, UN0432 or as Articles, Pyrotechnic, 1.3G, UN0430 on the
basis of examination and testing as specified in Title 49 CFR, Â§ 173.56.
Examples include aerial shell, salute, all other fireworks that are not
considered novelty or consumer.

FALSE ALARMS
Â 
47.01 Purpose and Scope 47.05 Right to Hearing and Appeal
47.02 Definition        47.06 Notification
47.03 Penalty           47.07 Deliberate False Alarms
47.04 Exceptions        47.08 Violation; Penalty
Â 
47.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
The purpose of this chapter is to assess a civil penalty for false alarms
received by the Police Department or Fire Department which require a police
officer to report to the scene or a response from the Fire Department to the
scene. False alarms are an increasing problem, in part due to errors by the
owners or operators of the system or failure on the part of the operators of
the system to shut the alarm down before entering the premises. It is hereby
declared that the occurrence of false alarms at premises protected by emergency
alarm systems constitutes both a nuisance and a hazard to life and property. In
light of (i) the traffic danger inherent in the emergency response of police
vehicles, (ii) the danger caused by possible decreased caution on the part of
emergency personnel responding to a location where previous false alarms have
occurred, and (iii) the cost in money and manpower to respond where no actual
emergency exists, the City Council finds it necessary to the health, safety,
and welfare of citizens to enact the following provisions governing alarm
systems. Alarms caused by power surges or electrical storms shall not be
included in the false alarm category.
47.02 DEFINITION.
â€œFalse alarm,â€ for the purpose of this chapter, means the activation of an
alarm system, which results in a response by the West Burlington Police
Department or West Burlington Fire Department where an emergency does not exist
and for which no evidence or indication of criminal activity, or other hazard
is discovered. False alarms shall include negligently or accidentally activated
signals; signals, which are the result of faulty, malfunctioning or improperly
installed or maintained equipment; signals which are purposely activated to
summon emergency personnel in non-emergency situations; and alarms for which
the actual cause is not determined. False alarms also include an alarm signal
caused by conditions of nature which are normal for that area. â€œFalse Alarmâ€
does not include an alarm signal caused by extraordinarily violent conditions
of nature, which cannot be reasonably anticipated by the alarm user.
47.03 PENALTY.
The owner or lessor of the alarm system shall forfeit a civil penalty in an
amount set by resolution of the Council for each false alarm to the Police
Department or Fire Department in excess of two such alarms received in a
calendar year; provided, however, no such fee or civil penalty shall be
assessed in the event it can be shown that the false alarm was caused by a
surge in electricity caused by a power outage.
1.Â Â Â For each false alarm, after two, to which emergency personnel respond, the
alarm user shall be issued a notice of violation with a penalty of:
Â Â Â First false alarm Â Â Â No charge
Â Â Â Second false alarmÂ Â Â No charge
Â Â Â Third false alarm within a fiscal yearÂ Â Â Fee set by Resolution
Â Â Â Fourth and subsequent false alarms within a fiscal yearÂ Â Â Fee set by
Resolution
2.Â Â Â If any fine is not paid within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice, an
additional notice of a municipal infraction will be filed against the alarm
user for non-payment.
3.Â Â Â The City may use all available legal remedies to collect delinquent
service fees and late penalties.
(Section 47.03 â€“ Ord. 831 â€“ Dec. 21 Supp.)
47.04 EXCEPTIONS.
During the repair of an alarm system the owner may in writing ask for a waiver
of the penalty and release the Police Department and Fire Department from
responding until the alarm system is repaired. Upon repair of the alarm system
the owner must again notify in writing the Police Department and Fire
Department that the alarm system is in working order and all alarms should be
responded to as an emergency situation. It is also be the responsibility of the
owner to notify the It is also be the responsibility of the owner to notify the
Des Moines County Communication Center of a malfunctioning alarm system.
47.05 RIGHT TO HEARING AND APPEAL.
1.Â Â Â An alarm user shall have the right to a hearing to contest the imposition
of any penalty under this chapter. A request for a hearing must be received no
later than five (5) days prior to the due date of the fine.
2.Â Â Â The alarm user must file a written request for a hearing with the City
Administrator. The request for a hearing shall include the alarm userâ€™s name,
address, telephone number, and a statement of the reasons for disputing the
imposition of the penalty. A timely request for a hearing shall stay the
imposition of any penalty until the hearing is decided. The Cityâ€™s
determination of a false alarm and the imposition of an administrative service
fee shall be considered final if the alarm user fails to request a hearing
within the time period set forth above.
3.Â Â Â Notice of the imposition of a penalty shall be considered satisfied if
sent by regular mail to the alarm userâ€™s address.
4.Â Â Â The City Administrator shall conduct hearings requested by alarm users and
shall affirm, modify, or vacate the imposition of the penalty after considering
all of the evidence presented.
5.Â Â Â An alarm shall be presumed to be a false alarm unless the alarm user can
establish the existence of an emergency or other hazard at the time of the
alarm by a preponderance of the evidence. The burden of proving the existence
of an emergency shall be upon the alarm user.
47.06 NOTIFICATION.
Upon receipt of first false alarm the Police Department or the Fire Department
or the designee of either department shall notify the owner of the alarm system
that a fee shall be charged in the case of a third and subsequent false alarms
in a twelve-month period. Upon receipt of a third false alarm within a twelve-
month period, the Police Department or the Fire Department or the designee of
either department shall notify the owner of the alarm as shown by the records
of the department that the owner shall have thirty (30) days within which to
forfeit the required amount. Such amount shall be paid to the Clerk and a
receipt shall be given. Failure of any person to comply with the requirements
of this chapter shall constitute a municipal infraction.
47.07 DELIBERATE FALSE ALARMS.
No person shall cause any alarm to be transmitted to the West Burlington Police
Department or Fire Department knowing the same to be false or without basis in
fact. A violation of this section shall be a municipal infraction.
47.08 VIOLATION; PENALTY.
Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, the failure of any person to comply
with the requirements of this chapter shall constitute a municipal infraction.

Notes
  â€ Â EDITORâ€™S NOTE: A suggested form of notice for the abatement of nuisances is
  included in the Appendix of this Code of Ordinances. Caution is urged in the use
  of this administrative abatement procedure, particularly where cost of abatement
3 is more than minimal or where there is doubt as to whether or not a nuisance does
  in fact exist. If compliance is not secured following notice and hearings, we
  recommend you review the situation with your attorney before proceeding with
  abatement and assessment of costs. Your attorney may recommend proceedings in
  court under Chapter 657 of the Code of Iowa rather than this procedure.

91.06 Meter Costs
Â 
91.01 PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to encourage the conservation of water and
facilitate the equitable distribution of charges for water service among
customers.
91.02 WATER USE METERED.
All water furnished customers shall be measured through meters. Meters for new
homes will be furnished at the customerâ€™s expense; thereafter the meter will be
replaced and/or maintained at the expense of the City.
91.03 FIRE SPRINKLER SYSTEMS; EXCEPTION.
Fire sprinkler systems may be connected to water mains by direct connection
without meters under the direct supervision of the Public Works Director. No
open connection shall be incorporated in the system, and there shall be no
valves except a main control valve at the entrance to the building which must
be sealed open.
91.04 LOCATION OF METERS.
All meters shall be so located that they are easily accessible to meter readers
and repairmen and protected from freezing. New businesses and homes must have
remote readers.
91.05 METER SETTING.
The property owner shall provide all necessary piping and fittings for proper
setting of the meter including a valve on the discharge side of the meter.
Meter pits may be used only upon approval of the Public Works Director and
shall be of a design and construction approved by the Public Works Director.
91.06 METER COSTS.
The full cost of any meter larger than that required for a single-family
residence shall be paid to the City by the property owner or customer prior to
the installation of any such meter by the City, or, at the sole option of the
City, the property owner or customer may be required to purchase and install
such meter in accordance with requirements established by the City.
91.07 METER REPAIRS.
Whenever a water meter owned by the City is found to be out of order the Public
Works Director shall have it repaired. If it is found that damage to the meter
has occurred due to the carelessness or negligence of the customer or property
owner, or the meter is not owned by the City, then the property owner shall be
liable for the cost of repairs.
91.08 RIGHT OF ENTRY.
The Public Works Director (or designee) shall be permitted to enter the
premises of any customer at any reasonable time to read, remove, or change a
meter. Provided a City water customer is notified at least ten (10) days prior
to the requested inspection by regular mail to the billing address of record on
the customerâ€™s account, City water customers shall cooperate and ensure said
entry is allowed at the time and date specified, or shall reschedule a time and
date not to exceed 14 days from the originally scheduled specified time and
date. Any customer failing to so cooperate and permit such entry at the time
and date so specified commits a violation of the Code of Ordinances to which
the standard penalties under Section
1.14 of the Code shall apply, and a citation may therefore be issued to the
customer. Further, in addition, any such customer failing to permit entry on
the specified date and time may be charged a $50 administrative penalty to be
imposed on the customer in the next billing cycle. If a customer further fails
to cooperate with further written requests for entry, the $50 administrative
penalty may be charged each time a notification is ignored. During the duration
of time the meter cannot be read due to lack of response or cooperation from
the customer, the customerâ€™s usage will be billed at the highest monthly
consumption rate during the previous 24 months. No refund of overpayment will
be given if the overpayment is due to the customerâ€™s refusal to allow access to
the meter. In the event that the meter is unreadable for 60 days, due to lack
of response or cooperation of the customer, water service may be disconnected.

also be installed, for residential or commercial use, to measure water that is
not disposed of through the public sanitary sewer system. The water measured by
an irrigation meter may include water for swimming pools, watering yards,
watering gardens, production purposes, or other similar uses. The procedure for
installation of an irrigation meter is as follows:
1.Â Â Â The irrigation meter shall be obtained from the City. The cost of the
original meter, installation of meter, including any electrical wiring, shall
be borne by the owner of the property to be served. Replacement of the original
meter will be of no additional cost to the property owner. Rental properties
shall pay a meter deposit for all irrigation meters.
2.Â Â Â The approval for installation of an irrigation meter shall be enforced at
any time there is a change in occupancy, or a change in billing for any
irrigation meter within the City, whether or not the meter is removed and
reinstalled. An irrigation meter may be shut off at any time the meter cannot
be read or user fails to pay promptly any charges for water service within the
City, after appropriate warnings. The irrigation meter may be shut off at any
time due to leakage in the irrigation system, misuse of water, or high water
usage in the system.
3.Â Â Â Irrigation meters on residential properties shall be installed not more
than four (4) feet from the prime meter and shall be installed parallel to the
prime meter. Location of irrigation meters on commercial properties shall be
preapproved by the Public Works Director.
4.Â Â Â Any request for the installation of an irrigation meter shall be directed
to the Public Works Director.
5.Â Â Â The irrigation meter installation must be approved by the Public Works
Director. The water lines must be separately valved and run directly to point
of distribution or consumption.
6.Â Â Â The Public Works Director shall review the request and make a
determination that the separate line will not discharge into the sanitary sewer
system of the City.
7.Â Â Â Shut-off valves are required ahead of the irrigation meter and must be
within one foot of the meter.
8.Â Â Â A backflow preventer (approved by the City) to protect against
contamination of the water system must be installed on the inlet side of the
irrigation meter.
9.Â Â Â The irrigation meter must be installed horizontal to the floor with the
arrow of the meter being in the direction of the flow of water.
10.Â Â Â A minimum billing of 3,000 gallons a month shall be charged for water
that is registered through the irrigation meter and all other amounts shall be
per current rate schedule.
11.Â Â Â Water service rates and charges are subject to change at the beginning of
every fiscal year or at any time the Council deems necessary. A schedule of all
rates and charges are available at City Hall.
12.Â Â Â Upon request to discontinue service of irrigation water, the Public Works
Director shall have the water meter removed and lines capped. A service fee set
by resolution of the Council will be charged for reconnection.
91.11Â Â Â METER TAMPERING.
No person, without the consent of the Public Works Director or a duly
authorized representative of the City, shall remove, alter, adjust, manipulate,
damage, disconnect, reconnect, or bypass any water meter. Any person or entity
performing the foregoing actions shall pay the Cityâ€™s cost of investigation,
attorneyâ€™s fees, repairs for any resulting damage, replacement materials, or
other liabilities resulting from such tampering. Any person or entity found
responsible for the declared actions shall be in violation of the Code of
Ordinance to which the standard penalties under
Section 1.14 of the Code shall apply, and a citation may therefore be issued.
In any case, where it cannot be determined who was being supplied, the property
owner may be held responsible for the tampering or theft.Â Â Â

All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHâ€™s are determined from
periodic grab samples).

refunds for groups of or individual customers the City shall reimburse the
Company for the expense incurred by the Company to provide such data or

Â 
113.01 PURPOSE AND RULE OF INTERPRETATION.
The Council finds it is necessary for the City to establish uniform rules and
controls to ensure public safety and provide efficient delivery of services by
the City and others wishing to utilize streets and other public property for
the delivery of utility or other services, in order to protect public and
private investment, ensure orderly use of public property and ensure the
health, safety and welfare of the population, to provide for the regulation and
administration of the public streets and other public property and secure the
rights of the City to a return on its investment in public property. This
chapter is to be interpreted in light of these findings for the benefit of the
public and users of the streets and other public property.
113.02 FRANCHISE, LICENSE, OR LEASE REQUIRED.
No person or other entity shall use the public right-of-way or other public
property without first obtaining a franchise, license, or lease from the City.
The City shall not enter into or issue any franchise, license, or lease that
grants exclusive rights. An application for a license or lease shall be filed
with the Clerk on a form provided by the City and shall include as a minimum
the following information: the name, address, and telephone number of the
applicant; the name, address, and telephone number of a person whom the City
may notify or contact at any time concerning the license or lease; an
engineering site plan showing the proposed location of the facilities including
any manholes, the size, type and proposed depth of any conduit or other
enclosures; and any additional information the City may require. All licenses
or leases required by this section shall be granted by the Council.
113.03 FEES REQUIRED.
No franchise, license, or lease for the use of public right-of-way or other
public property shall be granted without requiring the grantee thereof to pay a
reasonable and competitively neutral fee for the use of public right-of-way or
other public property. The fees will be as follows:
1.Â Â Â All new franchises shall be assessed a franchise fee of up to five percent
(5%) of the gross receipts of customers within the City limits.
2.Â Â Â A license or lease fee will be assessed on all new licenses or leases for
space in the right-of-way. The fee is based on the number of linear feet of
wire, fiber optics line, or pipe placed in the City right-of-way. This license
or lease fee is a onetime fee for the term of the license or lease. Payment is
expected when the license or lease is signed. If the license or lease is
renewed, a new license or lease fee will be assessed. The fee shall be
considered partial reimbursement to the City for its acquisition, development
and maintenance costs of said right-of-way. License or lease fees are set by
resolution of the Council.
3.Â Â Â In addition to the license or lease fee, any person or other entity shall
pay a fee every time their facility requires excavation in the right-of-way.
This excavation fee will cover costs for street degradation and replacement,
inspection and obstruction and routing of pedestrian and vehicle traffic. The
fee is set by resolution of the Council. The City may waive all or part of this
fee if such work is done in conjunction with City construction.
113.04 LIMIT ON TERM.
No franchise, license, or lease for use of the public right-of-way or other
public property shall be granted for a term in excess of twenty-five (25)
years. No license or lease shall be for a term of more than five (5) years. Any
proposed lease which shall exceed three (3) years in length shall not be
executed by the City until fully complying with the terms of Section 364.7 of
the Code of Iowa. All licenses and leases shall expire on January 1 of their
respective term.
113.05 PLACEMENT OF FACILITIES.
The facilities, fixtures, and equipment for the distribution, transmission, or
sale of any utility services or services provided under license or lease or
easement shall be placed and maintained so as not to unnecessarily or
unreasonably interfere with the travel on the streets, highways, avenues,
alleys, bridges, and public places in the City, and such facilities, fixtures,
and equipment shall not interfere with the proper use of the same, including
(but not limited to) ordinary drainage or the functioning of the sewers,
underground pipe, or other property of the City. In the event that facilities,
fixtures, and equipment of any person or other entity located within a public
right-of-way must be relocated because of paving, road construction or road
reconstruction, sewer construction or sewer reconstruction, or the construction
or reconstruction of public drainage systems or similar public works or the
construction or reconstruction of the facilities of any City-owned utility,
such relocation, at the request of the City, shall be completed by the owner of
such facilities at the ownerâ€™s cost. The City shall, upon request of any person
or other entity holding a franchise, license, or lease, review any plans for
the construction of facilities, fixtures, and equipment within the public
right-of-way and advise the person or other entity of any conflict such
construction may have with planned or anticipated public improvements, but
failure of the City to so advise such person or other entity will not relieve
the owner of such facilities of its obligations under this chapter.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City Administrator may require placement of
equipment or facilities belonging to any holder of a franchise, license, or
lease be limited to locations designated by the City Administrator if such
limitation is deemed by the City Administrator to be necessary to protect the
integrity of use of present and future users of the public right-of-way or
other public property.
113.06 INDEMNIFICATION AND BOND.
The holder of any franchise, license or lease shall indemnify and hold the City
harmless at all times during the term of the franchise, license, or lease from
and against all claims for injury or damage to any person or property,
including payments under workerâ€™s compensation laws, caused by the
construction, erection, operation or maintenance of its facilities, fixtures or
equipment, or the negligence of its contractors or its employees. In case of
any suit or action at law being commenced against the City, upon any claim for
damage arising out of any loss, injury or damage claimed to have been caused by
any installation, improvement, obstruction, or excavation made or left in,
under, or upon such street, sidewalk, alley, or public place by the holder of a
franchise, license or lease, its agents, contractors or employees, upon being
notified in writing by the City of such action or proceeding, the holder of
said franchise, license, or lease shall appear and make proper defense thereto
at the expense of the holder of the franchise, license, or lease; and if any
judgment or decree shall in any such case be rendered against the City therein,
the holder of said franchise, license, or lease shall assume, pay, and satisfy
such judgment or decree, with the cost thereof. Immediately upon issuance of
the franchise, license or lease, the holder of the franchise, license or lease
shall purchase general liability insurance. The amount of insurance shall be a
minimum of $1,000,000 with a maximum deductible of $5,000. The holder of the
franchise, license or lease shall file with the Clerk a certificate of
insurance which clearly discloses on its face coverage in conformity with these
requirements. Upon request of the City, the holder of the franchise, license or
lease shall submit a certified copy of the policy.
113.07 REGULATION BY THE CITY.
The City reserves the right to make reasonable general regulations for the use
of streets and other public property which unless otherwise specifically
provided shall apply to any holder of a franchise, license or lease.
113.08 CONSTRUCTION BY HOLDERS OF FRANCHISE OR LICENSE OR LEASE.
Any holder of a franchise, license or lease shall obtain from the Clerk a
written permit whenever it becomes necessary to excavate in streets or public
grounds of the City. Such permits shall state a particular part or point of the
street where the excavation is to be made and the length of time in which such
permit shall authorize the work to be done. An exception to a requirement for a
permit shall be made in cases of emergency involving public safety, in which
case a permit will be obtained at the earliest opportunity after the work has
started. In making excavations in the streets, the holder of any franchise,
license, or lease shall proceed with such work as to cause the least possible
inconvenience to the public. The holder of any franchise, license, or lease
shall properly protect, according to safety standards generally accepted at the
time of placement as may be determined from time to time by the Public Works
Director, all excavations and obstructions by proper placement of shoring,
surface plates, barricades, warning lights and such other or additional devices
as circumstances may warrant. If in the opinion of the Public Works Director
such excavation or obstruction is not properly and safely protected, the Public
Works Director shall notify such holder of a franchise, license or lease, who
shall immediately comply with such reasonable instructions. Immediately after
use, any trenches for excavations which the holder of a franchise, license or
lease has opened shall be filled. However, no trench or excavation in the
streets shall be filled or covered without giving the City the right to inspect
the same. All backfilling in streets will be according to City specifications.
Temporary street surfacing will be placed in such excavations as soon as the
same has been backfilled. Pavements, sidewalks, curbs and gutters, or other
portions of streets and public places opened, disturbed, or damaged shall be
promptly restored and replaced with like materials at the expense of the holder
of a franchise, license, or lease and left in as good condition as before the
opening, disturbance, or damage occurred. In the event like replacement
materials are not available, the holder of the franchise, license, or lease
shall notify the Public Works Director, who must approve the use of any
alternate materials. In the event that the holder of a franchise, license, or
lease fails to comply with the provision of this section, after having been
given reasonable notice, the City may do such work as may be needed to properly
repair such pavements, sidewalks, curbs and gutters, or other portions of
streets and public places and the cost thereof shall be repaired to the City by
the holder of the franchise, license or lease. In cases where a cut or
disturbance is made in a section of street paving or sidewalks, but causes
greater disturbance than to just the area cut, rather than replace only the
area cut, the holder of a franchise, license, or lease shall replace that area
as may be ordered by the Public Works Director, which in no event shall exceed
the panel or panels disturbed.
113.09 CITY CONSTRUCTION AND PAVING.
Whenever the City shall pave or repave any street or shall change the grade
line of any street or public place or shall construct or reconstruct any
conduit, water main service or water connection, sewer or other City-owned
public works or City-owned utility, it shall be the duty of the holder of any
franchise, license, or lease, when so ordered by the City, to relocate its
service lines and other property in the streets or other public places at its
own expense so as to conform to the established grade or line of such street or
public place and so as not to interfere with the public improvements so
constructed or reconstructed. In the case of other public improvements,
including but not limited to urban renewal projects, the City may require the
holder of a franchise, license, or lease to relocate its poles, service lines,
and appurtenances in the streets at the ownerâ€™s expense. The City may at its
discretion assign personnel for inspection of excavation and related work being
performed by the holder of a franchise, license or lease. Should the holder of
the franchise, license, or lease fail or refuse to do and perform the things
provided in this section, the City may, after reasonable notice, perform the
work and charge the expense thereof to the holder of the franchise, license or
lease and the holder of the franchise, license, or lease shall promptly pay
said charges.
113.10 DESIGN NOTICE TO CITY.
The holder of a franchise, license, or lease shall promptly, upon request,
furnish the Clerk a detailed map or maps of its distribution system both within
the City limits and the area within two miles surrounding the City unless that
area is within another City. The holder of a franchise, license, or lease shall
thereafter update the map or maps at least annually or upon request, showing
all subsequent additions or deletions to the distribution system. Prior to any
excavation by the City or its agents, a representative must contact the holder
of any franchise, license, or lease regarding current information on the
location of underground lines or facilities in the area concerned. The
obligation to contact the holder of a franchise, license, or lease under this
section shall be satisfied if contact is made with the corporation organized
pursuant to Code of Iowa Chapter 480 or an entity with a similar function
utilized by both the City and the Company, currently the Iowa One Call System.
113.11 ABOVE-GROUND CABLES, WIRES, CONDUITS AND POLES.
All cables, wires, and conduits shall be placed underground except where above-
ground connection to buildings or other locations above ground are reasonably
necessary. Such above-ground connection shall be by means of poles located, as
far as reasonably practical, within alleys. No such poles shall be installed or
erected until the Public Works Director has approved the proposed location,
construction, and pole heights.
113.12 ASSIGNMENT.
No sale or assignment of any franchise, license, or lease of the use of the
public right-of-way or other public property shall be effective until it is
approved by the Council and until the holder thereof has filed in the office of
the Clerk written notice of the proposed sale, transfer, disposition or
assignment, such notice to clearly summarize the proposed procedure and the
terms and conditions thereof. Such approval by the City shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The proposed vendee, assignee, or lessee shall similarly
file an instrument, duly executed, reciting such proposal, accepting the terms
of the franchise, license, or lease and agreeing to perform all of the
conditions thereof.
113.13 FORFEITURE.
The violation of any material portion of a franchise, license, or lease by the
holder thereof or its successors or assigns or its failure promptly to perform
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be cause for forfeiture of said
franchise, license, or lease and the termination of all rights thereunder. Such
forfeiture shall be accomplished by ordinance of the City after written notice
to the holder thereof and a continuation of the violation, failure, or default
specified on the notice for at least thirty (30) days from the date the notice
was served.
113.14 APPLICATION.
This chapter shall apply to all franchises, licenses, or leases and easements
granted by the City, including all existing franchises, licenses, or leases and
easements.
113.15 HOME RULE.
This chapter is intended to be and shall be construed as consistent with the
reservation of local authority contained in the 25th Amendment to the Iowa
Constitution granting cities Home Rule powers. To such end, any limitation on
the power of the City contained herein is to be strictly construed and the City
reserves to itself the right to exercise all power and authority to regulate
and control its local affairs and all ordinances and regulations of the City
shall be enforceable against the holder of any franchise, license or lease.
113.16 NEW TECHNOLOGIES.
Should, within the term of any franchise, license, or lease, developments
within the field for which the grant was made offer to the holder thereof the
opportunity to effectively, efficiently and economically serve its customers
through use of a substance or material other than those for which the grant was
originally made, then the holder of the franchise, license or lease may
petition the Council, which, with such requirements or limitation as it deems
necessary to protect public health, safety and welfare, may allow the use of
such substances under the terms and conditions of the franchise, license, or
lease.

2.Â Â Â Emissions. The Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 gives the FCC sole
jurisdiction to regulate radio frequency emissions. Facilities that meet the
FCC standards shall not be conditioned or denied on the basis of emissions
impacts. Applicants for tower sites shall be required to provide information on
the projected power density of the facility and how this meets the FCC
standards.
114.10 PLACEMENT OF FACILITIES AND RELATED LEASE FEES.
Â Â The placement and maintenance of communications antennas or towers on City-
owned sites, such as water towers and parks, will be allowed when the following
additional requirements are met.
1.Â Â Â Water Tower or Reservoir Sites. The placement of communications towers or
antennas on water towers or reservoir sites will be allowed only when the
following requirements are met:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The applicant must have written approval from the Public Works Director
each time access to the facility is desired. This will minimize the risk of
contamination to the water supply.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â There is sufficient room on the structure and/or the grounds to
accommodate the applicant's facility.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The presence of the facility will not increase the water tower
orÂ reservoir maintenance cost to the City.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The presence of the facility will not be harmful to the health or
safety of the workers maintaining the water tower or reservoir.
2.Â Â Â Parks. The presence of certain communications antennas or towers
represents a potential conflict with the purpose of certain City-owned parks
and recreational facilities. The Council hereby finds that West Burlington
lacks sufficient park land to meet the recreational needs of the community and
that, therefore, none of the Cityâ€™s parks are of sufficient scale and character
to allow for the erection of any communication towers for any purpose. The City
may permit the placement of camouflaged antennas on buildings located in City
parks.
The fees for placing facilities on City-owned property shall be determined from
time to time by the Council and may vary based on the relative value of the
subject property. The Council may elect to engage a certified real property
appraiser to assist it in determining a reasonable and competitively neutral
fee for the use of such property. Furthermore, the City may also include in
such fee a charge to monitor any work performed by the applicant on City-owned
property. Such monitoring charge shall be based on a schedule of charges for
private-purpose projects.
114.11 ABANDONMENT.
Â Â In the event the use of any communications tower has been discontinued for a
period of 180 consecutive days, the tower shall be deemed to be abandoned.
Determination of the date of abandonment shall be made by the Building
Inspector, who shall have the right to request documentation and/or affidavits
from the communications tower owner/operator regarding the issue of tower
usage. Upon such abandonment, the owner/operator of the tower shall have an
additional thirty (30) days within which to: (i) reactivate the use of the
tower or transfer the tower to another owner/operator who makes actual use of
the tower; or (ii) dismantle and remove the tower. At the earliest, 181 days
from the date of abandonment, without reactivating or upon completion of
dismantling and removal, any special exception and/or variance approval for the
tower shall automatically expire.
114.12 TERMINATION.
Â Â The Council may terminate any lease if it is determined that any one of the
following conditions exist.
1.Â Â Â A potential user with a higher priority cannot find another adequate
location and the potential use would be incompatible with the existing use.
2.Â Â Â A userâ€™s frequency broadcast unreasonably interferes with other users of
higher priority, regardless of whether or not this interference was adequately
predicted in the technical analysis.
3.Â Â Â A user violates any of the standards in this chapter or the conditions
attached to the Cityâ€™s lease agreement.
Before taking action, the City will provide notice to the user of the intended
termination and the reasons for it, and provide an opportunity for a hearing
before the Council regarding the proposed action. This procedure need not be
followed in emergency situations.
114.13 HOME RULE.
Â Â This chapter is intended to be and shall be construed as consistent with the
reservation of local authority contained in the 25th Amendment to the Iowa
Constitution granting cities Home Rule powers. To such end, any limitation on
the power of the City contained herein is to be strictly construed and the City
reserves to itself the right to exercise all power and authority to regulate
and control its local affairs and all ordinances and regulations of the City
shall be enforced against the holders of any lease.
114.14 NEW TECHNOLOGIES.
Â Â Should, within the term of any lease, developments within the field for which
the grant was made to the holder of the lease present the opportunity to the
holder of the lease to be more effective, efficient and economical through the
use of a substance or material other than those for which the lease was
originally made, the holder of the lease may petition the Council which, with
such requirements or limitations as it deems necessary to protect public
health, safety and welfare, may allow the use of such substances under the
terms and conditions of the lease.
114.15 SATELLITE TELEVISION ANTENNAS. No satellite television antenna shall be
erected, constructed, maintained or operated except in conformation with the
following regulations.
1.Â Â Â Definitions:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â â€œSatellite television antennaâ€ means an apparatus capable of receiving
communications from a transmitter or a transmitter relay located in planetary

Â Â Â International Building Code
Â Â Â International Mechanical Code

155.04 SCOPE.
This chapter shall apply to all real property located within the incorporated
limits of West Burlington, Iowa, which contains one or more rental units as
defined herein.
155.05 RENTAL HOUSING INSPECTOR.
The Fire Chief/Building Inspector shall serve as the Rental Housing Inspector
of the City of West Burlington, herein known as the â€œInspector.â€
(Ord. 783 â€“ Jan. 19 Supp.)
155.06 ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
The Inspector shall administer and enforce this chapter. The Inspector may be
provided with assistance of such other persons as the Council may direct. If
the Inspector finds that any provisions of this chapter are being violated,
such official shall provide the owner with written notice that shall specify
the particular code provision that has been violated; said notice shall be
mailed to the owner by ordinary mail at the address provided by the owner on
the rental registration form. The notice shall specify the action required by
the owner and the date such action shall be completed. All corrective action
must be completed within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of notice of
violation with the exception of violations concerning the immediate health and
safety of the occupants, which shall be repaired within five (5) working days
after notice. Up to two (2) extensions may be granted where the Inspector has
determined that the owner is making a good faith effort to complete required
repairs or improvements to the property in a timely manner, but is unable to
comply due to the magnitude of the work, or can prove delays in receipt of
materials or equipment, delays in a hired contractorâ€™s completing of such work,
or delays due to weather or other matters beyond the ownerâ€™s control. In the
case of imminent danger or fire hazards, structural failure, or danger of
imminent collapse, interruptions or failures in plumbing, heating, or
electrical systems, or other hazardous situations, the Inspector may order
immediate repair or correction and may order the premises vacated pending such
repair or correction. If the Inspector discovers an imminently dangerous
condition, the owner shall be notified and the persons likely to be endangered
by the condition shall be notified. The notice shall specifically advise them
of the nature of the dangerous condition and the possible consequences to them.
This notice shall be served through one of the following: (i) positing of the
unit; (ii) mailed notice; (iii) verbal warnings; (iv) evacuation order; or (v)
other notification actions tailored to the specific condition. The notification
shall be reasonably calculated to reach and inform the persons likely to be
harmed by the imminently dangerous condition. If at the conclusion of the
period established for corrective action, the violation has not, in the
Inspectorâ€™s judgment been satisfactorily corrected, then the Inspector may
issue citations in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance, revoke the
registration for the affected unit, and with the concurrence of the City
Administrator, have the rental unit vacated. Units vacated under this section
shall be posted with signs indicating that the unit has been determined to be
â€œIllegalâ€ or, if applicable, â€œUnfit for Habitation,â€ and that occupancy is
prohibited until the rental unit has been inspected to verify that the
violation has been corrected. Any person who defaces or removes a posted sign
without the approval of the Inspector shall be in violation of this chapter.
155.07 VIOLATION AND PENALTIES.
Any person, firm, corporation, or other entity violating any provision of this
chapter shall be guilty of a municipal infraction and such person, firm,
corporation, or other entity shall be deemed guilty of a separate offense for
each and every day or portion thereof during which such violation is committed,
continued, or permitted, and upon finding that a municipal infraction has
occurred, shall be fined in accordance with the appropriate provisions of City
Code for this and subsequent or continuing violations.
155.08 UNFIT PROPERTIES.
The Inspector may upon the direction and concurrence of the City Administrator,
Chief of Police, the Fire Chief or their duly authorized representatives,
prohibit persons from entering or occupying, except for repair related
activity, any property, building or structure, including utility and
outbuildings, found to be unfit, found not to comply with City ordinances, or
poses dangerous, unsafe, or unhealthy conditions for the buildingâ€™s occupants,
passers-by, or the general public. Unfit properties shall be posted as â€œUnfit
for Habitation.â€ Any person who shall enter, occupy, use, or permit others to
enter, occupy, or use the building or structure after such a posting shall be
guilty of a municipal infraction. Each day the building or structure is
entered, occupied, or used following such a posting shall be considered a
separate offense.
155.09 ACCESS FOR INSPECTION.
Upon presentation of proper credentials, the Inspector or a duly authorized
representative may enter, at reasonable times and with reasonable notice, any
building, structure, or land within the incorporated limits of the City to
perform the duties imposed by this chapter. Reasonable notice shall be defined
as a minimum of ten (10) calendar daysâ€™ advance notice. It shall be the
responsibility of the landlord to notify the tenants of inspection
appointments, arrange access with the tenants, and provide access to the unit.
Units not accessible for inspection or otherwise not inspected shall be in
violation of this chapter and shall not be permitted as rental units. In cases
of complaints by the tenant or report of potentially life or health threatening
conditions from any source, the Inspector may promptly investigate with general
notice to the owner. The owner or manager shall keep and have available for the
Inspector a complete list of the names, addresses, unit numbers, and telephone
numbers of all tenants for the registered property in question.
155.10 PARKING.
Off-street parking shall be provided for all rental units in accordance with
the standards set forth in the West Burlington Zoning Ordinance.
155.11 MODIFICATIONS.
Whenever there are practical difficulties involved in carrying out the
provisions of this code, the Inspector shall have the authority to grant
modifications to the standards herein for individual cases, provided the
Inspector shall first find that special individual reason makes the strict
letter of this code impractical and the modification is in compliance with the
intent and purpose of this code and that such modification does not lessen
health, life, and fire safety requirements. The details of action granting
modification shall be recorded and entered in the official files.
155.12 RIGHT OF APPEAL.
The owner and any other person, officer, or commission of the City aggrieved by
the decision of the Inspector shall have the right to appeal such decision. An
appeal in writing may be submitted to the City Administrator to review the
decision of the Inspector. In deciding such appeals, the City Administrator
may, so long as such action is in conformity with the terms of this chapter,
reverse, affirm, or modify, wholly or in part, any order of the Inspector.
155.13 OCCUPANCY.
No dwelling unit may be occupied by anyone other than the owner without being
registered and inspected under the provisions of this chapter.
155.14 RENTAL REGISTRATION.
Each owner of a rental unit, whether occupied or vacant, shall file with the
City a completed registration form including the appropriate fee for each
rental unit. All delinquent fees, fines, charges, or other amounts due to the
City by the owner in part or in whole must be paid before the owner can
register any rental unit. Any person becoming an owner of an existing
registered rental unit shall file a complete registration form within ninety
(90) days of the transaction. The registration form shall contain the following
information:
1.Â Â Â Description of the premises by street number.
2.Â Â Â Name and address of the owner. If the owner is a corporation, the name and
address of the resident agent thereof shall also be provided. The owner shall
keep his name and address information current on the rental registration form.
3.Â Â Â The name and address of a managing agent. When a rental unit is owned by
more than one individual, or is owned by an entity that is not a natural
person, a managing agent must be designated. The inspector shall be notified in
writing within ten (10) days of any change of the managing agent. An owner with
a designated managing agent who is found not to be customarily available or
able to perform the duties as defined shall designate a different individual
who is able to properly fulfill the requirements within ten (10) days of being
notified.
155.15 INSPECTIONS.
Prior to the initial occupancy of any dwelling unit by a tenant, the Inspector
shall complete an inspection of the unit for compliance with the standards of
this chapter and other applicable City ordinances. Owners of occupied rental
units not inspected in accordance with, or who are otherwise in violation of
this chapter, shall incur a municipal infraction. All owners of rental dwelling
units must have a valid inspection certificate from the Inspector. All rental
units shall be inspected for compliance with the standards of this chapter on a
routine basis. Single-family rental units and duplexes shall be inspected every
five years and any rental unit with three or more units shall be inspected
every two years. In the event an owner, manager, or tenant refuses right of
entry to the Inspector, particularly in the cases where the Inspector may have
reasonable cause to believe there is an imminently dangerous condition, the
Inspector shall have the authority to pursue a search warrant in connection
with code enforcement.
155.16 FEES FOR REGISTRATION AND INSPECTION.
Registration and inspection fees shall be established annually by the Mayor and
City Council and shall be assessed to and paid by each rental dwelling owner in
accordance with this chapter. The registration fee for rental dwelling units
shall be established by resolution of the Council and shall be waived if the
rental dwelling unit is registered within 90 days of purchase, transfer of
title, or change from owner-occupancy to rental unit. There shall be a fee for
the rental inspection regardless of whether the registration fee is paid or
waived. If a complaint is received by the Inspector or any agent of the City
authorized and an additional inspection is completed, the inspection fee shall
be assessed for each inspection. If an inspection is completed based on a
complaint from a tenant, and no violation is found, the tenant shall be
responsible for payment of the inspection fee. If an inspection appointment is
cancelled or missed without reasonable cause, then the inspection charges for
that inspection shall apply. The fees for rental housing and inspection shall
be set by resolution of the Council.
155.17 PROPERTY MAINTENANCE.
No rental unit shall be occupied or continued to be occupied unless the
structure in which said unit is located complies with the provisions and
standards of the West Burlington Property Maintenance Code and is maintained in
a structurally sound condition and kept free from health, fire, and other
hazards to life and property. The owner of the rental unit shall be responsible
for keeping the premises maintained in good repair and fit for human
habitation. The tenant shall be responsible for keeping good care of the
property that tenant occupies per the rental arrangement between tenant and
landlord. Every facility, piece of equipment, utility or service, which is
required under this chapter, shall be so constructed and/or installed to
function safely and effectively, and shall be maintained in satisfactory
working condition and shall not be removed, shut off or disconnected in any
occupied rental unit, except for such temporary interruption as may be
necessary while actual repairs or alterations are in process or during
temporary emergencies, or tenants failure to pay agreed upon services.
Utilities or services shared by more than one unit or tenant may not be
removed, shut off, or disconnected due to another tenantâ€™s failure to pay
agreed upon services. Utilities or services shared by more than one unit shall
be the ownerâ€™s responsibility to maintain.
155.18 STANDARDS.
All new and existing rental units shall meet the standards set forth in the
current West Burlington Property Maintenance Code or the standards contained
herein. In the event of a conflict between standards, the more stringent
requirement shall apply.
155.19 OCCUPANCY LIMITS.
Each rental dwelling unit shall contain at least 150 square feet of floor space
for the first occupant thereof and at least 100 additional square feet of floor
space for every additional occupant thereof. For the purpose of determining the
maximum permissible occupancy, the floor area of that part of a room where the
ceiling height is less than five feet shall not be considered when computing
the total floor area of the room. In every dwelling unit of two or more rooms
and every rooming unit, every room occupied for sleeping purposes by one
occupant shall contain at least 70 square feet of floor space and every room
occupied for sleeping purposes by two occupants shall contain at least 110
square feet of floor space per sleeping room.

drugs, any portion of the rental house that came into contact with possible
contaminants shall be removed and replaced with new materials.
155.21 CONTRACT/LEASE/OPTION TO BUY EXCEPTION.
For the purpose of enforcement of this chapter, a rental property remains a
rental property, regardless of assertion that Offer to Buy Real Estate
Contract, Lease with Option to Buy, Option Sale, or Rent to Own Agreement
exists transferring ownership or control to any person or entity other than
shown as legal owner in fee, unless and until a properly executed and notarized
form of such document of transfer is recorded of record with the County
Recorder, providing open obvious public notice of transfer. Absent such
showing, no legal excuse or exception may be claimed by the Owner shown of
record, and Code enforcement shall be pursued consistent with public records of
ownership.
155.22 Â Â Â STATE TENANT/LANDLORD LAW.
To the extent that such provisions are not inconsistent with the provisions of
this chapter, generally, those provisions of Chapter 562A.1 to 562A.37, and

CHAPTER 161
ADULT ORIENTED ESTABLISHMENTS
Â 
161.01 Findings                     161.05 Responsibilities of the Operator
161.02 Definitions                  161.06 Minors
161.03 Location Restrictions        161.07 Hours of Operation
161.04 Development Design Standards
Â 
161.01 FINDINGS.
1.Â Â Â The City Council finds that adult-oriented establishments require special
zoning in order to protect and preserve the health, safety and welfare of the
City.
2.Â Â Â Based on its review of studies conducted in Phoenix AZ, Garden Grove CA,
Los Angeles CA, Whittier CA, Indianapolis IN, Minneapolis MN, St. Paul MN,
Cleveland OH, Oklahoma City OK, Amarillo TX, Austin TX, Beaumont TX, Houston
TX, Seattle WA, and the findings incorporated in City of Renton v. Playtime
Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Coleman A. Young v. American Mini-Theaters,
Inc., 427 U.S. 50 (1976), the City Council finds that there is convincing
evidence that the secondary effects of adult-oriented establishments include an
increased risk of prostitution, high-risk sexual behavior, crime, and other
deleterious effects upon existing businesses and surrounding residential areas,
and decreased property values.
3.Â Â Â The City Council intends to control the impact of these secondary effects
in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry; protect
the citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the
property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods and areas.
4.Â Â Â It is not the intent of the City Council to suppress any speech activities
protected by the First Amendment, but to enact a content-neutral ordinance
which addresses the secondary effects of adult-oriented establishments while
providing an outlet for First Amendment protected activities.
5.Â Â Â In order to minimize and control the secondary effects of adult-oriented
establishments upon the City, it is the intent of the City Council to prevent
the concentration of adult-oriented establishments within a certain distance of
each other and within a certain distance of other specified locations which are
incompatible with and would suffer from the secondary effects of adult-oriented
establishments.
6.Â Â Â Based upon its review of materials linking alcohol consumption and high-
risk sexual behavior and materials linking alcohol consumption and crimes such
as sexual assault, the City Council finds that a geographic separation of
adult-oriented establishments from alcohol beverage licensed premises is
warranted.
161.02 DEFINITIONS.
1.Â Â Â â€œAdult bookstoreâ€ means an establishment that has a facility or
facilities, including (but not limited to) booths, cubicles, rooms, or stalls
for the presentation of â€œadult entertainment,â€ including adult-oriented films,

Â 
162.01 STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
1.Â Â Â Statutory Authority. The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter
364, Code of Iowa, as amended, delegated the power to cities to exercise any
power and perform any function it deems appropriate to protect and preserve the
rights, privileges and property of the City or of its residents, and to
preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort and
convenience of its residents.
2.Â Â Â Findings of Fact.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The flood hazard areas of the City of West Burlington are subject to
periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare of the community.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by:
(i) The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â This ordinance relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
3.Â Â Â Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City of West Burlington and
its residents and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare,
and comfort and convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses
described in Section 162.01(2)(A) of this chapter with provisions designed to:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows so
that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
162.02 GENERAL PROVISIONS.Â Â 
1.Â Â Â Lands to Which Chapter Apply. The provisions of this chapter shall apply
to all areas having special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the City
of West Burlington. For the purpose of this chapter, the special flood hazard
areas are those areas designated as Zone A on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) for Des Moines County and Incorporated Areas, City of West Burlington,
Panels 19057C0254F, 258F, 259F, 266F, and 267F, dated October 21, 2021, which
is hereby adopted and made a part of this chapter.
2.Â Â Â Rules for Interpretation of Flood Hazard Boundaries. The boundaries of the
special flood hazard areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the
official Flood Insurance Rate Map. When an interpretation is needed as to the
exact location of a boundary, the Building Official shall make the necessary
interpretation. The City Council shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
made by the Building Official in the enforcement or administration of this
chapter.
3.Â Â Â Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure
shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
4.Â Â Â Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter to
repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provision of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with
this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
5.Â Â Â Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
6.Â Â Â Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated special flood hazard areas will be
free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on
the part of the City of West Burlington or any officer or employee thereof for
any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
7.Â Â Â Severability. If any section, clause, provision or portion of this chapter
is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction,
the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.
162.03 FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT STANDARDS.Â Â 
All development must be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and
meet the following applicable performance standards. Where base flood
elevations have not been provided on the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to (i) whether the land
involved is either wholly or partly within the floodway or floodway fringe and
(ii) the base flood elevation. The applicant will be responsible for providing
the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to
make such determination.
Review by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources is not required for the
proposed construction of new or replacement bridges or culverts where (i) the
bridge or culvert is located on a stream that drains less than two (2) square
miles, and (ii) the bridge or culvert is not associated with a channel
modification that constitutes a channel change as specified in 567-71.2(2),
Iowa Administrative Code.
1.Â Â Â All development within the special flood hazard areas shall:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or
lateral movement.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood damage.

of Natural Resources.
2.Â Â Â Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than 1.0 ft. above the
base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed subject to favorable
consideration by the City Council, where existing topography, street grades, or
other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods used must
be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various forces
and hazards associated with flooding.
All new residential structures located in areas that would become isolated due
to flooding of surrounding ground shall be provided with a means of access that
will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this
criterion shall not apply where the Administrator determines there is
sufficient flood warning time for the protection of life and property. When
estimating flood warning time, consideration shall be given to the criteria
listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa Administrative Code.
3.Â Â Â Non-Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved non-
residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, or together

elevation.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
plumbing, gas lines, water/gas meters and other similar service utilities
either elevated (or in the case of non-residential structures, optionally
floodproofed to) a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation or
designed to be watertight and withstand inundation to such a level.
5.Â Â Â Factory-built homes.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All factory-built homes, including those placed in existing factory-
built home parks or subdivisions shall be elevated on a permanent foundation
such that the lowest floor of the structure is a minimum of one (1) foot above
the base flood elevation.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All factory-built homes, including those placed in existing factory-
built home parks or subdivisions shall be anchored to resist flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not
limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. Anchorage
systems may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties
to ground anchors as required by the State Building Code.

reasonable time, make a determination as to whether the proposed floodplain
development meets the applicable standards of this chapter and shall approve or
disapprove the application. For disapprovals, the applicant shall be informed,
in writing, of the specific reasons therefor. The Administrator shall not issue
permits for variances except as directed by the City Council.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Construction and Use to Be as Provided in Application and Plans.
Floodplain Development Permits based on the basis of approved plans and
applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in
such approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement or
construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. The applicant shall be
required to submit certification by a professional engineer or land surveyor,
as appropriate, registered in the State of Iowa, that the finished fill,
structure floor elevations, floodproofing, or other flood protection measures
were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to
the use or occupancy of any structure.
3.Â Â Â Variance.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The Board of Appeals may authorize upon request in specific cases such
variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances
granted must meet the following applicable standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage,
and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Council Shall Be Based. In
passing upon applications for variances, the Council shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the City.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for the area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (12)Â Â Â The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and bridges.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (13)Â Â Â Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
chapter.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances
as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such conditions
may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Limitation of periods of use and operation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed
restrictions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the flood
protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration, rate
or rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated with
the regulatory flood. The Council shall require that the applicant submit a
plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
162.05 NONCONFORMING USES.

163.01Â Â Â SHORT TITLE.
These regulations shall be known and may be cited as the Airport Approach
Regulations.
163.02Â Â Â PURPOSE AND INTENT.
The Airport Approach Regulations is established pursuant to the authority
conferred by Chapter 329 of the Code of Iowa. It is hereby found that an
airport approach obstruction has the potential for endangering the lives and
property of users of the Southeast Iowa Regional Airport (BRL) and property or
occupants of land in its vicinity. An obstruction may affect existing and
future instrument approach minimums of the airport and an obstruction may
reduce the size of the areas available for the landing, takeoff, and
maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the
airport and the public investment therein. Accordingly, this ordinance is
established in order to:
1.Â Â Â Prevent the establishment of hazards to air navigation and incompatible
land uses in public airport approach areas and surrounding areas in the
interest of public health, safety, and general welfare of the community.
2.Â Â Â Minimize potential dangers from, and conflicts with, the use of aircraft
at the Southeast Iowa Regional Airport, and
3.Â Â Â Address Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 77 and all other applicable
federal and State laws regulating hazards to air navigation.
It is further declared that the prevention of the creation or establishment of
hazards to air navigation, the elimination, removal, alteration, or mitigation
of hazards to air navigation, or marking and lighting of otherwise would-be
hazards to airport navigation are public purposes for which a political
subdivision may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or interests in
land.

airport are as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Runway 36 (AOZ36). Beginning 200 feet (200â€™) beyond the paved portion
at the end of the runway and centered on the extended centerline of the runway,
the inner edge of the zone is 1,000 feet (1,000â€™) wide, expanding uniformly to
an outer edge of 16,000 feet (16,000â€™) wide. The altitude of the inner edge is
the same as the altitude of the runway threshold at the centerline. For each 50
feet of horizontal distance from the floor of the zone rises from the inner
edge one foot (50:1 slope) for a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet, and for an
additional 40,000 horizontal feet, for each 40 feet of horizontal distance,
rising at a rate of one foot (40:1).
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Runway 12 (AO12). Beginning 200 feet (200â€™) beyond the paved portion at
the end of the runway and centered on the extended centerline of the runway,
the inner edge of the zone is 500 feet (500â€™) wide, expanding uniformly to an
outer edge of 3,500 feet wide (3,500â€™). The altitude of the inner edge is the
same as the altitude of the runway threshold at the centerline. The floor of
the zone rises from the inner edge one foot for each 34 feet of horizontal
distance (34:1 slope) for a distance of 10,000 feet (10,000â€™).
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Runway 30 (AO30). Beginning 200 feet (200â€™) beyond the paved portion at
the end of the runway and centered on the extended centerline of the runway,
the inner edge of the zone is 500 feet (500â€™) wide, expanding uniformly to an
outer edge of 3,500 feet wide (3,500â€™). The altitude of the inner edge is the
same as the altitude of the runway threshold at the centerline. The floor of
the zone rises from the inner edge one foot for each 34 feet of horizontal
distance (34:1 slope) for a distance of 10,000 feet (10,000â€™).
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Runway 18 (AO18). Beginning 200 feet (200â€™) beyond the paved portion at
the end of the runway and centered on the extended centerline of the runway,
the inner edge of the zone is 500 feet (500â€™) wide, expanding uniformly to an
outer edge of 1,500 feet (1,500â€™) wide. The altitude of the inner edge is the
same as the altitude of the runway threshold at the centerline. For each 20
feet of horizontal distance from the floor of the zone rises from the inner
edge one foot (20:1) for a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet (5,000â€™).
2.Â Â Â Transitional Overlay Zone (TO). The airspace above a sloping plane rising
from the sides of each runway and from the sides of each AO zone at the rate of
1 foot of elevation for each 7 feet horizontally (7:1 slope). The TO zones for
the airport are as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Runway 36 (TO36). Along each side of the runway, beginning at a point
500 feet from the center line of the runway and at right angles to the runway
center line, and from each side of the AO36 zone at the south end of the
runway, at right angles to the extended runway center line. The TO zone is
interrupted at the point where it intersects the HO zone and resumes at the
outer edge of the CO zone, continuing out for a distance of 5,000 feet
horizontally from the edge of the AO36 zone.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Runway 12 (TO12). Along each side of the runway, beginning at a point
500 feet from the center line of the runway and at right angles to the runway
center line, and from each side of the AO12 zone at right angles to the
extended runway center line. The TO zone ends at the point where it intersects
the HO zone.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Runway 30 (TO30). Along each side of the runway, beginning at a point
500 feet from the center line of the runway and at right angles to the runway
center line, and from each side of the AO30 zone at right angles to the
extended runway center line. The TO zone ends at the point where it intersects
the HO zone.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Runway 18 (TO18). Along each side of the runway, beginning at a point
500 feet from the center line of the runway and at right angles to the runway
center line, and from each side of the AO18 zone at right angles to the
extended runway center line. The TO zone ends at the point where it intersects
the HO zone.
3.Â Â Â Horizontal Overlay Zone (HO). The airspace above the horizontal surface
plane, the perimeter of which is established by swinging arcs of 10,000 feet
radii from the center of the inner edge of Airport Overlay Zones AO36, AO12,
AO30, and AO18, and connecting adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs.
The floor of the HO is 150 feet (150â€™) above the airport elevation, or 698 feet
(698â€™) above mean sea level.
4.Â Â Â Conical Overlay Zone (CO). The airspace above a sloped horizontal plane
beginning at the periphery of the HO zone and rising 1 foot in height for each
20 feet horizontally (20:1) for a distance of 4,000 feet horizontally.

163.06Â Â Â GENERAL ZONE REGULATIONS.
Except as otherwise provided herein, no person shall construct or alter any
structure at or above the lowest extent of any Approach Overlay Zone, Runway
Protection Zone, Transitional Overlay Zone, Horizontal Overlay Zone, or Conical
Overlay Zone created herein without first having submitted a FAA Form 7460-1
(Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration) or later editions of this form
to the form to the FAA and obtained a permit from the administrative agency. No
person shall be issued a permit from the administrative agency for any
construction or alteration at or above the lowest extent in any zone created by
this ordinance without a determination of finding from the FAA. Any conditions
that the Federal Aviation Administration attached to the approval
recommendation shall be adopted and administered by the administrative agency.
A permit will not be issued if the FAA finding, or determination determines
that the proposed construction or alteration:
1.Â Â Â Would create a hazard to air navigation.
2.Â Â Â Would establish a non-compatible use.
3.Â Â Â Would endanger the general safety, health, and welfare of persons in the
vicinity of the airport or occupants of aircraft in flight.
4.Â Â Â Would result in raising the minimum instrument flight altitude of any
federal airway, approved off-airway route, or instrument approach procedure to
the airport.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance, no person shall, in any
zone created by this ordinance, or upon any land or water underlying such
zones:
1.Â Â Â Establish any putrescible waste landfill, or open-air composting facility
one (1) acre in size or larger.
2.Â Â Â Create alter or maintain any structure or use that would create a bird
strike hazard.
3.Â Â Â Create, alter, or maintain any structure or use in such a manner as to
create electrical or radio interference with aviation navigational signals or
aircraft communications.
4.Â Â Â Install, align, or use any lighting devices that make it difficult for
pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, create glare in the
eyes of pilots, or otherwise impair visibility.
5.Â Â Â Create, alter, or maintain any structure or use that would endanger or
interfere with landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft.
6.Â Â Â Plant, or allow the growth of, any tree, which, during the normal
lifecycle of such tree, can be expected to grow into any zone created herein.
7.Â Â Â Establish or maintain any private roadway in any location that would
result in the penetration of any zone created herein.
163.07Â Â Â LIGHTING AND MARKINGS.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance, any person constructing
or altering any structure located in any zone created by this ordinance shall
install all lighting or markings upon said structure as shall be recommended by
the FAA as a part of its review of the applicantâ€™s Notice of Proposed
Construction or Alteration. Such lighting or markings shall be made in a manner
consistent with FAA regulations and advisories.
Any permit or variance granted under the provisions of the ordinance may be so
conditioned as to require the owner of the land, structure, or tree in question
to install, operate and maintain, at the ownerâ€™s expense, such markings and
lights as the airport or County deems necessary to indicate to operators of
aircraft the presence of any obstruction.
Any permit or variance granted under the provision of the ordinance may be so
conditioned so as to require the owner of the land, structure, or tree in
question to permit the airport, City, or County, at its own expense, to
install, operate, and maintain such lighting and/or markings as the airport,
City, or County deems necessary to indicate to operators of aircraft the
presence of an obstruction.
163.08Â Â Â EXISTING AND FUTURE USES.
1.Â Â Â Existing Uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use,
structure, or tree to become a greater airport hazard than it was on the
effective date of this ordinanceâ€   7  or any amendment thereto or than it is
when the application for a permit is made.
2.Â Â Â Future Uses. Except as specifically provided hereunder, no material change
shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise
established whether it is intended to be permanent or temporary, and no tree
shall be planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit or variance
therefore shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a
permit or variance shall indicate the purpose for which the permit or variance
is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit or variance to be
determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the
regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the
permit or variance shall be granted. No permit or variance for a use
inconsistent with the provisions of this ordinance shall be granted.
Â 
Notes
7 â€  EDITOR'S NOTE: Chapter 163 was approved with Ordinance No. 842 on November
  16, 2022.
163.09Â Â Â NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES.
The regulations prescribed shall not be construed to require the removal or
alteration of any structure or landscaping not conforming to the regulations as
of the effective date of this ordinance or otherwise to interfere with the
continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing herein contained shall require
any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure,
in which the construction or alteration has begun prior to the effective date
of this chapter.
1.Â Â Â Marking and Lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this
section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby
required to permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon of such
markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary through an FAA Airspace
Analysis to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the
airport the presence of such potential airport hazard.
2.Â Â Â Alteration or Change of Nonconforming Use. No permit shall be granted that
would allow a nonconforming use or structure to become a greater airport hazard
than it was on the effective date of this ordinance or any amendments thereto
or than it is when the application for a permit is made.
3.Â Â Â Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Damaged. Whenever the administrative
agency or its designee determines that a nonconforming structure is idle,
unoccupied, vacant, discontinued, or abandoned for one (1) year or damaged, by
any means, to the extent of more than sixty (60) percent of the assessed value
at the time of destruction, no permit shall be granted that would allow the
nonconforming use or structure to become a greater airport hazard than it was
on the effective date of this ordinance or any amendments thereto or than it is
when the application for a permit is made.
163.10Â Â Â VARIANCES.
Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit
the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance with the regulations
prescribed in this ordinance, may apply for a variance from such regulations.
The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the
FAA as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation
facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances
shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or
enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and granted,
will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air
navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the
spirit of this ordinance. Additionally, no application for variance to the
requirements of this ordinance may be considered by the Airport Zoning Board of
Adjustment unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the Southeast
Iowa Regional Airport Authority for advice as to the aeronautical effects of
the variance. If the Southeast Iowa Regional Airport Authority does not respond
to the application within ninety (90) days after receipt, the Airport Zoning
Board of Adjustment may act on its own to grant or deny said application.
In addition, all applications for height variance within the airport zones
shall be accompanied by Federal Aviation Administration Form 7460-1 (Notice of
Proposed Construction or Alteration), or later equivalent editions of this
form, which has been completed by the applicant and processed by the FAA
regional office or otherwise appropriate FAA office.
Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to
advance the purpose of this ordinance and be reasonable in the circumstances,
be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question
to install, operate, and maintain, at the ownerâ€™s expense, such markings and
lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the Southeast Iowa Regional
Airport Authority, this condition may be modified to require the owner to
permit the Southeast Iowa Regional Airport Authority at its own expense, to
install, operate, and maintain the necessary markings and lights.
163.11Â Â Â ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES.
It shall be the duty of the administrative agency or its designee to administer
and enforce the regulations prescribed therein. Applications for permits and
variances shall be made to the administrative agency or its designee upon a
furnished form. Applications required by this ordinance to be submitted to the
administrative agency shall be promptly considered and granted or denied.
Application for action by the Airport Zoning Commission and Airport Board of
Adjustment shall be forthwith transmitted by the administrative agency as
necessary.

165.12 I INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS â€“ DEFINITIONS.
1.Â Â Â Purpose. The Industrial District regulations are intended to govern the
locations, intensity, and method of development of the industrial areas of West
Burlington. The regulations are designed to provide for the clustering of
industries that are compatible with the community as a whole. The regulations
preserve the lands for industrial and related uses, and prohibit the intrusion
of residential and other non-compatible uses into the industrial area.
2.Â Â Â List of Districts. The following Districts are hereby established and
defined:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â I-1 LIMITED INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The Limited Industrial District is intended to provide lands for
development by industrial firms that can locate in close proximity to
residential uses. The district regulations are designed to permit the
operations of most manufacturing, wholesaling, and warehousing activities, in
which there is sufficient control of any external effects on neighboring uses,
including lands in other districts, as well as separate industrial firms. Some
retail uses are permitted, in which they directly service or complement the
industries present. No outdoor storage is allowed in this District, and all
industrial operations must be in an enclosed building.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â I-2 GENERAL INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Purpose. The I-2 General Industrial District is intended to provide
lands for development by most types of industrial firms. The regulations are
designed to permit operations in a clean and quiet manner, and to protect
adjacent uses, both within and outside the district. Further residential
development is prohibited in this district, in order to keep homes from
absorbing any adverse effects of the industries, as well as conserve the supply
of industrial land for appropriate uses.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â I-3 HEAVY INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Purpose. The Heavy Industrial District is intended to provide lands
for use by heavy or intense industries. The district is designed primarily for
manufacturing, assembling, and fabricating activities, including large scale or
specialized operations whose external effects will be felt to some degree by
surrounding districts. As such, Residential development is prohibited in this
district. Less restriction is placed upon outdoor use and storage. Certain uses
that are economically necessary in function, but likely to create a nuisance,
are permitted only in this district, by special use permit.

165.14 SU SPECIFIC USE DISTRICTS - DEFINITIONS.
1.Â Â Â Purpose. The Specific Use District category is established to provide for
the orderly, planned development of two unique, large institutional entities
that reside in the City of West Burlington â€“ a community college, and a
regional hospital. These two long-established institutions serve a population
which extends far beyond the borders of West Burlington. They are also quasi-
public entities which serve a distinct and valuable function for the residents
of the region. Hence, they shall each be allowed special discretion over the
internal land use of their properties, which is largely exempt from the
standard regulations present in other Districts, yet still beholden to the
basic requirements for protecting adjacent properties from adverse impacts.
2.Â Â Â List of Districts. The following Specific Use Districts are hereby
established and defined:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â SU-CC COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Purpose. This District is intended to help guide the future
development and expansion of Southeastern Community College, as well as the Des
Moines County Fairgrounds, whose facilities share the property.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â SU-MC MEDICAL CENTER DISTRICT
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Purpose. This District is intended to help guide the future
development and expansion of the Great River Medical Center, a large regional
hospital campus. The District contains agricultural lands owned by the Medical
Center, which are intended for future, orderly development that is
complementary to the hospital facility.
165.15 SU SPECIFIC USE DISTRICTS - REGULATIONS.
Any development or use legally operated prior to the establishment of this
District 9  shall be considered a Permitted Use. These and additional uses are
included in the following lists, based on the desired future plans for each

Notes
9 The Specific Use District was established by an Ordinance Amendment dated
  July 6, 2016.
165.16 O-OT_OLD_TOWN_OVERLAY_DISTRICT
1.Â Â Â Purpose. The Old Town Overlay District is intended to conserve the
existing ambiance of residential neighborhoods in close proximity to Downtown
West Burlington. These constitute the earliest platted areas in the City, and
are generally characterized by lots with a width of less than 70 feet, and a
lot area of less than 7,500 square feet.
Â Â Â The regulations established for the O-OT Overlay District are intended to
accommodate residential lot dimensions of a considerably higher density than
elsewhere in the city. They are also intended to ensure that infill development
and redevelopment in this area are consistent with the established aesthetic
character of the neighborhood.
2.Â Â Â Description. This overlay district encompasses all residential blocks
contained within the initial subdivisions of Original Town, 1st Addition, 2nd
Addition, 3rd Addition, and 4th Addition, as well as several blocks of land to
the immediate south and west of these subdivisions. This reflects the
approximate extent of development in West Burlington in 1930.
Â Â Â The two Downtown blocks bounded by Mount Pleasant, Swan, Wheeler, and
Leffler Streets are not included in this Overlay.
Â Â Â The precise boundaries of this District are indicated on the Official Zoning
Map.
3.Â Â Â Relation to Base Zoning Districts. Functioning as an overlay, this
District is meant to work in conjunction with the underlying Base Zoning
Districts. It serves to modify specific provisions, so that they are either
more restrictive or less restrictive than the Base District.
Â Â Â All requirements established by the Base District, which are not explicitly
modified by the Overlay District, shall be enforced as written.
4.Â Â Â Non-Residential Uses. All non-residential uses shall be exempt from the
requirements of this Overlay District. If a lot in the B-1 Base District is
converted from a residential use to a commercial or service use, the
requirements of the Overlay District shall cease to apply to this lot.
Â Â Â A dwelling used for a Home Occupation or Home Business (as defined and
regulated in Section
165.03) shall constitute a residential use, subject to the requirements of the
Overlay District.
5.Â Â Â Exemptions and Modifications. These provisions shall apply to all
residential lots in this Overlay District, including new and pre-existing
development.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Front Setback. The minimum front setback shall be 15 feet. Front
porches, whether open-air or enclosed, shall have a minimum setback of 10 feet.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Rear Setback. There shall be no required setback for accessory
buildings
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Side Setbacks. The minimum side setback shall be 5 feet. For corner
lots, the minimum setback for the side facing the side street shall be 15 feet.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Lot Area. The minimum lot area shall be 5,000 square feet per dwelling
unit.
6.Â Â Â Additional Requirements for Infill Development. These provisions shall
apply exclusively to the development of new dwellings. Dwellings built prior to
the establishment of this Overlay District 10  shall be exempt from these
requirements. However, no pre-existing dwellings shall be structurally altered
in such a way that directly results in them no longer complying with any of
these requirements.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Equivalent Setback. Wherever applicable, when a new dwelling is
constructed, and the adjacent dwellings on each side have a front setback that
is equivalent to one another, the new building shall conform to this same
setback. If this is not the case, then a â€œcontextual setbackâ€ shall be used, as
described in Section
165.22(3).
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Maximum Front Setback. No new dwelling shall be constructed with a
front setback of greater than 25 feet, unless a neighboring dwelling has a
setback of 30 feet or greater. In such cases, a contextual setback is required.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Maximum Lot Width. No new dwelling shall be constructed on a lot of
greater than 80 feet in width.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Street-facing FaÃ§ade. The front faÃ§ade and primary entrance of each
dwelling unit shall face the street on which the property fronts. For corner
lots, the front faÃ§ade and primary entrance of the dwelling(s) shall face the
street that is parallel with the rear alley.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Alley Access. All garages shall be situated at the rear of the dwelling
unit, with auto access from the alley, rather than the street on which the lot
fronts. This shall apply to corner lots, as well.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Porches. Each dwelling unit shall include a space at the front
entrance, which can function as a porch. This shall constitute a partially-
enclosed area with an overhang, and at minimum, a wooden or paved surface large
enough to provide seating for one or more people, unobstructed by the doorway.
7.Â Â Â Recommendations. While not required by this Ordinance, the City encourages
that the following elements be incorporated into an infill development project
in the Old Town Overlay District, whenever deemed feasible by the developer.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Placement of Windows. An abundance of blank walls distracts from the
visual character of Old Town, in which the coordinated placement of windows
helps create a welcoming sense of safety and enclosure around the street and
sidewalk.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Decorative Landscaping. The inclusion of vegetative landscaping at the
front of a dwelling help contribute to the aesthetic appeal of Old Town,
particular in the area around the porch.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Full-Length Porches with Columns. Traditionally, dwellings in Old Town
were constructed with open-air porches that spanned the full width of the
building, with vertical columns strategically placed around the porch.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Detached Garages. While garages attached to the principal structure are
allowed, detached garages are preferable, as they allow a direct connection
from the alley, and open up additional land for storm water drainage, in
between the impervious space of the dwelling and garage.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Lot Width. While the consolidation of multiple adjacent parcels into a
wider lot is allowed, up to a width of 80 feet, it is encouraged that dwellings
be developed within the original 50-foot lots, whenever possible.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Minimum Height. The majority of original dwellings in Old Town have a
height of 1.5 or 2 stories. While 1-story dwellings are allowed, it is
encouraged that they conform to the established pattern of the neighborhood,
whenever possible.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Tree Canopy. As it is recognized that consistent tree cover contributes
to the established character of these neighborhoods, it is encouraged that
trees be planted in the front yard of each new dwelling in Old Town, whether in
the terrace area or the area between the dwelling and the sidewalk.

Notes
10 10 The Old Town Overlay District was established by an Ordinance Amendment
   dated July 6, 2016.
165.17 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS (PUD).
1.Â Â Â Purpose. In some situations, the nature of a proposed development project
may require special planning between the developer and the City. This may
relate to factors such as the density, physical layout, or arrangement of
individual uses, which differ substantially from the requirements of a
particular Zoning District.
Â Â Â In the event that such a proposal is encountered, the City may establish a
Planned Unit Development (PUD) Overlay District, to apply to that specific
circumstance. This PUD may be used to accommodate innovative or imaginative
approaches to design and development, through a negotiated contract between the
City and one or more private entities. While the specific provisions will vary
considerably from one such District to another, each shall comply with the
basic requirements listed below.
2.Â Â Â Characteristics of a Planned Unit Development.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A PUD may contain residential, business, service, or industrial uses.
It may also be mixed use, containing a combination of two or more of the
aforementioned uses, with the exception of residential and industrial, on the
condition that these uses are deemed to be fully compatible with one another.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â As an Overlay District, the PUD shall serve to complement the
underlying Base Zoning District, by modifying specific provisions, to
accommodate the proposed development in question.
Â Â Â All requirements established by the Base District, which are not explicitly
modified by the Overlay District, shall be enforced as written.
Â Â Â As such, when an Overlay District is established, its provisions must
clearly state which elements are made to be more flexible, and which are meant
to comply entirely with the requirements of the Base District.
3.Â Â Â Establishment of a PUD Overlay District.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Submission of Preliminary Plan. The owner(s) of a tract of land where a
PUD is proposed shall submit a preliminary plan for the use and development of
the property, to the Planning and Zoning Commission for its review.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Review by Planning and Zoning Commission. The Planning and Zoning
Commission will study the plan, hold a public hearing, and report its findings
on whether the plan is compatible with the basic requirements of this
Ordinance. In addition, the Commission shall ascertain whether the proposed
development complies with the following conditions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The applicant has demonstrated a need to provide adequate
facilities at the proposed location, by means of market studies and/or such
other evidence as the Planning and Zoning Commission may require.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The proposed site for the PUD is adequate in size to provide
convenient facilities for the population which it may be reasonably expected to
serve, allowing for reasonable future expansion.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The proposed PUD is at a location where traffic congestion does not
presently exist, or is not likely to be created as a result of the development,
on all streets used for primary access to the site. Prevention of future
traffic congestion may be accomplished through the allocation of new streets or
service drives, the precise arrangement of entrances and exits, and by internal
provisions for parking and traffic flow.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The plan provides for a PUD consisting of one or more groups of
buildings of integrated and harmonious designs, together with adequate and
properly arranged traffic and parking facilities and landscaping. The project
is arranged in an attractive and efficient manner, being convenient, pleasant
and safe to use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â If a mix of land use types is present, the uses in question are
deemed to be compatible with one another, under the density and physical layout
of the proposed development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â The proposed development is compatible with adjoining or
surrounding land uses, and would have no adverse effects upon them.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â The applicant is financially able to carry out the proposed
project, construction shall begin within two years of approval, and the project
will be completed within a reasonable amount of time.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Final Development Plan. Upon determination by the Planning and Zoning
Commission that the proposed PUD, as shown in the preliminary plan, appears to
conform to the requirements listed above, the applicant(s) shall prepare and
submit a final development plan, which shall incorporate any changes or
modifications required by the Commission.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Draft of Overlay District. If the final development plan is found to
comply with all applicable requirements, the Planning and Zoning Commission
shall work with the City to draft the provisions of an Overlay District for the
location of the PUD, using the final development plan as a model for the
necessary relaxation of certain requirements of the Base District.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Recommendation to Council. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall
submit the final plan, along with its report and recommendation to create an
Overlay District, to the City Council. The Council may accept, reject, or
modify the plan, consistent with the intent and meaning of this Ordinance.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Creation of District. If approved by the City Council, an Overlay
District shall be established for the PUD in question, and the Zoning Map will
be amended to reflect this change.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Sign Requirements. Subject to the provisions of
Chapter 160 of this Code of Ordinances and approval by the Board of Adjustment,
all signs within the PUD shall be controlled by written agreement between the
owners and tenants of commercial space, with the intent to prevent excessive
advertising and promote a harmonious appearance of the development as a whole.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Compensation Expenses. The developer shall be responsible for
reasonable expenses incurred by the Planning and Zoning Commission in obtaining
technical services to review development plans.
165.18 GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.Â Â Â The following requirements apply to all relevant lots, buildings, and/or
uses in the City of West Burlington, regardless of the District in which they
are located.
Â Â Â Except as explicitly outlined below, no building, portion of building, or
parcel of land shall be used, and no structure shall be erected, constructed,
occupied, moved, altered or repaired, except when in conformity with the
regulations specified for the District in which it is located.
2.Â Â Â Validity of Existing Building Permits. Nothing contained in this ordinance
shall require any change in the layout, plans, construction, size or designated
use of any development, building, structure or portion of structure, for which
official approvals and required building permits have been granted prior the
enactment of the Ordinance, or any relevant amendments to the Ordinance. In
conformance with such plans, the construction shall have been started prior to
the effective date of the Ordinance or amendment, completed within the
subsequent six-month period, and not discontinued until completion, except for
reasons beyond the builderâ€™s control.
3.Â Â Â Nonconforming Uses. If a building, structure, or use existed lawfully at
the time the Ordinance or any subsequent amendment was enacted, but does not
conform to the requirements of the District in which it is located, its
continued existence shall be allowed, with certain exceptions, as outlined
below. These shall not apply to the Maximum Impervious Surface provision as
specified in Section
165.21.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â In the event that a nonconforming building or structure has been
damaged by fire, flood, explosion, earthquake, or other natural disaster, it
may be reconstructed and restored to its previous use, if it is done within
twelve (12) months of the incident. However, if the damage amounts to more than
60% of the assessed value of the structure at the time of the incident, as
determined by the Board of adjustment, reconstruction shall be in accordance
with the provisions of the District in which it is located.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In the event that an owner intends to voluntarily demolish and
reconstruct a non-conforming building or structure, it shall only be
reconstructed in a non-conforming manner if the cost of the demolition and
reconstruction amounts to 60% or less of its assessed value at the time this
occurs. If the cost exceeds 60%, then the building or structure shall only be
built in such a manner as would be in accordance with the provisions of the
District in which it is located.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Once a building, structure, or lot has had a nonconforming use
discontinued for more than one year, or had its use changed to one permitted
within the District in which it is located, it shall never again be devoted to
a nonconforming use.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Any nonconforming use of land not involving any structure and any
nonconforming outdoor advertising sign or outdoor advertising structure may be
continued for a period not to exceed three years after such determination,
whereupon such nonconforming use shall cease or structure shall be removed.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Any building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use with an
assessed value of less than $5,000.00, as determined by the Board of
Adjustment, may be continued for a period of no more than three years after
such determination. At this point, the nonconforming use shall cease, and the
building or structure shall be removed or changed to a conforming use.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Nothing in these regulations shall prevent the repair and restoration
of any part of a building or structure that the Building Inspector has declared
to be unsafe.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â The above provisions shall not be applicable where any such building,
structure, or use would be conforming under the Land Use Plan, as defined in
Section
165.03.
4.Â Â Â Multiple Uses. A lot may contain more than one principal use, provided all
uses are conforming and compatible. In B-1 and B-2 Districts, a multiple use

circumstance would justify such an action.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If advised to do so, Planning Commission, in consultation with other
City departments and agencies concerned, shall undertake studies of various
areas of the City, for the purpose of determining whether there is a need for

165.20 HOME OCCUPATIONS AND HOME BUSINESSES.
1.Â Â Â Home Occupations.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Definition. A â€˜home occupationâ€™ refers to a circumstance where a
residential dwelling is also used for an occupational activity by a member of
the household residing in the dwelling, with no additional employees.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Allowable Conditions. A Home Occupation shall be allowed through the
use of a permit. The following provisions apply in these circumstances:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The occupational activity shall be incidental and secondary to the
use of the property as a residence, and be carried out entirely within either
the dwelling or an accessory building.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â  If located in the dwelling, it shall occupy no greater than 25%
of the floor area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â  If located in an accessory building, it shall occupy no greater
than 600 square feet of the floor area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The activity shall not noticeably distract from the residential
character of the property, or the surrounding neighborhood.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â  If located in a Residential District, signage for the activity
shall be discouraged. The sole exception shall be a single, non-illuminated
nameplate of no more than three (3) square feet in area, mounted on the
exterior wall of the building.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â  If located in a Business or Agricultural District, the activity
may be accompanied by a single non-illuminated sign, no more than three (3)
square feet in area. It may either be mounted on the wall, or placed on the
ground, in which case the height shall not exceed four (4) feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The activity shall not involve the use of equipment which creates
offensive noise, vibration, smoke, dust, odor, heat or glare.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Permitted Uses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The use of the premises by a chiropractor, physician, dentist,
lawyer, clergyman or other similar professionals for consultation or emergency
treatment, but not for the general practice of those professions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Instructional services offered by the resident to no greater than
two (2) outside clients at a time, involving music or dance lessons, fitness
training, arts and crafts, and tutoring.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Home studios for painting, ceramics or similar arts, in which
retail sales are not conducted on-site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Repair services for a limited number of small appliances,
furniture, and computers and similar electronic equipment, provided that the
activity does not result in persistent noise that is offensive for other
neighborhood residents.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Offices for services that are provided outside the home, such as
lawn care, snow removal, or similar activities, which are carried out by a
resident of the home.
2.Â Â Â Home Businesses.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Definition. A â€œhome businessâ€ refers to a circumstance similar to a
â€œhome occupationâ€, except in this case, the occupational activity is of equal
significance to the use of the property as a residence, rather than an
incidental, secondary use. Such an operation will typically require the use of
1 or more employees to assist the resident conducting the business.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Allowable Conditions. As these uses are likely to have some impact on
surrounding residential areas, they are considered Special Uses, and must
obtain approval from the Board of Adjustment. The following provisions apply in
these circumstances:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The activity shall not noticeably distract from the residential
character of the property, or the surrounding neighborhood.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â If located in a Residential District, signage for the activity
shall be discouraged. The sole exception shall be a single, non-illuminated

165.21 STORM_WATER_DRAINAGE_CONTROLS
1.Â Â Â Storm Water Controls for New Development. When development occurs, the
following requirements shall apply, as a means of controlling the negative
effects of excessive storm water runoff:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The developer shall provide sufficient documentation to ensure that,
when completed, new development will not increase the amount of storm water
runoff onto adjacent and downstream properties. If necessary for this purpose,
the developer shall also submit plans for site improvements, such as the
creation of retention or detention ponds, at strategically placed locations.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In areas with especially steep slope or poorly drained soils, these
topographical and geological limitations shall be incorporated into the
development plan.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â No existing water channel (creek, river, or stream) shall have its
natural course further altered for the purpose of private development. These
features shall be retained in their natural state, to ensure that patterns of
topography and drainage are not disturbed.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Private development shall not alter the placement of trees and other
riparian vegetation lining the banks of a stream channel, as these contribute
to natural drainage patterns.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â If any existing stationary water feature (lake, pond, or wetland) must
be altered for the purpose of development, a water feature of equal retention
capacity shall be created in the nearby vicinity, to ensure that natural
patterns of topography and drainage are not disturbed.
2.Â Â Â Maximum Impervious Surface. For all residential properties, a certain
percentage of the land shall be devoted to green space, unobstructed by
impervious surfaces, defined as any form of ground cover which prevents the
ready absorption and retention of water. This requirement is intended to reduce
the effects of storm water runoff, and enhance the capacity of the City sewer
system, in managing rainfall events in each neighborhood or subdivision.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â This requirement shall apply to buildings, driveways, walkways, patios,
tennis courts, or any other similar structure or surface which meets the
definition of an impervious surface.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A deck is not considered impervious if it is slatted, with gaps for
water to easily pass through to the soil below. If it is composed of a solid
material without any gaps, a deck is considered impervious. If there is a solid
barrier covering the ground underneath, any kind of deck â€“ slatted or solid â€“
is considered impervious.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â This requirement shall not apply to swimming pools, as this is not
considered an impervious surface, due to its retention capacity in normal
rainfall events.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â This provision shall apply exclusively to new development and
redevelopment. Buildings and structures existing prior to the establishment of
this provision 13  shall be exempt from its requirements.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The requirements shall apply, however, to any structural additions that
increase the physical footprint of an existing dwelling. They shall also apply
to the installation of new features such as patios, tennis courts, or walkways,
where none existed previously.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â If the existing dwelling has already reached or exceeded the
maximum impervious surface allowable, then no such additions shall be
permitted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If the existing dwelling has not yet reached the maximum impervious
surface allowable, then additions shall only be permitted if they do not result
in the dwelling exceeding the maximum.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â If the owner plans to rebuild or replace an existing impervious
structure or surface, and this property already exceeds the amount of
impervious surface allowed, then its replacement shall not increase the amount
of impervious surface present. The amount must either decrease or remain the
same as before the replacement. This shall also apply to the rebuilding of
structures that were damaged by fire, flood, earthquake, or natural disaster.
Note: Under these conditions, any other nonconforming aspects of a property
shall be required to conform, based on the stipulations of Section
165.18(3).
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â The following table lists the maximum amount of impervious surface that
is allowable for each type of residential use:
Single and Two-Family Residential
Lot Size           Maximum Impervious Surface
6000 SF or less    60% of total lot area
6,001 â€“ 7,500 SF 55% of total lot area
7,501 â€“ 10,000 SF50% of total lot area
10,001 â€“ 15,000 S45% of total lot area
15,001 â€“ 20,000 S40% of total lot area
20,001 â€“ 25,000 S35% of total lot area
25,001 â€“ 30,000 S30% of total lot area
30,001 or more     25% of total lot area
Â 
Â 
Multi-Family Residential
Density                      Maximum Impervious Surface
2-4 Units per Dwelling       55% of total area of the complex
5 or More Units per Dwelling 60% of the total area of the complex
Â 
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Substitutions. In the event that a desired building addition or paved
surface conflicts with the requirement for maximum impervious surface on a lot,
the following methods may be used to accommodate the proposed addition:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Permeable Pavers. When adding a driveway, walkway, or patio,
permeable pavers may be used as a substitute for impervious materials. In
addition, existing paved surfaces may be replaced with permeable pavers, in the
event that a new building addition would result in the Maximum Impervious
Surface being exceeded for the lot.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Rain Barrels. Above-ground devices for the collection and storage
of excess rainwater may be installed, to offset the effects of storm water
runoff.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Cisterns. Similar to a rain barrel, an underground cistern may be
used as a substitution. To ensure the safety of the device, it is required that
the Building Inspector shall inspect and evaluate any cistern intended to be
used for this purpose.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Rain Gardens. Rain gardens planted with native plants and grass may
be used, if positioned in a location especially suited to capture storm water
runoff, such as adjacent to a downspout, sump pump drain line, or any elevated
impervious surface.
In each case, if such components are to be installed for this purpose, the
owner or developer shall produce advanced documentation, showing the precise
form of materials to be used, to prove that they have sufficient capacity to
handle excess runoff, and are in conformance with all applicable industry
standards.
If the components are already present prior to the application for a permit,
the owner shall allow the Building Inspector to inspect and evaluate them, to
prove that they have sufficient capacity to handle excess runoff, and are in
conformance with all applicable industry standards.
Note: All of the preceding strategies are encouraged by the City, regardless of
whether or not the Maximum Impervious Surface has been reached. While they are
especially helpful in such a circumstance, they are a desirable addition in any
other context, alone or in combination with one another.
Â 
Notes
13 13 The Maximum Impervious Surface provision was established by an Ordinance
   Amendment dated July 6, 2016.

Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â When two adjacent lots in the middle of a block are developed
simultaneously, and the existing dwellings on adjoining lots have an uneven
setback, there are two options: 1) the setbacks of both new dwellings shall be
equivalent to the average setback of the two existing dwellings, or 2) the
setbacks of the two new dwellings shall be staggered, to create a gradual
transition from the setback of one dwelling to the next, as indicated below:

Â 
4.Â Â Â Side Yard Exemptions and Modifications.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â When a side yard abuts a District boundary line, if the requirements of
the adjacent District are more restrictive than those of the District in which
the lot is contained, the width of the side yard shall not be less than that
required in the adjacent District. Where a lot in an Industrial or Business
District abuts a lot in a Residential District, the side yard shall be
increased by 3 feet for each story that the building exceeds the height limit
of the adjacent Residential District.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â When a lot is narrower than the width specified for the District in
which it is located, and the lot of record existed prior to the establishment
of this Ordinance, side yard width may be reduced by 3 inches for every foot
less than the width required in the District.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Side yards may be measured to the center line of adjoining alleys, but
when a side yard is required, no building or structure shall be erected within
5 feet of such alley.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â For corner lots, the side yard facing the side street shall be
functionally considered a front yard, subject to the same required setback as
the actual front yard.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â For corner lots of between 50 and 60 feet in width, the minimum
side yard setback shall be 20 feet from the side street lot line.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â For corner lots of less than 50 feet in width, the minimum side
yard setback for principal or accessory buildings shall be 13 feet from the
side street lot line.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Structures or projections into the side yard may be permitted as
follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Fire escapes, at least 3 feet from the side lot line.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Bay windows or balconies that project no further than 3 feet, and

requirements of this Ordinance.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The Board may call on the City departments for assistance in the
performance of its duties, and it shall be the duty of these departments to
render such assistance to the Board as may reasonably be required.
2.Â Â Â Applications and Appeals.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â An application to the Board of Adjustment, in cases in which it has
original jurisdiction under the provisions of this Ordinance, may be taken by
any property owner, including a tenant, or by governmental officer, department,
board or bureau.
Â Â Â Such application shall be filed with the Building Inspector, who shall
transmit all the fees, together with all plans, specifications and other papers
pertaining to the application to the Board.
Â Â Â Should the application be withdrawn prior to the publication of a legal

Â Â Â Should the appeal be withdrawn prior to the publication of a legal notice,
the fee will be returned upon written request of the applicant.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of an application
or an appeal. It shall give at least seven (7) daysâ€™ notice of the time and
place of such hearing by insertion in a newspaper of general circulation in the
community. It shall also, at least five (5) days prior to the hearing, mail
notices to the applicant or appellant, the Building Inspector, the owner(s) the
property in question, as well as all other properties within 300 feet of that
property. Any party may appear at such a hearing in person, or by agent or
attorney. The Board shall decide the application or appeal within a reasonable
time subsequent to the hearing.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Stay of Proceedings. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Building Inspector
certifies to the Board that by reason of facts stated in the certification, a
stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in the opinion of this
official. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed, unless order may, on
due cause shown, be granted by the Board on application, after notice to the
Building Inspector, or by a court record.
3.Â Â Â Powers of the Board of Adjustment. The Board shall have jurisdiction in
matters discussed in this Ordinance, and shall have the specific and general
powers described here.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Special Uses. In addition to permitting the special uses previously
specified in this ordinance, the Board shall have authority to permit the
following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Nonconforming Uses. The substitution for a nonconforming use,
provided that no structural alterations are made, other than those required by
law or ordinance. Any substituting use shall be of a classification that is
equally restrictive, or more restrictive than the nonconforming use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Temporary Uses and Permits. In otherwise undeveloped areas of the
City, a temporary use (as defined in Section
165.03) shall be incidental to, and encourage the future development of these
areas. The permit granted shall be temporary and revocable for a period of no
greater than 12 months, subject to such conditions necessary to safeguard the
public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Access Management on Arterial Streets.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Along certain segments of arterial streets, no development or
redevelopment of a directly adjacent property shall be permitted unless
approved as a Special Use. The specific street segments are included in the
figure below, and include portions of Agency Road, Gear Avenue, Mount Pleasant
Street, and Division Street. These street segments are located in areas largely
zoned for Business or Industrial uses. They also regularly carry high volumes
of through traffic, or are projected to do so in the near future. As such,
critical attention must be given to ensure the safety of access points for
individual properties along these roadways.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2022.png]
Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Before authorizing such a Special Use, the Board shall give due
consideration to the number, location, and design of existing and proposed
driveway(s) of the property and their consistency with all applicable driveway
construction standards, including the requirements of
Chapter 140 of this Code of Ordinances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The Board is authorized to impose such requirements and
conditions as is deemed necessary for the protection of neighboring properties
and the public interest, including, but not limited to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Shared access between 2 or more businesses in close proximity,
including consolidation of driveways, or the use of shared access parking lots
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Construction of a frontage or backage road, parallel to the
arterial street, for accessing multiple businesses
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Access restrictions in close proximity to a signalized intersection
(within 300 feet)
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Evaluation Process for Special Uses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Before authorizing a Special Use, the Board shall give due regard
to the nature and condition of all adjacent uses and structures, and their
consistency with the proposed use or development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The Board shall deny a Special Use if it determines any of the
following conditions to be true:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The proposed use is inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The proposed use would be considered hazardous, harmful, or
offensive, by reason of noise, smoke, odor, vibration, dust and dirt, cinders,
noxious gases, glare and heat, fire and safety hazards, sewage wastes and
pollution, transportation and traffic, aesthetic and psychological effects.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The proposed use would be substantially injurious to the present
or future use and enjoyment of properties in the immediate vicinity.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The proposed use would substantially diminish or impair property
values in the immediate vicinity.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â The proposed use would be detrimental to, or otherwise endanger
the public health, safety, comfort, morals or general welfare of the community.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The burden of proof that the proposed Special Use meets the
standards of this Ordinance rests solely with the applicant. If the applicant
fails to provide sufficient information and documentation that this is the
case, the Board shall deny the Special Use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The Board may utilize and give recognition to those performance
standards which are available in model codes or ordinances, or have been
developed by planning, engineering, or similar professional research
organizations, and can be applied to the proposed use to assist it in reaching
a fair and objective decision.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Upon authorization, the Board may impose such requirements and
conditions for the particular Special Use, as are deemed necessary for the
protection of adjacent properties and the public interest.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â A Special Use granted by the Board shall become null and void if
the use for which it was granted has ceased to be present for more than one
year.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Interpretation of Map. Where the street or lot layout actually on the
ground or as recorded, differs from the street and lot lines indicated on the
Zoning Map, the Board, after notice to the owners of the property and after
public hearing, shall interpret the map in such a way as to carry out the
intent and purposes of this Ordinance for the particular section or District in
question. Administrative Review. The Board has the power to hear and decide
appeals where it is alleged by the appellant that there is error in an order,
requirement, decision, grant or refusal made by the Building Inspector in the
enforcement of the provisions of the regulation.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Variances. In specific cases on appeal, the Board may authorize a
variance from the terms of the regulation, in situations where, owing to
special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the regulation
will result in unnecessary hardship for the applicant.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A variance may be appropriate in the following situations:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â A property is exceptionally narrow, shallow, or otherwise oddly
shaped, at the time of enactment of this Ordinance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The property has exceptional topographic conditions, such as an
excessive slope, or low elevation area prone to flooding.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The property has any other extraordinary and exceptional
conditions or characteristics, in which use or development of the property
would be heavily restricted by the literal enforcement of the provisions of
this ordinance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â In authorizing a variance, the Board may attach such conditions as
it may deem necessary to the enforcement of the Ordinance, regarding the
location, character and other features or the proposed building, structure, or
use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â No such variance shall be authorized by the Board unless it finds
beyond reasonable doubt that all of the following conditions exist:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The owner has been deprived of all beneficial or productive use
of their land, which cannot yield a reasonable return from any uses permitted
in that Zoning District.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances, and not
to the general conditions of the neighborhood or District.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The use to be authorized by the variance will not alter the
essential character of the neighborhood or District.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â No grant of variance shall be authorized unless the Board finds the
specific circumstance is not representative of a common occurrence, which is
likely to result in additional variance requests, to the extent that an
amendment to the Ordinance may be necessary, to address this matter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The Board shall have no power to authorize a variance for the
establishment of a nonconforming use where none previously existed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â In considering a request for a variance from the regulations
concerning signs, the Board shall give consideration and arrive at a finding on
the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Shape and area of the lot in question.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Bulk and floor area of the main building or structure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Setback of proposed sign from all property lines.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Zoning and use of surrounding lots.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Unusual or exceptional topography.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Compatibility with general intent of the Zoning Regulation to
encourage development without detracting from the use and enjoyment of
surrounding property.
4.Â Â Â Action of Board of Adjustment.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Appeals. Pursuant to a decision on appeal, in accordance with the
provisions of the Code of Iowa and of this Ordinance, the Board may reverse or
affirm â€“ wholly or partly â€“ or modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination being appealed from. It may also make any order, requirement,
decision or determination as ought to be made, in the opinion of the Board. To
that end, the Board has all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is
taken.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Variances. When authorizing a variance, no such action of the Board
shall become effective until it is reviewed by the Council, provided such
review occurs within thirty (30) days of such action. The Council may remand
any decision to the Board for further study. The effective date of any action
so remanded shall be 30 days from the date of the remand.
5.Â Â Â Judicial Review. All final administrative decisions of the Board of
Adjustment shall be subject to judicial review pursuant to the provisions of,
and all amendments and modifications to Chapter 414 of the Code of Iowa.
165.25 ENFORCEMENT AND DUTIES OF BUILDING INSPECTOR.

may be necessary for the enforcement of the Ordinance.
One copy of such plans shall be signed and returned to the applicant when
approved by the Building Inspector, together with such permit as may be
granted.
2.Â Â Â Prior to building construction, lot pins shall be set based on the actual
survey by a registered Iowa land surveyor. They shall be reset in the proper
location, if disturbed by construction or grading work.
3.Â Â Â Certificate of Occupancy.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Before using any building, or portion of building hereafter created,
erected, changed, converted or enlarged in use or structure, a Certificate of
Occupancy shall be obtained from the Building Inspector. Such Certificate shall
show that such building, or portion of building, and its proposed use conform
to the provisions of this Ordinance.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Temporary Certificate. If the Building Official determines that no
substantial hazard will result from the occupancy of a portion of building,
prior to the completed construction of the entire building, a Temporary
Certificate of Occupancy may be issued. This certificate may be used for one or
more portions of a building or structure, in the period leading up to the
completion of the entire building or structure.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Posting. The Certificate of Occupancy shall be posted in a conspicuous
place on the premises, and shall not be removed except by the Building
Official.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Revocation. The Building Official may, in writing, suspend or revoke a
Certificate of Occupancy issued under the provisions of this Code, under the
following conditions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The Certificate is issued in error.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The Certificate was issued on the basis of incorrect information
being supplied.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â It is determined that the building, structure, or portion of
building or structure, is in violation of any Ordinance, or any of the
provisions of this Code.
4.Â Â Â Any person violating any provision of this Ordinance shall be guilty of a
municipal infraction, as defined by Section
3.01 of this Code of Ordinances, and such person shall be deemed guilty of a
separate offense for each and every day, or portion of a day, during which such
violation is committed, continued, or permitted, and upon finding that a
municipal infraction has occurred, shall be fined in accordance with Section
364.22(1) of the Code of Iowa,Â for this and subsequent or continuing
violations.
5.Â Â Â In case any building or structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed,
altered, repaired, converted or maintained, or any building, structure, or land
is used in violation of the provisions of this Ordinance, the City Attorney, in
addition to other remedies under the Code of Iowa, is hereby authorized to
institute an action to enjoin, or any other appropriate action or proceeding to
prevent such erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair,
conversion, maintenance or use.
165.26 AMENDMENTS TO ZONING ORDINANCE AND MAP
1.Â Â Â In accordance with the provisions of Chapter 414, of the Code of Iowa, the
City Council may, from time to time, make amendments to the specific
regulations of the Zoning Ordinance. It may also amend the Zoning Map, by
regulating the number, shape or area of the Districts previously established.
No such amendment shall become effective, unless the proposed change(s)
involved are first submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission for their
approval. The Commission shall be allowed a reasonable period of time â€“ no less
than 30 days â€“ to review and report on these matters.
2.Â Â Â Public Hearing and Notice. Before submitting its recommendation and report
to the City Council, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold a public
hearing on the proposed amendment, supplement or change.
It shall provide a notice of the time and place of such hearing, no less than
seven (7), and no more than thirty (30) days prior to the hearing, by
publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the community. It shall
also mail notices to all property owners directly involved, or within 300 feet
of the area affected by the amendment.
3.Â Â Â Public Petition. Any person desiring a change in the Zoning of property
may submit a petition to request such a change. In doing so, they shall
accompany this petition with a fee in the amount of $45.00, to cover the cost
of processing the application. Should the application be withdrawn prior to the
publication of a legal notice, this fee will be returned upon written request
of the applicant.
4.Â Â Â Public Viewing of Materials. During the seven (7) days prior to the public
hearing, the text of the proposed amendment, along with any relevant maps or
plans, shall be provided for public examination â€“ online, and in a physical
copy, available in the office of the City Clerk.
5.Â Â Â No regulation which differs from the recommendation made by the Planning
and Zoning Commission shall become effective unless passed by not less than
three-fourths (3/4) of all members of the City Council.
6.Â Â Â Public Protest. If a written protest against a proposed amendment is
submitted to the City Clerk, and is signed and acknowledged by the owners of 20
percent or more of all properties directly affected by the amendment, combined
with any properties within 300 feet of this area, such amendment shall not
become effective, unless approved by a vote of three-fourths (3/4) of all
members of the City Council.
7.Â Â Â Omission from Notification. This section is intended to maximize the
exposure of a proposed amendment to the Zoning Ordinance, to all persons who
may be substantially interested in such a change. If the name of a property
owner was unintentionally omitted from the notification list, this shall not
invalidate the passing of an amendment, as long as the omission was not
intentional.

170.17 EXEMPTIONS AND MODIFICATIONS.
1.Â Â Â Planned Unit Developments (PUD). In the case of a Planned Unit
Development, the design principles and minimum requirements for subdivision
layout may be modified by the Planning and Zoning Commission, based on their
judgment that the PUD makes adequate provision for all essential community
requirements. However, no modification shall be granted which would conflict
with the proposals of the Transportation Plan, Community Facilities Plan or the
adopted Comprehensive Plan.
2.Â Â Â Unusual Conditions. In any particular case where the subdivider can show
that by reason of unusual topographic or other physical conditions, strict
compliance with any requirements of the regulations could cause practical
difficulty or exceptional or undue hardship, or in subdivisions lying in the
two-mile jurisdiction outside the City limits, where the purpose of subdivision
does not involve housing development or other intensive land use, the Planning
and Zoning Commission may relax such requirement to the extent deemed just and
proper, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided such relief may
be granted without detriment to the public good, and without impairing the
intent and purposes of the regulations or the desirable general development of
the City in accordance with the adopted Planning and Zoning Regulations of the
City. Any modification thus granted shall be entered in the minutes of the
Commission, setting forth the reasons which, in the opinion of the Commission,
justified the modification.
3.Â Â Â Preliminary Plats for Small Subdivisions. In the case of a subdivision of
less than five (5) lots and where the lots can be adequately served by existing
streets, situated in a location where conditions are well defined, the
Commission may exempt the subdivider from complying with some of the
requirements stipulated in this section pertaining to the preparation of the
Preliminary Plat.
4.Â Â Â Simple Replatting. The realignment, combining or dividing of lots in an
approved subdivision may be carried out by simple replatting, in final plat
form, provided all modifications conform with requirements of current zoning
and subdivision regulations, with approval of the Commission and the City
Council.
5.Â Â Â Extraterritorial Jurisdiction â€“ Subdivision Review. The Extraterritorial
Subdivision Review Area of the City of West Burlington is the area of
unincorporated land within 2 miles of the City limits, over which the City has
the authority to review all subdivisions of land, pursuant to Section 354.9 of
the Code of Iowa. As the Cities of Burlington and Middletown are granted the
same authority over land within 2 miles of their City limits, the City of West
Burlington has entered into agreements with both of these municipalities, which
define the mutually accepted boundaries between the Subdivision Review Areas of
each 14 . Neither of these Cities has authority over land lying within the Iowa
Army Ammunition Plant, which is exclusively the property of the United States
Government. The precise boundaries of the Subdivision Review Area are indicated
on the map titled â€œExtraterritorial Subdivision Review Area.â€
Â Â Â Subdivisions lying within the Cityâ€™s Extraterritorial Subdivision Review
Area shall follow the above procedures, subject to the following modifications:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Requirement for topographic survey data with two-foot intervals may be
waived in the following circumstances:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â It is a simple division required for estate settlement, with no
proposed use of the land for further development purposes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A single lot is being delineated for residential purposes, and the
remaining portion will not be subdivided for development purposes.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Setbacks shall meet the requirements of the A-1 Agricultural District
(See Section
165.05 of the Zoning Regulations).
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â In areas not served by sanitary sewer, the minimum lot area shall be
20,000 square feet.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Street frontages shall be no less than 50 feet in width, in accordance
with the requirements of the R-1 Rural Estate Residence District.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â â€œMinor Subdivisionsâ€.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â When a subdivision of land does not involve the creation of new
streets, roadways or public utility extensions, and where each lot transfer
occurs either between close family relations, and/or adjoining property owners,
the plat may be considered a â€œminor subdivision platâ€, and be approved
administratively by agreement and written consent and signature of the City
Administrator.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â In such case, the approval of the full Planning and Zoning Board
shall be waived, and public hearing requirements shall also be waived unless
such a hearing is requested by the City Council prior to approval.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A single driveway shall not serve more than two (2) individual lots
developed for single-family residential or agricultural purposes. 15
Accordingly, if any additional driveways require the extension of a street, for
access to a subdivided parcel, then this shall not be considered a â€œminor
subdivisionâ€.
Â

Preliminary Plat or Preliminary Replat to the Commission. No approval of any
such preliminary platting shall be given unless said fees have been paid in
full.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A final plat fee shall be paid upon presentation of the final plat, or
final replat to the Commission. No final approval shall be given any such final
platting unless said fees have been paid in full.

170.20 GENERAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
In laying out a subdivision, the subdivider shall comply with the general
principles and requirements set forth in this Ordinance.
170.21 CONFORMITY OF DESIGN STANDARDS TO CITY PLANS AND REQUIREMENTS.
1.Â Â Â The layout must conform to the transportation plan, other parts of the
adopted Comprehensive City Plan and other adopted regulations of the City.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Whenever a tract to be subdivided embraces any part of a primary or
secondary arterial or collector street, so designated on the City plan, this
part of the public right-of-way must be platted by the subdivider in the
location and at the width indicated on the plan.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where a proposed park, playground or other recreational area, proposed
school site or other public ground, shown on the adopted community facilities
plan or other adopted part of the City plan, is located in whole or in part
within the proposed subdivision, such proposed public ground or part, if not
dedicated to the City, Board of Education or other public agency, must be
reserved and no action taken on the subdivision for a period of no less than
ninety (90) days to allow the City or other public agency the opportunity to
consider and take action toward acquisition of such public ground or part by
purchase or other means. If the responsible agency does not take action to
acquire such land, the subdivider may then use the land for any purpose
permitted in that particular zoning district.
2.Â Â Â Where considered desirable by the subdivider, and held appropriate by the
Commission, suitably located open spaces of adequate size may be provided for
neighborhood parks, playgrounds or other recreational facilities. These spaces,
if not dedicated to the public and accepted by the appropriate public body, may
be reserved for the common use of all property owners in the proposed
subdivision by covenant in the deeds.
3.Â Â Â In proposed subdivisions of 20 or more lots, the developer shall provide
an open space equivalent in area of, at least, the average area of the lots of
the subdivision, in a suitable location for park, playground or recreational
purposes for the neighborhood and/or the community. Such area may be dedicated
for public use or may be reserved for the common use of all property owners in
the proposed subdivision by covenant in their deeds.
170.22 STREET AND BLOCK LAYOUT.
1.Â Â Â The street layout of the subdivision shall be in general conformity with a
plan for the most advantageous development of adjoining and nearby areas.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where appropriate to the design, proposed streets shall be continuous
and in alignment with existing, planned or platted streets with which they are
to connect.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract
to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical condition,
in order to ensure the orderly future development of adjacent tracts. If, in
the opinion of the Commission, such street extension is not necessary or
desirable for the circumstances of the development in question, this
requirement may be waived. Cul-de-sacs of reasonable length will be approved
where topography necessitates, or where they are appropriate for the type of
development envisioned, and where adequate fire protection can be assured.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Proposed streets shall intersect one another as nearly at right angles
as topography and other limiting factors of good design permit.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â When an existing street and/or alley terminates in mid-block, the
subdivision of the adjoining land shall include the platted extension of that
street and/or alley, up to the subsequent intersecting street.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Alleys shall be platted:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â In the rear of all commercial business lots.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â In the rear of residential lots fronting on arterial streets
(unless service roads are provided in front), as a means of providing safe
access to such lots.
2.Â Â Â Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of
appropriate depth, at least 100 feet, unless, in the opinion of the Commission,
prevented by exceptional topography or other physical conditions.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The lengths of blocks shall be such as are appropriate, in the opinion
of the Commission, for the locality and the type of development contemplated,
but shall not exceed 1,200 feet.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In any block over 700 feet in length, the Commission may require that a
crosswalk or pedestrian way, no less than 10 feet wide, be provided near the
center and entirely across such block.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed 500 feet in length, measured along the
centerline from the intersection at origin through the end of the circle to the
end of the right-of-way in subdivisions protected by a fire hydrant system.
In areas outside the City limits and within the extraterritorial planning
jurisdiction, cul-de-sac dimensions shall be reasonable with regard to access
for utilities, fire control and maintenance.
3.Â Â Â In areas within the extraterritorial planning jurisdiction, blocks laid
out in random manner shall conform to regulations specified for the R-1 Rural
Estate Residence District (Section
165.07).
170.23 RIGHT-OF-WAY WIDTHS AND EASEMENTS.
Minimum right-of-way widths of streets, alleys, and easements for utilities
shall be:
1.Â Â Â Primary thoroughfares (as designated on the transportation plan), no less
than 80 feet wide in any case.
2.Â Â Â Secondary thoroughfares, (as designated on the transportation plan), no
less than 60 feet wide in any case.
3.Â Â Â Collector or local streets; minor streets and cul-de-sacs, 50 feet wide.
4.Â Â Â All dead-end streets shall terminate in a circular turnaround having a
minimum right-of-way diameter of 120 feet. Illustrations of the methods of
street termination are on file for public use in the office of the Clerk.
5.Â Â Â Alleys and service drives, 16 feet wide.
6.Â Â Â Easements for utilities, where required, should be at least 10 feet wide,
centered on rear or side lot lines.
170.24 PAVEMENT WIDTHS.
The portion of the pavement required to be installed as the subdividerâ€™s
responsibility shall be as follows:
1.Â Â Â As designated on the transportation plan:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Primary arterial thoroughfares shall be 39 feet wide, back to back of
curbs;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Secondary arterial thoroughfares and collector streets shall be 29 feet
wide, back to back of curbs;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Local or minor streets shall be 24 feet wide, back to back of curbs.
Overall pavement widths shall be as designated by the transportation plan, and
the differences, if any, between the cost of the portion to be provided at the
expense of the subdivider and that of the total width designated by the
transportation plan shall be borne by the City, unless it is determined by the
Commission that such greater width will benefit the subdivider in proportion to
its cost; provided, however, the cost of curb and gutter should be borne by the
subdivider in any case. The pavement of a turning circle at the end of a cul-
de-sac shall have a minimum outside diameter of 100 feet. A â€œTâ€ or â€œYâ€ shaped
paved space, when approved by the Commission, may be used as a temporary
measure at the end of a dead-end street until such time as the street is
continued.
2.Â Â Â Alleys and service drives: minimum pavement 4 feet less than dedicated
right-of-way.
170.25 STREET GRADES, CURVES AND SIGHT DISTANCES.
1.Â Â Â The grades of streets shall not be less than 0.5 percent, or exceed the
following:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Primary and secondary thoroughfares, designated as such on the
transportation plan, five percent unless prevented by topography;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Collector, minor and local streets, service drives, and alleys, ten
percent.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Pedestrian ways or crosswalks: Not to vary more than three percent from
adjoining roadway, unless acceptably designed steps are to be provided.
2.Â Â Â All changes in street grades above one percent shall be connected by
vertical curves of a minimum length equal to 30 times the algebraic difference
in the rate of grade for thoroughfares and one-half of this minimum for all
other streets.
3.Â Â Â The radii of curvature on the centerline shall not be less than the
following:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Thoroughfares, 350 feet;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Local streets, minor streets, service drives and alleys, 150 feet.
170.26 INTERSECTIONS.
1.Â Â Â Curb returns at street intersections shall be rounded by radii of at least
25 feet.
2.Â Â Â Streets shall intersect at as close to a 90 degree angle as possible. The
above minimum radii shall be increased where the angle of intersection is less
than 90 degrees.
170.27 LOTS.
1.Â Â Â The size, shape, and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the
location of the proposed subdivision and for the type of development
contemplated, and shall follow the guidelines of all zoning regulations.
2.Â Â Â Ordinarily, lots with excessive depth, in relation to width, shall be
avoided.
3.Â Â Â Every lot shall abut on a public right-of-way dedicated as a street. If a
subdivision utilizes a privately maintained driveway for its primary access,
such a driveway shall meet the same required right-of-way width as a public
street, and be maintained as a durable and dust-free surface.
4.Â Â Â Lots for residence purposes, other than cul-de-sacs, shall be at least 50
feet wide at the front lot line, in order to permit compliance with the side
yard requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, and still be adequate for a building
of reasonable width. Lots fronting cul-de-sacs shall be at least 37Â½ feet wide.
5.Â Â Â Lots larger than the minimum called for by the Zoning Regulations may be
required where topographic or other considerations may limit the buildable or
usable portion of such lots. This is especially applicable where a septic
system is required for sewage disposal.
6.Â Â Â Corner lots for residential use should ordinarily be platted at a minimum
of 15 feet wider than interior (non-corner) lots, in order to permit
conformance with the setback required by for the side street.
7.Â Â Â Residential lots fronting on highways and major arterial streets should
have extra depth to allow a comfortable separation between buildings and
traffic flow.
8.Â Â Â Situations should be avoided where individual lots have both front and
rear street frontage, or the only frontage is to the rear of the residence.
9.Â Â Â Side lot lines shall be at approximate right angles to the right-of-way
line of the street on which the lot fronts. If other than a right angle, lots
should be wider, in order to provide adequate side yard setbacks for buildings
that could be constructed on lots at right angles to the front property line.
10.Â Â Â Front lot lines on curved streets shall be radial to the right-of-way
line of the street on which the lot fronts.
170.28 STREETS, SIDEWALKS AND ALLEYS.
1.Â Â Â When improvements are to be installed, construction plans shall be
prepared by a registered Iowa Professional Engineer, whose seal shall appear
thereon, and a reproducible copy on film or other permanent material, plus two
prints furnished, in accordance with specifications approved by the City
Engineer, and shall be revised as may be necessary and receive approval of the
City Engineer and other agencies having jurisdiction before improvements are
installed. Construction plans shall be provided, as follows, at a minimum:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Plan and profile of each street with grades indicated and horizontal
and vertical curve data provided;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Typical cross-section of each proposed street, at a horizontal and
vertical scale of 5 feet or less to the inch, showing the width of pavement,
the location and width of any sidewalks, and the location of utility mains.
Cross-sections for each street shall be furnished at hundred-foot intervals or
less. These sections shall be at a horizontal scale of 10 feet or less per inch
and a vertical scale of 5 feet or less per inch.
2.Â Â Â Streets shall be graded to full right-of-way width. The surfacing in
residential areas of collector, minor, or local streets shall be 7 inches of
Portland cement concrete or equivalent as approved by the City Engineer.
Surfacing of collector, minor and local streets in business areas shall be 8
inches of Portland cement concrete or equivalent as approved by the City
Engineer. Surfacing of all streets in industrial areas shall be no less than 9
inches of Portland cement concrete. Surfacing of primary and secondary arterial
streets shall be not less than 8 inches of Portland cement concrete. Surfacing
of local streets in R-1 Residential Districts shall be made in accordance with
zoning regulations for those districts, with approval of the City Engineer.
3.Â Â Â Sidewalks shall be constructed of Portland cement concrete, no less than 4
inches thick, and no less than 4 feet in width, on both sides of every street
in accordance with standards and specifications approved by the Planning and
Zoning Commission and City Engineer. Sidewalks may be waived by the Council
upon recommendation of the Commission in the R-1 Rural Estate Residence
District, where lots are at least 20,000 square feet in area and lot width is
at least 100 feet. They may also be waived in business and industrial areas
where pedestrian traffic is infrequent or nonexistent, and not likely to
increase as a result of anticipated development.
4.Â Â Â Alleys and service drives shall be graded to the full width of the right-
of-way, and shall be provided with an all-weather surface satisfactory to the
City Engineer. Such paved width shall be 4 feet less than the dedicated right-
of-way unless otherwise specified.
170.29 WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.
Every subdivision shall be provided with a complete water distribution system
adequate to serve the area being platted, including a service connection to
within one foot of each lot, and appropriately spaced fire hydrants. The entire
water system shall be designed to meet the approval of the City Engineer and
the State Department of Natural Resources. Plans shall be provided, showing the
location of the water distribution system, pipe sizes and the location of
valves and hydrants, along with calculations on anticipated fire-flow
capacities.
170.30 SANITARY SEWAGE DISPOSAL.
In every subdivision, provision shall be made for the satisfactory disposal of
sanitary sewage:
1.Â Â Â Where a public sanitary sewer main is reasonably accessible, in the
opinion of the Commission, the subdivision shall be provided with a complete
sanitary sewer system connected with such sewer main, including a service
connection to within one foot of a lot line of each lot. Such system shall be
approved by the City Engineer and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.
2.Â Â Â Where a public sanitary sewer main is not reasonably accessible, in the
opinion of the Commission, proper provisions shall be made for the disposal of
sanitary waste, subject to approval of the City Engineer. If individual
disposal systems are provided, they shall be located on each lot.
3.Â Â Â When an individual septic disposal system is proposed, the subdivider
shall determine whether or not this is feasible, based on the criteria of soil
absorption, surface drainage, and topography. At least two percolation tests
shall be made on each lot at the approximate location of the septic system
absorption field. Such tests shall be performed in accord with the requirements
of the Commission, City Engineer and the County Health Department. The results
of these tests shall be certified by a registered Iowa Professional Engineer
and made known to the City Engineer, the Commission, and the County Health
Department.
4.Â Â Â Wherever excavation for storm sewer, sanitary sewer, and/or water mains
and associated infrastructure may lie beneath existing or proposed pavement,
sidewalk or drive area, such excavation shall be backfilled by a method and
with material of a type approved by the City Engineer.
170.31 UTILITIES.
Poles or underground conduits for electric lights, telephone lines or other
utilities shall be placed in easements provided along rear or side lot lines,
wherever this is feasible.
170.32 STORM SEWERS AND DRAINAGE.
1.Â Â Â Every subdivision shall be provided with a storm water sewer or drainage
system that is capable of sustaining a five-year design storm, or otherwise
meeting the approval of the City Engineer:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Storm sewers shall have grade and size indicated;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A complete grading/drainage plan shall be provided;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Drainage calculations shall be submitted for review.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Drainage easements shall be provided wherever any stream or surface
water channel is located in the area being subdivided.
2.Â Â Â The developer shall provide sufficient plans and site improvements to
ensure that, when completed, the new subdivision will not increase the amount
of storm water runoff onto adjacent and downstream properties, as determined by
engineering studies. This may include the creation of retention or detention
ponds, at strategically placed locations within the subdivision.
3.Â Â Â In areas with especially steep slope or poorly drained soils, these
topographical and geological limitations shall be incorporated into the
physical layout of the subdivision, influencing such factors as the shape,
size, and dimensions of land parcels.
4.Â Â Â For additional regulations regarding storm water drainage and private
development, see Section
165.21 of the Zoning Regulations.
