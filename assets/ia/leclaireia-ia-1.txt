1.10   INDEMNITY.
The applicant for any permit or license under this Code of Ordinances, by

of any person or persons whomsoever, and any loss of or damage to property
whatsoever, including all costs and expenses incident thereto, however arising
from or related to, directly, indirectly, or remotely, the issuance of the
permit or license, or the doing of anything thereunder, or the failure of such
applicant, or the agents, employees, or servants of such applicant, to abide by
or comply with any of the provisions of this Code of Ordinances or the terms
and conditions of such permit or license, and such applicant, by making such
application, forever agrees to indemnify the City and its officers, agents, and

action by the City against any person so notified, as to the existence of the
defect or other cause of the injury or damage, as to the liability of the City
to the plaintiff in the first named action, and as to the amount of the damage

County, pursuant to Section 808.14 of the Code of Iowa, for an administrative

warrant, to permit entry therein by the municipal officer or employee.

Whenever this Code of Ordinances grants any discretionary power to the Council
or any commission, board, or officer or employee of the City and does not
specify standards to govern the exercise of the power, the power shall be
exercised in light of the following standard: The discretionary power to grant,
deny, or revoke any matter shall be considered in light of the facts and
circumstances then existing and as may be reasonably foreseeable, and due

similar circumstances in the exercise of the police power.

1.16   PENDING SUITS.
No new ordinance shall be construed or held to repeal a former ordinance,
whether such former ordinance is expressly repealed or not, as to any offense
committed against such former ordinance or as to any act done, any penalty,
forfeiture, or punishment so incurred, or any right accrued or claim arising
under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any such offense
or act so committed or so done, or any penalty, forfeiture, or punishment so
incurred or any right accrued or claim arising before the new ordinance takes
effect, save only that the proceedings thereafter shall conform to the
ordinance in force at the time of such proceeding, so far as practicable. If
any penalty, forfeiture, or punishment be mitigated by any provision of a new
ordinance, such provision may be, by the consent of the party affected, applied
to any judgment announced after the new ordinance takes effect. This section
shall extend to all repeals, whether by express words or implication, whether
the repeal is in the ordinance making any new provisions upon the same subject
or in any other ordinance. Nothing contained in this or the preceding sections
shall be construed as abating any action now pending under or by virtue of any
general ordinance of the City herein repealed, or as discontinuing, abating,
modifying, or altering any penalty, any penalty accrued or to accrue, or as
affecting the liability of any person, firm, or corporation, or as waiving any
right of the City under the ordinance or provision thereof in force at the time
of passage of this ordinance.

authority of the City to enforce the provisions of this Code of Ordinances by
criminal sanctions or other lawful means.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.22[12])

violations of this Code of Ordinances, and/or any ordinance or code herein
adopted by reference, the City Administrator is hereby authorized to record
with the Scott County Recorder’s office a “Certificate of Non-Compliance” lien.
Said lien may be recorded after notice has been served on the owner of record
of a property where a violation has occurred or allowed to exist. The notice
shall state the nature of the violation(s), the actions needed to correct the
violation(s), and the timeframe within which the violation(s) must be corrected
prior to the issuance of the lien. The lien shall remain in full force and

  or purchase, and when this combined value satisfies at least one or more of
  the above-listed criteria.
7.06   FUNDS, EXPENDITURES, AND PURCHASING CONTROLS.
City funds, expenditures, and purchasing controls shall be administered and
maintained by the City Administrator, City Clerk/Treasurer, and Department
Heads in accordance with the provisions of Section 384, Division II of the Code
of Iowa, as amended, and the following specific provisions:

employee except as is hereinafter provided.
2.   As of July 1, of each year, the City Administrator and Department Heads
may administer and expend their respective budget appropriations as approved by

flow and should conform with the purchasing authority as spelled out herein.
3.   The City Administrator and/or Department Heads may authorize and approve
budgeted expenditures of any kind up to a maximum of $10,000.00 without
additional Council review. Any expenditure over this amount will require
additional, specific, formal review, and reauthorization by the Council. The
Council may, by separate resolution, lower this maximum expenditure threshold
at any time to insure the continued sound financial management of the City as
it deems necessary.
4.   The City Administrator, working with the respective department heads and

for formal consideration.
5.   Any transfers between funds shall be considered by formal resolution only.

vendors. If an item is a proprietary product, this provision may be waived.

the Council. Proposals shall be taken from at least three qualified,
responsible bidders. Contracts over $10,000.00 shall be reviewed and acted upon

any singular or cumulative purchases exceeding $2,500.00. The City
Administrator shall develop the necessary administrative policies and
safeguards needed to effect the provisions of this subsection.

four-fifths majority vote of the Council. Should an individual be relieved of
their duties as Police Chief, for other than illegal or serious, major
violations of the LeClaire Police Rules and Regulations Manual, or the LeClaire
Human Resources Guidelines Manual, they shall automatically assume the regular
duties of the position that they held prior to the appointment as Police Chief
with the corresponding wage adjustments as provided in the LeClaire Human
Resources Guidelines Manual. In the event that an individual from within

Resources Guidelines Manual. In the event that an individual is hired from
outside the existing City police personnel to serve in the capacity of Police
Chief, and this eligible individual (as defined in the previous paragraph), who
was demoted decides not to seek employment elsewhere, the individual with the
least number of years of service on the department at that time, including the
recently demoted Police Chief, may be laid off from employment with the City,
unless the Council finds it necessary to increase the number of members
employed by the department. The establishment of this provision shall, in no
way, prevent dismissal for illegal activities or for serious major violations

Resources Guidelines Manual.

waters, the responsible person shall cause the condition to be remedied by a
cleanup, as defined in the preceding section, as rapidly as feasible to an

the present danger to the public health, safety, and welfare, then no notice
shall be required, and the City may proceed to procure the cleanup and bill the
responsible person for all costs associated with the cleanup. If the bill for
those services is not paid within 30 days, the City Attorney shall proceed to

knowingly to permit or to allow a minor to be in any public place in the City
within the time periods prohibited by this section unless the minor’s presence
falls within one of the above exceptions.
5.   Enforcement Procedures.
   A.   Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in the
absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driver’s license,
a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance, use his
or her best judgment in determining age.
   B.   Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody. Grounds for arrest are that
the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the person’s
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any nonsecured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into
custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.
   C.   Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into custody,
the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the minor as
soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible for the
minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at such
time as the court may direct.
   D.   Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minor’s parent, guardian or other person
legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the
law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative
of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person
who is known to the child.
6.   Penalties.
   A.   Responsible Adult’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation
by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall, by certified mail, send to the
adult responsible for the minor, written notice of the violation with a warning
that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew
ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with applicable
penalties.
   B.   Responsible Adult’s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as defined
in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows the minor
to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a municipal
infraction.
   C.   Minor’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a minor,
the law enforcement officer shall give the minor a written warning, which
states that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the
curfew ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with applicable
penalties, or, at the law enforcement officer’s discretion, may issue the minor
a citation for a first violation.
   D.   Minor’s Second Violation. For the minor’s second and subsequent
violations of any of the provisions of this section, the minor is guilty of a
municipal infraction.
46.02   CIGARETTES AND TOBACCO.
It is unlawful for any person under 21 years of age to smoke, use, possess,
purchase, or attempt to purchase any tobacco, tobacco products, alternative
nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes. Possession of tobacco,
tobacco products, alternative nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes
by an individual under 21 years of age shall not constitute a violation of this
section if the individual under 21 years of age possesses the tobacco, tobacco
products, alternative nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes as part
of the person’s employment and said person is employed by a person who holds a
valid permit under Chapter 453A of the Code of Iowa or who lawfully offers for

“Delivered” shall mean the day that the notice is placed in the U.S. mail for
processing. Commencement of any abatement activities shall begin no sooner than

notice to be given for the entire year (season). The City will not notify a
property owner every time a property becomes a nuisance violation.

mail in late March to all property owners who had at least one weed violation
in the previous year.

subsequent violations are observed after receiving either a reminder or first-
time notice, the City will immediately abate the nuisance with no further
notice and “administrative charges” (see below) may be added to the abatement
costs.
4.   An additional “administrative charge” (as determined by resolution of the
Council) will be added to any “repeat” violations on properties where weed
violations were abated and who were previously notified within the past two
years.

citation should be rescinded. Within 30 days after the City receives such a
challenge, the City shall notify the vehicle owner whether the challenge to the

facilities therein, and to connect such facilities directly with the proper
public sewer in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, within 60 days
from the date of receipt of the official written notice to do so, provided that
said public sewer is within 200 feet of the property line, is readily and
reasonably available, and does not require the need to obtain easements or
other encumbrances caused by the passage through property owned by another, or
require an addition to the existing main, if the City deems that such addition
is necessary for said connection.
96.02   BUILDING LATERAL INSTALLATION PERMIT REQUIRED.
No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connections with or opening
into, use, alter, or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof without
first obtaining a written permit from the City. Before or in conjunction with

connection or reconnection with the public sewer system, a written permit must
be obtained from the City. The application shall be filed with the City on
blanks furnished by the City. The application shall include any and all
information deemed necessary by the City to adequately describe the work being
done, protect the property owner’s and the City’s interests in the work being
performed, and to serve as a permanent utility record of the pertinent
information involved with the building lateral. The permit application shall be
supplemented by any plans, specifications, or other information deemed
necessary to affect the intent of the foregoing statement. The City shall issue
the permit if the proposed work meets all the requirements of this chapter and

supplemented by any plans, specifications, or other information considered
pertinent in the judgment of the City. At such time as an application for a
building lateral installation/ connection permit is filed with the City, a
permit and inspection fee shall be paid to the City in the following amounts:
1.   For each new residential connection, a permit request shall be accompanied
by a fee as established by resolution of the Council, except as specifically
noted otherwise herein.
2.   For each existing residential reconnection† 4 , a permit request shall be
accompanied by a fee as established by resolution of the Council, except as
specifically noted otherwise herein.
3.   For each new commercial or industrial connection, a permit request shall
be accompanied by a fee as established by resolution of the Council, except as
specifically noted otherwise herein.

made sufficient showing that due to conditions beyond the applicant’s control
or peculiar hardship the period of time set forth for the completion of the
connection shall be inequitable or unfair to the applicant, an extension of
time within which to comply with the provisions herewith may be granted.
96.05   INSPECTION REQUIRED.
All new, first-time connections with the public sewer system before being
covered, shall be inspected and approved, in writing, by the City. As soon as
all pipe work from the public sewer system to inside the building has been
completed and before any backfilling is done, the City shall be notified and
shall cause to be inspected the work as to workmanship and material. No sewer
service pipe laid underground shall be covered or trenches filled until after

sewer main, the person doing the work shall submit to the City an executed Hold
Harmless and Waiver of Liability Statement on a form supplied by the City and a
License and Permit Bond in an amount not less than $10,000.00. Said bond shall
be obtained from and secured by a responsible surety bonding company authorized
to operate within the State, conditioned to indemnify and save the City
harmless against all losses or damages that may arise from or be occasioned by
the making of connections with the public sewer main, or excavations therefore,
or by carelessness, negligence, or unskillfulness in making the same.
96.09   TAPPING MAINS.
All taps into public sewer mains shall be made by an approved contractor and in
accordance with the following:
1.   Connection of the building lateral into the public sewer main shall be

banded, saddle w/hub attached to the main. No building laterals will be
installed directly into any hole cut into the public sewer main. The invert of
the building lateral at the point of connection shall be at the same or a
higher elevation than the invert of the public sewer. A smooth, neat joint
shall be made, and the connection shall be made secure and watertight by
encasement in concrete or by some other method approved by the Inspector.
Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the City.
At no time shall a building lateral be constructed so as to enter a manhole
unless special written permission is received from the City and then only in
accordance with any special conditions as may be required by the City.
2.   A separate and independent building lateral shall be provided for every
building, except where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, courtyard, or driveway. The building
lateral from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the
whole considered as one building lateral, provided, however, that the minimum
size shall then be not less than six inches for the building sewer lateral. Any
multi-family or multi-use structure may utilize one building lateral sized
accordingly, but in no case shall it be less than six inches in diameter.
3.   An accurate and dimensional sketch showing the exact location of the tap
and lateral routing shall be filed with the City and attached to or recorded on
the permanent application form.
96.10   CONNECTION REQUIREMENTS.
The installation of the building sewer and its connection to the public sewer
shall conform to the requirements of the Uniform Plumbing Code, the current
edition of SUDAS as adopted by the City in
Chapter 163, the laws of the State, and other applicable rules and regulations
of the City. Old building laterals may be used in connection with new building
construction only when they are found, on examination and test by the City, to
meet all requirements of this chapter.
96.11   COMPLETION BY THE CITY.
Should any excavation be left open or only partially refilled for more than 24
hours after the building lateral is installed and connected with the sewer
system, or should the work be improperly done and not approved, the City shall
have the right to finish or correct the work, and the City may assess the costs
to the property owner. If the contractor is responsible for the uncompleted or
improperly completed work, said contractor must reimburse the City any and all
associated costs incurred in remedying the situation before the contractor will
be granted another installation/construction permit. If the property owner is
assessed, such assessment shall be collected with and in the same manner as
general property taxes. Any such condition is hereby deemed to be a nuisance
and as such may be abated per the process as defined in
Chapter 50 of this Code of Ordinances.
96.12   DEPTH REQUIREMENT.
Whenever possible, the building lateral shall be brought to the building at an
elevation below the basement floor. The depth of cover above the sewer shall be
sufficient to afford protection from frost, and in all cases shall be a minimum
of 12 inches below the finished grade. In all buildings in which any building
drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer main, sanitary
sewer carried by such building drain may be lifted by an approved means and
discharged to the building lateral. (See Section
96.16.)
96.13   STORMWATER.
No person shall make a connection of roof downspouts, interior and exterior
foundation drains, areaway drains, garage floor drains, or other sources of
surface run-off or groundwater to a building lateral or building drain which in
turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.
96.14   OWNER’S RESPONSIBILITY.
All costs and expense incident to the installation and connection of the
building lateral and associated appurtenances to the public sewer main shall be
borne by the property owner. The property owner shall indemnify the City from
any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the
installation of the building lateral. It shall be the responsibility of the
property owner of the property connected to the public sewer system to keep in
good repair, operable, and free of any leaks the building lateral and
associated appurtenances whether located upon private property or in the public
right-of-way. When any building lateral and/or associated appurtenances become
defective and create a nuisance in violation of this code, the nuisance shall
be corrected at the property owner’s expense within 30 days after the date of
receipt of official notice from the City of such violation. If not made within
such time, the City shall, in addition to the other penalties herein provided,
have the right to finish and correct the work and assess the cost thereof to
the property owner. Such assessment shall be collected with and in the same
manner as general property taxes.
96.15   LIMITED RESPONSIBILITY FOR PERMIT REVOCATION.
All permits to connect with the public sewer shall be issued with the express
condition that the City may, at any time before the work is completed, revoke
and annul the same and no interested party shall have a right to claim damages
as a consequence of any such permit being revoked or annulled.
96.16   USE OF SEWAGE LIFT/SUMP PUMPS PROHIBITED.
No new construction shall be built below the usable level of the public
sanitary sewer system so as to require the installation and use of a sewage
lift/sump pump, without the express written consent of the Council.
96.17   PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION OF PUBLIC SEWER MAINS PROHIBITED.
The City will construct or contract for the construction of all public sewer
mains within an established public right-of-way except as pertains to approved
subdivision development. No private party shall otherwise construct any type of
sewer within these public right-of-ways. This does not include the approved
installation of any building lateral being attached to an already existing
public sewer main. The cost of all public sewer main construction will be borne
by the City except during the course of an approved subdivision development or
except when a property owner desires an extension of the existing public sewer
main in advance of the City’s projected construction date. The property owner
can request that the City proceed with this construction as soon as is
practical, with the cost to be borne by the property owner making the request.
The cost of all building laterals connecting to the public sewer main shall be
borne by the property owner.

99.01   ALL WATER USED TO BE METERED.
All water shall pass through and shall be accurately measured through meters
furnished by the City and/or Iowa American Waterworks (IAW). The only
exceptions to this requirement will be fire suppression systems, authorized and
required on-site appliances (which may be connected to the public water mains
by direct connection without meters under the direct supervision of the City
and/or IAW), and situations where there can be calculated a defined known
volume of water. In the case of fire sprinkler systems or on-site appliances,
no other connections can be incorporated in the piping supporting the system
and there shall be no valves except main control valves at the entrance to the
building which must be sealed open in the case of fire sprinkler systems or a
hydrant valve which must be left open in the case of on-site hydrants.† 6  (See
Chapter 159)
 
Notes
  † EDITOR’S NOTE: This chapter is applicable to those customers who are also
6 serviced by the Municipal Water System or to those customers who are not
  serviced by the Municipal Water System and who have elected to utilize metered
  billing per the provisions of this chapter.
99.02   METER LOCATIONS.
All meters shall be located as near as practicable to the point where the
building lateral first enters the premises, and the inlet side of the meter
base shall be no farther than a maximum of 12 inches from that point. All
meters shall be located so that they are easily and readily accessible to meter
readers and repairmen and protected from freezing and other potentially
damaging conditions, including strain imposed by adjacent plumbing, and shall
only be located within the particular premises which they directly serve. (In
multi-use buildings, meters may be grouped together for convenience in a
common, public use area). Any meter found to be in violation of this provision
shall be relocated at the expense of the property owner within 30 days after
receipt of notice to do so from the City. If relocation is not able to be done,
radio read equipment will be provided/installed by the City at the expense of
the property owner.
99.03   METER SETTING.
1.   The property owner shall provide all necessary piping and fittings for the
proper setting of the meter base including shut-off valves no more than six
inches distance from the meter, one on either side. Meter pits may be used only
upon approval of the City and shall be of a design and construction approved by
the City. Plumbing adjacent to the meter shall be supported mechanically by a
meter yoke or other approved means so that removal of the meter will not cause
the meter connections to be out of line or shift lengthwise.
2.   The City may, if necessary, require remote or data endpoint transmitters
to be placed wherever they may be necessary to facilitate reading. All new
construction and reconstruction will be required to have remote or data
endpoint capable equipment. This equipment will be supplied/installed by the
IAW or the City. All new, first-time meters and meters installed after a
reconnection shall be installed immediately upon the completion of the plumbing
rough-in inspection. Customers failing to install a meter within such time
frame will be charged the monthly “Contractor’s Fee” as shown in
Chapter 100 until such time as the meter is installed and inspected as required
herein.
99.04   COST OF REPAIRS.
Whenever a water meter or outside meter reader is found to be inoperative, it
shall be replaced as soon as possible. If it is found that damage to the device
has occurred due to the carelessness or negligence of the customer and/or
property owner, then the customer and/or property owner shall be liable for the
cost of repairs or replacement and said cost shall be added to the monthly bill
as an additional charge.
99.05   SIZING OF METERS.
Water meter sizes shall be determined solely by the City or IAW.
99.06   METER ACCURACY TESTING AND SERVICE TEST CHARGE.
Any customer may submit a written request to have a meter tested to verify its
accuracy at any time. There will be a service test charge added to the
customer’s next billing for this test (see
Chapter 100). Should the meter register more than two percent fast, the
customer shall be entitled to a credit adjustment on the next bill following
the testing based on the over registration of the meter computed on the number
of gallons or cubic feet consumed in the previous six-month period. Should the
meter register more than two percent slow, the customer shall be charged an
additional amount on the next bill following the testing based on the under
registration of the meter computed on the number of gallons consumed in the
previous six-month period.
99.07   METERING EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT REQUIRED.
All meters shall be replaced by the City or IAW on an as needed basis to be
determined by the City or IAW.
Any and all meters and remote readers shall be replaced immediately when they
cease to record accurately.
99.08   UNAUTHORIZED TAMPERING.
It is unlawful for any person, except the City or IAW, to disconnect, alter, or
move any meter, metering wire, or remote meter reading device, or to break any
seal wire of the City or IAW.
(In any prosecution with regards to tampering with any meter or any meter
appurtenances as described above, proof that tampering did occur in some
fashion, together with proof that the defendant named in the complaint was at
the time the registered customer utilizing that particular meter and associated
appurtenances, shall constitute prima facie evidence that the defendant was the
person who tampered with the meter or associated appurtenances in violation of
this section.)
99.09   READING OF METERS REQUIRED.
In order to insure and maintain system accuracy, all meters shall be read at
least once per month by the City. When service is to be changed into another
customer’s name, or service is to be permanently discontinued, or in the normal
course of changes in occupancies (“moves”), the remote or data endpoint device
shall be read, compared, and adjusted or replaced as necessary.
99.10   SECOND OR WATER-ONLY METERS AUTHORIZED.
When requested, any customer may install and utilize one (1) or more additional
City supplied meters at any property location in accordance with all other
requirements of this Code and the following situation-specific requirements
where such installation is for the metering of water-only uses and where it can
be conclusively shown that any such water metered will not be discharged to or
entering the City’s sanitary sewer system in any way (i.e. lawn & garden
watering, “hot-water heating systems,” swimming pools, other exterior-only
uses, etc.):
1.   The customer must purchase the additional meter(s) from the City for the
purchase cost of the meter and there shall be an activation/installation/
deactivation fee per additional meter installed which shall be payable at the
time of application.
2.   Charges may be assessed against any property for failure to pay any amount
due and owing on said additional meter(s). (Ord.#622 12/1/03)
3.   Each property’s plumbing configuration shall be inspected by the City
prior to supplying and immediately following the installation of any additional
meter and not less than every six months thereafter, prior to the refund of any
consumer deposit in connection therewith, prior to the deactivation of any
additional meter account, and upon a change in ownership and/or occupancy, to
assure metering accuracy.
4.   Any water acquired and recorded through an additional meter which enters
the City’s sanitary sewer system shall be considered a violation of this Code
and may be prosecuted in any manner allowed for herein and/or the City may
immediately begin charging for sewer service on the additional meter account
(s).
5.   Prior to deactivating an additional meter account, the customer must
modify the property’s plumbing so that any and all water use is acquired and
recorded through a single metering point, the additional meter must be returned
to the City in good working order, and the property’s plumbing reconfiguration
must be inspected and approved by the City. (Ord. #600 8/19/02)
6.   The repair, upkeep, and replacement of any water-only meters installed are
the customer’s responsibility and shall abide by the above regulations.

(Section 100.02 – Ord._841 – Jan. 25 Supp.)
1.   “Seniors” means any residential customers of the Sanitary Sewer Utility,
65 years of age or older, that have registered for said discount at City Hall
prior to any billing date. (See definition of “eligible senior citizen” for
further clarification.) Any such user shall be charged the “Monthly Metered
Minimum Charge, Eligible Seniors Only” amount as spelled out above, provided
that such user elects to use “metered” billing. Any such user, who would
otherwise qualify, that elects not to use “metered” billing shall then be
charged the “Non-Metered Monthly Flat Rate, Seniors” amount as spelled out
above.
2.   “Eligible Senior Citizen” discount shall apply only to senior citizens
residing within the City and the dwelling unit, and not to rental units, rental
houses, rental apartments, laundry rooms/common areas, etc., that may be owned
but not occupied by a senior citizen. Senior citizens will not be eligible for
this discount if anyone other than a spouse or other senior citizen resides at
that service location for a period greater than 30 days. Senior citizens
seeking this discount must annually verify their eligibility by no later than
May 15. Eligibility will be verified through methods determined and approved by
the City Administrator as outlined in Section
95.01(11). Absent timely and appropriate verification as specified herein,
billing will be at the regular, non-discounted rate.
3.   Governmental and specifically designated “quasi-governmental” user units
will be charged for services at the City Council’s discretion.
4.   All “user units” or multiples thereof who are also connected to the
municipal water system shall be metered to define water consumption, upon which
sewer service charges are based. Any single-family residential “user unit” that
is not connected to the municipal water system and that elects NOT to utilize
metered billing for sewer services shall be billed the applicable “Non-Metered
Monthly Flat Rate” amount as spelled out above.
5.   All commercial, industrial, and governmental “user units” or multiples
thereof shall be metered under all circumstances. (Any such “user unit” that is
not metered as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter
(September 9, 1993) shall make arrangements for and shall be metered within 30
days from the receipt of a notice from the City to do so.
6.   Common areas, such as laundry rooms in apartments, etc., shall be
considered as single user units regardless of the number of users who use it.
7.   The billing period for each “user unit” shall be monthly.
8.   In no case shall the minimum service charge be less than that shown in the
rate chart in Section
100.02.
9.   In the event that multiple “user units” are served by a single meter, the
minimum monthly service charge per “user unit” shall be applied to each
connected “user unit” to determine the total minimum monthly service charges
applicable to the multiple use meter. If two or more users are serviced off of
one meter, they are to be granted the minimum number of gallons (500) times the
number of user units (i.e., 2 x 500 = 1,000).
10.   In the event that a property containing multiple “user units” is served
by a single meter, the plumbing shall be modified to provide a separate meter
for each “user unit” at such time as the property is sold or otherwise changes
ownership or control. Until such time as the plumbing is modified to comply
with this chapter, the billing will be administered as mentioned above with no
consideration for the number of occupied versus vacant units.
11.   The monthly billing for each “user unit” shall include both the minimum
charge and the metered usage charge as spelled out herein based upon the meter
reading, unless otherwise noted herein.
12.   All flat rate billings will continue in force until service is
permanently terminated. There will be no discontinuation in billing for such
things as vacations, temporary occupancies, etc. Metered billings only may be
discontinued for a period of time to accommodate vacations, vacancies,
temporary occupancies, etc. (similar to the provisions in Chapter 92) if a
request is confirmed with the Billing Clerk ahead of time, specific start and
stop dates are given, and inside/outside meter readings are obtained.
13.   The monthly billing method will automatically be changed to a flat rate
billing and will remain so until the situation is corrected for those “user
units” NOT connected to the Municipal Water Supply System who have elected to
use metered billing where individual private well debris has plugged the City’s
water meter three or more times during any six-month period.
14.   “Contractor’s Fees” as shown herein shall be charged to all utility hook-
up applicants commencing upon the completion of the plumbing rough- in
inspection.
100.03   CUSTOMER DEPOSITS REQUIRED.
Customer deposits, covering all services supplied by the City, shall be
required for each and every service provided to each and every user unit in
connection with new customers and of those who have an unacceptable credit
record or who have a prior record of failure to pay service charges rendered by
the City.
1.   Such deposits shall be as follows and shall be submitted prior to
supplying said services and/or issuing a building lateral installation/
connection permit:
Classification Amount
Classification                       Amount
Sewer/garbage (with meter)           $150.00
Sewer/garbage (without meter)        $150.00
Sewer only (with meter)              $100.00
Sewer only (without meter)           $100.00
Garbage only - Residential           $50.00
Sewer only (with meter) - Commercial $100.00
Deposits listed are MINIMUMS ONLY and are based on a maximum meter size of not
more than ¾”. Customers requiring larger or multiple meters will be required to
pay a proportionally larger deposit based on the size and number of meters.
 
2.   Customer deposits may be transferred from one location to another, or into
another person’s name, provided that the customer’s bill is paid in full and is
not delinquent in any way, and the customer deposit amount shall be adjusted
upward, if necessary, to reflect the current required amount as specified
herein and paid prior to said transfer.
3.   Customer deposits are required to guarantee payment for any customer-
related damages to any metering device and payment for any municipal service-
related charges. To this end, the customer deposit shall be credited and then
refunded, if appropriate, in the following manner: first to any metering device
damages; next to any garbage service-related charges; next to any sewer
utility-related charges; and the remainder thereafter may be refunded to the
customer.
4.   For those “Sewer Only” single-family residential customers who are on a
“metered billing” basis and request that the meter be removed from the
premises, then the customer deposit service status difference shall be
refunded. Otherwise, the meter will remain on the premises, the billing will be
adjusted accordingly to reflect the flat rate amount, and the customer deposit
shall not be refunded until such time as the meter is removed.
100.04   BILLING PROCEDURES FOR SEWER SERVICE.
1.   The charges aforesaid shall be billed monthly by such methods as shall be
adopted by the City Administrator subject to Council approval. Said billings
and the minimum monthly billings (and surcharges, if applicable) shall be
billed no later than the last day of each month and all bills for said services
shall be due and payable and received in the office of the Billing Clerk on or
before the 15th day of the month following the date of the billing and will be
considered delinquent and eligible for assessment if not paid in full by that
time. “On or before the 15th day” means on or before 5:00 p.m. on the close of
the normal business day if paying in the office or by drop box or 4:45 p.m. if
paying on-line on the 15th. If the 15th of the month falls on a Saturday,
Sunday, or a holiday, then payment must be received no later than the close of
the next following business day. If any payment is not received in the office
of the Billing Clerk on or before the 15th day of the month following the date
of the billing, it shall be deemed delinquent, and a late charge shall be added
thereto in the amount of 10 percent. (Governmental units, sub-units, and
designated “quasi- governmental units will not be charged any penalties.) There
will be no compounding of collection charges (i.e., penalties on penalties).
Delinquent accounts may also have their water shut-off in accordance with Iowa
law and be charged for a water shut-off fee. If the total accumulated
collection charges and/or certified mailing charges reach or exceed $10.00,
these charges will be assessed as any other charges as provided for herein. The
Billing Clerk may waive the late charge mentioned above once per calendar year
per customer.
2.   Billings for those industrial wastewater load charges as shown in the
above table shall be done monthly in conjunction with the regular billing and
shall be calculated based on the usage recorded for that month adjusted for the
quantities calculated as determined by the City’s sampling. Any unpaid amount
covered by this paragraph shall be subject to the same procedures for
collection as specified for other types of service charges listed herein.
3.   Billing for contract “bulk disposal” shall be done as soon as possible
after service is provided.
4.   Billing to leased or rental properties may be either to the property owner
or to the tenant/renter, but the property owner shall ultimately be responsible
for any unpaid charges, and/or assessments.
5.   Residential customers of the Municipal Sanitary Sewer Utility, as defined,
who are not also customers of the Municipal Water System may elect to use or
change the billing method from flat rate to metered billing, or vice versa,
provided appropriate customer deposits are on file. If going from metered to
flat rate billing, a reading will be taken on the day requested. If the request
falls before the 15th of the month, then the final metered bill will be based
on usage only, and then that current month’s billing will reflect the non-
metered, monthly flat rate as applicable. If the request falls after the 15th
of the month, then the final metered bill will be based on the final usage
combined with the monthly minimum charges. If going from flat rate billing to
metered billing, the meter will be installed by the 15th of the month to be
reflected in that month’s billing. If the meter is installed after the 15th of
the month, then the customer will be billed the flat rate charge for the
current month and the metered billing will begin with the next month’s billing.
6.   If a customer deposit and request for service is filed with the Billing
Clerk on or before the 15th of any month, the billing shall start with that
month’s billing and if it is filed after the 15th of the month, the billing
will begin with the next month’s billing. If a person moves out of the City or
is no longer a customer of the sanitary sewer system on or before the 15th of
any month, such person shall not be charged a minimum service charge but shall
be charged for any actual usage of service.
7.   In the event that the City receives any returned checks from the bank for
lack of sufficient funds, the customer will have three days to pay for the
check and the NSF charges.
8.   Billing may be temporarily discontinued to accommodate vacations,
vacancies, etc., to those “metered” users if a request is confirmed with the
Billing Clerk ahead of time, specific start and stop dates are given, and
inside/outside meter readings are obtained.
9.   The bill format, structure, content, and wording will be determined by the
City Administrator. In addition to specifying any and all amounts due,
information contained on the bill must clearly indicate to the customer that
the bill serves as the customer’s only form of notice and that the customer
will receive only one other prior notice in the event that charges must be
assessed for nonpayment.
100.05   BILLING PROCEDURES AND CHARGES FOR SPECIAL SERVICES.
Following is a listing of special service charges not associated with actual
water consumption:
 
Description                              Amount
Meter service test                       $50.00/test
Leak test                                $50.00/test
Meter damage charges                     Cost plus $50.00
NSF check charge                         $30.00
Building lateral and/or curb stop locate $50.00
Water shut-off fee                       $46.00 (or contractual rate with IAW)
 
100.06   BILL ADJUSTMENT.
Adjustments to bills may be made only by the City Administrator or City Council
to take into account such occurrences as billing errors, meter errors,
incorrect readings, etc. Where metered billing is used and when all or a
portion of the metering system experiences some type of metering failure, the
following procedures shall be used for bill adjustments:
1.   When the water meter itself fails to properly record the usage, the next
billing, after discovery of the failure, will be based on the usage that may
have been recorded since the last reading or on an estimated amount based on
the average of the last 12 readings observed, whichever is higher.
2.   When only the remote reader fails to properly record the usage, the next
billing, after discovery of the failure, will be based on the actual reading
obtained from the water meter itself. In these instances when a bill is
incurred where it is more than twice the customer’s normal monthly bill payment
arrangements may be established whereby:
   A.   In addition to their current monthly bill, the amount of the “large
bill” above the normal monthly bill can be paid back over a period of months
equal to the amount of the “large bill” minus the normal monthly bill divided
by the normal monthly bill (i.e. (100- 25)/25=3 months), or;
   B.   In addition to their current monthly bill, an amount equal to 20% of
the “large bill” can be paid until such time as there is no outstanding amount
due.
Failure to make payment in full each month under one of the above-referenced
programs will automatically make the full amount due and owing with the next
bill issued following the missed or partial payment.
100.07   BILL COMPLAINTS.
Questions and/or complaints about the bills will first be handled or processed
through the Billing Clerk. If satisfaction is not achieved, an appeal may then
be made, in writing, to the City Administrator for a decision on the matter.
After this decision, an appeal may then be made, in writing, to the City
Council, whose decision shall be final.
100.08   CHARGES ASSESSED AND/OR SERVICE TERMINATION FOR NONPAYMENT.
The Billing Clerk shall notify each sewer service customer classified as the
“property owner” and “sewer-only” tenants and the respective property owner,
whose sewer service bill, or any portion thereof, is past due, that any unpaid
sewer service charges will be certified as delinquent to the Scott County
Auditor by the City, assessed, and act as a lien against the property and hence
collected as property taxes, unless the total outstanding sewer service charges
and other related charges are paid in full and received in the office of the
Billing Clerk by the close of business on or before the date specified in the
notice. (For the purpose of this section, “date of notice” shall be the date
that the notice is dated.) If any due date above falls on a holiday, Saturday,
or Sunday, the payment must be received no later than the close of the next
following business day.) The above stated notice will be the sewer utility
bill. If past due sewer charges and/or related charges are not paid in full 30
days after the billing date on the utility bill, that amount will be assessed.
A separate notice will be sent to the property owner of past due tenant
accounts by regular mail on the same day as the above-mentioned utility bill
informing them of the past due amount and the assessment proceedings. Pursuant
to the provisions allowed within Section 476.20(1)(b) of the Code of Iowa, as
amended, in addition to the assessment provisions contained herein, or in lieu
thereof, the City may cause to have a property’s water service terminated for
nonpayment of charges after due notice is provided.
100.09   AUTHORITY TO RENDER AND COLLECT BILLS AND SYSTEM ACCOUNTABILITY.
1.   It is hereby made the duty of the City Administrator to render bills for
sewer service and all other charges in connection therewith and to collect all
monies due therefrom.
2.   All revenues and monies derived from the operation of the sewer system
shall be paid to and held by the City separate and apart from all other funds
of the City. All of said sums and all other funds and monies incident to the
operation of said system as may be delivered to the City, shall be deposited in
a separate fund designated the “Sewer Revenue Fund.” The City shall administer
said fund in every respect in the manner provided by the Code of Iowa and all
other laws pertaining thereto, except that all such revenues collected shall
remain a permanent part of this fund and shall not be transferred to any other
fund except upon specific written approval of the City Council.
3.   The City shall establish a proper system of accounts and shall keep proper
records, books, and accounts in which complete and correct entries shall be
made of all transactions relative to the sewer system, and, at regular annual
intervals, the Council shall cause to be made an audit, by an independent
auditing firm or the State of Iowa, of the books to show the receipts and
disbursements of the sewer system. The City shall be required annually to
prepare a budget of the sanitary sewer system to show the required revenues and
expenses. If necessary, sewer service charges will be adjusted to produce
adequate income to retire the indebtedness; meet operation, maintenance, and
replacement needs; and required reserves.

110.01   FRANCHISE GRANTED.
There is hereby granted to MidAmerican Energy Company, an Iowa corporation,
hereinafter called “Company,” and to its successors and assigns, the right and
franchise to acquire, construct, erect, maintain, and operate in the City of
LeClaire, Iowa, hereinafter called the “City,” a gas distribution system, to
furnish natural gas along, under, and upon the streets, avenues, alleys, and
public places to serve customers within and without the City and to furnish and
sell natural gas to the City and its inhabitants. For the term of this
franchise, the Company is granted the right of eminent domain, the exercise of
which is subject to City Council approval upon application by the Company. This
franchise shall be effective for a 25-year period from and after the effective
date of this ordinance.† 8
 
Notes
  † EDITOR’S NOTE: Ordinance No. 767, adopting a natural gas franchise for the
8 City, was passed and adopted on December 16, 2013. Voters approved the franchise
  at an election held on December 18, 2023.
110.02   RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES.
The rights and privileges hereby granted are subject to the restrictions and
limitations of Chapter 364 of the Code of Iowa 2011, or as subsequently amended
or changed.
110.03   PIPES AND MAINS.
Company shall have the right to excavate in any public street for the purpose
of laying, relaying, repairing, or extending gas pipes, mains, conduits, and
other facilities provided that the same shall be so placed as not to
unreasonably interfere with the construction of any water pipes, drain, or
sewer or the flow of water therefrom, which have been or may hereafter be
located by authority of the City.
110.04   CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE.
The Company shall, excluding facilities located in private easements (whether
titled in Company exclusively or in Company and other entities), in accordance
with Iowa law including Company’s tariff on file with and made effective by the
Iowa Utilities Board as may subsequently be amended (“Tariff”), at its cost and
expense, locate and relocate its existing facilities or equipment in, on, over,
or under any public street or alley in the City in such a manner as the City
may reasonably require for the purposes of facilitating the construction
reconstruction, maintenance, or repair of the street or alley. If the City has
a reasonable alternative route for the street, alley, or public improvements or
an alternative construction method, which would not cause the relocation of the
Company installations, the City shall select said alternative route, or
construction method. The City shall be responsible for surveying and staking
the right-of-way for City projects that require the Company to relocate Company
facilities. If requested, the City shall provide, at no cost to the Company,
copies of its relocation plan and profile and cross-section drawings. If tree
removals must be completed by the City as part of the City’s project and are
necessary whether or not utility facilities must be relocated, the City, at its
own cost, shall be responsible for said removals. If the timing of the tree
removals does not coincide with the Company facilities relocation schedule and
Company must remove trees that are included in the City’s portion of the
project, the City shall either remove the trees, at its cost, or reimburse the
Company for the expenses incurred to remove said trees. If project funds from a
source other than the City are available to pay for the relocation of utility
facilities, the City shall attempt to secure said funds and provide them to the
Company to compensate the Company for the costs of relocation.
110.05   EXCAVATION.
In making excavations in any streets, avenues, alleys, and public places for
the installation of gas pipes, conduits, or apparatus, Company shall not
unreasonably obstruct the use of the streets and shall replace the surface,
restoring it to the condition as existed immediately prior to excavation.
Company agrees any replacement of road surface shall conform to current City
Code regarding its depth and composition. The Company shall not be required to
restore or modify public right-of-way, sidewalks, or other areas in or adjacent
to the Company project to a condition superior to its immediate previously
existing condition or to a condition exceeding its previously existing
condition to the extent any alterations are required for the City to comply
with City, State, or federal rules, regulations, or laws. When excavations are
made by the Company, its agents, employees, contractors, or subcontractors,
whether on public or private property, the Company shall restore the ground
involved in the excavation to a level, compacted condition equivalent to its
pre­excavation condition in order to avoid the creation of groundwater drainage
problems. To the extent that the Company is notified by the City of problems
resulting from excavations as contemplated by this section, the Company will
take prompt, commercially reasonable action to investigate, and if necessary,
to remedy such problems and to notify the City of such remedial action.
110.06   UTILITY EASEMENT.
Vacating a street, avenue, alley, public ground, or public right-of-way shall
not deprive the Company of its right to operate and maintain existing
facilities on, below, above, or beneath the vacated property. Prior to the City
abandoning or vacating any street, avenue, alley, or public ground where the
Company has facilities in the vicinity, the City shall provide Company with not
less than 60 days advance notice of the City’s proposed action and, upon
request, grant the Company a utility easement covering existing and future
facilities and activities. If the City fails to grant the Company a utility
easement for said facilities prior to abandoning or vacating a street, avenue,
alley, or public ground, the City shall, at its cost and expense, obtain
easements for existing Company facilities.
110.07   RELOCATION NOT REQUIRED.
The Company shall not be required to relocate, at its cost and expense, Company
facilities in the public right-of-way that have been relocated at Company
expense at the direction of the City at any time during the previous 10 years.
110.08   RELOCATION REIMBURSEMENT.
Pursuant to relocation of Company facilities as may be required by Sections
110.03,
110.04,
110.05,
110.06, and
110.07 of this chapter, if the City orders or requests the Company to relocate
its existing facilities or equipment in order to directly or indirectly
facilitate the project of a commercial or private developer or other non-public
entity, City shall reimburse or the City shall require the developer or non-
public entity to reimburse the Company for the cost of such relocation as a
precondition to relocation. The Company shall not be required to relocate in
order to facilitate such private project at its expense.
110.09   INDEMNIFICATION.
The Company shall indemnify and save harmless the City from any and all claims,
suits, losses, damages, costs, or expenses on account of injury or damage to
any person or property, to the extent caused or occasioned by the Company’s
negligence in construction, reconstruction, excavation, operation, or
maintenance of the natural gas facilities authorized by this franchise;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to defend,
indemnify, and save harmless the City for any costs or damages to the extent
arising from the negligence of the City, its officers, employees, or agents.
110.10   INFORMATION.
Upon reasonable request, the Company shall provide the City, on a project
specific basis, information indicating the horizontal location, relative to
boundaries of the right-of-way, of all equipment which it owns or over which it
has control that is located in City right-of-way, including documents, maps,
and other information in paper or electronic or other forms (“Information”).
The Company and City recognize the information may, in whole or part, be
considered a confidential record under State or federal law or both. Therefore,
the City shall not release any information without prior consent of the Company
and shall return the information to Company upon request. City recognizes that
Company claims the information may constitute a trade secret or is otherwise
protected from public disclosure by State or federal law on other grounds and
agrees to retain the information in its non-public files. Furthermore, the City
agrees that no documents, maps, or information provided to the City by the
Company shall be made available to the public or other entities if such
documents or information are exempt from disclosure under the provisions of the
Freedom of Information Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Critical
Energy Infrastructure requirements pursuant to 18 CFR 388.112 and 388.113, or
Chapter 22 of the Code of Iowa, as such statutes and regulations may be amended
from time to time.
110.11   APPLICABLE REGULATIONS.
The Company shall extend its mains and pipes and operate and maintain the
system in accordance with the applicable regulations of the Iowa Utilities
Board or its successors and Iowa law.
110.12   TERM OF FRANCHISE.

quantity and quality consistent and in accordance with the applicable
regulations of the Iowa Utilities Board the Company’s tariff made effective by
the Iowa Utilities Board or its successors and Iowa law.
110.13   POLICE REGULATIONS.
All reasonable and proper police regulations shall be adopted and enforced by
the City for the protection of the facilities of the Company.
110.14   FRANCHISE FEE.
A franchise fee is imposed upon, and shall be collected from, the natural gas
customers of the Company receiving service pursuant to the tariff and located
within the corporate limits of the City. The franchise fee shall be imposed
upon the gross receipts, minus uncollectible accounts, derived from the sale of
natural gas and distribution service pursuant to the tariff. City imposes the
franchise fee upon the following revenue classes:
1.   Residential customers    zero percent.
2.   Non-residential customers    zero percent.
3.   Transportation customers    zero percent.
110.15   FRANCHISE FEE EXEMPTIONS.
The City may, as allowed by Iowa law, exempt customer classes of sales from
imposition of the franchise fee, or modify, decrease, or eliminate the
franchise fee. The City reserves the right to cancel any or all the franchise
fee exemptions and also reserves the right to grant exemptions to customer
classes in compliance with Iowa law and Section
110.17 of this chapter. The City does therefore exempt the customer classes in
Section
110.14 from paying franchise fees.
1.   Customer classes exempted by the City at time of imposing a franchise fee
percentage greater than zero percent.
110.16   FRANCHISE FEE COLLECTION.
The City recognizes the administrative burden collecting franchise fees imposes
upon the Company and the Company requires lead time to commence collecting said
franchise fees. The Company will commence collecting franchise fees on or
before the first Company billing cycle of the first calendar month following 90
days of receipt of information required of the City to implement the franchise
fee, including the City’s documentation of customer classes subject to, or
exempted from City imposed franchise fee. The City shall provide the
information and data required in a form and format acceptable to the Company.
The Company will, if requested by the City, provide the City with a list of
premises considered by the Company to be within the corporate limits of the
City.
110.17   CITY RESPONSIBLE.
The City shall be solely responsible for identifying customer classes subject
to or exempt from paying the City imposed franchise fee. The City shall be
solely responsible for notifying Company of its corporate limits, including,
over time, annexations, or other alterations thereto, and customer classes that
it wishes to subject to, or to the extent permitted by law, exempt from paying
the franchise fee. The City shall provide to the Company, by certified mail,
copies of annexation ordinances in a timely manner to ensure appropriate
franchise fee collection from customers within the corporate limits of the
City. The Company shall have no obligation to collect franchise fees from
customers in annexed areas until and unless such ordinances have been provided
to the Company by certified mail. The Company shall commence collecting
franchise fees in the annexed areas no sooner than 60 days after receiving
annexation ordinances from the City.
110.18   FRANCHISE FEE MODIFIED.
The City agrees to modify the level of franchise fees imposed only once in any
24-month period. Any such ordinance exempting classes of customers, increasing,
decreasing, modifying, or eliminating the franchise fee shall become effective,
and billings reflecting the change shall commence on an agreed upon date which
is not less than 60 days following written notice to the Company by certified
mail. The Company shall not be required to implement such new ordinance unless
and until it determines that it has received appropriate official documentation
of final action by the Council.
110.19   FRANCHISE FEE INDEMNIFY.

or related to the imposition and collection of the franchise fee. In addition,

franchise fees or being exempt from the imposition of franchise fees.

than on or before the last business day of the month following each quarter as
follows.

3.   July, August, and September, and
4.   October, November, and December.
MidAmerican shall provide City with notice at least 30 days in advance of any
changes made in this collection schedule, including any alterations in the
calendar quarters or any other changes in the remittance periods.
110.21   FRANCHISE FEE COST.
The City recognizes that the costs of franchise fee administration are not
charged directly to the City and agrees it shall, if required by the Company,
reimburse the Company for any initial or ongoing costs incurred by the Company
in collecting franchise fees that Company, in its sole opinion, deems to be in
excess of typical costs of franchise fee administration.
110.22   FRANCHISE FEE REIMBURSEMENT.
The Company shall not, under any circumstances, be required to return or refund
any franchise fees that have been collected from City customers and remitted to
the City. In the event the Company is required to provide data or information
in defense of the City’s imposition of franchise fees or the Company is
required to assist the City in identifying customers or calculating any
franchise fee refunds for groups of or individual customers, the City shall
reimburse the Company for the expenses incurred by the Company to provide such

110.23   OBLIGATION TO COLLECT AND REMIT FEE MODIFIED.
The obligation to collect and remit the fee imposed by this ordinance is
modified or repealed if:
1.   Any other person is authorized to sell natural gas at retail to City
consumers and the City imposes a franchise fee or its lawful equivalent at zero
or a lesser rate than provided in this chapter, in which case the obligation of
Company to collect and remit franchise fee shall be modified to zero or the
lesser rate;
2.   The City adds additional territory by annexation or consolidation and is
unable or unwilling to impose the franchise fee upon all persons selling
natural gas at retail to consumers within the additional territory, in which
case the franchise fee imposed on the revenue from sales by Company in the
additional territory shall be zero or equal to that of the lowest fee being
paid by any other retail seller of natural gas within the City; or
3.   Legislation is enacted by the Iowa General Assembly or the Supreme Court
of Iowa issues a final ruling regarding franchise fees or the Iowa Utilities
Board issues a final nonappealable order (collectively, “final franchise fee
action”) that modifies, but does not repeal, the ability of the City to impose
a franchise fee or the ability of Company to collect from City customers and
remit franchise fees to City. Within 60 days of final franchise fee action, the
City shall notify Company and the parties shall meet to determine whether this
ordinance can be revised, and, if so, how to revise the franchise fee on a
continuing basis to meet revised legal requirements. After final franchise fee
action and until passage by the City of revisions to the franchise fee
ordinance, Company may temporarily discontinue collection and remittance of the
franchise fee if, in its sole opinion, it believes it is required to do so in
order to comply with revised legal requirements.
4.   The other provisions of this ordinance to the contrary notwithstanding,

to the City the franchise fee as, effective as the date specified below, with
no liability therefor under each of any of the following circumstances as
determined to exist in the sole discretion of Company:

collection, or remittance of a franchise fee unlawful, effective as of the date
lawfully specified by the General Assembly.
   C.   The Iowa Utilities Board, or its successor agency, denies the Company
the right to impose, collect, or remit a franchise fee provided such denial is
affirmed by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date of the final
agency order from which the appeal is taken.
110.24   MANAGEMENT FEES.
Upon implementation of a franchise fee the City shall not, pursuant to Chapter
480A.6 of the Code of Iowa, impose or charge Company right-of-way management

shall attempt to secure said funds and provide them to the Company to
compensate the Company for the costs of relocation. Annually, during the first
quarter of each year, the parties hereto shall cause their respective
representatives to meet to discuss each party’s planned construction projects
for the next five years of infrastructure construction, replacement,
enhancements, abandonments, or maintenance within the City. Following the
procedures and standards applicable to such projects, the parties will develop
plans to facilitate the placing of overhead electric distribution facilities
underground in conjunction with City projects in the public right-of-ways or in
strategic areas of the City. Any conversion of overhead electric distribution
facilities to underground electric distribution facilities shall comply with
the Iowa Utilities Board rules and regulations, Company tariffs applicable to
City required conversions of overhead facilities to underground facilities, the
National Electric Code and the National Electric Safety Codes as adopted by the
Iowa Utilities Board. The Company shall not be responsible for any costs

with City ordinances. The Company agrees that for a period of 24 months
following the closing of a Company trench or excavation, the Company shall be
responsible to make repairs required as a result of settling of said trench or
excavation. Trenches that are jointly occupied by the Company and other
entities shall be repaired by the Company. MidAmerican shall not be responsible
for any repair or restoration of trenches or excavations made by other entities
in which MidAmerican is not a participant.
111.07   FRANCHISE FEE.

to develop a methodology and timeline to implement the franchise fee. The
established fee shall not exceed an amount greater than five percent of the
gross receipts, less uncollectible amounts, derived by the Company from the
transmission, distribution, or sale of electricity to retail customers located

Company-owned distribution system, the City will enter into a pole attachment
agreement with the Company. The City shall reimburse the Company for any
modifications required to accommodate the City equipment. Free access to the
Company facilities shall not be allowed or continued for any communications or
information or data transmittal systems owned or leased by the City for which

said problem is a result of City facilities, the City shall correct the problem
within the time limits of the Iowa Utilities Board or the Company. If the City

response is true and accurate to the best of that person’s knowledge,
information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry.

of the work proposed to be done plus 10 percent thereof, and shall name the
City as thereof, and shall be in a form approved by the City Administrator. In
lieu of furnishing such a corporate surety bond, the owner or lessee may post
an additional cash deposit in the amount of said bond. An extension of time for

park in the City shall be under the control of the City and every such building

way relieves the person having charge of the moving of any building of the
obligation to furnish proper supervision.
124.13   NOTICE REQUIRED.

work shall be done daily by the authorized workers of the utility or the City,
whichever is the owner. The person to whom said permit is granted shall pay to
said public utility or to the City, as the case may be, any and all costs or
expense for the removal, rearrangement, or replacement of any pole or

granted hereunder causes damage to the public streets or other public property,
in addition to any other remedies the City may have, the City may cause such
damage to be repaired and the cost thereof shall be deducted from the deposit
required herein, or the City may require the person to whom such a permit has
been granted, and to whom said notice has been given, or an authorized
representative to effect such repairs. If such person fails to make necessary
repairs within the period of time designated in said written notice, the City
may cause such necessary repairs to be made and the cost thereof deducted from

granted shall be held liable for the amount of damage and/or other costs which
are in excess of the amount deposited, and the City shall collect such part of
the claim which is in excess of the deposit from the person to whom the permit
was granted.

CHAPTER 137
VACATION AND DISPOSAL OF PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAYS
 
137.01 Power to Vacate                137.04 Findings Required
137.02 Planning and Zoning Commission 137.05 Disposal of Streets or Alleys
137.03 Notice of Vacation Hearing     137.06 Disposal by Gift Limited
 
137.01   POWER TO VACATE.
When, in the judgment of the Council, it would be in the best interest of the
City to vacate a street, alley, portion thereof, or any public grounds, the
Council may do so by ordinance in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.
137.02   PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION.
Any request to vacate a street or alley shall be in writing and submitted to
the office of the City Administrator who shall refer the matter to the Planning
and Zoning Commission for study and a recommendation prior to further
consideration by the City Council. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall,
after due notification and hearing thereon, submit a written report, including
recommendations in general and specific recommendations pertaining to easements
over that right-of-way when it deems it necessary to accommodate the needs of
any and all adjoining private properties so that those adjoining private
properties will have free and unencumbered access to and/or across the vacated
right-of-way for any and all purposes, to the City Council within 30 days of
the request for vacation was referred to it.
137.03   NOTICE OF VACATION HEARING.
The Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council shall each cause to be
published a notice of public hearing at which time said request for vacation is
to be considered. In addition to the above, written notice shall be delivered
by certified mail to each property owner of record who owns property within 200
feet of any boundary of the proposed vacation area. Said notice shall be
delivered no less than seven clear days prior to the date set for the public
hearing.
137.04   FINDINGS REQUIRED.
No street or alley, or portion thereof, shall be vacated unless the City
Council finds that:
1.   Public Use. The street or alley proposed to be vacated is not needed for
the use of the public and, therefore, its maintenance at public expense is no
longer justified.
2.   Abutting Property. The proposed vacation will not deny owners of property
abutting on the street or alley reasonable access to their property.
137.05   DISPOSAL OF STREETS OR ALLEYS.
When, in the judgment of the City Council, it would be in the best interest of
the City to dispose of a vacated street or alley, or portion thereof, they may
do so by resolution following notice and hearing as set out above in Section
137.03 and only after or in conjunction with the recording of the associated
vacation instrument. When disposing of any vacated public right-of-way, the
City Council shall consider easements over that right-of-way when it deems it
necessary to accommodate the needs of any and all adjoining private properties
so that those adjoining private properties will have free and unencumbered
access to and/or across the vacated right-of-way for any and all purposes.
137.06   DISPOSAL BY GIFT LIMITED.
The City may not dispose of a vacated street or alley right-of-way, or portion
thereof, by gift, except to a governmental body for a public purpose or to a
fair. When the City Council, at their sole discretion, determines that a
vacated street or alley is to be disposed of pursuant to Section
137.05 above, the vacated property may be disposed of through either one of the
following two methods:
1.   Pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 354.23, of the Code of Iowa, (as
amended) where the vacated parcel shall first be divided into equal portions*
and disposed of and conveyed to the immediately adjoining proprietors through
the vacation instrument (ordinance or plat acceptance resolution) after payment
of an application and processing fee as set by Council resolution.
*(In lieu of dividing the parcel into equal portions, the City may dispose of
the vacated parcel in whatever portions are agreed upon in advance, in writing,
between the immediately adjoining proprietors).
2.   Through a publicly noticed, sealed-bid process wherein the minimum,
acceptable bids will be determined as follows:
   A.   Where the vacated property is of such a size or configuration to render
it “unbuildable” per those requirements as established in the Zoning
Regulations Chapter, and/or the property is 600 square feet or less in total
area, the minimum acceptable bid will be established on a square foot basis
where the square foot value shall be determined by the Council.
   B.   Where the vacated property is of such a size or configuration so that
it could be rendered “buildable” per those requirements as established in the
Zoning Regulations Chapter, and/or the property is more than 600 square feet in
total area, the property will be appraised and the minimum acceptable bid will
be established on a square foot basis by dividing the appraised value by the
square footage, and then adding the City’s costs to determine the total cost.

140.01 Permit Required 140.03 Specifications
140.02 Fees
 
140.01   PERMIT REQUIRED.
No person shall commence or proceed with construction of any automobile
driveway or parking area over, across, or upon any portion of the public right-
of-way adjoining a permanently paved street without first having obtained a
written permit to do so from the City.
140.02   FEES.
Permit fees will be established by Council resolution and must be paid to the
City before any work or replacement commences.
140.03   SPECIFICATIONS.
All plans and specifications must conform to the following minimum requirements
before a permit will be issued:
1.   All driveways or parking areas meeting the criteria established herein,
which are constructed, replaced, or rebuilt, will be constructed of reinforced
Portland cement concrete (P.C.C.) or asphalt cement concrete (A.C.C.) at least
six inches thick in accordance with the City’s standard public works
improvements specifications where they abut paved, concrete, or asphalt
streets.
2.   Where a driveway or parking area is constructed across the sidewalk space,
it will conform to the sidewalk grade as established by the City.
3.   The width of any driveway or parking area for other than residential
dwellings will not exceed 30 feet at the property line. Where two or more
adjoining driveways or parking areas of any property type are provided for the
same property, a safety island of not less than three feet in width at the
property line will be provided. No more than two such driveways or parking
areas will be allowed to any piece of property on any street for each 100 feet
of continuous frontage thereof.
4.   The width of the driveways or parking areas for a residential dwelling
will not be more than 12 feet per garage stall but no more than 30 feet at the
property line, except for lots located on a cul-de-sac shall not exceed 24 feet
in width.
5.   Combined curb and gutter and separate curbing will be entirely removed for

gutter or separate curbing, making a neat edge at right angles to the edge of
the pavement and vertical. Integral curbing, which is that type placed with the
pavement and molded as an integral part of it, must be removed for the full
depth from the top of the curb to the bottom of the pavement. The edge must be
cut as described above. No combined curb and gutter, straight curb, or integral
curb will be removed within five feet of a public crosswalk.
6.   Where driveways or parking areas cross open ditches in the public right-
of-way, culverts of at least 12 inches will be installed.
7.   Any and all driveways, parking areas, private drives, and the areas
immediately adjacent thereto that are constructed or reconstructed over,
across, or upon any public right-of-way in the City, will be installed and
maintained at all times by and at the sole expense of the property owner,
except when the City, in the course of conducting repairs to or during the
construction of public facilities or improvements, disturbs or damages said
drive or parking areas. In these instances, the City will replace the damaged
or disturbed drive or parking areas with a similar material to that which
existed previously.
8.   Any and all driveways and private drives used for any purpose other than
strictly residential uses will be constructed no less than 50 feet from any
public right-of-way intersection measured from the nearest edge of the drive to
the closest right-of-way line.

141.01   DEFINITION.
“Excavation” includes removal, stripping, or disturbance of soil, earth, sand,
rock, gravel, or other similar substances from the ground.
141.02   PERMIT REQUIRED.
It is unlawful for any person to tunnel under, make any excavation, fill, or
grade on any public property in the City without having obtained a permit as
required by City Code
Chapter 142, or without complying with the provisions of this chapter or in
violation of or variance from the terms of any such permit.† 11
 
Notes
11 † EDITOR’S NOTE: Public and private properties.
141.03   MANNER OF EXCAVATING.
It is unlawful to make any such excavation or tunnel in any way contrary to or
at variance with the terms of the permit therefore. Proper bracing shall be
maintained to prevent the collapse of adjoining ground; and, in excavations,
the excavation shall not have anywhere below the surface any portion which
extends beyond the opening at the surface. No injury shall be done to any
pipes, cables, or conduits in the making of such excavations or tunnels; and at
least 48 hours prior to the commencement of the excavation, excluding
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, the person performing the excavation
shall contact the Statewide Notification Center and provide the center with the
information required under Section 480.4 of the Code of Iowa. No unnecessary
damage or injury shall be done to any tree or shrub or the roots thereof.
141.04   SIDEWALKS.
If any sidewalk is blocked by any such work a temporary sidewalk shall be
constructed or provided which shall be safe for travel and convenient for
users.
141.05   RESTORING SURFACE.
Any person making any excavation or tunnel in or under any public street,
alley, or other public place in the City shall restore the surface to its
original condition if there is no pavement there. Refills shall be properly
tamped down, and any bracing in such tunnel or excavation shall be left in the
ground. Any opening in a paved or improved portion of a street shall be
repaired and the surface re-laid by the applicant, in compliance with the
ordinances of the City.
141.06   SUPERVISION.
The City shall, from time to time, inspect or cause to be inspected all
excavations and tunnels being made in or under any public street, alley, or
public place in the City to insure the enforcement of the provisions of this
chapter. Notice shall be given to the City at least 10 hours before the work of
refilling any such tunnel or excavation commences.
141.07   TUNNELING REQUIRED.
It is unlawful to make any excavation in any portion of a street or sidewalk in
the City which is paved with concrete or asphalt paving. Where necessary, and
where a proper permit has been secured, tunnels may be driven or excavated
under any such pavement provided that, upon completion of the work involved,
the tunnel shall be backfilled with compacted sand, flowable mortar, or by some
other approved methods or materials.
141.08   PROTECTIVE MEASURES AND ROUTING TRAFFIC.
It shall be the duty of every person cutting or making an excavation in or upon
any public place, to place and maintain barriers and warning devices necessary
for safety of the general public. Barriers, warning signs, lights, etc., shall
conform to the requirements of the City. The permittee shall take appropriate
measures to assure that during the performance of the excavation work traffic
conditions as near normal as possible shall be maintained at all times so as to
minimize inconvenience to the occupants of the adjoining property and to the
general public. When traffic conditions permit, the City may, by written
approval, permit the closing of streets and alleys to all traffic for a period
of time. Such written approval may require that the permittee give notification
to various public agencies and to the general public. In such cases, written
approval shall not be valid until such notice is given. Warning signs shall be
placed far enough in advance of the construction operation to alert traffic
within a public street.
141.09   CLEARANCE FOR VITAL STRUCTURES.
The excavation work shall be performed and conducted so as not to interfere
with access to fire hydrants, fire stations, fire escapes, water valves,
underground vaults, valve housing structures, and all other vital equipment.
141.10   PROTECTION OF TRAFFIC.
The permittee shall maintain safe crossings for two lanes of vehicle traffic at
all street intersections where possible and safe crossings for pedestrians at
intervals of not more than 300 feet. If any excavation is made across any
public street, alley, or sidewalk, adequate crossings shall be maintained for
vehicles and for pedestrians. If the street is not wide enough to hold the
excavated material without using part of the adjacent sidewalk, a passageway at
least half of the sidewalk width shall be maintained along such sidewalk line.
141.11   RELOCATION AND PROTECTION OF UTILITIES.
The permittee shall not interfere with any existing utility without the written
consent of the City and the owner of the utility. If it becomes necessary to
relocate an existing utility this shall be done by its owner. No utility owned
by the City shall be moved to accommodate the permittee unless the cost of such
work be borne by the permittee. The cost of moving privately owned utilities
shall be similarly borne by the permittee unless it makes other arrangements
with the person owning the utility. The permittee shall support and protect, by
timbers or otherwise, all pipes, conduits, poles, wires, or other apparatus
which may be in any way affected by the excavation work, and do everything
necessary to support, sustain, and protect them under, over, along, or across
said work. The permittee shall secure approval of method of support and
protection from the owner of the utility. In case any of said pipes, conduits,
poles, wires, or apparatus should be damaged, and for this purpose pipe coating
or other encasement or devices are to be considered as part of a substructure,
the permittee shall promptly notify the owner thereof. All damaged utilities
shall be repaired by the agency or person owning them and the expense of such
repairs shall be charged to the permittee. It is the intent of this section
that the permittee shall assume all liability for damage to utilities and any
resulting damage or injury to anyone because of such utility damage and such
assumption of liability is a contractual obligation of the permittee. The only
exception will be such instances where damage is exclusively due to the
negligence of the utility owner. The City shall not be made a party to any
action because of this section. The permittee shall inform itself as to the
existence and location of all underground utilities and protect the same
against damage.
141.12   ABANDONMENT OF SUBSTRUCTURES.
Whenever the use of substructure is abandoned, except the abandonment of
service lines designed to serve single properties, the person owning, using,
controlling, or having an interest therein, shall, within 30 days after such
abandonment, file with the City a statement in writing giving in detail the
location of the substructure so abandoned. If such abandoned substructure is in
the way, or subsequently becomes in the way, of an installation of the City or
any other public body, which installation is pursuant to a governmental
function, the owner shall remove such abandoned substructure or pay the cost of
its removal during the course of excavation for construction of the utility by
the City or any other public body.
141.13   PROTECTION OF ADJOINING PROPERTY.
The permittee shall, at all times and at the permittee’s own expense, preserve
and protect from injury any adjoining property by providing proper foundations
and taking other measures suitable for the purpose. Where in the protection of
such property it is necessary to enter upon private property for the purpose of
taking appropriate protecting measures, the permittee shall obtain consent from
the owner of such private property for such purpose and if the permittee cannot
obtain such consent, the City may authorize the permittee to enter the private
premises solely for the purpose of making the property safe. The permittee
shall, at the permittee’s own expense, shore up and protect all buildings,
walls, fences, or other property likely to be damaged during the progress of
the excavation work and shall be responsible for all damage to public or
private property or highways resulting from its failure properly to protect and
carry out said work. Whenever it may be necessary for the permittee to trench
through any lawn area, said area shall be re-seeded or the sod shall be
carefully cut and rolled and replaced after ditches have been backfilled as
required by this chapter. All construction and maintenance work shall be done
in a manner calculated to leave the lawn area clean of earth and debris and in
a condition as nearly as possible to that which existed before such work began.
The permittee shall not remove, even temporarily, any trees and shrubs which
exist in parking strip areas without first obtaining the consent of the City.
141.14   CARE OF EXCAVATED MATERIAL.
All material excavated from trenches and piled adjacent to the trench or in any
street shall be piled and maintained in such manner as not to endanger those
working in the trench, pedestrians, or users of the streets, and so that as
little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using streets and adjoining
property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too narrow to
permit the piling of excavated material beside the trench, such as might be the
case in a narrow alley, the City shall require that the permittee haul the
excavated material to a storage site and then rehaul it to the trench site at
the time of backfilling. It shall be the permittee’s responsibility to secure
the necessary permission and make all necessary arrangements for all required
storage and disposal sites. All material excavated shall be laid compactly
along the side of the trench and kept trimmed so as to cause as little
inconvenience as reasonably possible to vehicular and pedestrian traffic, or as
specified by the City. Whenever necessary, in order to expedite the flow of
traffic or to abate the dirt or dust nuisance, toe boards or bins may be
required by the City to prevent the spreading of dirt into traffic lanes.
141.15   CLEANUP.
As the excavation work progresses, all streets shall be thoroughly cleaned of
all rubbish, excess earth, rock, and other debris resulting from such work. All
cleanup operations at the location of such excavation shall be accomplished at
the expense of the permittee and shall be completed to the satisfaction of the
City. From time to time, as may be ordered by the City and in any event
immediately after completion of said work, the permittee shall, at the
permittee’s own expense, clean up and remove all refuse and unused materials of
any kind resulting from said work, and upon failure to do so within 24 hours
after having been notified to do so by the City, said work may be done by the
City and the cost thereof charged to the permittee, and the permittee shall
also be liable for the cost thereof under the surety bond provided hereunder.
141.16   PROTECTION OF WATERCOURSES.
The permittee shall maintain all gutters free and unobstructed for the full
depth of the adjacent curb and for at least one foot in width from the face of
such curb at the gutter line. Whenever a gutter crosses an intersecting street,
an adequate water way shall be provided and maintained at all times. The
permittee shall make provisions to take care of all surplus water, muck, silt,
slickings, or other run-off pumped from excavations or resulting from sluicing
or other operations and shall be responsible for any damage resulting from its
failure to so provide.
141.17   BACKFILLING.
Fine material, free from lumps and stone, selected from the spoil shall be
thoroughly compacted around and under the substructure to the upper level of
such substructure. Above the upper level of the substructure, backfill material
shall be placed to the subgrade of the pavement in lifts consistent with the
type of soil involved and the degree of consolidation specified by the City.
Broken pavement, large stones, roots, and other debris shall not be used in the
backfill. The number and size of each lift shall be dependent upon the types of
soil involved. Such backfill shall be done in a manner that will permit the
restoration of the surface to a density condition not less than the existing
prior to excavation unless otherwise specified. The City may require compaction
tests to be furnished by a recognized soil testing laboratory or registered
professional engineer specializing in soil mechanics when, in the opinion of
the City, backfill for any excavation is not being adequately compacted. In
order for the resurfacing to be permitted, such tests must show that the
backfill material meets the minimum requirements as prescribed by the City. All
expenses of such tests shall be borne by the permittee.
141.18   TRENCHES IN PIPE LAYING.
The maximum length of open trench permissible at any time shall be in
accordance with existing ordinances or regulations.
141.19   PROMPT COMPLETION OF WORK.
After an excavation is commenced, the permittee shall prosecute with diligence
and expedition all excavation work covered by the excavation permit and shall
promptly complete such work and restore the street to its original condition,
or as near as may be, so as not to obstruct the public place or travel thereon
more than is reasonably necessary.
141.20   URGENT WORK.
When traffic conditions, the safety or convenience of the traveling public, or
the public interest, require that the excavation work be performed as emergency
work, the City may have full power to order, at the time a permit is granted,
that a crew of workers and adequate facilities be employed by the permittee 24
hours a day to the end that such excavation work may be completed as soon as
possible.
141.21   EMERGENCY ACTION.
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the making of such
excavations as may be necessary for the preservation of life or property or for
the location of trouble in conduit or pipe, or for making repairs, provided
that the person making such excavation shall apply to the City for such permit
on the first working day after such work is commenced.
141.22   NOISE, DUST, AND DEBRIS.
Each permittee shall conduct and carry out excavation work in such manner as to
avoid unnecessary inconvenience and annoyance to the general public and
occupants of neighboring property. The permittee shall take appropriate
measures to reduce to the fullest extent practicable in the performance of the
excavation work, dust, unsightly debris, and noise, consistent with the
provisions of Section
155.05.
141.23   PRESERVATION OF MONUMENTS.
Any monument set for the purpose of locating or preserving the lines of any
street or property subdivision, or a precise survey reference point, or a
permanent survey benchmark within the City, shall not be removed or disturbed,
or caused to be removed or disturbed, without first obtaining permission in
writing from the City to do so. Permission to remove or disturb such monuments,
reference points, or benchmarks shall only be granted upon condition that the
person applying for such permission shall pay all expenses incident to the
proper replacement of this monument by the City.
141.24   INSPECTIONS.
The City shall make such inspections as are reasonably necessary in the
enforcement of this chapter. The City shall have the authority to promulgate
and cause to be enforced such rules and regulations as may be reasonably
necessary to enforce and carry out the intent of this chapter.
141.25   LOCATION RECORDS.
Every public utility shall maintain records showing the location of all its
underground facilities, except relatively minor facilities which connect a
particular premises or building to a facility serving more than one premises or
building, and except oil or gas gathering or field lines. Every public utility
shall maintain equipment which can locate such facilities in the field.

142.01   PURPOSE AND RULE OF INTERPRETATION.
The Council finds it is necessary and desirable to establish uniform rules and
controls: (a) to ensure public safety and provide efficient delivery of
services by the City and others wishing to utilize streets and other public
property for the delivery of utility or other services; (b) to protect public
and private investment; (c) to ensure the orderly use of public property and
the health, safety, and welfare of the population; and (d) to provide for the
regulation and administration of the public streets and other public property.
This chapter is to be interpreted in light of these findings for the benefit of
the public and users of the City streets and other public property.
Accordingly, this chapter imposes fair, efficient, competitively neutral,
uniform, and reasonable regulations on the placement and maintenance of
facilities currently within the City’s right-of-way or to be placed herein.
142.02   DEFINITIONS.
For purposes of this chapter the following terms are defined:
1.   “City right-of-way” means the area on, below, or above a City roadway,
street, bridge, bicycle path, or City sidewalk, in which the City has an
interest, including other dedicated rights-of-way for travel purposes and
utility easements. A City right-of-way does not include the airwaves above a
City right-of-way with regard to cellular or other non-wire telecommunications
or broadcasts service or utility poles owned by the City.
2.   “Right-of-way users”’ means those entities, except the City, that own or
operate facilities that are or are proposed to be installed within City right-
of-way.
142.03   FRANCHISE REQUIRED.
No person shall erect, maintain, or operate any plants or systems for electric
light and power, heating, cable television, or gas works within the City
through the use of the right-of-way to provide customers within the City
without first obtaining a franchise from the City as provided in Chapter 364 of
the Code of Iowa.
142.04   FRANCHISE SUPREMACY.
The terms of any existing franchise or other existing agreement allowing the
use of the right-of-way which are in direct conflict with any provision of this
chapter, shall control and supersede the conflicting terms of this chapter
until the expiration of such franchise or other agreement, provided, however,
that requirements set forth in this chapter relating to insurance, bonds,
penalties, security funds, letters of credit, indemnification, or any other
security in favor of the City may also be applicable in the sole determination
of the City or unless otherwise negotiated by the City and franchise grantee.
All other terms of this chapter shall be fully applicable to all persons
whether franchised or not.
142.05   FRANCHISE TERM LIMIT.
No franchise for use of the right-of-way or other public property shall be
granted for a term of more than 25 years.
142.06   RIGHT TO OCCUPY RIGHT-OF-WAY.
1.   Any person, required to register under this chapter, that occupies, uses,
or places its equipment in the right-of-way, is hereby granted a right to do so
if and only for so long as it:
   A.   Timely pays all fees as provided herein; and
   B.   Complies with all other requirements of law.
2.   The grant of right to occupy hereunder is expressly conditioned on, and is
subject to, the police powers of the City, continuing compliance with all
provisions of law now or hereafter enacted, including this chapter as it may
be, from time to time, amended and further, is specifically subject to the
obligation to obtain any and all additional required authorizations, whether
from the City or other governmental body or authority.
142.07   REGISTRATION.
1.   The City and all right-of-way users that have or propose to have
facilities within the City right-of-way shall register annually with the City
on or before January 1 of each year to provide the following information:
   A.   The identity and form of legal entity of the registrant and, if wholly
owned by another legal entity, the identity of the owning entity.
   B.   The name, address, and telephone number of the officer, agent, or
employee responsible for the accuracy of the registration statement, and for
local operations of the right-of-way user.
   C.   A description of the registrant’s existing and proposed facilities
within the City right-of-way.
   D.   A description of the service that the registrant intends to offer or is
currently offering within the City.
   E.   Information sufficient to enable the City to determine that the
registrant has applied for or received any document or certificate required by
State or federal law to provide services or facilities within the City.
   F.   Proof of registration with the Iowa One-call system, if applicable.
2.   Each right-of-way user registration, and registration by the City, shall
be accompanied by such registration fee as shall be set by Council resolution.
3.   The purpose of the registration required by this section is to assist the
City in enforcement of its regulations; and, to assist the City in the
abatement of dangerous conditions or conditions that threaten to interfere with
the property of others by reason of the registrant’s facilities.
142.08   RIGHT-OF-WAY INSTALLATION PERMITS.
1.   A right-of-way user shall obtain, by application to the City Public Works
Director, a permit for installation in the City right-of-way whenever the
right-of-way user desires to place, construct, or bury anything in the City
right-of-way. Such application shall be accompanied by:
   A.   Written and graphic material that states and shows the particular part
of or point on the City right-of-way where placement, construction, or
excavation is proposed to occur.
   B.   Statement of the beginning and ending dates for the time during which
the work is to be done and completed.
   C.   A sign-off sheet showing that all other registered right-of-way users,
the City, with facilities in the vicinity of the proposed installation or
repair work have reviewed the plan for the proposed work and have no objection.
So as not to have undue delay, the right-of-way user making application for the
permit need only wait 10 working days from the time of submitting its plans to
the other right-of-way users. Failure by a right-of-way user to respond to such
requested plan review within 10 days shall constitute an expression of no
objection. If there is a dispute between right-of-way users as to location of
the respective facilities of each in a segment of City right-of-way, the Public
Works Director shall determine the placement of such facilities in a manner
reasonably consistent with how various kinds of facilities are shown to be
placed on a model right-of-way cross section established and maintained on file
for public inspection by the Public Works Director.
   D.   Plans and specifications for the proposed work in such detail as the
Public Works Director shall reasonably require showing that the work as
proposed conforms to City ordinances, regulations, and policies.
2.   In making excavations in the City right-of-way, the right-of-way user
shall do the work in a manner devised to cause the least possible inconvenience
to the public.
3.   The right-of-way user shall properly protect, according to safety
standards generally accepted at the time that the installation in the City
right-of-way occurs, all excavations and obstructions by proper placement of
barricades, warning lights, and such other or additional devices, in accordance
with the Iowa Statewide Urban Design and Specifications (SUDAS), as
circumstances may warrant. If, in the opinion of the City Public Works
Director, such excavation or obstruction is not properly and safely protected,
the City Public Works Director shall notify the right-of-way user and the
right-of-way user shall comply immediately with the instructions of the Public
Works Director. Failure or refusal by the right-of-way user to follow such
instructions shall constitute a violation of this section.
4.   Any trenches or excavations opened by a right-of-way user in the City
right-of-way shall be filled by the right-of-way user. All backfilling in the
City right-of-way shall be done in accordance with City specifications,
including specification for the replacement of grass and other landscaping
features.
5.   Temporary street surfacing shall be placed in excavations in a City street
as soon as the same has been backfilled. Pavements, sidewalks, curbs, and
gutters or other portions of streets and public places opened, disturbed, or
damaged shall be promptly restored and replaced with like materials at the
expense of the right-of-way user and left in as good a condition as before the
opening, disturbance, or damage occurred. In the event that like materials for
replacement are not available, the Public Works Director may approve the use of
an alternative material that is reasonably close in effect to the original
material. The Public Works Director will consider and evaluate for approved
use, on a case-by-case basis, such alternative methods that meet standards of
good engineering practice.
6.   Where a cut or disturbance is made by a right-of-way user to a section of
a street or a sidewalk paving, rather than replacing only the area cut, the
right-of-way user shall replace the full width of the existing sidewalk or
street paving and the full length of the section or sections cut, a section
being that area marked by expansion joints or scoring, or as directed by the
City.
7.   Right-of-way users shall maintain, repair, and keep in good condition for
a period of two years following such disturbance all portions of the City
street surface disturbed by a right-of-way user. Landscaping that is so
disturbed shall be repaired and maintained for a period of one year. Grass that
is so disturbed shall be repaired and maintained for a period of 60 days.
8.   No right-of-way user, or any person acting on the right-of-way user’s
behalf, shall commence any non-emergency work in the City right-of-way without
five working days advance notice to the City. In the event of an emergency
involving public safety, the Public Works Director, or designee, may issue the
permit orally, but the written documentation of the application for and
issuance of the permit shall be completed as soon as practicable after the work
has started.
9.   Whenever any existing electric utility facilities, cable television
facilities, or other telecommunications facilities are installed underground in
a certain segment of the City right-of-way, any other right-of-way user shall
also locate its facilities underground in that segment of the City right-of-
way.
10.   Street crossings and sidewalk crossings by right-of-way user facilities
shall be bored at those locations where reasonably required by the Public Works
Director. Some examples of where such boring may be required are: major
streets, new streets, and locations of major events that conflict with
construction.
11.   No permit shall be issued for the installation of right-of-way user
facilities in the City right-of-way unless the right-of-way user has filed with
the City a registration statement in accordance with Section
142.07 above.
12.   No permit for installation of right-of-way user facilities in the City
right-of-way shall be issued by the City Public Works Director unless the
right-of-way user has paid such installation permit fee as shall be
established, from time to time, by resolution of the Council.
13.   Installation and repair work shall be done in accordance with the City
street tree protection policy requirements. All trees, landscaping, and grounds
removed, damaged, or disturbed as a result of installations by a right-of-way
user in the City right-of-way shall be replaced or restored as soon as is
reasonably possible, in accordance with the City street tree protection policy
with respect to effects of construction in the City right-of-way.
14.   No excavation or obstruction permit shall be required for the routine
maintenance and minor repair of equipment located in the right-of- way.
Activities constituting “routine maintenance” and “minor repair” work for
purposes of this chapter shall be restricted exclusively to work conducted on
equipment located aboveground or overhead and as more specifically limited in
the Right-of-Way Access Standards Book. Registrants shall be required to
restore the work area for such routine maintenance or minor repair projects to
the same condition that existed before the commencement of such work. Routine
maintenance and minor repair work shall be covered under the performance and
restoration bond and indemnification required under Section
142.20 of this chapter.
142.09   COMPLETION OF INSTALLATIONS.
A right-of-way user shall promptly complete all installations in the City
right-of-way so as to minimize disruption of the City ways and other public and
private property. All installation work authorized by permit within the City
right-of-way, including restoration work, shall be completed as soon as
possible but not later than 180 days of the date the City Public Works Director
issued a permit for the installation. An extension may be granted for good
cause due to circumstances beyond the control of the right-of-way user.
142.10   INSPECTION.
The City Inspector shall be afforded full access to registrant’s worksites to
review compliance with the terms of this chapter and to make any inspection or
test that the City determines is necessary to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, and to ensure that the work for which the applicable
permit was granted is being carried out in the authorized area of the right-of-
way and within the permitted time limit. The City Inspector may issue an order
to the registrant for any work which does not conform to the applicable
standards, conditions, or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct
the violation within 10 days after issuance of the order will be cause for
revocation of the permit pursuant to Section
142.11 of this chapter. The City Inspector shall not, however, make any
determinations or have control over the registrant’s work other than to require
that same be carried out in compliance with this chapter, within the authorized
area of the right-of-way, and within the time permitted for the work. The City
Inspector shall not make any determinations or have authority over or
responsibility for the means, methods, techniques, sequences, or procedures of
work being performed by the registrant, for safety precautions and programs
incident to the work, or for any failure of the registrant to comply with
applicable laws, rules, and regulations governing registrant’s performance of
the work. The City Inspector shall not make any determinations or have
authority over or responsibility for the structural integrity or safety of any
non-City equipment constructed, installed, repaired, reconstructed, replaced,
or restored in the right-of-way, nor shall it make any determinations or have
authority over or responsibility for the ability of non-City equipment to
function as intended in the right-of-way.
142.11   REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
1.   If the City determines that the permittee has committed a material breach
of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or any
condition of an applicable permit, the City shall make written demand upon the
permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued
violation may be cause for the immediate forfeiture of the permittee’s
franchise, the termination of all rights thereunder, and the revocation of all
rights established and granted under this chapter. Further, a material breach,
as set forth above, shall allow the City, at the City’s discretion, to place
additional or revised conditions on the applicable permit.
2.   Within 10 business days after receiving written notification of the
breach, the permittee shall provide the City with a written plan, acceptable to
the City Inspector, for its correction. Permittee’s failure to so contact the
City Inspector, the permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable plan, or the
permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan shall be cause
for immediate forfeiture of the permittee’s franchise, the termination of all
rights hereunder, and the revocation of all rights established and granted
under this chapter. Further, the permittee’s failure to so contact the City
Inspector, or the permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable plan, or the
permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan shall
automatically place the permittee on probation for one year.
3.   If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall reimburse the City for the
City’s reasonable costs including, but not limited to, restoration costs, the
costs of collection, and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in connection with
such revocation.
4.   In addition to the specific remedies set forth above, any material breach
of the terms of this chapter shall constitute a municipal infraction as set
forth in
Chapter 3 of this Code of Ordinances.
142.12   INTERFERENCE WITH THE CITY.
A right-of-way user shall so construct, maintain, operate, and locate its
facilities in the City right-of-way so as not to interfere with the
construction, location, maintenance, and operation of City sewer, water,
drainage, electrical, communications, signal, and fiber optic facilities, or
any other operations or facilities of the City. The City shall have the right
and power by resolution of its Council, or by order of its Public Works
Director, to specifically direct the location of right-of-way user facilities
with reference to City facilities, existing or proposed, in such a manner as
shall serve the public use and convenience. Failure or refusal by a right-of-
way user to promptly follow such directions shall be a violation of this
section.
142.13   RELOCATION OR REMOVAL.
Following written notice from the City, a right-of-way user shall, at its own
expense, promptly, temporarily or permanently, relocate, change or alter the
position of any facilities within the City right-of-way whenever the City shall
have determined that such relocation, change, or alteration is reasonably
necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any
City public improvement, or for the operations of the City in or upon the City
right-of-way.
142.14   REMOVAL OF UNAUTHORIZED FACILITIES.
Following written notice from the City, a right-of-way user that owns,
controls, or maintains any unauthorized facility within the City right-of-way
shall promptly remove such facilities from the City right-of-way at the right-
of-way users sole expense. A facility is unauthorized if:
1.   Any license, permit, or authorization required by federal, State, or City
regulations with respect to the facilities has not been obtained, or has been
revoked, or allowed to expire.
2.   The facilities are not installed in accordance with the permit for
installation or other requirements of this chapter.
142.15   ABANDONED AND UNUSABLE EQUIPMENT.
1.   A registrant who has determined to discontinue its operations with respect
to any equipment in any right-of-way, or segment, or portion thereof, must
either:
   A.   Obtain the Council’s approval by resolution of the transfer of the
registrant’s obligations for its equipment in the right-of-way under this
chapter to another person. The aforementioned resolution approving such a
proposed transfer shall not be considered until the registrant has filed with
the City Inspector written notice of the proposed sale, transfer, disposition,
or assignment, such notice to clearly summarize the proposed procedure and the
terms and conditions thereof. Similarly, the proposed vendee, assignee, or
lessee shall file an instrument with the City Inspector, duly executed,
reciting such proposal, accepting the terms of this chapter and franchise, if
applicable, and agreeing to perform all of the conditions thereof and all of
the obligations of the proposed transfer. The aforementioned approval by the
Council shall not be unreasonably withheld; or
   B.   Submit to the City a proposal and instruments for transferring
ownership of its equipment to the City. If a registrant proceeds under this
clause, the City may, at its option:
      (1)   Purchase the equipment;
      (2)   Require the registrant, at its own expense, to remove it; or
      (3)   Require the registrant to post an additional bond or an increased
bond amount sufficient to reimburse the City for reasonably anticipated costs
to be incurred in removing the equipment.
2.   Equipment of a registrant which fails to comply with the provisions of
this section, and which for two years remains unused, shall be deemed to be
abandoned. Abandoned equipment is deemed to be a nuisance. The City may:
   A.   Abate the nuisance in accordance with the provisions of
Chapter 50 of this Code of Ordinances;
   B.   Take possession of the equipment and restore it to a usable condition;
   C.   Require removal of the equipment by the registrant or by the
registrant’s surety; or
   D.   Exercise its rights pursuant to the performance and restoration bond.
3.   Any registrant who has unusable equipment in any right-of-way shall remove
it from that right-of-way during the next scheduled excavation, unless this
requirement is waived by the City.
142.16   COMPLIANCE WITH PERMIT.
All installation work and activities for right-of-way user facilities in the
City right-of-way shall be in accordance with the installation permit issued by
the Public Works Director. Any work done that is not in accordance with an
applicable installation permit shall be a violation of this section by the
right-of-way user; and, failure to do work required by an installation permit
shall be a violation by the right-of-way user, regardless of involvement of
agents or contractors of the right-of-way user.
142.17   EMERGENCY REMOVAL OR RELOCATION.
The City shall have the right and power to cut or move any right-of-way
facilities in the City right-of-way as the City may determine to be necessary,
appropriate, or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency.
The City shall endeavor to give notice of such emergency disruption, but
nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to create a duty to give such notice.
Restoration of right-of-way facilities that have been cut or moved as aforesaid
shall be done by the right-of-way user at its own expense.
142.18   COORDINATION OF INSTALLATIONS.
All right-of-way users with facilities in the City right-of-way or who expect
to install facilities in the City right-of-way shall coordinate such activities
with the City and with each other right-of-way user. Between January 1 and
February 1 of each year, all registered right-of-way users shall provide to the
City a schedule of their anticipated installations in the City right-of way for
that calendar year. Each registered right-of-way user shall meet with the City,
and with the other registered right-of-way users as scheduled by the City
Public Works Director, to schedule and coordinate installation of right-of-way
user facilities in the City right-of-way, so as to minimize public
inconvenience and costs.
142.19   ENFORCEMENT.
1.   Penalties. For violation of provisions of this chapter the City may seek
fines in the amounts of $500.00 for a first offense within a year, $750.00 for
each subsequent offense within a year. The penalties shall be assessable
against an owner or operator and shall be chargeable to its performance bond
and/or letter of credit, at the City’s discretion. Each day that a violation
occurs or is permitted to exist constitutes a repeat offense.
2.   Injunctive Relief. In addition to any other remedies hereunder, the City
may seek an injunction to mitigate or terminate a violation, or employ any
other remedy available at law or equity including, but not limited to,
imposition of penalties pursuant to Subsection 1 of this section.
3.   Timely Performance or Compliance. Any failure of the City to insist on
timely performance or compliance by any person shall not constitute a waiver of
the City’s right to later insist on timely performance or compliance by that
person or any other person.
4.   Remedies Cumulative. All remedies specified in this chapter are cumulative
unless otherwise expressly stated. The exercise of one remedy shall not
foreclose use of another, nor shall the exercise of a remedy or the payment of
liquidated damages or penalties relieve an operator of its obligations to
comply with this chapter. In exercising any remedy specified in this chapter,
including Subsections 1 and 2, the City shall comply with any substantive and
procedural requirements for exercising such remedies in an owner’s or
operator’s franchise agreement or other authorization.
5.   Reduce or Waive Penalties. The City Public Works Director or attorney may
reduce or waive any of the above listed penalties for good cause shown.
142.20   INSURANCE, BOND REQUIREMENTS, AND INDEMNIFICATION.
1.   A right-of-way user that has or expects to install facilities within the
City right-of-way shall maintain in effect such insurance as the City’s risk
manager shall reasonably deem appropriate to the nature of the facilities
installed or to be installed, and the location of such installations.
2.   The Public Works Director may require performance security in an amount
commensurate with the scope of the work, to secure satisfactory installation in
accordance with the installation permit, by means of an irrevocable letter of
credit in a form approved by the City Attorney, or by cash deposit.
3.   A right-of-way user that has or expects to install facilities within the
City right-of-way shall provide the City a Hold-Harmless, Waiver of Liability,
and Indemnification Agreement regarding the installation and maintenance of
such facilities.
142.21   POLE ATTACHMENTS.
At those locations on the City right-of-way where there are already existing
utility poles of either the City or of some other right-of-way user, a second
set of poles is strictly prohibited, except when done by or at the request of
the City. If there is not sufficient space on the existing utility poles for
attachment of the proposed additional right-of-way user facilities, or if the
right-of-way user proposing to install right-of-way user facilities at the site
of the existing poles cannot reach an agreement with the owner of the poles to
allow attachment of those facilities, then those facilities shall be installed
underground.
142.22   APPEAL TO CITY COUNCIL.
A right-of-way user that is denied registration, denied a right-of-way
installation permit, that has its right-of-way installation permit revoked, or
that believes that the fees imposed do not conform to the requirements of
Chapter 480A of the Code of Iowa, may request in writing that such denial,
revocation, or fee imposition be reviewed by the Council. The Council shall act
within 60 days of a timely written request. A decision by the Council affirming
the denial, revocation, or fee imposition must be in writing and supported by a
written finding establishing the reasonableness of the decision.
142.23   NO EASEMENT, PERMISSION ONLY, NOT ASSIGNABLE.
The provisions of this chapter, and the permits and authorizations granted
pursuant to this chapter, shall not be deemed to create, or grant to anyone any
easement, estate, or interest in the property of the City. A permit to install
right-of-way user facilities in the City right-of-way is a mere license, that
is, an authorization to the stated entity to go onto the land of the City to do
only that which is explicitly stated by the permit, that may be revoked by the
City as provided in this chapter, and that cannot be assigned to another. A
right-of-way user that occupies City right-of-way or makes an installation of
facilities in the City right-of-way on the basis of a purported assignment of
an installation permit granted to another entity, shall be in violation of this
section.
142.24   FRANCHISE FEE CREDIT.
For a right-of-way user that pays a franchise fee, the amount of any
registration fee paid per Subsection
142.07(2) and any installation permit fee paid per Subsection
142.08(12) shall be applied as a credit to reduce the amount due for the
franchise fee.

145.01   ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.
The Building Inspector is responsible for the enforcement of this chapter.
145.02   GENERAL DEFINITION OF UNSAFE.
All buildings or structures that are structurally unsafe or not provided with
adequate egress, or that constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise dangerous
to human life, or that in relation to existing use constitute a hazard to
safety or health, or public welfare, by reason of inadequate maintenance,
dilapidation, obsolescence, or abandonment, are, for the purpose of this
chapter, unsafe buildings. All such unsafe buildings are hereby declared to be
public nuisances and shall be abated by repair, rehabilitation, demolition, or
removal in accordance with the procedure specified in this chapter.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 657A.1 and 364.12[3a])
145.03   UNSAFE BUILDING.
“Unsafe building” means any structure or mobile home meeting any or all of the
following criteria:
1.   Various Inadequacies. Whenever the building or structure, or any portion
thereof, because of:
   A.   Dilapidation, deterioration, or decay;
   B.   Faulty construction;
   C.   The removal, movement, or instability of any portion of the ground
necessary for the purpose of supporting such building;
   D.   The deterioration, decay, or inadequacy of its foundation; or
   E.   Any other cause, is likely to partially or completely collapse.
2.   Manifestly Unsafe. Whenever, for any reason, the building or structure, or
any portion thereof, is manifestly unsafe for the purpose for which it is being
used.
3.   Inadequate Maintenance. Whenever a building or structure, used or intended
to be used for dwelling purposes, because of dilapidation, decay, damage,
faulty construction, or otherwise, is determined by any health officer to be
unsanitary, unfit for human habitation or in such condition that it is likely
to cause sickness or disease.
4.   Fire Hazard. Whenever any building or structure, because of dilapidated
condition, deterioration, damage, or other cause, is determined by the Fire
Marshal or Fire Chief to be a fire hazard.
5.   Abandoned. Whenever any portion of a building or structure remains on a
site after the demolition or destruction of the building or structure or
whenever any building or structure is abandoned for a period in excess of six
months so as to constitute such building or portion thereof an attractive
nuisance or hazard to the public.
145.04   NOTICE TO OWNER.
The enforcement officer shall examine or cause to be examined every building or
structure or portion thereof reported as dangerous or damaged and, if such is
found to be an unsafe building as defined in this chapter, the enforcement
officer shall give to the owner of such building or structure written notice
stating the defects thereof. This notice may require the owner or person in
charge of the building or premises, within 48 hours or such reasonable time as
the circumstances require, to commence either the required repairs or
improvements or demolition and removal of the building or structure or portions
thereof, and all such work shall be completed within 90 days from date of
notice, unless otherwise stipulated by the enforcement officer. If necessary,
such notice shall also require the building, structure, or portion thereof to
be vacated forthwith and not reoccupied until the required repairs and
improvements are completed, inspected, and approved by the enforcement officer.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[3h])
1.   Notice Served. Such notice shall be served by sending by certified mail to
the owner of record, according to Section 364.12[3h] of the Code of Iowa, if
the owner is found within the City limits. If the owner is not found within the
City limits, such service may be made upon the owner by registered mail or
certified mail. The designated period within which said owner or person in
charge is required to comply with the order of the enforcement officer shall
begin as of the date the owner receives such notice.
2.   Hearing. Such notice shall also advise the owner that he or she may
request a hearing before the Council on the notice by filing a written request
for hearing within the time provided in the notice.
145.05   CONDUCT OF HEARING.
If requested, the Council shall conduct a hearing in accordance with the
following:
1.   Notice. The owner shall be served with written notice specifying the date,
time and place of hearing.

issue such order as it deems appropriate.† 12
 
Notes
   † EDITOR’S NOTE: Suggested forms of notice and of a resolution and order of the
   Council for the administration of this chapter are provided in the APPENDIX to
12 this Code of Ordinances. Caution is urged in the use of this procedure. We
   recommend you review the situation with your attorney before initiating
   procedures and follow his or her recommendation carefully.
145.06   POSTING OF SIGNS.
The enforcement officer shall cause to be posted at each entrance to such
building a notice to read: “DO NOT ENTER. UNSAFE TO OCCUPY. CITY OF LECLAIRE,
IOWA.” Such notice shall remain posted until the required demolition, removal
or repairs are completed. Such notice shall not be removed without written
permission of the enforcement officer and no person shall enter the building
except for the purpose of making the required repairs or of demolishing the
building.
145.07   RIGHT TO DEMOLISH; MUNICIPAL INFRACTION.
In case the owner fails, neglects, or refuses to comply with the notice to
repair, rehabilitate, or to demolish and remove the building or structure or
portion thereof, the Council may order the owner of the building prosecuted as
a violator of the provisions of this chapter and may order the enforcement
officer to proceed with the work specified in such notice. A statement of the
cost of such work shall be transmitted to the Council. As an alternative to
this action, the City may utilize the municipal infraction process to abate the
nuisance.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[3h])
145.08   COSTS.
Costs incurred under Section
145.07 shall be paid out of the City treasury. Such costs shall be charged to
the owner of the premises involved and levied as a special assessment against
the land on which the building or structure is located, and shall be certified
to the County Treasurer for collection in the manner provided for other taxes.
In addition, the City may take any other action deemed appropriate to recover
costs incurred.

BUILDING NUMBERING
 
150.01 Grid System        150.03 Administration of House Numbering
150.02 General Provisions
 
150.01   GRID SYSTEM.
There is hereby established a uniform grid system to be used in the numbering
of buildings in an orderly manner as follows:
1.   Base Lines. The numbering system shall begin at the established base
lines.
   A.   Wisconsin Street. The base street for those streets running in an east-
west direction shall be Wisconsin Street. Even numbers shall be assigned to
buildings on the south side of the street. Odd numbers shall be assigned to
buildings on the north side of the street.
   B.   Cody Road. The base street for those streets running in a north-south
direction shall be Cody Road at its easternmost location. Even numbers shall be
assigned to buildings on the west side of the street. Odd numbers shall be
assigned to buildings on the east side of the street.
2.   Blocks. There shall be 14 blocks per mile. 375 feet shall be established
as a general guideline to equal a “block” in areas where streets do not occur
at regular intervals.
3.   Numbers Per Block. 100 numbers per block face are possible. In the process
of assigning numbers to buildings, a bias toward the first 50 numbers of the
number set shall be implemented. Seven and one-half feet per number shall be
the approximate figure for numbering buildings.
150.02   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
1.   Each platted lot shall have one primary structure which will be assigned a
number.
2.   Unsubdivided Land. If more than one main structure exists on a parcel of
land that has not been subdivided, each structure (home or business) should
have an individual house number. It should be noted that such instances
constitute nonconforming uses according to the Zoning Ordinance.
3.   Corner Lots. The address shall be assigned to the frontage of the lot
having the smallest dimension. If the lot has equal dimensions, the address
shall be assigned to the street on which the primary structure faces.
4.   Planned Unit Development. Planned unit developments should follow the
general grid system as closely as possible and exercise discretion in the
naming of the streets and numbering of buildings.
150.03   ADMINISTRATION OF HOUSE NUMBERING.
The Planning and Zoning Commission of the City shall have the power and duty to
establish, review, and revise, if found necessary, a house numbering system or
street numbering system to be effective within the City. The authority for
administration of assigning numbers to buildings shall be placed with the
Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer. Such officer shall issue addresses at
the time building permits are issued, and shall be responsible for the
maintenance of the record of all such addresses issued.

155.01   PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to adopt by reference complete codes regulating
the erection, construction, enlargement, alteration, repair, moving, removal,
conversion, demolition, occupancy, equipment, use, heights, area, and
maintenance of buildings and structures to provide for the preservation of the
health, safety, welfare, and overall benefits of the citizens of the City.
155.02   ADOPTION OF BUILDING CODES, STANDARDS, AND SUPPLEMENTS.
The regulations contained within Chapter 5 of the Scott County Code (Uniform
Construction Codes, including the International Building Code, the
International Residential Code, Uniform Mechanical Code, the Uniform Plumbing
Code, the International Property Maintenance Code, and the National Electric
Code), as amended and updated by County and as further specifically amended
herein-below, shall be adopted as the regulations governing any and all
construction of buildings and other structures or work done in the City.
155.03   AMENDMENTS, MODIFICATIONS, ADDITIONS, AND DELETIONS.
The following amendments, modifications, additions, and deletions to the Codes
as adopted in Section
155.02 are hereby made:
1.   “Iowa” is inserted as the name of the state and “City of LeClaire” as the
name of the municipality in those parts of the Codes where such insertions are
necessary or appropriate.
2.   A dimensioned plot plan shall be submitted to the City for review and
consideration for any work conducted on the exterior of any structure on any
lot. Each applicant shall submit a plot plan showing dimensions of the property
and locations of proposed (and existing) improvements and such other
information as may be necessary for checking compliance of proposed
improvements with the requirements of the Construction Code and Zoning
Ordinance. For all new construction and construction requiring a permanent
foundation/footing system, said plot plan shall be accompanied by a Certificate
of Survey executed by a land surveyor registered under the laws of the State,
certifying that they have surveyed the lot or parcel of real estate described
therein, and has set stakes or monuments at the corners of said tract which are
visible and available for use, a minimum of three-quarter inches steel stakes,
said Certificate of Survey to be dated not more than one year prior to the date
of application for a building permit, or sufficient survey markers shall be
readily visible to assist in verifying dimensions.
3.   All references to building line, height, and zoning are void and the
subject matter of the Zoning Regulations of the City shall be applicable.
4.   It is unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to erect, construct,
enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve, remove, convert, or demolish, equip,
use, occupy, or maintain any building or structure in the City, or cause same
to be done contrary to or in violation of any of the provisions of this code.
Where work for which a permit is required by this code is started prior to
obtaining said permit, the fees specified shall be doubled, but the payment of
such double fees shall not relieve any person from complying fully with any
requirements of this code in the execution of the work, nor from any other
penalties prescribed therein.
5.   The Building Official shall require a permit from the County Board of
Health approving the installation of a septic sewer system on said premises,
which permit shall be attached to the building permit to be issued by the
Building Official of the City and shall be a condition precedent to the
issuance of such building permit. The building permit of the City shall be
amended in an appropriate amount to show the issuance of such permit by the
County Board of Health. Nothing therein contained shall authorize the
installation of a septic sewer system of such City nor to permit the continued
use of septic sewer systems where the ordinances provide for connection with
the sanitary sewer system of the City.
6.   Food Waste Disposal Units Required. New structures erected, arranged, or
intended to be used for purposes which cause, result in, produce, or develop
food wastes in the direct preparation of food, occupancies such as dwellings,
restaurants, hotels, boarding houses, hospitals, and similar occupancies shall
provide and use approved food waste disposal equipment for such purposes within
the premises thereof. Existing structures, converted or altered to the uses as
described above, need not meet the requirements as set forth in this subsection
unless such structure is provided with a new kitchen. Such kitchen only shall
be provided with a food disposal unit.
7.   Causing, maintaining, or permitting graffiti of any nature or form to
remain on any exterior surface of any exterior structure whatsoever shall be
prohibited. For the purposes of the code, the term “graffiti” means the
intentional defacing of any exterior surface of any structure. (This is as
opposed to the normal, customary routine exterior surface maintenance of a
structure.)
155.04   RETROACTIVITY OF CODE.
The adoption by reference of the Codes and regulations as adopted in Section
155.02 shall not be applicable for any building for which buildings shall be
completed in accordance with the Building Code effective when the permit was
issued, and the City shall retain jurisdiction to prosecute such causes of
action and violations of the Code previously adopted and accruing prior to
December 31, 1980, as if the previous code were still in existence. It is
unlawful to erect or construct any building or structure or to commence any
work covered under these ordinances within the City in violation of, or without
complying with the appropriate provisions of such regulations. Copies of such
regulations shall be kept on file in the Clerk’s Office for inspection and
copies shall be furnished to the Building Official.
155.05   HOURS FOR CONSTRUCTION WORK.
1.   It is unlawful for any “commercial contractor” at any time to engage in or
to conduct any “construction activity” anywhere in the City except between the
hours of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. on Monday through Saturday. Permission to
engage in or to conduct “construction activities” at times other than those
mentioned herein may be granted by the City only in those instances when (i)
the public safety, health, and welfare will be enhanced and/or protected by
such authorization, or (ii) where substantial harm will be caused by the
failure to perform critical work in a timely fashion, or (iii) when the “noise
disturbance” emanating from such “construction activity” does not exceed those
decibel levels as established in Paragraph D of this section.
2.   It is unlawful for any person to engage in or to conduct any “construction
activity” anywhere in the City between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. on
Monday through Saturday, before 7:00 a.m. on Monday, and at any time on Sunday,
when the “noise disturbance” emanating from such activity exceeds those decibel
levels as established in Paragraph D.
3.   The provisions of this section shall not apply to the performance of any
work necessary at any time to prevent personal injury or property damage or to
restore damaged essential public services or facilities, nor shall the
provisions of this section apply to any vehicle or equipment whose operations
are regulated pursuant to the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act.
4.   For the purposes of this section the following definitions shall be
applicable:
   A.   The term “commercial contractor” means any person who, for profit or as
an employee of such person, normally engages in an activity associated with the
construction of any building or structure, or the laying of any pavement, or
the installation of any underground piping or other such facility including,
but not limited to, the making of any excavation, the clearing of land, and the
loading or unloading of materials, equipment, or supplies.

disturbs a reasonable person of normal sensitivities; or (ii) causes or tends
to cause an adverse psychological or physiological effect on humans; or (iii)
endangers or injures the safety or health of humans or animals; or (iv)
endangers or injures personal or real property; and (v) is transmitted across a

of this chapter; and all fees provided for in the codes and regulations shall
be paid to the Clerk or the City’s designated representative.
155.07   FAILURE TO COMPLY.
If a property owner fails to remedy a situation covered under the Building Code
or under agreements related to building and property regulations covered by
various permits which direct a property owner to complete stated work within a
stated period of time, the City Administrator may cause to have the work
completed by the City with the costs assessed against the property owner in the
following manner:
1.   Notice. The City Administrator shall notify, by certified and registered
mail, the property owner of the property owner’s failure to remedy a situation
and give that property owner a reasonable amount of time to complete the
necessary work.
2.   Completion of Work. The City Administrator shall, after a reasonable
amount of time, cause to have the work done by City workers or by private
contractors.
3.   Fee Schedule - City Workers. The Council shall establish, by resolution,
the fees and other costs associated with the City’s abatement of any violation
of any provision of this chapter as referenced herein.
4.   Fee Schedule - Private Contractors. When, in the opinion of the City
Administrator, it is desirable or necessary to have work done by private
contractors, the property owner shall be billed at 125 percent of the charge
from the private contractor to the City.

Treasurer for assessment and the costs will then be collected with and in the
same manner as property taxes.

been made to contact the affected property owner, either in person or by phone,
and said property owner is either not contacted or consent is given to make the
necessary repairs and bill them, only direct City costs shall be billed to the
property owner. Equipment costs shall be billed on an hourly basis using
standard rental rates in effect at the time as listed in the current Iowa DOT
Schedule of Equipment Rates. (The provisions of this section do not apply to
non-complying property owners after due notice has been served and as such all
other provisions of this section shall apply thereto.)
155.08   ZONING REVIEW AND COMPLIANCE.
No person will construct, build, establish, modify, or maintain any structure
on any lot without having first obtained a Zoning Review Permit. The cost of

In order to make buildings and structures accessible to and functional for
persons with disabilities and the elderly, the City hereby adopts by reference
the provisions of the Code of Iowa and the Iowa Administrative Code (as they

156.03 New Areas             156.07 Certificate of Occupancy
156.04 Moratorium on Permits
 
156.01   BUILDING PERMITS.
No building permits for the construction of residential buildings, single or
multi-family dwellings, or for commercial or industrial purposes, as defined in
the Zoning Regulations, shall be issued except for construction on sites
equipped with street pavements, sidewalks, sewers (both sanitary and storm),
water service with mains installed, and street lighting and signing, unless
otherwise approved by the Council.
156.02   FULLY EQUIPPED SITES.
The provisions of this chapter do not apply to permits for the construction of
residential, commercial, or industrial buildings on any lot which abuts upon an
established street already served by streetlights, stormwater, and sanitary
sewers, water mains and pavements, including curb and gutter.
156.03   NEW AREAS.
If the existing utilities of the City, including the wastewater treatment and/
or conveyance system, the natural gas and electric system, and the water supply
and/or distribution system, are not adequate to carry a load in addition to
that created by the construction of buildings on streets served by such
utilities, no additional load shall be placed on such utilities until the
capacity of the utilities has increased.
156.04   MORATORIUM ON PERMITS.
If, in the judgment of the Council, the water supply and distribution system of
the City and the wastewater treatment and conveyance system become loaded to
their full capacity, and if any additional burden or service requirement would
result in serious damage to the premises now being served with the consequent
injury to the public health and safety, then the issuance of any building
permits for the construction of new buildings, either commercial, residential,
or industrial, calling for services from or by the municipal waterworks system
or the wastewater treatment and conveyance system is prohibited until such time
that the capacity of the systems may be increased to provide for such
additional service.
156.05   STOP ORDER.
Whenever any work is being done in violation of the provisions of this Code of
Ordinances, or in variance with the terms of any permit issued for such work,
the Building Inspector or the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer may order
all work on the job stopped until such violation or variance is eliminated, and
any work or installation made in violation of this Code corrected. Such stop
order, if oral, shall be followed by a written stop order within 24 hours
(excluding Saturday, Sunday, or holidays). It shall be unlawful to do or
perform any work in violation of such stop order, except as may be necessary to
prevent injury or damage to persons or property. Such stop order may be revoked
by the Building Inspector, Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer, the Mayor,
Council, or City Administrator.
156.06   INTERPRETATION.
Wherever in the building regulations it is provided that anything must be done
to the approval of or subject to the direction of the Building Inspector,
Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer, or any other officer of the City, this
shall be construed to give such officer only the discretion of determining
whether the rules and standards established by ordinance have been complied
with; and no provision shall be construed as giving any officer discretionary
powers as to what such regulations or standards shall be, or power to require
conditions not prescribed by ordinance, or to enforce ordinance provisions in
an arbitrary or discriminatory manner.
156.07   CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
No Certificate of Occupancy for any building or structure erected, altered, or
repaired after the adoption of the Building Code shall be issued unless such
building or structure was erected, altered, or repaired in compliance with the
provisions thereof.

157.01   COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
It is unlawful to construct, maintain, install, or enlarge any swimming pool in
the City except in compliance with all provisions of this chapter.
157.02   PRIVATE POOL.
The term “swimming pool” is hereby defined to mean any outdoor, man-made
receptacle, not a part of a natural water course, which has a water depth of 18
inches or more in any portion thereof, intended for swimming, bathing,
immersion, or partial immersion, or other recreational activities by human
beings, and including all appurtenant equipment a part thereof. This definition
includes “in-ground,” “above-ground,” and “on-ground” swimming pools, along
with hot tubs, spas, and “temporary, inflatable, or otherwise constructed”
swimming pools.
157.03   LOCATION.
No portion of a swimming pool outside a building shall be located at a distance
less than eight feet from any side or rear property line, or building line.
Pumps, filters, and pool water disinfection equipment installations shall be
located at a distance not less than eight feet from any side property line. No
swimming pool shall be closer than eight feet to the principal building or
accessory structure having a basement, nor closer than five feet to any
principal building or accessory structure without a basement.
157.04   PERMIT REQUIRED.
It is unlawful to proceed with the construction, installation, enlargement, or
alterations of any private residential swimming pool and appurtenances within
the City unless permits therefore have been obtained from the Building
Inspector. “Temporary, inflatable, or otherwise constructed” swimming pools and
covered hot tubs and spas are exempt from the permit requirements of this
particular section only, providing all other conditions of their use as
enumerated in this chapter are complied with.
157.05   RECIRCULATION POOLS.
All swimming pools shall be of the recirculation type in which circulation of
the water is maintained through the pool by pumps; the water drawn from the
pool being clarified and disinfected before being returned to the pool.
157.06   FENCES.
1.   Every person who owns or is in possession of any premises on which there
is situated a swimming pool with a water depth of 18 inches or more in any
portion thereof shall maintain on the lot or premises upon which such swimming
pool is situated a fence, wall, or other adequate structure completely
surrounding such pool to make the same reasonably inaccessible to all persons,
including small children. Such fence, wall, or other structure must not be less
than four feet in height above the grade with no openings large enough to admit
a child except through doors or gates as hereinafter provided. Any above-ground
pool with a solid, non-collapsible, sidewall height, including access point(s)
of not less than four feet above grade, does not require fencing pursuant to
the requirements of this section providing that any access ladders, stairs, or
other such devices are removed or gated off and locked when the pool is not in
use.
Temporary, inflatable, or otherwise constructed swimming pools and hot tubs and
spas also do not require fencing pursuant to the requirements of this section
providing that the swimming pools are drained, dismantled, and placed in
storage and the hot tubs and spas are covered immediately following each use.
For any hot tub or spa “cover” to meet the requirements and intent of this
chapter, it shall be solid in nature and shall be capable of supporting not
less than 50 pounds of weight. When such pools, hot tubs, or spas are in use,
they shall be monitored at all times by at least one adult who shall be
immediately adjacent to and physically present within not more than 25 feet of
the pool’s location. Any fence, wall, or other adequate structure required
pursuant to the requirements of this section must be constructed and completed
prior to placing any water in any swimming pool.
2.   All doors or gates in fences surrounding swimming pools shall be of such a
size as to completely fill any opening in the fence, wall, or other structure,
and shall be equipped with self-latching devices capable of keeping such gate
or door securely closed. The closing or latching devices shall be located not
less than four feet above grade or be otherwise inaccessible from the outside
to small children. In lieu of such self-closing and self-latching devices, said
doors and gates may be equipped with locks which shall be kept locked at all
times when said pool is not in actual use.
3.   The Building Inspector and/or Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer may
allow slight modifications for good cause shown in individual cases with
respect to height of the fence, wall, or other enclosing structure or the
nature or position of the latch or other locking device. The Building Inspector
may permit other protective devices or structures to be used as the degree of
protection afforded by the substitute devices or structures is not less than
the protection afforded by the fence, wall, or other enclosing structure and
the gate, door, latch, or other locking devices described herein. Upon the
application of a property owner, the Council, only, may grant extensions of
time for compliance for good cause shown in individual cases. Such extensions
of time shall not exceed 30 days at a time.
157.07   WATER SUPPLY.
No source of water other than that secured from the City waterworks
distribution system shall be used in swimming pools.
157.08   ELECTRICAL REQUIREMENTS.
All electrical installations provided for, installed, and used in conjunction
with private residential swimming pools shall be in conformance with the
ordinances regulating electrical installations. No current-carrying electrical
conductors shall cross private residential swimming pools, either overhead or
underground, or within 15 feet of such pools. All metal fences, enclosures, or
railings near or adjacent to swimming pools, which might become electrically
alive as a result of contact with broken overhead conductors or from any other
cause, shall be effectively grounded.
157.09   INSPECTION.
The Building Inspector and/or Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer shall
periodically inspect all swimming pools to determine whether or not the
provisions of the ordinances regarding health, sanitation, and safety
applicable thereto are being complied with.

159.01   SPRINKLER AND STANDPIPE SYSTEMS.
Sprinkler and standpipe systems will be installed in accordance with the
provisions of the various building and fire codes covering these appliances.
The Building Inspector and the Fire Chief will determine the need for and
monitor and approve the installation of these appliances.
159.02   FIRE HYDRANTS.
1.   All fire hydrants erected within the public right-of-way or on immediately
adjacent easements, for the purpose of extinguishing fires, are hereby declared
to be public fire hydrants. No person or persons, except members of the Fire
Department acting in an official capacity or water department personnel, or
other persons that have been specifically authorized by the City and/or
Company, and then only in the exercise of authority delegated by the City and/
or Company, shall open any of said fire hydrants, or attempt to uncover or
remove any protection from, or in any manner tamper with any of said fire
hydrants.
2.   Public fire hydrants shall be installed at such time as any public water
main is extended for a distance of 400 feet or more, or a water main is
replaced and there is no hydrant within 400 feet in either direction. There
shall be no more than 400 feet in travel distance between each public fire
hydrant.
3.   All fire hydrants erected outside of the public right-of-way or outside of
immediately adjacent easements, for the purpose of extinguishing fires, are
hereby declared to be private, on-site fire hydrants. No person or persons,
except members of the Fire Department acting in an official capacity or
designated representatives of the property owner of the property upon which the
private, on-site fire hydrants are located, shall open, or operate any of said
fire hydrants or attempt to uncover, or remove any protection from or in any
manner tamper with any fire hydrant. Private, on-site fire hydrants will not be
opened or operated for any reason by any person except for the purposes of
testing or extinguishing fires and then only at the direction of the Fire Chief
or a representative of the Company.
4.   The City may require private, on-site, fire hydrants and water mains
capable of supplying adequate/required fire flows when any portion of any
structure is more than 150 feet from a public fire hydrant on a public street
or when such conditions exist as are outlined in item Subsection 5 below. The
need for, location, material specifications, and number of private, on-site
fire hydrants will be determined by the City. In making these determinations,
such factors as the following will be considered by the City: (i) the Fire
Chief’s recommendations relative to the Fire Department’s abilities and
equipment status, (ii) the relative severity of a probable fire and the
rapidity with which it may spread, (iii) especially hazardous occupancies, or
special hazards that may exist in addition to the normal hazard of the
occupancy, (iv) the suitability for use and ease of access to public fire
hydrants, and (v) changes in use, occupancy, or configuration of a structure
where such changes cause an increase in the hazards associated with said
structure.
5.   All public fire hydrant material specifications, positioning,
construction, and maintenance will be the responsibility of the Company.
6.   The construction, maintenance, and testing of private, on-site fire
hydrants will be the responsibility of the property owner upon whose property
the fire hydrants are located.
7.   Fire hydrants shall be installed at a minimum of 18 inches from the
nominal ground level to the center of the lowest water outlet.
8.   Fire hydrants shall be positioned so the four- and one-half inch
connection is facing the street or driveway accessible to the Fire Department.
9.   No fire hydrant shall be installed on a water main less than six inches in
diameter. Water mains shall be appropriately sized and installed to provide the
required water flow for hydrant supplied by it.
10.   A four-foot clear space around the circumference of a hydrant and a clear
path of visibility from the hydrant to the road shall be maintained, except as
otherwise required or approved.

162.01   ILLICIT DISCHARGE TO STORMWATER SYSTEM.
1.   For purposes of this chapter, a “responsible party” is one or more persons
that control or are in possession of or own property. Responsible parties shall
be jointly and severally responsible for compliance with this chapter and
jointly and severally liable for any illicit discharge from the property
controlled, possessed, or owned. For purposes of this chapter, “property”
includes, but is not limited to, real estate, fixtures, facilities, and
premises of any kind located upon, under, or above the real estate.
2.   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to relieve a responsible party
subject to an IDNR-issued industrial discharge permit or any other federal,
State, or City permit, statute, chapter, or rule from any obligation imposed by
such permit, statute, ordinance, or rule, if any such obligation is greater
than any obligation imposed by this chapter.
3.   Any discharge into the City’s storm sewer system prohibited by the City’s
MS4 Permit, (all terms, conditions, and requirements of which are hereby
incorporated by reference), shall be deemed an “illicit discharge” in violation
of this chapter. An “illicit discharge” as defined by the EPA’s Phase II
Stormwater Regulations is “any discharge to a municipal separate storm sewer
system that is not composed entirely of stormwater, except discharges pursuant
to an NPDES permit and discharges resulting from fire-fighting activities”.
4.   Sediment pollution originating from excessive erosion rates on any site
not otherwise subject to this chapter and/or any other “pollutants of concern”
entering or allowed to enter a municipal storm sewer that causes a water
quality violation as determined by the DNR shall be deemed an illicit discharge
in violation of this chapter.† 13  In determining what constitutes a water
quality violation for purposes of enforcing this chapter, the City shall base
any decisions on definitive analysis utilizing those published water quality
standards as established by the IDNR. As defined in I.A.C. 567-64.13(2.c.1)
(455B) as amended; “Pollutants of concern” include biochemical oxygen demand
levels, sediment, or a parameter that addresses sediment (total suspended
solids, turbidity, or siltation), pathogens, oil and grease, and any pollutant
that has been identified as a cause of impairment of any water body that will
receive a discharge from the MS4.
 
Notes
   † EDITOR’S NOTE: It is acknowledged that this provision essentially subjects any
13 site to regulation which is more than State or federal law may mandate; however,
   the IDNR has indicated that any discharge that constitutes a water quality
   violation is subject to regulation.
162.02   ILLICIT CONNECTIONS PROHIBITED.
1.   For purposes of this chapter, an “illicit connection” to the City’s storm
sewer system is any physical connection or other topographical or other
condition, natural or artificial, which is not specifically authorized by
ordinance or written rule of the City, which causes or facilitates, directly or
indirectly, an illicit discharge.
2.   The construction, use, maintenance, or continued existence of any illicit
connection is hereby deemed to be a public nuisance and shall constitute a
violation of this chapter.
3.   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
162.03   INDUSTRIAL DISCHARGES.
1.   Any responsible party subject to an industrial NPDES discharge permit
issued by the IDNR shall comply with all provisions of such permit.
2.   Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable
to the City prior to discharges to the storm sewer system authorized by said
permit.
162.04   ILLICIT DISCHARGE DETECTION, REPORTING, AND COST RECOVERY.
1.   All detection activities permitted under this chapter shall be conducted
by the City, or its designee, hereinbefore and after referred to as the “City.”
2.   The City shall not be responsible for the direct or indirect consequences
to persons or property of an illicit discharge, or circumstances which may
cause an illicit discharge, undetected by the City.
3.   Every responsible party has an absolute duty to monitor conditions on
property owned or controlled by them, to prevent all illicit discharges, and to
report to the City any illicit discharges which the responsible party knows or
should have known to have occurred. Failure to comply with any provision of
this chapter is a violation of this code.
   A.   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any responsible
party has information of any known or suspected illicit discharge, the
responsible party shall immediately take all necessary steps to ensure the
discovery, containment, and cleanup of such discharge at the responsible
party’s sole cost.
   B.   If the illicit discharge consists of hazardous materials, the
responsible party shall also immediately notify emergency response agencies of
the occurrence via emergency dispatch services.
   C.   If the illicit discharge emanates from a commercial or industrial
establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an
on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its
recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.
   D.   A report of an illicit discharge shall be made in person or by phone or
facsimile or email to the City immediately but, in any event, within 24 hours
of the illicit discharge; notifications in person or by phone shall be
confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed or emailed to the City within
24 hours of the personal or phone notice.
4.   Any person or entity shall also report to the City any illicit discharge
or circumstances which such person or entity reasonably believes poses a risk
of an illicit discharge.
5.   Upon receiving a report pursuant to the previous subsections, or otherwise
coming into possession of information indicating an actual or imminent illicit
discharge, the City shall conduct an inspection of the site as soon as
reasonably possible, and thereafter shall provide to the responsible party, and
any third-party reporter, a written report of the conditions which may cause or
which have already caused an illicit discharge. The responsible party shall
immediately commence corrective action(s) or remediation and shall complete
such corrective action(s) or remediation within 24 hours.
6.   The City shall be permitted to enter and inspect property subject to
regulation under this chapter as often as is necessary to determine compliance
with this chapter. If a responsible party has security measures that require
identification and clearance before entry to its property or premises, the
responsible party shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access by the
City. By way of specification, but not limitation:
   A.   A responsible party shall allow the City ready access to all parts of
the property for purposes of inspection, sampling, examination, and copying of
records related to a suspected, actual, or imminent illicit discharge, and for
the performance of any additional duties as defined by State and federal law.
   B.   The City shall have the right to set up on any property such devices as
are necessary, in the opinion of the City, to conduct monitoring and/or
sampling related to a suspected, actual, or imminent illicit discharge.
   C.   The City shall have the right to require any responsible party, at
responsible party’s sole expense, to install monitoring equipment and deliver
monitoring data or reports to the City as the City directs. The sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the responsible party at responsible party’s sole
expense. All devices shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
   D.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
property to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
responsible party at the written or oral order of the City and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the responsible
party.
   E.   Any unreasonable delay in allowing the City access to a property is a
violation of this chapter.
7.   If the City has been refused access to any part of the property from where
an illicit connection and/or illicit discharge to a municipal storm sewer or
tributary to a water course is occurring, suspected or imminent, and the City
is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation
of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety, and welfare of the community, then the City may seek issuance of a
search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
8.   If it is determined that an illicit discharge is imminent or has occurred,
any and all costs incurred by the City in the enforcement of this chapter shall
be recovered from the responsible party. The City shall submit an invoice to
the responsible party reflecting the costs incurred by the City for any and all
enforcement activities undertaken under this Code. Failure to pay charges
properly invoiced under this Code within 30 days of billing shall constitute a
violation of this Code, and said charges not timely paid shall constitute a
lien against the property and may be assessed against the property from which
an illicit discharge emanates and collected in the same manner as other
assessments due and owing the City.
162.05   SUSPENSION OF ACCESS TO THE CITY’S STORM SEWER SYSTEM.
1.   Emergency Suspension. The City may, without prior notice, suspend storm
sewer system access to a property when such emergency suspension is necessary
to stop an ongoing or imminent illicit discharge. If the responsible party
fails to immediately comply with an emergency suspension order, the City shall
take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize the illicit
discharge. All costs of such action shall be recovered from the responsible
party for the property identified as the source of the illicit discharge as
referenced in Subsection
162.04(8).
2.   Non-Emergency Suspension. If the City detects or is informed of
circumstances which could cause an illicit discharge, but such illicit
discharge is not ongoing or imminent, and if the suspension of storm sewer
system access would reasonably be expected to prevent or reduce the potential
illicit discharge, the City shall notify the responsible party of the proposed
suspension of storm sewer system access and the time and date of such
suspension. Notice to one responsible party for the property shall be
sufficient notice to all. Timely remediation of the circumstances shall avoid a
violation of this chapter provided that no illicit discharge occurs. In the
alternative, the responsible party may request a meeting with the City for the
purpose of presenting information which the responsible party believes will
show that remediation is unnecessary, and if the City finds such information is
satisfactory, the City may rescind or modify the notice of suspension.
If the City finds such information unsatisfactory, the City shall, issue a
final written order of suspension including the date and time of suspension and
such order may be appealed as provided hereinafter. Any physical action to
reinstate storm sewer system access to property subject to such order prior to
obtaining a court order of relief shall be deemed a violation of this chapter.
An order of suspension shall not preclude charging the responsible party with a
municipal infraction as provided hereinafter or taking any other enforcement
action permitted by statute or ordinance. All costs of such action(s) shall be
recovered from the responsible party for the property identified as the source
of the illicit discharge as referenced in Subsection
162.04(8).
162.06   SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE, WATERCOURSE PROTECTION, RECOGNITION, AND
PROTECTION OF OFFICIAL DRAINAGE SYSTEM.
1.   The “Official Drainage System” as used herein shall mean any stream,
river, ditch, culvert, pipe, natural or man-made watercourse, or other
stormwater conveyance feature, whether located on private or public property
and constructed and/or maintained by private or public entities, that conveys
storm water from, to, or through more than a single property.
2.   Prohibited Acts. Except as provided for herein and then only under the
authority of a duly issued permit, (if applicable), it shall otherwise be
unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to:
   A.   Place, deposit, or permit to be placed or deposited any debris, fill,
sand, stone, or other solid materials of any kind or nature, or construction of
any kind into or across any portion or component of the official drainage
system.
   B.   Construct and/or place any ditch, pipe, culvert, or artificial
watercourse of any kind or nature which shall collect and direct the flow of
natural surface waters or drainage, or increase in intensity or quantity the
flow of surface waters or drainage from paved surfaces, structures, roads, or
improvements directly into any portion or component of the official drainage
system.
   C.   Fill, obstruct, dam, divert, or otherwise change or alter the natural
or artificial flow of waters or drainage or the intensity or quantity of flow,
through any portion or component of the official drainage system.
3.   Correction of Existing Conditions. Except as hereinafter provided, all
existing obstructions, dams, diversions, construction of any kind, deposits of
debris, fill, sand, stone, or other solid materials, or other alterations or
diversions of the natural flow of water or the intensity or quantity of flow
through, across, or to any portion or component of the official drainage
system, which:
   A.   Causes the inundation of real property and/or buildings on other
premises, or;
   B.   Constitutes an undue burden upon the official drainage system or
hampers the proper present or future course of development of the official
drainage system, or;
   C.   Presently constitutes or in the reasonably foreseeable future will
constitute a danger or hazard to the well-being, safety, or general welfare of
the residents of the City or any property located therein;
are hereby declared and recognized as a public nuisance and as such shall be
removed or corrected by the owners of the premises upon which said obstruction,
dams, diversion, construction, deposits, or other alterations of the natural
flow of water are situated, within 60 days after written notice to remove or
correct same.
4.   Permitted Acts. The prohibited acts and correction of existing conditions
set forth herein shall have no application to work performed pursuant to the
authority of an agency of the federal, State, or other governmental body.
5.   Water Quality. Every person owning property through which a portion of the
official drainage system is located, or such person’s lessee, shall keep and
maintain that part of the official drainage system within the property below
the elevation of the 100-year flood free of trash, debris, grass clippings, or
other organic wastes and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or
significantly alter the quality of water flowing through the official drainage
system. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately
owned structures within or adjacent to any portion or component of the official
drainage system, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use,
function, or physical integrity of the official drainage system.
162.07   OBTAINING AND MAINTAINING CONSTRUCTION SITE EROSION AND SEDIMENT
CONTROL (COSESCO) PERMIT REQUIRED.
1.   Applicability. The following persons are required to obtain and maintain a
City COSESCO Permit:
   A.   All persons are required by law or administrative rule to obtain a
State NPDES General Permit #2 from the IDNR.
   B.   Unless otherwise waived by specific action of the Council, all persons
conducting any “land disturbance activity” for any purpose (other than those
specifically excluded herein) greater than 900 square feet in size on any
parcel of land. Any person required to obtain a City COSESCO permit under this
section shall be required to provide the following as a part of the permit
application:
      (1)   A dimensioned site plan drawing showing the entire site where the
project is to be located, the proposed project itself, the extent and boundary
of the proposed “land disturbing activity,” the location(s), type(s) and amount
(s) of erosion and sedimentation control measures, and any other information
that may be required by the City to determine the necessity and adequacy of the
erosion and sedimentation control measures proposed to be used.
      (2)   A $5,000.00 performance security (see forms permitted in Section
162.07(7) herein), guaranteeing that the proposed erosion control measures as
proposed and approved within the COSESCO permit will be timely constructed and
maintained throughout the length of the project.
      (3)   A certificate of insurance indicating a minimum public liability
limit of not less than $1,000,000.00 and a notation on the certificate that the
City is recognized as a named, additional insured under the policy.
      (4)   An executed standard City “Hold-Harmless, Waiver of Liability, and
Indemnification Agreement”.
      (5)   Fees for this COSESCO permit shall be paid as required and
established by resolution of the Council.
   C.   All persons creating other surface disturbances (not identified
hereinabove), where it can be reasonably forecasted and predicted that sediment
will; 1) leave (or has already left) a site; 2) enter a municipal storm sewer
system; or, 3) create a public nuisance, thereby constituting an illicit
discharge as defined herein and thus making the City subject to enforcement
actions from the IDNR and USEPA. (Agricultural activities, (including “home
gardening”) are not considered “construction site, land-disturbing activities,”
as defined, and are therefore exempt from the requirements of this section.
However, these activities could produce illicit discharges as defined, and as
such could be subject to the “illicit discharge” provisions as contained
herein.)
2.   Applications for City COSESCO Permits shall be made on forms provided by
the City.
3.   A permittee for a City COSESCO Permit shall pay fees as follows:
   A.   A non-refundable application and permit review fee (as established by
resolution of the Council based upon the estimated amount of land to be
disturbed) at the time of application submittal.
   B.   For each inspection required by any provision of this chapter, the
permittee shall pay an inspection fee (as established by resolution of the
Council) within 30 days of the billing and notice of payment for such fee.
Failure of the permittee to pay any inspection fee within said time frame shall
constitute a violation of this chapter and said charges not timely paid shall
constitute a lien against the property and may be assessed against the property
inspected and collected in the same manner as other assessments due and owing
the City.
4.   A permittee in possession of a State NPDES General Permit #2 issued by the
IDNR shall immediately submit to the City full and complete copies of the
materials described below as a basis for the City to determine whether to issue
a City COSESCO Permit:
   A.   Permittee’s plans, specifications and supporting materials previously
submitted to the IDNR in support of permittee’s application for the State NPDES
General Permit #2;
   B.   Permittee’s authorizations issued pursuant to permittee’s State NPDES
General Permit #2; and,
   C.   A Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) prepared in accordance
with this chapter.
5.   Every SWPPP submitted to the City in support of an application for a City
COSESCO Permit:
   A.   Shall comply with all current minimum mandatory requirements for SWPPPs
promulgated by the IDNR in connection with the issuance of a State NPDES
General Permit #2; and,
   B.   Shall, if the permittee is required by law to file a Joint Application
Form, Protecting Iowa Waters, Iowa Department of Natural Resources, and U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, comply with all mandatory minimum requirements
pertaining to such applications; and,
   C.   Shall comply with all other applicable State or federal permit
requirements in existence at the time of application; and,
   D.   Shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer or landscape
architect licensed to practice in the State of Iowa; and,
   E.   Shall include within the SWPPP a signed and dated certification by the
person preparing the SWPPP that the SWPPP complies with all requirements of
this chapter.
6.   In addition to the SWPPP requirements stated in Subsection 5 immediately
above which constitute minimum mandatory requirements imposed by the program,
every SWPPP submitted to the City in support of an application for a City
COSESCO Permit shall comply with the Statewide Urban Design and Specifications
(SUDAS) standard design criteria, current edition including, but not limited
to, design, location, and phased implementation of effective, practicable
stormwater pollution prevention measures designed for 25-year storm frequencies
at a minimum, and shall also:
   A.   Limit total off-site annual aggregate sediment yield for exposed areas
to an equivalent amount resulting from sheet and rill erosion equal to an
annual, cumulative soil loss rate not to exceed the standard established from
time to time by the County Soil and Water Conservation District; erosion rates
can exceed soil loss limits as long as sediment yield does not exceed that
expected from allowable erosion rates; and,
   B.   Identify the nature of the construction activity and the potential for
sediment and other pollutant discharges from the site; and
   C.   Calculate the predicted erosion and estimated sediment yield for the
construction site using the USDA Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE
II); and,
   D.   Assure that stockpiles of soil or other materials subject to erosion by
wind or water are covered, vegetated, or otherwise effectively protected from
erosion and sedimentation in accordance with the amount of time the material
will be on site and the manner of its proposed use; no stockpiling is allowed
in the street; and,
   E.   Identify measures and procedures to reasonably minimize site soil
compaction and provide soil quality restoration as specified; and,
   F.   Assure that all temporary erosion and sediment controls shall not be
removed until the City has determined that the site has been permanently
stabilized; and,
   G.   Assure that all disturbed sites be permanently stabilized with 70
percent perennial cover as measured by the USDA line transect method; and,
   H.   Identify methods to prevent sediment damage to adjacent properties and
sensitive environmental areas such as water bodies, plant communities, rare,
threatened, and/or endangered species habitat, wildlife corridors, greenways,
etc.; and,
   I.   Provide for design and construction methods to stabilize steep or long
continuous slopes; and include measures to control the quantity and quality of
stormwater leaving a site before, during, and after construction; and,
   J.   Provide for stabilization of all waterways and outlets; and,
   K.   Protect storm sewer infrastructure from sediment loading/plugging; and,
   L.   Specify precautions to be taken to contain sediment when working in or
crossing water bodies; and,
   M.   Assure stabilization of disturbed areas, including utility construction
areas, as soon as possible; and,
   N.   Protect outlying roads from sediment and mud from construction site
activities, including tracking; and,
   O.   Provide for disposal of collected sediment and floating debris; and,
   P.   Assure that when working near sensitive waters, the specific practices
itemized immediately below are utilized:
      (1)   During construction:
         a.   All exposed soil areas with a slope of 3:1 or steeper, that have
a continuous positive slope to a sensitive water, should have temporary erosion
protection or permanent cover within three days after the area is no longer
actively being worked; all other slopes that have a continuous positive slope
to a sensitive water should have temporary erosion protection or permanent
cover within seven days after the area is no longer actively being worked, and
         b.   Temporary sediment basin requirements should be used for common
drainage locations that serve an area with five or more acres disturbed at one
time; and
      (2)   Buffer Zone. Provide for the maintenance at all times of an
undisturbed buffer zone consisting of not less than 100 linear feet from the
special water (not including tributaries); exceptions from this for areas, such
as water crossings or limited water access, are allowed if the permittee fully
documents in the SWPPP the circumstances and reasons that the buffer
encroachment is necessary; all potential water quality, scenic, and other
environmental impacts of these exceptions should be minimized and documented in
the SWPPP for the project; and
      (3)   Enhanced Temperature Controls. Design the permanent stormwater
management system such that the discharge from the project will minimize any
increase in the temperature.
         a.   minimize new impervious surfaces; and/or,
         b.   other methods that will minimize any increase in the temperature
of the sensitive waters.
7.   Along with the application for a City COSESCO Permit, the permittee shall
post: 1) security for compliance with all requirements imposed by the State
NPDES General Permit #2 and the City COSESCO Permit, as well as necessary
remedial work resulting from violation of any provision of this chapter in an
amount not less than $10,000.00 per gross acre or any fractional portion
thereof or $5,000.00 for each one and two family residential property
improvement as defined in Subsection 162.07(1), whichever is greater. (The
amount required shall be calculated based upon the maximum acreage of soil that
will be simultaneously disturbed and exposed during the project’s
construction.) Said performance security shall remain valid, binding, and in
effect until such time as the permit is formally released and terminated by the
City; and 2) a draft maintenance agreement detailing any and all plans and
guarantees for the future, permanent, and long-term maintenance and repair of
all stormwater controls.
   A.   Acceptable forms of performance security include the following:
      (1)   Performance Bonds.
      (2)   Surety Bonds.
      (3)   Money orders or cashiers’ check.
      (4)   Irrevocable Letter of Credit.
   B.   The application for a City COSESCO Permit shall include the City’s
standard “Hold-Harmless and Waiver of Liability Form” which provides that the
permittee shall defend, indemnify, and hold the City harmless from any and all
claims, damages, or suits arising, directly or indirectly out of any act of
commission or omission by the permittee, or any employee, agent, assign or
contractor or subcontractor of the permittee, in connection with any and all
activities conducted pursuant to the permittee’s State NPDES General Permit #2
and/or City COSESCO Permit.
8.   Whenever any activity covered by the requirements of this chapter also
requires the issuance of any other City permit, site plan approval, or other
such authorization(s), no such other approval(s) or authorization(s) shall be
granted prior to the issuance of the COSESCO Permit.
9.   For so long as a construction site is subject to a State NPDES General
Permit #2 and/or a City COSESCO Permit, the permittee shall provide the City
with current information as follows:
   A.   The name, address, and telephone number of the person on-site
designated by the permittee who is knowledgeable and experienced in erosion and
sediment control and who will oversee compliance with the State NPDES General
Permit #2 and/or the City COSESCO Permit;
   B.   The name(s), address(es) and telephone number(s) of the contractor(s)
and/or subcontractors(s) that will implement each erosion and sediment control
measure identified in the SWPPP.
   C.   The name, address, telephone number, and other contact information of
the property owner and/or responsible party.
   D.   Permittee’s failure to provide current information shall constitute a
violation of this chapter.
10.   Original permittees cannot transfer any State NPDES General Permit #2
and/or City COSESCO Permit responsibilities to subsequent parties, (i.e.,
homebuilders, new lot owners, contractors and/or subcontractors, etc.). The
original permittee remains responsible for compliance on any property that has
been sold until such time as the permit(s) are terminated by the City and/or
IDNR. The permittee shall notify in writing and shall provide to the City a
copy of any application to the IDNR for release of any property from a General
Permit #2 pursuant to 567 IAC 64.6(b) or any similar successor provision.
11.   Upon receipt of an application for a City COSESCO Permit, the City shall
either find that the application complies with this chapter and issue a City
COSESCO Permit in accordance with this chapter, or that the application fails
to comply with this chapter, in which case the City shall provide a
comprehensive list identifying non-compliant elements of the application.
12.   Application (on forms provided by the City) for termination of a City
COSESCO Permit may be made no sooner than 30 days after “final stabilization”
is achieved, (as defined by the IDNR in its General Permit #2 to mean, “that
all soil disturbing activities at the site have been completed and that a
uniform perennial vegetative cover with a density of not less than 70 percent
for the area has been established or equivalent stabilization measures have
been employed”).
162.08   INSPECTION PROCEDURES FOR CITY COSESCO PERMITS.
1.   All inspections required under this chapter shall be conducted by the City
or its designee, hereinafter collectively referred to as the “City.”
2.   Permittee shall notify the City when all measures required by permittee’s
SWPPP have been accomplished on-site, whereupon the City shall conduct an
inspection for the purpose of determining compliance with this chapter, and
shall within a reasonable time thereafter report to the permittee either that
compliance appears to have been achieved, or that compliance has not been
achieved, in which case the City shall provide a comprehensive list identifying
the conditions of non-compliance. The permittee shall immediately commence
corrective action and shall complete such corrective action within 24 hours of
receiving the City’s comprehensive list. For good cause shown, the City may
extend the deadline for taking corrective action. Failure to take corrective
action in a timely manner shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
3.   Construction shall not occur on the site at any time when the City has
identified conditions of non-compliance. Construction activities undertaken by
a permittee prior to resolution of all discrepancies specified in the City’s
comprehensive list shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
4.   The City shall not be responsible for the direct or indirect consequences
to the permittee or to third parties for non-compliant conditions undetected by
inspection.
162.09   MONITORING PROCEDURES FOR CITY COSESCO PERMITS.
1.   Upon issuance of a City COSESCO Permit, the permittee has an absolute duty
to notify the City, in writing, of the commencement of land disturbing
activities and to monitor site conditions and to report to the City any change
of circumstances or site conditions which the permittee knows, or should know,
pose a risk of stormwater discharge in a manner inconsistent with permittee’s
SWPPP, State NPDES General Permit #2, and/or City COSESCO Permit.
   A.   Such written report shall be made by the permittee to the City
immediately but in any event within 24 hours of the change of circumstances or
site conditions.
   B.   Failure to make a timely report shall constitute a violation of this
chapter.
2.   Any third party may also report to the City site conditions which the
third party reasonably believes poses a risk of stormwater discharge in a
manner inconsistent with permittee’s SWPPP, State NPDES General Permit #2, and/
or City COSESCO Permit.
3.   Upon receiving a written report pursuant to the previous subsections, the
City shall conduct an inspection of the site as soon as reasonably possible and
thereafter shall provide the permittee with a comprehensive list identifying
the conditions of non-compliance. The permittee shall immediately commence
corrective action and shall complete such corrective action within 24 hours of
receiving the City’s comprehensive list. For good cause shown, the City may
extend the deadline for completing corrective action. Failure to take
corrective action in a timely manner shall constitute a violation of this
chapter, whereupon the City shall immediately commence enforcement actions
specified in Section
162.10 below.
4.   In addition to those inspection(s) made as a result of a report being
filed with the City pursuant to the previous subsections, the City shall
conduct at least one unannounced inspection during the course of construction
to monitor compliance with the State NPDES General Permit #2 and/or the City
COSESCO Permit. If the inspection discloses any significant non-compliance, the
City shall provide the permittee with a comprehensive list identifying the
conditions of non-compliance. The permittee shall immediately commence
corrective action and shall complete such corrective action within 24 hours of
receiving the City’s comprehensive list. For good cause shown, the City may
extend the deadline for completing corrective action. Failure to take
corrective action in a timely manner shall constitute a violation of this
chapter, whereupon the City shall immediately commence enforcement actions
specified in Section
162.10 below.
5.   The City shall not be responsible for the direct or indirect consequences
to the permittee or to third-parties for non-compliant conditions undetected by
inspection.
162.10   POST-CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER CONTROL.
1.   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to adopt by reference the minimum
stormwater management guidelines and controls established by SUDAS
(specifically Section 9040, as amended) in order to protect and safeguard the
general health, safety, and welfare of the public within this jurisdiction.
This section seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
   A.   Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from development within the
City limits and fringe area in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases
in stream temperature, and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of
stream channels;
   B.   Minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater
runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality;
   C.   Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows
from any specific development project site after completion to not exceed the
pre-development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable; and,
   D.   Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, and nonpoint
source pollution, wherever possible, through the establishment of appropriate
minimum stormwater management guidelines and controls and to ensure that
controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety.
2.   Applicability. The provisions and requirements of this section shall be
applicable to all subdivision or site plan applications and other circumstances
as specified in Subsection 162.07(1) unless eligible for an exemption or
granted a waiver by the City under Section
162.11 of this chapter. The provisions of this section also apply to all other
land disturbance activities that are not covered under the above-referenced
Subsection 162.07(1) if such activities are part of a larger common plan of
development that meets the minimum applicability criteria of said section even
though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take
place at different times on different schedules. In addition, all plans must be
reviewed by the City to ensure that established water quality standards will be
maintained during and after development of the site and that post construction
runoff levels are consistent with any local and regional watershed plans.
   A.   As noted herein the City hereby adopts by reference the minimum
guidelines and controls as established in the SUDAS Manual that must be met for
development to be approved. These guidelines and controls apply to any
development disturbing more than one acre of land.
   B.   The following activities are exempt from the provisions of this
section:
      (1)   Any logging and agricultural activity which is consistent with an

environmental characteristics of the project site, the potential impacts of all
proposed development of the site, both present and future, on the water
resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of the stormwater controls
proposed for managing stormwater generated at the project site. The intent of
this conceptual planning process is to determine the type of stormwater
controls necessary for the proposed project, and to ensure adequate planning
for management of stormwater runoff from future development. To accomplish this
goal the following information shall also be included in the stormwater
management concept plan:
      (1)   A map (or maps) indicating the location of existing and proposed
buildings, roads, parking areas, utilities, structural stormwater management,
and sediment and erosion controls. The map(s) will also clearly show proposed
land use with tabulation of the percentage of surface area to be adapted to
various uses; drainage patterns; locations of utilities, roads, and easements;
the limits of clearing and grading. A written description of the site plan and

topography, wetlands, and other native vegetative areas on the site. Particular
attention should be paid to environmentally sensitive controls that provide
particular opportunities or constraints for development.
      (4)   A written description of the required maintenance burden for any
proposed controls.
      (5)   The City may also require a concept plan to consider the maximum
development potential of a site under the existing zoning classification,
regardless of whether the applicant presently intends to develop the site to
its maximum potential.
      (6)   For development occurring on a previously developed site, an
applicant shall be required to include, within the stormwater management
concept plan, controls for controlling existing stormwater runoff discharges
from the site in accordance with this chapter to the maximum extent
practicable.
   C.   The stormwater management concept plan shall be referred for comment to
all other interested agencies, and any comments must be addressed in a
stormwater management final plan.
   D.   No building, grading, sediment control, or COSESCO Permit shall be
issued until a satisfactory stormwater management final plan, or a waiver
thereof, shall have undergone a review and been approved by the City after
determining that the plan or waiver is consistent with the requirements of this
chapter.
   E.   Stormwater Management Final Plan Requirements. After review of the
stormwater management concept plan, and modifications to that plan as deemed
necessary by the City, a stormwater management final plan must be submitted to
the City for approval.
      (1)   The stormwater management final plan, in addition to the
information included in the stormwater management concept plan, shall:
         a.   Be prepared by a licensed professional engineer (PE) or landscape
architect; and

environmental permits for the site, or that no other such permits are required,
prior to submission of the stormwater management final plan to the City.
   F.   Installation Performance Security or Bond. The City shall require the
submittal of an installation performance security or bond prior to the issuance
of a permit in order to ensure that the stormwater controls are installed by
the permit holder as required by the approved stormwater management final plan.
      (1)   The amount of the installation performance security or bond shall
be the total estimated construction cost of the stormwater controls approved
under the permit, plus 25 percent. The installation performance security or
bond shall contain forfeiture provisions for failure to complete work specified
in the stormwater management final plan.
      (2)   The installation performance security or bond shall be released in
full only upon submission of “as built plans” of all stormwater controls
specified in the storm water management final plan and written certification by
a professional engineer that the stormwater controls have been installed in
accordance with the approved stormwater management final plan and other
applicable provisions of this ordinance. The City will make a final inspection
of stormwater controls to ensure compliance with the approved stormwater
management final plan and the provisions of this chapter. Provisions for a
partial pro-rata release of the installation performance security or bond based
on the completion of various development stages may be made at the discretion
of City.
   G.   Maintenance Performance Security or Bond. The City shall also require
the submittal of a maintenance performance security or bond prior to the
issuance of a permit in order to ensure that the stormwater controls are
maintained in an effective state for a minimum of two years after the City’s
acceptance of said controls.
      (1)   This maintenance performance security or bond may be released by
the City upon a showing satisfactory to the City that:
         a.   The permit holder has assigned to another bona-fide financially
responsible legal entity, such as a homeowners’ or similar organization
organized under State law, responsibility for maintenance of the stormwater
controls in an effective state for the balance of the initial two-year period
after assignment; and
         b.   Said assignee-legal-entity has fully accepted such responsibility
in a written document that qualifies for recording and has been recorded in the
County Recorder’s office under State law; and
         c.   Said assignee-legal-entity posts a substitute maintenance
performance security or bond subject to release at the end of the initial two-
year period upon a further showing by the assignee-legal-entity that the
stormwater controls are, in the City’s sole judgment, still reasonably
effective.
   H.   Notice of Construction Commencement. The applicant must notify the City
in advance, in writing, before the commencement of construction on any
stormwater plan covered by this chapter. Regular inspections of construction of
the stormwater controls shall be conducted by the City.
      (1)   All inspections shall be documented, and written reports prepared
that contain the following information:
         a.   The date and location of the inspection; and
         b.   Whether construction is in compliance with the approved
stormwater management concept plan; and
         c.   Variations, if any, from the approved stormwater management
concept plan.
      (2)   If any violations are found, the applicant shall be notified in
writing of the nature of the violation and the required corrective actions. No
added work shall proceed until any violations are corrected and all work
previously completed has received approval by the City.
      (3)    After construction is completed, applicants are required to submit
actual “as-built” drawings satisfactory to the City for any stormwater controls
located on-site. The drawings must show the final design specifications for all
stormwater controls and must be certified by a professional engineer or
landscape architect. A final inspection by the City is required before the
release of any performance securities can occur.
   I.   Landscaping and Stabilization Requirements. Landscaping and
stabilization shall be accomplished to prevent a violation of this chapter or
impairment of controls.
      (1)   In addition to the above requirements, a landscaping plan must be
submitted with the final as-built drawings describing the vegetative
stabilization and management techniques to be used at a site after construction
is completed. This plan will explain not only how the site will be stabilized
after construction, but who will be responsible for the maintenance of
vegetation at the site and what practices will be employed to ensure that
adequate vegetative cover is preserved. This plan must be prepared by a
registered landscape architect and must be approved prior to receiving a
permit.
   J.   Maintenance and Repair of Stormwater Controls. The applicant or owner
of every site, or an assignee qualified pursuant to Paragraph G above, shall be
responsible for maintaining as-built stormwater controls in an effective state
as determined in the sole judgment of the City for not less than 25 years from
and after completion of construction.
   K.   Maintenance and Repair Easement. Prior to the issuance of any permit
for development involving any stormwater control, the applicant or owner of the
site must execute a maintenance and repair easement agreement that shall be
binding on all subsequent owners of land served by the stormwater control. The
agreement shall provide for access to the control and the land it serves at
reasonable times for periodic inspection by the City, or the City’s designee,
and for regular or special assessments of property owners to ensure that the
control is maintained in proper working condition to meet the guidelines
established in the SUDAS Manual. The easement agreement shall be recorded by
the City at the expense of the permit holder or property owners.
   L.   Maintenance Covenants. Maintenance of all stormwater controls shall be
ensured through the creation of a formal maintenance covenant that must be
approved by the City and recorded prior to the stormwater management final plan
approval. As part of the covenant, a schedule shall be developed for when and
how often maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the stormwater
controls. The covenant shall also include plans for periodic inspections to
ensure proper performance of the controls between scheduled cleanouts.
      (1)   The City, in lieu of a maintenance covenant, may, but is not
required to accept dedication of any existing or future stormwater control to
include the City responsibility for maintenance and repair, provided that the
maintenance and repair of such element will not impose an undue burden on other
City taxpayers who enjoy little if any benefit from the control, the control
meets all the requirements of this chapter, and the dedication includes
adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or otherwise,
for inspection and regular maintenance.
      (2)   Requirements for Maintenance Covenants. All stormwater controls
must undergo, at the minimum, an annual inspection to document maintenance and
repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of this chapter and
accomplishment of its purposes. These needs may include, but are not limited
to, removal of silt, litter, and other debris from all catch basins, inlets,
and drainage pipes, grass cutting, and vegetation removal, and necessary
replacement of landscape vegetation. Any maintenance or repair needs detected
must be corrected by the developer or entity responsible under a written
maintenance agreement under Section
162.06 in a timely manner, as determined by City, and the inspection and
maintenance requirement may be increased as deemed necessary to ensure proper
functioning of the stormwater controls.
   M.   Inspection of Stormwater Controls. Inspection programs may be
established on any reasonable basis including but not limited to: event
initiated (all rainfalls of greater than one-half inch), routine inspections;
random inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other notice of
possible violations; inspection of drainage basins or areas identified as
higher than typical sources of sediment or other contaminants or pollutants;
inspections of businesses or industries of a type associated with higher than
usual discharges of contaminants or pollutants, or with discharges of a type
which are more likely than the typical discharge, to cause violations of State
or federal water or sediment quality standards or the NPDES Stormwater Permit;
and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under environmental or
safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to: reviewing
maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water,
groundwater, and material or water in stormwater controls, and evaluating the
condition of stormwater controls.
   N.   Right-of-Entry for Inspection. When any new stormwater control is
installed on private property, or when any new connection is made between
private property and a public stormwater management facility, sanitary sewer or
combined sewer, the property owner shall grant to the City the right to enter
the property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of
inspection. This includes the right to enter a property when the City has a
reasonable basis to believe that a violation of this Code is occurring or has
occurred, and to enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or
correction of any violation of this code.
   O.   Records of Installation and Maintenance and Repair Activities. Parties
responsible for the operation and maintenance of stormwater controls shall make
records of the installation and of all maintenance and repairs and shall retain
the records for at least 25 years. These records shall be made available to the
City during inspection of the facility and at other reasonable times upon
request.
   P.   Failure to Maintain Stormwater Controls. If a responsible party fails
or refuses to meet the requirements of the maintenance covenant or any
provision of this chapter, the City, after providing written notice and
allowing for a maximum 30-day correction time frame from the date of the
notice, may correct a violation by performing all necessary work to place the
control in proper working condition. In the event that the stormwater control
is deemed to be an immediate threat or danger to public safety or public
health, the City may take immediate actions to place the control in proper
working condition. Any and all costs incurred by the City in the enforcement of
this section shall be recovered from the responsible party. The City shall
submit an invoice to the responsible party reflecting the costs incurred by the
City for any and all enforcement activities undertaken under this code. Failure
to pay charges properly invoiced under this Code within 30 days of billing
shall constitute a violation of this Code and said charges not timely paid
shall constitute a lien against the property and may be assessed against the
property and collected in the same manner as other assessments due and owing
the City.
162.11   WAIVERS.
Every applicant shall provide for stormwater management as required by this
chapter, unless a written request is filed with the City to waive the
implementation of controls, in whole or in part, and such waiver is granted by
the City.
1.   A partial waiver of controls as required by this chapter may be granted
provided that at least one of the following conditions is established by the
applicant based on the presentation of authoritative written evidence
satisfactory to the City:
   A.   The proposed development is not likely to impair attainment of the
objectives of this chapter.
   B.   Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of stormwater
have been established in a stormwater management final plan that has been
approved by the City and fully implemented.
   C.   Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility. The
off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and adequately
sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater than
that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there is, in the City’s
sole judgment, a responsible entity legally obligated to monitor the
performance of and maintain the efficiency of stormwater controls in accordance
with a written and recorded maintenance agreement.
2.   In instances where one of the above conditions is established, the
applicant must further establish by authoritative written evidence satisfactory
to the City that the partial waiver will not result in any of the following
impacts to downstream waterways:
   A.   Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other
structures; or
   B.   Degradation of biological functions or habitat; or
   C.   Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion or siltation; or
   D.   Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, or property.
3.   If the City finds that a general waiver is appropriate because
implementation of no on-site stormwater controls is feasible due to the natural
or existing physical characteristics of a site, or that one of the conditions
specified in Subsection 1 above cannot be established to a certainty, or that
any one or more of the impacts to downstream waterways specified in Subsection
2 above cannot be entirely averted, the applicant shall execute a binding
written agreement to accomplish one or more of the following mitigation
measures selected by City:
   A.   The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant of an
easement to be dedicated for preservation and or reconstruction of native
ecosystems of lands strategically located in the watershed consistent with the
purposes of this chapter, of a sufficient quantity to enable the City or others
to achieve the guidelines with respect to a number of cubic feet of annual
stormwater equivalent to the estimated number of cubic feet of annual
stormwater that will not achieve the guidelines as a consequence of the waiver.
   B.   The creation of one or more stormwater controls on previously developed
properties, public or private, that currently lack stormwater controls, having
a capacity to achieve the guidelines with respect to a number of cubic feet of
annual stormwater equivalent to the estimated number of cubic feet of annual
stormwater that will not achieve the guidelines as a consequence of the waiver.
   C.   Monetary contributions (Fee-in-Lieu) to fund stormwater management
activities such as research and studies (e.g., regional wetland delineation
studies, stream monitoring studies for water quality and macro invertebrates,
stream flow monitoring, threatened and endangered species studies, hydrologic
studies, monitoring of stormwater controls, and stream corridor stabilization
practices). The monetary contribution required shall be in accordance with a
fee schedule (unless the developer and the City agree on a greater alternate
contribution) established by the City based on the estimated cost savings to
the developer resulting from the waiver and the estimated future costs to the
City to achieve the guidelines with respect to a number of cubic feet of annual
stormwater equivalent to the estimated number of cubic feet of annual
stormwater that will not achieve the guidelines as a consequence of the waiver.
All of the monetary contributions shall be credited to an appropriate capital
improvements program project, and shall be made by the developer prior to the
issuance of any building permit for the development.
   D.   Dedication of land or granting of an easement by the applicant of a
value equivalent to the cost to the City of the construction of an off-site
stormwater management facility sufficient to achieve the guidelines with
respect to a number of cubic feet of annual stormwater equivalent to the
estimated number of cubic feet of annual stormwater that will not achieve the
guidelines as a consequence of the waiver. The agreement shall be entered into
by the applicant and the City prior to the recording of plats or, if no
recorded plat is required, prior to the issuance of any permit.
162.12   FEES, ENFORCEMENT, AND PENALTIES.
1.   Abatement Fees and Costs. The Council shall review and establish, by
resolution, the fees and other costs associated with the City’s abatement of
any violation of any provision of this chapter as referenced herein.
2.   Violation of any provision of this chapter may be enforced by civil action
including an action for injunctive relief, by imposition of a civil penalty
pursuant to Section
1.14 of this Code, through the abatement of the violation by the City, through
the issuance of a “Stop Work Order,” and/or a lawsuit filed in District Court
for the County.
3.   Violation of any provision of this chapter may also be enforced as a
municipal infraction within the meaning of Section 364.22 of the Code of Iowa,
pursuant to the City’s municipal infraction ordinance,
Chapter 3, as amended.
4.   Restoration of Lands. Any violator may be required to restore affected
land to its prior, undisturbed condition. In the event that restoration is not
undertaken within 30 days after written notice, the City may take the necessary
corrective action(s). The City shall submit an invoice to the responsible party
reflecting the costs incurred by the City for any and all corrective action(s)
undertaken under this Code. Failure to pay charges properly invoiced under this
code within 30 days of billing shall constitute a violation of this Code and
said charges not timely paid shall constitute a lien against the property and
may be assessed against the property from which an illicit discharge emanates
and collected in the same manner as other assessments due and owing the City.
5.   Holds on Occupancy Permits. Occupancy permits shall not be granted, and
performance security shall not be released until all stormwater controls have
been inspected and approved by City.
162.13   APPEALS AND REQUESTS FOR HEARINGS.
1.   Administrative decisions and enforcement actions rendered and conducted by
City staff or contractors authorized to administer and enforce the provisions
of this chapter may be appealed by the permittee, developer, and/or responsible
party to the Council pursuant to the following rules of procedure:
   A.   The appeal and request for hearing must be filed in writing with the
City within five business days of the date of the decision or enforcement
action.
   B.   The written appeal and request for hearing shall specify in detail the
action appealed from, the errors allegedly made by the City giving rise to the
appeal, a written summary of all oral and written testimony the permittee
intends to introduce at the hearing, including the names and addresses of all
witnesses the permittee intends to call, copies of all documents the permittee
intends to introduce at the hearing, and the specific relief requested.

action, a written summary of all oral and written testimony the City intends to
introduce at the hearing, including the names and addresses of all witnesses
the City intends to call, and copies of all documents the City intends to
introduce at the hearing.
   D.   The City shall notify the permittee by ordinary mail, and shall give
public notice in accordance with Chapter 21 of the Code of Iowa, of the date,
time, and place for the regular or special meeting of the Council at which the
hearing on the appeal shall occur. The hearing shall be scheduled for a date
not less than four nor more than 20 days after the filing of the appeal. The
rules of evidence and procedure, and the standard of proof to be applied, shall
be the same as provided by Chapter 17A of the Code of Iowa. The permittee may
be represented by counsel at the permittee’s expense. The City may be
represented by the City Attorney or by an attorney designated by the Council at

165.02   STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSE.
1.   The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 414, Code of Iowa, as
amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure
safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
2.   Findings of Fact.
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation
which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community.
   B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by:
      (1)   The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood
damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately
elevated or otherwise protected from flooding; and
      (2)   The cumulative effect of obstructions on the floodplain causing
increases in flood heights and velocities.
   C.   This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Paragraph 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
   A.   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows so
that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
   B.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
   C.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
   D.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
   E.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
165.03   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
1.   Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter shall apply

165.05   ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING (OVERLAY) DISTRICTS.
The floodplain areas within the jurisdiction of this chapter are hereby divided
into the following districts:
1.   Floodway (Overlay) District (FW) - those areas identified as Floodway on
the Official Floodplain Zoning Map.
2.   Floodway Fringe (Overlay) District (FF) - those areas identified as Zone
AE on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map but excluding those areas identified
as Floodway.
3.   General Floodplain (Overlay) District (GF) - those areas identified as
Zone A on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map.
The boundaries shall be as shown on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map. Within
these districts, all uses not allowed as permitted uses are prohibited unless a
variance to the terms of this chapter is granted after due consideration by the
Board of Adjustment.
165.06   FLOODWAY (OVERLAY) DISTRICT (FW).
1.   Permitted Uses. All development within the Floodway District shall be
permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance (or
underlying zoning district) and provided they meet applicable performance
standards of the Floodway District.
2.   Performance Standards. All Floodway District uses allowed as a permitted
use shall meet the following standards.
   A.   No development shall be permitted in the Floodway District that would
result in any increase in the base flood elevation. Consideration of the
effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption
that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly situated
lands.
   B.   All development within the Floodway District shall:
      (1)   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
      (2)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
      (3)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
   C.   No development shall affect the capacity or conveyance of the channel
or floodway of any tributary to the main stream, drainage ditch, or any other
drainage facility or system.
   D.   Structures, buildings, recreational vehicles, and sanitary and utility
systems, if permitted, shall meet the applicable performance standards of the
Floodway Fringe District, and shall be constructed or aligned to present the
minimum possible resistance to flood flows.
   E.   Structures, if permitted, shall have a low flood damage potential and
shall not be for human habitation.
   F.   Storage of materials or equipment that are buoyant, flammable,
explosive or injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited. Storage of
other material may be allowed if readily removable from the Floodway District
within the time available after flood warning.
   G.   Watercourse alterations or relocations (channel changes and
modifications) must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within
the altered or relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations
must be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
   H.   Any fill allowed in the floodway must be shown to have some beneficial
purpose and shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary.
   I.   Pipeline river or stream crossings shall be buried in the streambed and
banks or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due to channel
degradation and meandering or due to the action of flood flows.
165.07   FLOODWAY FRINGE (OVERLAY) DISTRICT (FF).
1.   Permitted Uses. All development within the Floodway Fringe District shall
be permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance
(or underlying zoning district) and provided they meet applicable performance
standards of the Floodway Fringe District.
2.   Performance Standards. All development must be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance standards.
Where base flood elevation data has not been provided on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to
compute such data. Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no development
may increase the base flood elevation more than one foot. The applicant will be
responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient
technical information to make such determination.
   A.   All development shall:
      (1)   Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement.
      (2)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
      (3)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
   B.   Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the base flood elevation. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed subject to favorable
consideration by the Board of Adjustment, where existing topography, street
grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods
used must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various
forces and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential structures
located in areas that would become isolated due to flooding of surrounding
ground shall be provided with a means of access that will be passable by
wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this criterion shall not apply
where the Floodplain Administrator determines there is sufficient flood warning
time for the protection of life and property. When estimating flood warning
time, consideration shall be given to the criteria listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa
Administrative Code.
   C.   Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level. When
floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State of
Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and
other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the
base flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Floodplain
Administrator.
   D.   All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
      (1)   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
         a.   A minimum of two openings, with positioning on at least two
walls, having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
         b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade.
         a.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, and
low damage potential storage. Where the distance between the floor and ceiling
of the fully enclosed area below the lowest floor is five feet or more, the
applicant shall be required to sign and record with the County Recorder a Non-
Conversion Agreement that ensures the lower enclosed area remains compliant
with the criteria outlined in this subsection.
      (2)   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
      (3)   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
electric meter, electrical service panel box, hot water heater, heating, air
conditioning, ventilation equipment (including ductwork), and other similar
machinery and equipment elevated (or, in the case of non-residential
structures, optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one foot above the base
flood elevation.
      (4)   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
plumbing, gas lines, water meters, gas meters, and other similar service
utilities either elevated (or in the case of non-residential structures,
optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation or designed to be watertight and withstand inundation to such a
level.
   E.   Factory-Built Homes.
      (1)   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the structure
is a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation.
      (2)   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame
ties to ground anchors. Anchorage systems may include, but are not limited to,
use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors as required by the State
Building Code.
   F.   Utility and Sanitary Systems.
      (1)   On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located or
designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
      (2)   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system as well
as the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment facilities
(other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood protection
equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood elevation.
      (3)   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water
supply treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with
a level of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood
elevation.
      (4)   Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
   G.   Storage of Equipment and Materials. Storage of equipment and materials
that are flammable, explosive, or injurious to human, animal, or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or:
      (1)   Not subject to major flood damage and anchored to prevent movement
due to flood waters; or
      (2)   Readily removable from the area within the time available after
flood warning.
   H.   Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as
levees, flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the base
flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for
adequate interior drainage. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources
shall approve structural flood control works.
   I.   Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must be
designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources must
approve such alterations or relocations.
   J.   Subdivision. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and
subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the base flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50 lots
(whichever is less) shall include base flood elevation data for those areas
located within the Floodplain (Overlay) District.
   K.   Accessory Structures to Residential Uses.
      (1)   Detached garages, sheds, and similar structures that are incidental
to a residential use are exempt from the base flood elevation requirements
where the following criteria are satisfied:
         a.   The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential. Its size shall not exceed 600 square feet in size. Those portions of
the structure located less than one foot above the base flood elevation must be
constructed of flood-resistant materials.
         b.   The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage potential
purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure shall not
be used for human habitation.
         c.   The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building
site so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
         d.   The structure shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement.
         e.   The structure’s service facilities such as electrical and heating
equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above the base
flood elevation.
         f.   The structure’s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of Paragraph D(1) of this subsection.
      (2)   Exemption from the base flood elevation requirements for such a
structure may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of
the structure and its contents.
   L.   Recreational Vehicles. Recreational vehicles are exempt from the
requirements of Paragraph E of this subsection regarding anchoring and
elevation of factory-built homes when the following criteria are satisfied.
      (1)   The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less than
180 consecutive days, and
      (2)   The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than 180
consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements of
Paragraph E of this subsection regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-
built homes.
   M.   Pipeline Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be buried
in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent
rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
   N.   Maximum Damage Potential Development. All new or substantially improved
maximum damage potential development shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated a minimum of one foot above the elevation of the 500-year
flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed
to such a level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer
registered in the State of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods
used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact
and uplift forces and other factors associated with the two-tenths percent
annual chance flood; and that the structure, below the two-tenths percent
chance flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Floodplain
Administrator. Where a two-tenths percent chance flood elevation data has not
been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The applicant will be
responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient
technical information to make such determinations.
165.08   GENERAL FLOODPLAIN (OVERLAY) DISTRICT (GF).
1.   Permitted Uses.
   A.   All development within the General Floodplain District shall be
permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance (or
underlying zoning district) and provided they meet the applicable performance
standards of the General Floodplain District.
   B.   Any development which involves placement of structures, factory-built
homes, fill or other obstructions, storage of materials or equipment,
excavation or alteration of a watercourse shall be reviewed by the Department
of Natural Resources to determine:
      (1)   Whether the land involved is either wholly or partly within the
floodway or floodway fringe; and
      (2)   The base flood elevation.
The applicant shall be responsible for providing the Department of Natural
Resources with sufficient technical information to make the determination.
   C.   Review by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources is not required for
the proposed construction of new or replacement bridges or culverts where:
      (1)   The bridge or culvert is located on a stream that drains less than
two square miles, and
      (2)   The bridge or culvert is not associated with a channel modification
that constitutes a channel change as specified in 567-71.2(2b) Iowa
Administrative Code.
2.   Performance Standards.
   A.   All development, or portions thereof, to be located in the floodway as
determined by the Department of Natural Resources shall meet the applicable
provisions and standards of the Floodway (Overlay) District (Section
165.06).
   B.   All development, or portions thereof, to be located in the floodway
fringe as determined by the Department of Natural Resources shall meet the
applicable provisions and standards of the Floodway Fringe (Overlay) District
(Section
165.07).
165.09   RESERVED.
165.10   APPOINTMENT AND DUTIES OF BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
1.   The Board of Adjustment, hereinafter referred to as the Board, shall hear
and decide:
   A.   Appeals; and
   B.   Requests for variances to the provisions of this chapter, and shall
take any other action which is required of the Board.
2.   Appeals. Where it is alleged that there is any error in any order,
requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in
the enforcement of this chapter, the aggrieved party may appeal such action.
The notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board and with the official from
whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason for the
appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to the Board
all the documents constituting the record upon which the action appealed from
was taken.
3.   Variance. The Board may authorize upon request in specific cases such
variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances
granted must meet the following applicable standards.
   A.   Variances shall only be granted upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
      (3)   A determination that the granting of the variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public
or conflict with existing local codes or ordinances.
   B.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
   C.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   D.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection
for structures than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the applicant
shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Floodplain Administrator
that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates
for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance
coverage; and
      (2)   Such construction increases risks to life and property.
   E.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
4.   Hearings and Decisions of the Board.
   A.   Hearings. Upon the filing with the Board of an appeal or a request for
a variance, the Board shall hold a public hearing. The Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the hearing and give public notice thereof, as well as due
notice to parties in interest. At the hearing, any party may appear in person
or by agent or attorney and present written or oral evidence. The Board may
require the appellant or applicant to provide such information as is reasonably
deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or evaluation of
a professional engineer or other expert person or agency, including the
Department of Natural Resources.
   B.   Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal or
variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an appeal, the Board may, so
long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter,
reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in
writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision.
In granting a variance, the Board shall consider such factors as contained in
this section and all other relevant sections of this chapter and may prescribe
such conditions as contained in Subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
      (1)   Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board Shall Be Based. In
passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all relevant
factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
         a.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
         b.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
         c.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability
of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
         d.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         e.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the City.
         f.   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
         g.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
         h.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development
and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
         i.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for the area.
         j.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         k.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.
         l.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer,
gas, electrical, and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
         m.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
chapter.
      (2)   Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances
as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such conditions
may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
         a.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
         b.   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
         c.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed
restrictions.
         d.   Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this chapter.
         e.   Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the
flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration,
rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated
with the regulatory flood. The Board shall require that the applicant submit a
plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
5.   Appeals to the Court. Any person or persons, jointly or severally,
aggrieved by any decision of the Board may present to a court of record a
petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole
or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be
presented to the court within thirty days after the filing of the decision in
the office of the Board.
165.11   NONCONFORMING USES.
1.   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before
the passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but which
is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be continued
subject to the following conditions:
   A.   If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any future use
of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
   B.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
   C.   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless
it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
State or local health, sanitary, building, or safety codes or regulations, or
the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
designation.
2.   Except as provided in Subsection 1(B) of this section, any use which has
been permitted as a variance shall be considered a conforming use.
165.12   PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with grants of variances) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any
person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its
requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $500.00 or
imprisoned for not more than 30 days. Each day such violation continues shall
be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained prevent the City
from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy
violation.
165.13   AMENDMENTS.

170.01   TITLE.
Chapter 170 will be known as and may be cited as the “Zoning Code” of the City.
170.02   PURPOSE.
The various use districts which are created and outlined in this chapter and
sections of this Code are adopted for the purpose among others of:
1.   Carrying out the Comprehensive Plan for the development of the City;
2.   Promoting the public health, safety, and general welfare;
3.   Helping to achieve greater efficiency and economy of land development by
promoting the grouping of those activities which have similar needs and are
compatible;
4.   To accommodate change while insuring the continuation of the City’s
historical character, identity, diversity, and authenticity;
5.   Encouraging such distribution of population, classification of land use,
and distribution of land development that will tend to facilitate adequate and
economic provision of transportation, communication, water supply, drainage,
sanitation, education, recreation, and other public requirements;
6.   Defining and limiting the powers and duties of the Building and Zoning
Enforcement Officer and bodies as provided herein;
7.   Classifying, regulating, and limiting the height, area, bulk, and use of
land, buildings, and premises hereafter to be erected.
170.03   GENERAL DESCRIPTION.
This Code classifies and regulates the use of land, buildings, and structures
within the corporate limits of the City as herein set forth. The regulations
contained here are necessary to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the
inhabitants by dividing the City into zoning districts and regulating therein
the use of the land and the use and size of buildings as to height and number
of stories, the coverage of the land by buildings, the size of yards and open
spaces, the location of buildings, and the density of population. Further, in
interpreting and applying the provisions of this Code, they will be held to be
the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, and
general welfare. The Planning and Zoning Commission has given consideration to
the future probable use of land in the territory affected by this Code, and has
prepared a Comprehensive Development Plan showing the future development of
this area which has served as a guide in the preparation of this Code.
170.04   PRIVATE EASEMENTS, COVENANTS, AGREEMENTS, AND PRIOR ORDINANCES.
It is not the intention of this Code to interfere with, evade, or annul any
easements, covenants, or other agreements between parties, except that, where
this Code imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings or land, or
upon the height of buildings, or requires larger open spaces or greater lot
area per family than are required or imposed by such easements, covenants, or
agreements between parties, the provisions of this Code will control. The
provisions of this Code will control and supersede the provisions of any
ordinances, rules, or regulations previously adopted relating to the use of
buildings and premises in all matters which are provided for in this Code,
whether specifically or by implication, except for prior ordinances which
specify a particular dimension for a front yard or which authorize the location
and construction of a public utility installation, which prior ordinances will
remain in full force and effect.
170.05   AUTHORITY.
This Code is adopted pursuant to the authority granted by Chapter 414 of the
Code of Iowa, as amended.
170.06   REQUIRED REVIEW.
This Code will be reviewed at least once every 10 years in its entirety by the
Planning and Zoning Commission and will be revised if necessary.

   on August 15, 1980.
170.08   NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES, AND USES.
1.   General. A conforming building, structure, or use that becomes
nonconforming as a result of any change in this Code, including any changes to
the applicable zoning ordinances, may be continued, maintained, and repaired,
except as otherwise provided for in this section. Nothing in this Zoning Code
will prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition any part of any
building or structure declared unsafe by the City.
2.   Alteration or Enlargement of Buildings and Structures. A nonconforming
building or structure will not be added to or enlarged in any manner unless
said building or structure, including additions and enlargements, are made to
conform to all of the regulations of the district in which it is located;
provided, however, that if a building or structure is conforming as to use, but
nonconforming as to yards or height or off-street parking space, said building
or structure may be enlarged or added to provided that the enlargement or
addition complies with the yard and height and off-street parking requirements
of the district in which said building or structure is located. No
nonconforming building or structure will be moved, in whole or in part, to
another location on the lot unless every portion of said building or structure
is made to conform to all of the regulations of the district in which it is
located.
3.   Destruction of Nonconforming Building or Structure. Any nonconforming
building or structure which has been or may be damaged by fire, flood,
explosions, earthquake, war, riot, or any other act of God, may be
reconstructed and used as before if it is reconstructed within one year of such
calamity, unless damaged more than 50 percent of its fair market value, as
determined by the Board of Adjustment, at the time of such damage, in which
case reconstruction may be implemented only in accordance with the provisions
of this Zoning Code.
4.   Building Vacancy. A building or structure or portion thereof, which is
nonconforming as to use, which is or hereafter becomes vacant and remains
unoccupied for a continuous period of six months or more will not thereafter be
occupied except by a use which conforms to the use regulations of the district
in which it is located. Further no such vacant building, structure, or portion
thereof, whether conforming or not as to use, shall be used for any purpose
other than that which it was originally intended for and shall only be used for
purposes allowed within the particular zoning district within which it is
located. (i.e., vacated single-family residential structures may not be used
for storage purposes, etc.)
5.   Change in Use. A nonconforming use of a conforming building or structure
will not be expanded or extended into any other portion of such conforming
building or structure or changed except to a conforming use. If discontinued or
changed to a conforming use, any future use of such building, structure, or
portion thereof will be in conformity with the regulations of the district in
which such building or structure is located. A vacant or partially vacant
nonconforming building or structure may be occupied by a use for which the
building or structure was designed or intended if occupied within a period of
six months or less after the effective date of this Zoning Code, or otherwise
it will be used in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it
is located. The use of a nonconforming building or structure may be changed to
a use of the same or a more restricted district classification; but where the
use of a nonconforming building or structure is changed to a use of a more
restricted district classification, it thereafter will not be changed to a use
of a less restricted district classification.
6.   Nonconforming Uses of Land. A nonconforming use of land, where the
aggregate value of all permanent buildings or structures is less than $500.00,
existing at the time of the adoption of this Zoning Code, may be continued for
a period of not more than five years therefrom, provided that:
   A.   Said nonconforming use may not be extended or expanded, nor will it
occupy more area than was in use on the effective date of this Zoning Code.
   B.   If said nonconforming use or any portion thereof is discontinued for a
period of six months or more, or changed, any future use of such land, or
change in use, will be in conformity with the provisions of the district in
which said land is located.
170.09   FEES.
Any application submitted for an amendment, variance, special exception,
appeal, or other form of petitioned public hearing governed by this Zoning Code
will be accompanied by a fee as determined by resolution of the Council.
170.10   PENALTIES.
Any person, firm or corporation, agent, employee, or contractor who violates,
disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to comply with or who resists enforcement
of any provision of this Zoning Code, commits a municipal infraction and as
such will be subject to the penalties and remedies specified in
Chapter 3. In the event that any building, structure, or use is erected,
constructed, reconstructed, altered repaired, converted, or maintained; or any
building, structure, or land is used in violation of this Zoning Code, the
Council, in addition to other remedies, may institute an action for injunctive
relief or any proper action or proceedings in the name of the City to prevent
such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair,
conversion, maintenance, or use; to restrain, correct, or abate such violation;
to prevent the occupancy of such building, structure, or land; or to prevent
any act, conduct, business, or use in or about such premises in violation of
this Zoning Code. Any building erected, raised, or converted, or land or
premises used in violation of any provisions of this Zoning Code or the
requirements thereof, is hereby declared to be a public nuisance, and as such,
in addition to the remedy provided above, may be abated in such manner as
nuisances are now or may hereafter be abated under this Code. Further, any
person, firm or corporation, agent, employee, or contractor of such who seeks
an after-the-fact remedy to an infraction of this code through the use of any
administrative process allowed herein shall be charged double the listed
application fees.

170.12   ZONING DISTRICT MAP.
The location and boundaries of the zoning districts established by this Code
are set forth on the map entitled “Zoning Districts” which is herein and hereby
made a part of this Code by reference. Said map, together with everything shown
thereon and all amendments thereto, will be as much a part of this Code and
have the same force and effect as though fully set forth and described herein,
the original of said map which is properly attested and is on file with the
Clerk. The Overlay Flood District (FD) and the Overlay Greenway District (GD)
may not necessarily be located upon the Official Zoning Map due to the
confusion created, but will be located as specified in Sections
170.27 and
170.29. Developments completed under the Overlay Planned Development (PDD)
zoning district will be designated by zone labels of the regular zoning
districts preceded by the letter “P,” (i.e., P/C-3). The letter “P” may be used
upon individual lots which are developed and controlled by the overlay zoning
within a larger area having a regular district classification which is the same
as the underlying zoning.

170.14   RULES OF INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
In determining the boundaries of districts, and establishing the regulations
applicable to each district, due and careful consideration has been given to
existing conditions, the character of buildings erected in each district, the
most desirable use for which the land in each district may be adapted, and the
conservation of property values throughout the City. Unless otherwise specified
or where uncertainty exists with respect to the precise location of any of the
aforesaid districts shown on the zoning map, the following rules will apply:
1.   Boundaries shown as following or approximately following streets,
highways, or alleys will be construed to follow the center lines of such
streets, highways, or alleys.
2.   Boundaries shown as following or approximately following platted lot lines
or other property lines will be construed to be said boundary lines.
3.   Boundaries shown as following or approximately following railroad lines
will be construed to lie midway between the main tracks of such railroad lines.
4.   Boundaries indicated as following shorelines will be construed to follow
such shore lines, and in the event of change in the shore line, will be
construed as moving with the actual shore line.
5.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of
streams or other bodies of water will be construed to follow such center lines
taken at a mean low water mark.
6.   All areas within the corporate limits of the City which are under water
and are not shown as included within any district will be subject to all of the
regulations of the district which immediately adjoins the water area. If the
water area adjoins two or more districts, the boundaries of each district will
be construed to extend into the water area in a straight line until they meet
another district or until they meet the City corporate limits, whichever occurs
first.
7.   Boundaries shown as following or closely following the City limits will be
construed as following such limits.
8.   Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated in
Subsections 1 through 7 above will be so construed. Distances not specifically
indicated on the Official Zoning Map will be determined by dimensions, by the
scale of the map.
9.   Where a zoning district boundary line divides a lot in single ownership on
the effective date of this Zoning Code or amendment, the regulations of this
Zoning Code for either portion of such lot may, at the owner's discretion,
apply to the entire area of the lot or 25 feet beyond the zoning district
boundary line, whichever is the lesser distance.
10.   Where the application of the aforesaid rules leaves a reasonable doubt as
to the boundaries between two districts, the regulations of the more
restrictive district will govern the entire parcel in question, unless
otherwise determined by the Board of Adjustment in accordance with the
provisions contained in Section
170.34(9)).
11.   Whenever any street, alley, or other public easement is vacated, the
district classification of the property to which the vacated portions of land
accrue will become the classification of the vacated land. (See City Attorney's
opinion letter dated June 17, 1991.)
12.   See Section
170.27 for interpreting Floodplain Map boundaries.
13.   See Section
170.29 for interpreting Greenway District Boundaries.
170.15   ANNEXED TERRITORY.
Any territory which may hereafter be annexed to the City will be classified
automatically as being in an “A-1” General Agricultural District until such
classification shall have been changed by amendment of this Zoning Code as
provided for hereinafter. Within 30 days following the completion of any
annexation, the Planning and Zoning Commission will proceed to make a
recommendation(s) to the Council as to the appropriate zoning classification
designation(s) for the annexed area(s).
170.16   GENERAL AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT (A-1).
1.   General Description. This district is intended to provide areas in which
agriculture and related uses are encouraged as the principal uses of the land.
The district encourages the agricultural use of lands which are best suited for
that purpose, while also allowing urban and rural uses which are compatible
with the agricultural uses and will not prematurely terminate the agricultural
uses. The district prohibits residential and urban densities that might cause
health problems until they can be serviced by community utilities and
facilities. It is essential that open areas be maintained for future urbanized
development of the community. It is assumed that most agricultural uses in the
City are of an interim nature and will be terminated when the property is ready
for urban-type development. Properties in this classification will eventually
be reclassified to more appropriate urban-type zoning districts. All newly
annexed areas will fall within this district classification until amended as
provided for in Section
170.32.

District (A-1) will be used only for the following purposes:

landscaping will be provided in accordance with Section
170.43.
   C.   Parking Provisions. Parking spaces/areas will be provided, in
accordance with the applicable regulations set forth in Section
170.52.
   D.   Performance Standards. Any use established in this district after the
effective date of this Zoning Code will be so operated as to comply with the
performance standards governing Subparagraphs (1) - (8). Where the performance
standards required by this Code are less restrictive than comparable
requirements imposed by any other law, ordinance, resolution, rule, or
regulation of any kind of the State of Iowa or another governmental agency, the
more restrictive will govern. Uses already established on the effective date of
this Code will be permitted to be altered, enlarged, expanded, or modified
provided that the additions or changes comply with said performance standards.
      (1)   Noise. For the purpose of measuring the intensity and frequency of
sound, the sound level meter, the octave band analyzer, and the impact noise
analyzer will be employed. The flat network and the fast meter response of the
sound level meter will be used. Sounds of very short duration, as forge
hammers, punch presses, and metal shears which cannot be measured accurately
with the sound level meter will be measured with the impact noise analyzer.
Octave band analyzers calibrated in the preferred frequencies (United States of
America Standard S16-1967, Preferred Frequencies for Acoustical Measurements)
will be used in the table herein “Octave Band, Preferred Frequencies.” Octave
band analyzers calibrated with the pre-1960 octave bands (U.S.A.S. Z24. 10-
1953, Octave Band Filter Set) will be used with the tables herein “Octave Band,
Pre-1960”. The following uses and activities will be exempt from the noise
level regulations:
         a.   Noises not directly under the control of the property user.
         b.   Noises emanating from construction and maintenance activities
between 7:30 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. on weekdays and 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on
Saturdays. Such activities are those which are non-routine operations accessory
to the primary activities and which are temporary in nature or conducted
infrequently.
         c.   The noises of safety signals, warning devices, and emergency
pressure relief valves which are used infrequently.
         d.   Transient noises of moving sources such as automobiles, trucks,
airplanes, and railroads. The decibel values specified for residentially zoned
districts will be reduced by five decibels between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and
7:30 a.m. Noises from essential services are excluded from this nighttime
reduction. The generation of noise will not exceed the decibel limits
prescribed below.

Overall Peak               86 db                  80 db
 
      (2)   Vibration. No activity or operation will cause or create earth
borne vibrations in excess of the displacement values given below. Measurements
will be made at or beyond the adjacent lot line or nearest residentially-zoned
district boundary line, as described below. Vibration displacements will be
measured with an instrument or complement of instruments capable of
simultaneously measuring in three mutually perpendicular directions. The
maximum vector will be less than the vibrations displacement permitted. The
maximum permitted displacements will be permitted in each district by the
following formula:
       K
D = f
Where: D = Displacement in inches
K = A constant to be determined by reference to the following tables
f = The frequency of the vibration transmitted through the ground, cycles per
second.
The maximum earth displacement permitted at the points described below will be
determined by use of the formula in the preceding paragraph and the appropriate
K constant shown as follows:
Values of K to be used in vibration formula:
Location K
Values of K to be used in vibration formula:
Location                                  K
In any neighboring lot:
Continuous                                0.008
Impulsive                                 0.015
Less than eight pulses per 24-hour period 0.037
In any residentially-zoned district:
Continuous                                0.003
Impulsive                                 0.006
Less than eight pulses per 24-hour period 0.015
 
      (3)   Smoke and Particulate Matter. The standards and controls of the
Quad City Regional Air Pollution Control Board with reference to smoke and
particulate matter will be the controlling regulation in the City. However, in
the absence of such control, the following will be the controlling standard:
For the purpose of grading the density or equivalent opacity of smoke, the
Ringelmann Chart described in the U.S. Bureau of Mines Information Circular
8333 (May 1967) will be employed. The emission of smoke or particulate matter
of a density or equivalent opacity equal to or greater than No. 2 on the
Ringelmann Chart is prohibited at all times except as otherwise provided
hereinafter. Dust and other types of air pollution borne by the wind from such
sources as storage areas, yards, roads, and the like within lot boundaries will
be kept to a minimum by appropriate landscaping, paving, oiling, fencing,
wetting or other acceptable means. No operation will cause or allow to be
emitted into the open air from any process or control equipment or to pass any
convenient measuring point in a breaching or stack, particulate matter in the
gases that exceeds 0.35 grains per standard cubic foot (70 degrees Fahrenheit
and 14.7 psi) of gases during any one hour. Particulate matter loading in
pounds per acre described below will be determined by selecting a continuous
four-hour period which will result in the highest average emission rate. The
emission of smoke having a density or equivalent opacity in excess of
Ringelmann No. 1 is prohibited. However, for two minutes in any four-hour
period, smoke up to and including Ringelmann No. 2 will be permitted. The rate
of emission of particulate matter from all vents and stacks within the
boundaries of any lot will not exceed 0.5 pounds per hour per acre of lot area.
      (4)   Toxic matter. The release of airborne toxic matter will not exceed
one-eighth of the “Threshold Limit Values for 1967” as adopted by the American
Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, when measured at any point
beyond the lot line, either at ground level or habitable elevation, whichever
is more restrictive. Concentrations will be measured and calculated as the
highest average that will occur over a continuous 24-hour period. If a toxic
substance is not listed, the applicant will satisfy the City that the proposed
level will be safe and not detrimental to the public health or injurious to
plant and animal life.
      (5)   Odorous matter. When odorous matter is released from any operation,
activity, or use, the concentration of such odorous materials will not exceed
the odor threshold when measured beyond the lot line, either at ground level or
habitable elevation.
      (6)   Fire and explosion hazards.
         a.   Detonable Materials. The storage, utilization, or manufacture of
materials or products which decompose by detonation is limited to five pounds.
Such materials will include, but are not limited to: all primary explosives
such as lead azide, lead styphnate, fulminates, and tetracene; all high
explosives such as TNT, RDX, HMX, PETN, and picric acid; propellants and
components thereof, such as dry nitrocellulose, black powder, boron hydrides,
hydrazine and its derivatives; pyrotechnics and fireworks such as magnesium
powder, potassium chlorate, and potassium nitrate; blasting explosives such as
dynamite and nitroglycerine; unstable organic compounds such as acetylides,
tetrazoles, and ozonides; unstable oxidizing agents such as perchloric acid,
perchlorates, and hydrogen peroxide in concentrations greater than 35 percent.
         b.   Flammable Solids. The storage, utilization, or manufacture of
solid materials or products ranging from incombustible to moderate burning is
permitted. The storage, utilization, or manufacture of solid materials or
products ranging from free or active burning to intensive burning is permitted
provided said materials or products will be stored, utilized, or manufactured
within completely enclosed buildings having not less than two-hour fire-
resistant exterior walls and protected with an automatic fire extinguishing
system.
         c.   Flammable Liquids and Gases. The storage, utilization, or
manufacture of flammable liquids will be permitted in accordance with the
following table, exclusive of storage of finished products in original sealed
containers, which will be unrestricted. Aboveground flammable liquids and gas
storage tanks will not be less than 50 feet from all lot lines. Flammable
liquids and gases in original sealed containers of 55-gallons liquid capacity
or less may be stored or utilized without restriction.

When flammable gases are stored, utilized, or manufactured and measured in
cubic feet, the quantity in cubic feet at standard temperature and pressure
will not exceed 30 times the quantities listed above.
      (7)   Glare. Any operation or activity, (including lighted signage),
producing glare will be conducted so that direct, indirect, and reflected
illumination from any source of light on any lot will not cause illumination in
excess of one-half foot candle when measured at any point on any adjoining
property. No fluctuating, revolving, flickering, flashing, or other such non-
constant sources of lighting will be allowed.
      (8)   Radiation hazards. The release of radioactive materials or the
emission of ionizing radiation outside of property lines will be in accordance
with the rules and regulations of the State or the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission. Unsealed radioactive materials will not be manufactured, utilized,
or stored except when such materials are stored in a radioactive-proof
container stored at or below ground level.
   E.   Sign Requirements. Any sign erected will be done so in accordance with
the applicable regulations set forth in Section
170.53.
   F.   Outdoor Sales. All outdoor sales space will be provided with a
permanent, durable, and dustless surface and will be graded and drained as to
properly dispose of all surface water.
   G.   Outdoor Storage. When permitted, all outdoor storage facilities for
fuel, raw materials, products, and all objectionable materials will be enclosed
by a fence, wall, or plant materials adequate to completely conceal such
facilities from any adjacent properties and any public right-of-way.
   H.   Waste Materials. No materials or waste will be deposited upon a lot in
such a form that may be transferred off the property by natural causes or
forces.
8.   Floor Area Ratio. The allowable floor area ratio in this zoning district
will not exceed 0.6.
9.   Maximum Lot Coverage. Not more than 40 percent of the lot area may be

provide for heavy industrial uses and other uses not otherwise provided for in
the districts established by this Zoning Code. This district is designed
primarily for manufacturing, assembling, and fabricating activities, including
large scale or specialized operations, whose external effects will be felt to
some degree by surrounding districts. Less restriction is placed upon outdoor
use and storage, although such use must conform to the performance standards of
the district. Certain uses with established functions in the economy, but
having a well-known nuisance potential, are permitted only by special
exception. The intensity of uses permitted in this district makes it most
desirable that they be separated from residential and commercial uses by
adequate buffers or screening.
2.   Principal Uses Permitted. Property and buildings in a Heavy Industrial
District (I-2) may be used for any commercial or industrial use, (including
PDD), with the following exceptions or as noted otherwise:

resources.
   E.   Wholesale or bulk storage of gasoline, propane, butane, or other
petroleum products.
   F.   Waste disposal plants of all types including, but not limited to,
trash, garbage, sewage treatment, etc.
   G.   Outdoor storage facilities.
   H.   Automobile salvage or junk yard, building material salvage yard, scrap
metal storage yard, or other salvage yard of any kind, provided that, all such
operations are conducted in such a manner that all operation, display, or
storage of material or equipment is so screened by ornamental fences, walks, or
permanent planting that it cannot be seen from any public right-of-way or from
adjoining lots when viewed by a person standing on ground level, and provided
further, however, that no such screening in excess of eight feet in height will
be required.
   I.   Any other use determined by the Board of Adjustment upon review to be
of the same general character as the foregoing permitted special exceptions.
4.   Prohibited Uses. The following uses are specifically prohibited in the
Heavy Industrial District:
   A.   Dwellings, except for watchman or caretaker facilities on the premises.
   B.   Churches, schools, hospitals, clinics, and other institutions for human
care, except when incidental to a permitted use.
5.   Height Regulations. No building or structure will exceed 100 feet in
height and no accessory structure will exceed 40 feet in height.
6.   Lot area, Lot Width, and Yard Requirements.
   A.   Lot Area. None required. The minimum lot width, setbacks, on-site
parking requirements, floor area ratio, building codes, maximum lot coverage,
etc., will ultimately determine the minimum lot area.
   B.   Lot Width and Yard Requirements. The following minimum lot and yard
width requirements will apply:
      (1)   Lot Width:   150 feet.
      (2)   Front Yard Depth:   50 feet.
      (3)   Side Yard Width and Rear Yard Depth:   Side and rear yards will be
governed by the requirement that buildings will adjoin public space, yards, or
streets on three sides and that each such space will be not less than 20 feet.
7.   Special Provisions.
   A.   Enclosure of Operations. Industrial operations, including storage, in
this district may take place outdoors only if permitted upon review by the
Board of Adjustment. (Solid waste collection and storage or processing will be
conducted within completely enclosed buildings or structures).
   B.   Screening. Where an industrial use in this district abuts or is across
the street from any other district, adequate screening and landscaping will be
provided in accordance with Section
170.43. Further, when permitted, all outdoor storage facilities for fuel, raw
materials, products, and all objectionable materials will be enclosed by a
fence, wall, or plant materials adequate to completely conceal such facilities
from any adjacent properties and any public right-of-way.
   C.   Parking Provisions. Parking spaces and areas will be provided, in
accordance with the applicable regulations, as set forth in Section
170.52.
   D.   Performance Standards. Any use established in this district after the

permanent, durable, and dustless surface and will be graded and drained as to
properly dispose of all surface water.
      (7)   Waste Materials. No materials or waste will be deposited upon a lot
in such a form that may be transferred off the property by natural causes or
forces.
8.   Floor Area Ratio. The allowable floor area ratio in this zoning district
will not exceed 2.0.
9.   Maximum Lot Coverage. Not more than 60 percent of the lot area may be
occupied by buildings and structures, including accessory buildings.
170.27   OVERLAY FLOOD DISTRICTS.
See
Chapter 165 – Floodplain Management.
170.28   OVERLAY PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT (PDD).
1.   General Description and Purposes of District. This overlay planned
development district (PDD) district has been established to promote to the
extent possible;
   A.   A maximum choice in the types of environment available to the public by
allowing a development that would not be possible under the strict application
of the other sections of this Zoning Code or the Subdivision Development
Regulations, while preserving the primary purposes and intent of this Zoning
Code;
   B.   The permanent preservation of common open space and recreation areas
and facilities;
   C.   A pattern of development to preserve natural vegetation, topographic,
and geologic features;
   D.   A creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities
that results in better development, design, and the construction of aesthetic
amenities;
   E.   An efficient use of the land resulting in more economic networks of
utilities, streets, and other facilities, such as, but not limited to, cluster
developments;
   F.   A land use which promotes the public health, safety, comfort, morals,
and welfare;
   G.   A substitute procedure for the review of subdivisions and zoning-
related issues, (i.e., variances, special exceptions, etc.);
   H.   Developments which incorporate a single type or a variety of related
uses which are planned and developed as a unit, but which depart from the
specified standards and requirements of other sections of this Zoning Code or
the Subdivision Development Regulations; and,
   I.   The provision of amenities, facilities, and open spaces not otherwise
required by law.
The foregoing purposes and principles will not be interpreted to permit the
further reduction of standards and minimum requirements set forth in this
section.
2.   Procedures For the Submittal, Review, and Consideration of Planned
Development District (PDD) Proposals. The procedures used in the submittal,
review, and consideration of PDD proposals will be as follows:
   A.   Planning Consultation, Sketch Plan Discussion, and Preliminary Review
Requirements.
      (1)   Planning Consultation. In order to make the most of the
opportunities related to the PDD process and to conserve time, effort, and
expense, the developer should consult with the Council, the Planning and Zoning
Commission, the City Administrator, and other public officials prior to the
preparation of the tentative plan of the PDD. The City’s comprehensive plans
should be reviewed to determine how the proposed PDD will fit into those plans.
Requirements of the master street development plan; school and recreational
sites; shopping centers, community facilities; sanitation; water supply,
drainage, and erosion; and relationship to other developments, existing and
proposed in the vicinity, should be determined in advance of the preparation of
the PDD plan. Consultation should also be held with those familiar with the
economic factors affecting the PDD. A thorough estimate of the situation will
result in sound decisions with respect to the form, character, and extent of
the proposed PDD. Land, which the City finds to be unsuitable for designation
as a PDD due to flooding or poor drainage characteristics, or topographic
features likely to be harmful to the safety, welfare, and general health of
future residents, will not be so designated until the objectionable features
have been eliminated, or until adequate safeguards against such hazards are
provided. In applicable cases, plans will be reviewed by the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources (IDNR) and their findings and recommendations incorporated in
the approval of such plans.
      (2)   Sketch Plan Discussion and Preliminary Review Requirements. Prior
to the filing of a formal application for a PDD zoning amendment it shall be
required that the developer submit to the Building and Zoning Enforcement
Officer certain materials relating to the proposed PDD. These materials will
include information relative to the site, conditions of the site, existing
community facilities, and utilities on and adjacent to the site, number and
size of lots proposed, existing and proposed structures, etc. These materials
will include as a minimum:
         a.   Location Plan. This is a plan showing the location and
relationship of the proposed PDD to the City in general, streets, and other
community facilities serving it. This plan will include, as a minimum, the
following:
            (i)   PDD name in bold letters, centered at the top of the plan
            (ii)   Bold, heavy outline of area to be included in PDD.
            (iii)   Existing streets and City utilities on/or adjoining the
property to be included in the PDD.
            (iv)   North point, graphic bar scale, and date.
            (v)   Outline of the Overlay Floodplain District area as described
in Section
170.27 of this Zoning Code, if the proposed PDD lies within said district.
         b.   Sketch Plan(s). This is a plan or a set of plans showing the
proposed layout of streets, lots, structures, (including architectural
renderings, etc.), and other features of the specific site proposed for the PDD
in relation to existing conditions, features, and structures, as well as
existing topographic data.
The PDD sketch plan discussion and preliminary review process does not require
formal applications, fees, or filings. The Building and Zoning Enforcement
Officer will submit the required, submitted, materials to the Planning and
Zoning Commission at their next regularly scheduled meeting. (See Section
170.35) The Planning and Zoning Commission will, within 30 days from the date
of the meeting at which the materials are reviewed, make known its comments
regarding the proposed PDD to the developer and the Building and Zoning
Enforcement Officer.
   B.   Preliminary PDD Plan and Rezoning Application Preparation and Filing
Requirements. An application for the preliminary consideration of a request for
a rezoning to the PDD Zoning District, (See Appendix), will be accompanied by a
filing fee specified by resolution of the Council, a preliminary PDD plan and
related documents meeting the requirements of Sections
170.14(9) of the Subdivision Development Regulations, the information, (as
revised, if necessary), contained in Sections 170.28 – 170.28(2)(A) and above,
and any other information deemed necessary by the Building and Zoning
Enforcement Officer to insure that the proposed PDD zoning district amendment
will conform to the City’s Comprehensive Plan and to the purposes of a PDD
Zoning District as set forth in Section 170.28 above.
      (1)   Additional Filing Information Required. In addition to the filing
information requirements specified above, the following information will be
supplied by the developer at the time of filing:
         a.   Character. A written narrative, explaining the character of the
PDD and the reasons why it has been planned to take advantage of the
flexibility of these regulations.
         b.   Ownership. A statement of present and proposed ownership of all
land within the project, including present tract designation.
         c.   Schedule. Development schedule indicating:
            (i)   Stages in which the project will be built, with emphasis on
public areas and facilities to be developed with each stage, will be shown on
the plan and through supporting graphic material.
            (ii)   Completion date or dates of new construction for above- and
below-ground facilities, utilities, and buffer zones or screening. (See also
170.28(2)(D) below)
            (iii)   If different land use types are to be included within the
planned unit development, the schedule must include the mix of uses to be built
in each stage.
         d.   Density. Provide information on the density of residential uses
and the number of dwelling units by type.
         e.   Use. Provide a list of uses planned for the ancillary and
nonresidential areas.
         f.   Architectural Plans. Preliminary architectural plans for all
primary buildings will be submitted in sufficient detail to permit an
understanding of the style of the development, the design of the building, and
the number, size, and type of dwelling units.
         g.   Unsubdivided Lands. Tabulations on separate unsubdivided use
area, including land area, number of buildings, number of dwelling units, and
dwelling units per acre.
         h.   Common Open Space Documents. All common open space will be either
conveyed to a municipal or public corporation, conveyed to a nonprofit
corporation or entity established for the purpose of benefiting the owners and
residents of the Planned Development District, or retained by the developer
with legally binding guarantees, in a form approved by the City, that the
common open space will be permanently preserved and maintained as open area.
All land conveyed to a nonprofit corporation or like entity will be subject to
the right of said corporation to impose a legally enforceable lien for
maintenance and improvement of the common open space.
   C.   Preliminary PDD Plan or Rezoning Application Hearing and Review
Processes. The Planning and Zoning Commission and the Council will conduct
their respective hearings, reviews, and considerations of a proposed,
preliminary PDD rezoning request pursuant to the amendment provisions contained
within Section
170.37(10). Approval of the preliminary PDD rezoning request by the Council
does not constitute approval of the PDD Zoning District, but is merely an
authorization and an expression of interest by the City which will serve as a
guide to the developer in preparation of the final PDD; plan and any
preliminary PDD plan not finally approved by the Council is revocable by the
Council pursuant to the terms and conditions contained herein. A PDD rezoning
request may be submitted for preliminary, combined with, final approval if all
of the land is to be developed at one time, (any and all development completed
within two years from the date of approval of the PDD plan), and if all
requirements as specified herein are met.
   D.   Final PDD Plan or Rezoning Application Preparation and Filing
Requirements. An application for the final consideration of a request for a
rezoning to the PDD Zoning District, (See Appendix), will be accompanied by a
filing fee specified by resolution of the Council, a final PDD plan which will
conform substantially to the approved, preliminary PDD plan or subject to minor
changes, and related documents meeting the requirements of Sections 171.11(1)
(J)-2(B) of the Subdivision Development Regulations, and any other information
deemed necessary by the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer to insure that
the proposed PDD Zoning District amendment will conform to the City’s
Comprehensive Plan and to the purposes of a PDD Zoning District as set forth in
Section 170.28. A final PDD plan may be submitted in stages with each stage
reflecting the approved preliminary PDD plan, provided, however, that said
stages conform to all of the requirements set forth herein and a submittal
schedule is approved as a part of the preliminary approval process. If a
staged-submittal process is used, all submittals must conform with the agreed-
to schedule and no submittal will be allowed later than five years from the
approval date of the preliminary PDD plan by the Council. The Council may grant
an extension of time for a submittal or the developer may resubmit an entirely
new preliminary PDD rezoning request application for consideration. In the
event that no action is taken on behalf of the developer in conformance with
the above, the Council will initiate such zoning amendments as it deems
necessary to preserve the public interest. If development falls more than two
years behind the schedule filed with the preliminary or final PDD plan, the
plan becomes subject to revocation. The Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer
will monitor all pending PDD projects and inform the Council of those plans six
months or more behind schedule.
   E.   Final PDD Plan or Rezoning Application Hearing and Review Processes.
The Planning and Zoning Commission and the Council will conduct their
respective hearings, reviews, and considerations of a proposed, final PDD
rezoning request pursuant to the amendment provisions contained within Section
170.37.
      (1)   Recording the Final Planned Development District Plan. An approved
final PDD plan will be filed with the County Recorder within 30 days of the
date of approval by the Council, and if not filed within such time, will have
no validity and will not be recorded without reapproval by the Council and
recertification by the Clerk. Within five working days after recording, a duly
noted, recorded copy will be filed with the Clerk of the City. The construction
of any public improvements or the issuance of any building permits in the PDD
Zoning District will be allowed only after recording of the final PDD plan with
the County Recorder and submittal of said recorded plan to the Clerk. The
recording of the final plan will inform all who deal with the planned unit
development of the restrictions placed upon the land and will serve as a zoning
control device notification.
      (2)   Changes in the Planned Development District Plan. The planned
development district will be developed according to the approved, recorded, and
filed final PDD plan, except where authorized changes or amendments are
permitted. The recorded plan and supporting data together with all recorded
amendments will be binding on the applicants, their successors, grantees, and
assigns, and will limit and control the use of premises and location of
structures in the planned development district project as set forth therein.
         a.   Major Changes. A change in the approved preliminary or final PDD
plan which alters the concept or intent of the planned development district
including a change in usage, the configuration, increase in floor area or the
height of buildings, an increase in intensity, a reduction of proposed open
space, a change in road locations or standards, a change in the final governing
agreement, provisions or covenants, or other such changes will be deemed a
major change, and will be reviewed and considered only by submission of a new
preliminary and final PDD plan. All approved major changes in the final PDD
plan will be recorded with the County Recorder as amendments to the final PDD
plan as specified above.
         b.   Minor Changes. The Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer may
approve minor changes in the planned development district plan which do not
change the concept or intent of the development, without going through the
submittal, review, and consideration steps. Minor changes will be any change
not defined as a major change.
3.   Minimum Standards for Consideration and General Scope of Authorized
Variances Within the PDD Concept. The site under consideration for any PDD
rezoning request must;
   A.   Be under single ownership or unified control;
   B.   Be not less than four acres in size, and;
   C.   Not more than 60 percent of the ground area of any PDD may be devoted
to the principal uses permitted, (i.e. structures, parking areas, etc.).
Any PDD concept may depart from strict compliance with the required density,
dimension, area, height, bulk, use, and other similar regulations listed for
the standard zoning districts and subdivision regulations and other provisions
of this Zoning Code so long as the PDD project will not be detrimental to or
endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort, or general welfare; and
only if said variances are so authorized and approved by the Council throughout
the PDD review and consideration processes as outlined herein.
170.29   OVERLAY GREENWAY DISTRICT (GD).
1.   General Description and Purposes of District. With increasing urban
development pressures within the City, the Overlay Greenway District (GD) has
been established to promote the preservation of those existing City natural
resources and environmentally sensitive areas that are deemed to be essential
to protecting the public health, safety, and welfare of our residents. These
areas allow for the natural filtration of streams and rivers and provide
improved stormwater and floodplain management. These areas promote erosion
control along waterfronts and ravines and create protective buffers for
woodlands and prairies. These typically linear corridors protect migration
routes for wildlife and allow for the interconnection of recreation and multi-
purpose trails. These areas can provide opportunities for urban landscaping and
design and economic development associated with increased property values,
recreation related retail sales, and rental enterprises, tourism attractions,
and quality of life initiatives which can attract corporations and businesses
to our City. Greenways have been further defined as “passive” and “active” or a
combination of these types. These definitions aid in the prioritization
process, strategies for implementation, and these development standards. The
foregoing purposes and principles will not be interpreted to permit the further
reduction of standards and minimum requirements set forth in this section.
2.   Greenway Districts (Areas Defined). The following greenway areas are
hereby established within the City:
   A.   Mississippi River. The City recognizes the value and importance of the
Mississippi River as a tourist attraction, commercial and environmental
resource, and panoramic wonder. It is designated as an existing and future
active greenway with passive components. The Great River Road of Iowa, (U.S.
67), parallels the shoreline of the river as well as a major railroad corridor.
This river corridor is envisioned to be vital, distinctive, and accessible,
coordinated in its use, and integrated through good design.
   B.   Cody Trail. This active greenway, developed from the Iowa
Sesquicentennial Celebration of 1996, embraces a part of the history of the
County and the City. The Cody Trail provides a historic and scenic on-road, 12-
mile route throughout Northern Scott County. This trail highlights the
birthplace and boyhood home(s) of William Frederick (Buffalo Bill) Cody in and
around the City area. In the City, this trail starts in the 1,000 block of
North Cody Road (U.S. 67), continues on Cody Road North to Territorial Road,
and then proceeds West on Territorial Road to the City’s Westernmost corporate
limits, (23rd Street).
   C.   Valley Drive Corridor. Valley Drive is proposed as a future active
greenway. A spur from the Great River Trail is proposed which would preserve
the scenic, forested, bluff areas along the on-road trail route.
   D.   West Sycamore Creek. Future passive greenways are proposed for this
relatively minor drainage area located on the West side of I-80. Protection
from erosion and improved water quality in these areas will benefit the
Mississippi River at its confluence.
   E.   East Sycamore Creek. A trail spur from the Great River Trail will
complement this future active greenway. The creek flows nearby the Mississippi
Valley Welcome Center, which is promoted as an area gateway to the Quad-Cities.
This greenway also provides a connection to 15th Street Park and surrounding
residential subdivisions.
   F.   Silver Creek. This passive greenway watershed contains 1,327 acres and
flows into the Mississippi River. Protecting the stream bank and water quality,
while providing a wildlife corridor, is a priority of this greenway.
   G.   McCarty Creek. This passive greenway watershed contains 3,894 acres.
This stream flows adjacent to the City Quarries along Territory Road. Future
reclamation plans will convert the existing quarry site into a lake and open
space recreational area at the conclusion of the mining process. Protection
from run-off, erosion, and sedimentation control are primary concerns in this
greenway.
170.30   INFILL DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT (IDOD).
1.   General Description and Purposes of District. The Infill Development
Overlay District (IDOD) has been established to encourage infill and
redevelopment in the older residential area to include parcels of land that do
not meet the minimum dimensional requirements of the Zoning Code as well as
those that do meet the minimum requirements. It has been established to
encourage development that maintains the character of existing neighborhood
buildings and structures; to permit a flexible approach to providing single-
family houses; and to foster well-planned, modest homes in a residential area
in keeping with the visual character of the neighborhood.
   A.   Allowing development of single-family homes in close proximity to each
other within the district and within a limited area;
   B.   Preserving and restoring the overall character of the identified
overlay district area;
   C.   Promoting a balance of home sizes;
   D.   Promoting the opportunity for people to develop residences in areas of
land that would not otherwise be developed;
   E.   Promoting a high level of design quality; and
   F.   Facilitating development proposals responsive to current and future
market conditions.
2.   Principal Uses Permitted. Property and buildings in the Infill Development
Overlay District (IDOD) will be used only for the following purposes:
   A.   Single-family detached dwelling, either site-built or pre-fabricated
modular home, providing compliance with the provisions of the following
subsections on density, floor area ratio, and minimum dwelling size.
   B.   Accessory uses or building which are customarily incidental to any of
the above stated use.
   C.   Planned Development District (PDD).
3.   Special Exceptions. The following principal uses may be permitted as
special exceptions by the Board of Adjustment in accordance with the provisions
contained herein:
   A.   Church, temple, synagogue, or mosque.
   B.   Childcare center.
   C.   Duplex, assuming underlying zoning district is either R-2 or R-3.
   D.   Home occupation.
   E.   Municipal administrative or public service building or properties,
except storage yards, warehouses, or garages, connected therewith.
   F.   Park, playground, or community center.
   G.   Public library and similar public culture uses.
   H.   Public school or private school offering general educational courses
the same as ordinarily given in public schools.
   I.   Public utility service facilities - such as, but not limited to, gas
regulator station, telephone exchange, electric substation, water tower or
well, sanitary sewer lift stations and treatment facilities, and
telecommunication facilities.
4.   Height Regulations. No principal building or structure will exceed 35 feet
in height and no accessory structure will exceed the elevation of the principal
building as verified by a State licensed professional engineer.
5.   Lot Area, Lot Width, and Yard Requirements. Lot area and yard requirements
are significantly more flexible than the traditional requirements of the
Single-Family Residential District (R-1), under the stipulations that the lot
and dwelling will not create additional nuisances towards neighbors, and will
meet other additional development standards of the Infill Development Overlay
District, including:
   A.   The proposed building or structure is consistent in architectural
style, scale, setbacks, and frontage with abutting structures, and those in the
immediate neighborhood.
   B.   Each lot will have access and utility service comparable to that
serving nearby properties.
   C.   No traffic congestion, health, or safety limitations would be created
by the development.
   D.   Access shall be provided to the extent feasible through an existing
side street or a shared driveway; curb cuts shall be minimized.
   E.   Lot area. The following minimum lot area requirements will apply:
      (1)   5,000 square feet.
   F.   Lot Width and Yard Requirements. The following minimum lot width and
yard requirements will be observed:
      (1)   Lot Width   60 feet.
      (2)   Front Yard Depth   25 feet.
      (3)   Side Yard Minimum Width   5 feet.
      (4)   Sum of Side Yard Widths   10 feet.
      (5)   Rear Yard Depth   30 feet.
6.   Density. The allowable residential density in this zoning district will
not exceed 9.3 dwelling units per acre, except under the provisions of a PDD.
7.   Floor Area Ration. The allowable floor area ratio in this zoning district
will not exceed 0.4.
8.   Minimum Size of Dwelling. Each single-family detached dwelling and any
other structure occupied, in whole or in part, for residential purposes will
contain at least 1,000 square feet of finished square feet.
9.   Minimum Spacing Between Buildings. The minimum horizontal distance between
any buildings will be 10 feet for single-family dwellings.
10.   Minimum Structure Width. The minimum dimension (width) of the main body
of any residential structure will not be less than 22 feet for at least 75
percent of the distance of the major dimension (length).
11.   Parking Standards. Newly constructed homes in the Infill Development
Overlay District shall include off-street parking amenities for at least two
vehicles. A continuous parking surface such as concrete, asphalt, paver bricks,
or other alternative materials that are shown to be impervious yet as durable
as concrete pavement.
12.   Commonly Held Adjacent Lots. Any lot that is commonly held in ownership
with an adjacent lot in this district may be treated as a single lot in
accordance with this Code, provided that the total area of such lots is at
least 5,000 square feet in area, the lots have a combined contiguous frontage
of at least 60 feet, and vacant of structures, parking facilities, or accessory
uses. Additionally, an exceptionally large lot in the Infill Development
Overlay District may be re-platted into two separate lots if each adjacent lot
meets the minimum requirements outlined above.
13.   Infill Overlay District (Areas Defined on Map). The Infill Overlay
District is hereby established within the City, as defined by the corresponding
map in the Zoning Code.
170.31   MARINA OVERLAY DISTRICT (MOD).
1.   General Description and Purposes of District. The Marina Overlay District
is intended to foster river-oriented improvements, visual and physical river
access, and encourage well-planned design along the riverfront to enhance the
vision of the community. The proposed Marina Overlay District has been
identified along U.S. 67 beginning just south of downtown and extending north
up to the existing corporate limits. This district is intended to provide the
community with better river access, increase business development along the
riverfront, encourage community pride, and use of the riverfront, and
eventually host a portion of the Mississippi River Trail connecting Bettendorf
to LeClaire to Princeton.
   A.   To recognize, preserve, maintain, and promote economically viable uses
that are a benefit to the City;
   B.   To maximize public benefit for further development of the riverfront
area;
   C.   To provide for improved scenic and aesthetic controls;
   D.   To recognize the riverfront area as a visual, environmental, and
recreational resource that affects and benefits the City as a whole;
   E.   To protect adjacent properties from the negative effects of
incompatible development;
   F.   To establish a physically attractive pattern of development for the
general welfare of the City. The MOD extends along the Mississippi River in the
corporate limits of the City. The exact boundary of the MOD is delineated on
the Official City Zoning Map. The Marina Overlay District regulations
supplement and control (where inconsistent) the regulations of underlying
district(s). All other applicable provisions and standards of the Zoning Code
and other pertinent ordinances shall remain in effect.
2.   Principal Uses Permitted. All uses permitted by right in the underlying
zoning district(s).
3.   Special Exceptions. The following principal uses may be permitted as
special exceptions by the Board of Adjustment in accordance with the provisions
contained herein:
   A.   All uses permitted by review by the Board of Adjustment in the
underlying zoning district(s).
   B.   Any other uses deemed permitted by the Board of Adjustment.
4.   Height Regulations. No principal building or structure will exceed 35 feet
in height, and no accessory structure will exceed the elevation of the
principal building as verified by a State licensed professional engineer.
5.   Lot Area, Lot Width, and Yard Requirements. All requirements of the
underlying zoning district(s) concerning lot area and yard depths shall remain
applicable except where modified by the following sections.
6.   Density. All requirements of the underlying zoning district(s) concerning
density shall remain applicable except where modified by the following
sections.
7.   Floor Area Ration. All requirements of the underlying zoning district(s)
concerning floor area ratio shall remain applicable except where modified by
the following sections.
8.   Minimum Size of Dwelling. All requirements of the underlying zoning
district(s) concerning dwelling size shall remain applicable except where
modified by the following sections.
9.   Minimum Spacing Between Buildings. All requirements of the underlying
zoning district(s) concerning minimum building spacing shall remain applicable
except where modified by the following sections.
10.   Minimum Structure Width. All requirements of the underlying zoning
district(s) concerning structure width shall remain applicable except where
modified by the following sections.
11.   Public Space and Easements. For the benefit of the public, physical or
visual access to or along the riverfront is encouraged. This will serve to
provide open areas and vehicle-free areas for use by the general public. Given
the path of adjacent railway, desired design standards also include visual
access areas such as vistas, scenic overlooks, and open space plazas.
   A.   A public pedestrian easement should be located adjacent to the
riverfront, if feasible, and not subject to excessive risks with unwarranted
railway crossing.
      (1)   The easement should connect to any adjacent public pedestrian
easement in a physically logical and efficient manner.
      (2)   Such pedestrian easements should be located in a safe and logical
fashion and be usable by pedestrians or bicyclists.
      (3)   The City shall be responsible for the cost, installation, and
maintenance of the asphalt surfacing, lighting, signage, security, and fencing
where needed, and any other facilities and public space necessary for the
public use along the riverfront.
      (4)   The developer, their successors, and assigns, if any, shall provide
cross-easements for ingress and egress to interconnect parcels on the
riverfront facing side of the property within the MOD when appropriate. In some
cases, a street or drive connecting more than two parcels may be needed.
      (5)   Appropriate right-of-way easements for accommodating access to the
riverfront shall be established with the platting of any and all parcels within
the MOD. Maintenance responsibilities and City ingress and egress rights to
said right-of-way shall be granted with any and all plats submitted. Public
street right-of-way shall be dedicated to the public on the riverfront facing
parcels in a coordinated and continuous manner in order to make full use of any
and all pedestrian bridges or pedestrian-oriented infrastructure constructed
within the district.
   B.   A public vista should be constructed to maintain, enhance, and develop
river views from streets, paths and trails, and developed areas. Obstacles
should be removed, and outdoor furnishings such as benches and informational
and educational signs describing the scene or vista, should be provided.
   C.   A scenic overlook should be erected to provide panoramic views and
specific focal points of the riverfront. Well-designed towers or raised
platforms to enhance the overlook should be provided.
   D.   A plaza should be established to provide open space opportunities for
passive recreation, often enclosed by either landscaping or buildings, and
encouraged to complement existing land uses. Tiles lining the plaza may be
artistically designed in a mosaic to tell river or community history.

12.   Development Incentives. To encourage the creation of public space along
the riverfront, various developer incentives are offered upon the designation
of public space and easements. These spaces shall be adjacent to the riverfront
on the owners’ property, or an alternative location may be proposed, if that
location is not possible.
   A.   For every 400 square feet of dedicated public space or pedestrian
easement that is provided by the owner, the maximum building height allowable
may be increased up to 45 feet for the principal building or structure. The
granting of this increase shall also be dependent upon design and topographical
considerations.
   B.   For every 400 square feet of dedicated public space or pedestrian

right-of-way may be varied as long as design, floodplain, safety, topographic,
and view considerations are satisfactorily addressed; provided, however, the
setback may not be reduced to less than 10 feet.
   C.   For every 400 square feet of dedicated public space or pedestrian
easement that is provided by the owner, one parking space may be deducted from
the required parking total. This provision shall not apply to residential use

floor transparent windows to allow visual access into and out of the building;
   B.   Primary entrances shall open on to a street or interior courtyard.
   C.   Building frontages along streets shall break any flat, monolithic
façade by including architectural features such as, but not limited to, bay
windows, recessed entrances, fluted masonry, fenestration, cornices, or other
articulation so as to provide visual interest and a pedestrian scale to the
first floor.
   D.   Multi-story buildings shall extend the same architectural features
above the ground floor level through variations in design, detail, and
proportion, and by avoiding designs featuring a monolithic street façade.
15.   Marina Overlay District (Areas Defined on Map). The Marina Overlay

the regulations of this Zoning Code in harmony with its general purpose and
intent only in the specific instances hereinafter set forth and only in
accordance with the standards hereinafter prescribed.
   B.   Initiation of Variance. Variances affecting a particular property may
be requested by any person, firm, corporation, or government agency having a
freehold interest in that property, a possessory interest entitled to exclusive
possession of that property, or a contractual interest which may become a
freehold interest of an exclusive possessory interest in that property, either
of which is specifically enforceable, by submitting to the Building and Zoning
Enforcement Officer a properly completed “Petition for Hearing and
Consideration of Action” application.
   C.   Application for Variance. An application for a variance must be filed
in writing with the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer. Said application
will contain such information as the Board of Adjustment may, by rule, require.

application referred to in Section 170.34(6)(C) above by the Building and
Zoning Enforcement Officer, the Board of Adjustment will hold at least one
public hearing on the requested variance within 30 calendar days from the date
of acceptance of the application, subject to the provisions of Section
170.37(5).
   E.   Notice of Hearing. Notice of the time and place of such public hearing
will be:
      (1)   Published at least once, not less than seven calendar days, or more
than 20 calendar days, before the hearing, in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City.
      (2)   Said notice will also be delivered by certified mail not less than
seven calendar days, nor more than 20 calendar days, before the hearing to all
property owners whose property boundaries lie within 200 feet, (inclusive of
any and all public and quasi-public right-of-way distances), of the boundaries
of the property upon which the use, or structure is located that is the subject
of the requested variance.
      (3)   No less than seven working days prior to the public hearing on a
petition requesting a variance, the applicant shall post a notice sign on or
near the property upon which the application is being made and shall remove and
return the sign immediately following the public hearing on the application.
The sign will be provided to the applicant by the Board Secretary upon receipt
of a signed deposit, which shall be refunded if the sign is returned in good
condition within seven working days of the date of the decision on the
application.
   F.   Standards for Variances. The Board of Adjustment will not vary the
regulations of this Code, as authorized in this section, unless there is
evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
      (1)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the property owner would result, as distinguished from a mere
inconvenience if the strict letter of the regulations were to be carried out;
      (2)   The conditions, upon which a petition for a variance is based, are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable,
generally, to other property within the same zoning classification;
      (3)   The purpose of the variance is not based exclusively upon a desire
for financial gain;
      (4)   The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by this Zoning Code
and has not been created by any persons having an interest in the property;
      (5)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in
which the property is located;
      (6)   The requested variance will not impair an adequate supply of light
and air to adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion of the
public streets, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety, or
substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood;
      (7)   The purpose of the variance will not be to establish a use
otherwise excluded from the particular district in which it is requested,
except as noted otherwise herein; and,
      (8)   The requested variance will not be contrary to the public interest
and will ensure that the spirit of this Zoning Code will be observed and
substantial justice done.
   G.   Conditions. The Board of Adjustment may impose such conditions and
restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variance as may be necessary to
comply with the standards for variances established in this section. Said
conditions and restrictions, if imposed, must be adhered to and failure to do
so will automatically and immediately cause the variance to be revoked.
   H.   Recording Required. Approved variances and attached conditions must be
recorded in the County Recorder’s office at the applicant’s expense. The
recording fee will be paid at City Hall at the same time that the permit for
the project being granted a variance is issued.
   I.   Authorized Variances. Variances from the regulations of this Zoning
Code may be granted by the Board of Adjustment only in accordance with the
“Standards for Variances” established in Section
170.37(6) and may be granted only in the following instances and in no others:
      (1)   To permit any yard or setback line of lesser dimension than
required by the applicable regulations;
      (2)   To permit any building or structure to exceed the height
limitations imposed by the applicable regulations;
      (3)   To permit the use of a lot or lots for a use otherwise prohibited
solely because of the insufficient area or width of the lot or lots, but in no
event will the respective area and width of the lot or lots be less than 70
percent of the required area and width;
      (4)   To permit the same off-street parking facility to qualify as
required facilities for two or more uses provided that substantial use of such
facility by each user does not take place at approximately the same hours of
the same days of the week. (See Section
170.52(5)(F))
      (5)   To modify or waive the off-street parking and loading space
requirements or approve any special location plan in any of the districts
wherever the character or use of a building is such as to make unnecessary the
full provision of parking or loading facilities, or where such regulations
would impose an unreasonable hardship upon the use of the lot, as contrasted
with merely being granted for a convenience. (See Section
170.52)
      (6)   To permit the alteration or enlargement of an existing building or
use located in a district which prohibits that use of land or building; or the
height and area of buildings existing at the time of the adoption of this
Zoning Code where such alteration or enlargement is a necessary incident to the
use of the structure existing at the time of the adoption, amendment, or change
of this Zoning Code;
      (7)   To permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming building which has
been damaged by explosion, fire, act of God, or the public enemy to the extent
of more than 65 percent of its assessed valuation as determined by the records
of the County Assessor’s Office, where the Board finds some compelling public
necessity requiring a conditional continuance of the nonconforming use.
      (8)   To permit a lower level of flood protection for floodplain uses
than required by the floodplain management regulations contained in Section
170.27.
      (9)   To permit an increase in the allowable light intensity on any
adjoining property, or to allow any other deviation from the lighting and
related provisions of this Zoning Code. Any person requesting a variance of
this nature will, in addition to those requirements for filing as spelled out
in Section 170.34(6), add to their application the following information:
         a.   Type and use of outdoor light involved.
         b.   Specific exemption requested; including proposed foot candle
intensity on any and all adjacent, effected buildings.
         c.   Physical size of outdoor light involved.
         d.   Type of illumination.
         e.   Rated lumen output of lamp or lamps per location.
         f.   Proposed location of outdoor light.
         g.   Duration of use of outdoor light.
         h.   Site and necessary elevation plans to depict vertical and
horizontal relationships between proposed light source and any and all
adjacent, effected buildings.
      (10)   To assist and enhance economic development activities in areas of
the City designated as Urban Renewal Areas (URA) or Tax Increment Financing
(TIF) areas, provided such variance is consistent with the standards outlined
in Section 170.34(6)(I) and the City’s Comprehensive Development Plan.
   J.   Findings on Variances. All decisions by the Board of Adjustment on
requests for variances must be supplemented with a written finding of fact
stating the conformity or nonconformity, as the case may be, of their decision
with the standards for variance set forth in this chapter.
   K.   Effective Date(s) and Revocation of a Variance. Variances become
effective immediately upon their approval by the Board and will be valid for a
period no longer than six months from the date of such decision and will
automatically be revoked unless the building permit is obtained within such
period and the erection or alteration of a building is substantially complete
or the use commenced within such period or unless otherwise specified in the
Board's official action granting the variance.
   L.   Effect of Denial of a Variance Request or Voluntary Withdrawal of
Petition. No application for a variance that has been denied wholly, or in
part, by the Board of Adjustment or that has been voluntarily withdrawn by the
petitioner will be resubmitted for consideration, in its original form, for a
period of at least one year from the date of said order of denial or the date
of the withdrawal request, except on the grounds of new evidence being
presented to and being found to be valid by the Board of Adjustment. This
section does not preclude any person from submitting a new, modified
application for substantially the same variance. Modified may mean any one of
the following: a new petitioner, different set-back footage, altered structural
or special features, etc.
7.   Appeals.
   A.   Authority. The Board of Adjustment, after a public hearing, may vary
any administrative order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the
Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer or Building Official.
   B.   Initiation of Appeal. Appeals affecting a particular property may be
requested by any person, firm, corporation, or government agency having a
freehold interest in that property, a possessory interest entitled to exclusive
possession of that property, or a contractual interest which may become a
freehold interest of an exclusive possessory interest in that property, either
of which is specifically enforceable, by submitting to the Building and Zoning
Enforcement Officer a properly completed Petition for Hearing and Consideration
of Action Application.
   C.   Application for Appeal. An application for an appeal must be filed in
writing with the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer. Said application will
contain such information as the Board of Adjustment may, by rule, require.
   D.   Imminent Peril to Life and Property. An appeal properly filed and
accepted will stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from
unless the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer certifies to the Board of
Adjustment, within 24 hours after the application for the appeal has been filed
and accepted by them, that by reason of acts stated in the certificate a stay
would, in their opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property.
   E.   Hearing on Application. Upon acceptance in proper form of the
application referred to in Section 170.34(3) above by the Building and Zoning
Enforcement Officer, the Board of Adjustment will hold at least one public
hearing on the appeal within 30 calendar days from the date of acceptance of
the application, subject to the provisions of Section 170.34(3).
   F.   Notice of Hearing. Notice of the time and place of such public hearing

      (1)   Published at least once, not less than seven calendar days, nor
more than 20 calendar days before the hearing, in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City.
      (2)   Said notice will also be delivered by certified mail not less than
seven calendar days, nor more than 20 calendar days, before the hearing to all
property owners whose property boundaries lie within 200 feet, (inclusive of
any and all public and quasi-public right-of-way distances), of the boundaries
of the property upon which the use, or structure, is located that is the
subject of the appeal.
      (3)   No less than seven working days prior to the public hearing on a
petition requesting an appeal, the applicant shall post a notice sign on or
near the property upon which the application is being made and shall remove and
return the sign immediately following the public hearing on the application.
The sign will be provided to the applicant by the Board Secretary upon receipt
of a signed deposit, which shall be refunded if the sign is returned in good
condition within seven working days of the date of the decision on the
application.
   G.   Findings on Appeals. In exercising its appellate power, the Board of
Adjustment may reverse, or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order,
requirement, decision, or determination appealed from and may make any such
order, requirement, decision, or determination as it so deems necessary, and to
that end will have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.
8.   Special Exceptions.
   A.   Authority. The development and administration of this Zoning Code is
based upon the division of the City into zoning districts in which the use of
land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in
relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that
there are certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot
be properly classified in any particular district or districts, without
consideration in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land
and of the public need for the particular use at the particular locations. To
that end, the Board of Adjustment may grant special exceptions to the strict
interpretation of this Zoning Code in harmony with its general purpose and
intent only in specific instances hereinafter set forth and only in accordance
with the standards hereinafter prescribed. Such special exceptions fall into
two categories:
      (1)   Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public
interest; and,
      (2)   Uses entirely private in character but of such a nature that their
operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon
neighboring property or public facilities.
   B.   Initiation of Special Exceptions. Consideration of a special exception
affecting a particular property may be requested by any person having a
freehold interest in land, a possessory interest entitled to exclusive
possession, or a contractual interest which may become a freehold interest of
an exclusive possessory interest, either of which is specifically enforceable,
by submitting to the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer a properly
completed Petition for Hearing and Consideration of Action.
   C.   Application for Special Exceptions. An application for a special
exception must be filed in writing with the Building and Zoning Enforcement
Officer. Said application will contain such information as the Board of
Adjustment may, by rule, require. The application will include a statement in
writing by the applicant accompanied by adequate evidence showing that the
proposed special exception will, on review, conform to the standards set forth
in Section 170.34(6).
   D.   Hearing on Application. Upon acceptance in proper form of the
application referred to in Section 170.34(3) above by the Building and Zoning
Enforcement Officer, the Board of Adjustment will hold at least one public
hearing on the proposed special exception within 30 calendar days from the date
of acceptance of the application, subject to the provisions of 170.34(3).
   E.   Notice of Hearing. Notice of the time and place of such public hearing
will be:
      (1)   Published at least once, not less than seven calendar days, or more
than 20 calendar days before the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation
in the City.
      (2)   Said notice will also be delivered by certified mail not less than
seven calendar days, nor more than 20 calendar days, before the hearing to all
property owners whose property boundaries lie within 200 feet, (inclusive of
any and all public and quasi-public right-of-way distances), of the boundaries
of the property upon which the use, or structure is located that is the subject
of the proposed special exception.
      (3)   No less than seven working days prior to the public hearing on a
petition requesting a special exception, the applicant shall post a notice sign
on or near the property upon which the application is being made and shall
remove and return the sign immediately following the public hearing on the
application. The sign will be provided to the applicant by the Board Secretary
upon receipt of a signed deposit, which shall be refunded if the sign is
returned in good condition within seven working days of the date of the
decision on the application.
   F.   Standards for Special Exceptions. The Board of Adjustment will not
grant a special exception to the provisions of this Zoning Code, as authorized
in this section, unless there is evidence presented to it in each specific case
that:
      (1)   The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the special
exception will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety,
morals, comfort, or general welfare;
      (2)   The special exception will not be detrimental to the use and
enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already
permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the
neighborhood;
      (3)   The establishment of the special exception will not impede the
normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for
uses permitted in the district;
      (4)   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, or necessary facilities
have been or are being provided;
      (5)   Adequate measures have been, or will be, taken to provide ingress
and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets;
and
      (6)   The special exception will, in all other respects, conform to the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such
regulations may, in each instance, be modified by the Board of Adjustment.
   G.   Conditions and Guarantees. Prior to the granting of any special
exception, the Board of Adjustment may stipulate such conditions and
restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance, and
operation of the special exception as it deems necessary for the protection of
the public interest and to secure compliance with the standards and
requirements specified in Section 170.34(8). In all cases in which special
exceptions are granted with conditions or restrictions, the Board of Adjustment
may require such evidence and guarantees, as it deems necessary, to insure that
the conditions or restrictions stipulated in connection therewith are being and
will be complied with. Said conditions or restrictions, if imposed, must be
adhered to and failure to do so will automatically and immediately cause the
special exception to be revoked.
   H.   Findings on Special Exceptions. All decisions by the Board of
Adjustment on requests for special exceptions must be supplemented with a
written finding of fact stating the conformity or nonconformity, as the case
may be, of their decision with the standards for special exceptions set forth
in this article.
   I.   Effective Date(s) and Revocation of Special Exceptions. In addition to
the provisions of Section 170.34(8), and unless otherwise specified, special
exceptions granted become effective immediately and will be valid for a period
no longer than six months from the date of such decision and will automatically
be revoked unless the special exception is fully and completely established
during such period or unless otherwise specified in the Board’s official action
granting the special exception.
   J.   Effect of Denial of Special Exception Request or Voluntary Withdrawal
of Petition. No application for a special exception that has been denied
wholly, or in part, by the Board of Adjustment, or that has been voluntarily
withdrawn by the petitioner, will be resubmitted for consideration, in its
original form, for a period of at least one year from the date of said order of
denial or the date of the withdrawal request, except on the grounds of new
evidence found to be valid by the Board of Adjustment. This section does not
preclude any person from submitting a new, modified application for
substantially the same special exception. Modified could mean any one of the
following: a new petitioner, different or conditional use, altered structural
or special features, etc.
9.   Other Conditions By the Board of Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment may
also conduct hearings on and consider action on the following items on the
following items:
   A.   Interpretation of Zoning District Map. Where the application of the
rules for the interpretation of district boundaries contained in Sections
170.12 and
170.34 leaves a reasonable doubt as to the boundary between two districts the
Board of Adjustment will interpret the map in such a way as to carry out the
intent and purposes of this Zoning Code.
   B.   Temporary Uses and Permits. The Board of Adjustment may issue a permit
for the temporary use of a building or premises in any district for a purpose
or use that does not conform to the regulations prescribed by this Code,
provided that such use is of a true temporary nature and does not involve the
erection of substantial structures. Such permit may be granted in the form of a
temporary and immediately revocable permit for not more than one 12-month
period, subject to such conditions as will safeguard the public health, safety,
convenience, and general welfare.
   C.   Certain Uses Located in Industrial Districts. In determining whether
certain uses will be located in an I-1 or an I-2 District, the Board of
Adjustment will give due regard to the nature and condition of all adjacent
uses and structures, and the consistency therewith of the proposed use and
development. Before authorizing a use in an industrially-zoned district, the
Board will determine whether the proposed use would be hazardous, harmful,
noxious, offensive, or a nuisance to the surrounding properties by reason of
noise, smoke, odor, vibration, dust and dirt, cinders, noxious gases, glare and
heat, fire and safety hazards, sewage wastes and pollution, transportation and
traffic, aesthetic, and psychological effects. (See Sections
170.25 and
170.26)

170.37   AMENDMENTS.
1.   Authority. Amendments to this Zoning Code may be necessary, from time to
time, for the purposes of promoting the public health, safety, morals, comfort,
and general welfare, conserving the value of property throughout the City, and
lessening or avoiding congestion in the public streets and highways. The
Council may, from time to time in the manner hereinafter set forth, amend the
regulations imposed in the districts created by this Zoning Code. The Code may
be amended, provided that in all amendments adopted under the authority of this
section, due consideration and allowance(s) will be made for existing
conditions, the conservation of property values, the direction of building
development to the best advantages of the entire community, and the uses to
which the property is devoted at the time of the adoption of such amendment.
Any amendment to the floodplain management regulations of this Code must
receive prior approval from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.
2.   Initiation of Amendment. The Council, Planning and Zoning Commission,
Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer, or any person having a freehold
interest, a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, or a
contractual interest which may become a freehold interest of an exclusive
possessory interest, either of which is specifically enforceable, involving
land within the City, may file an application for an amendment to the district
map, or any person or entity may file an application for an amendment to the
text of this Code with the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer.
3.   Application for Amendment. An application for an amendment must be filed,
in writing, with the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer. Said application
will contain such information as required by the Planning and Zoning
Commission. Such application, when accepted for filing by the Building and
Zoning Enforcement Officer, will be forwarded along with their recommendations
for action, to the Planning and Zoning Commission with the request to hold a
public hearing on said application for amendment.
4.   Hearing on Application. Upon acceptance in proper form of the application
referred to in Section 170.37(3) above by the Building and Zoning Enforcement
Officer, the Planning and Zoning Commission will hold a public hearing on each
amendment application within 30 days from the date of acceptance by the
Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer of the application at such time and
place as will be established by the Planning and Zoning Commission, subject to
the provisions of Section
170.35(3).
5.   Notice of Hearing. Notice of the time and place of any such public hearing
conducted under this section will be published at least once, not less than
seven days, nor more than 20 days before the hearing, in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City. In the case of a proposed amendment to the district
map, said notice will also be delivered by certified mail not less than seven
days, nor more than 20 days, before the hearing to all property owners whose
property boundaries lie within 200 feet, inclusive of any and all public and
quasi-public right-of-way distances, of the boundaries of the property upon
which the proposed amendment is to be considered.
6.   Findings on Amendments and Recommendations of the Planning and Zoning
Commission. Within 30 days after the close of the hearing(s) on a proposed
amendment, the Planning and Zoning Commission will make written findings of
fact and will submit same together with its recommendation(s) to the Council.
Where the purpose and effect of the proposed amendment is to change the zoning
classification of a particular property, the findings of fact and
recommendation(s) will include at least the following information:
   A.   Existing use of property within the general area of the property in
question;
   B.   The zoning classification of property within the general area of the
property in question;
   C.   The suitability of the property in question to the uses permitted under
the existing zoning classification;
   D.   The trend of development, if any, in the general area of the property
in question, including changes, if any, which have taken place since the day
the property in question was placed in its present zoning classification; and,
   E.   Minimum Size of Parcel. A lot, lots, or parcel of land will not qualify
for a zoning amendment unless it possesses 200 feet of frontage and contains
25,000 square feet of area, or adjoins a lot, lots, or parcel of land which
bears the same zoning district classification as the proposed zoning amendment.
   F.   Information and findings specifically addressing PDD proposals;
      (1)   In what respects the proposed PDD plan is consistent with the
stated purposes of the PDD requirements.
      (2)   The extent to which the proposed PDD plan meets the requirements
and standards of the PDD district.
      (3)   The extent to which the proposed PDD plan departs from the zoning
and subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the subject proposal
including, but not limited to, the density, dimensions, area, bulk, and use,
and the reasons why such departures are deemed to be in the public interest.
      (4)   The physical design of the proposed PDD and the manner in which
said design makes adequate provision for public services, provides adequate
control over vehicular traffic, provides for, and protects designated common
open space, and furthers the amenities of light, air, recreation, and visual
enjoyment.
      (5)   The relationship and compatibility of the proposed PDD plan to the
adjacent properties and neighborhood.
      (6)   The desirability of the proposed PDD plan to the physical
development, tax base, and economic well-being of the entire community.
      (7)   The conformity with the intent and spirit of the City’s
Comprehensive Plan.
      (8)   Specific points noted on the PDD plan that have an impact on its
design, function, and visibility in the community.
7.   The Planning and Zoning Commission will not recommend the adoption of a
proposed amendment unless it finds that the adoption of such amendment is in
the public interest and is not solely for the interest of the applicant. The
Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend the adoption of an amendment
changing the zoning classification of the property in question to any higher
classification than that requested by the applicant. (For the purpose of this
Zoning Code, the R-1 District will be considered the highest classification,
and the I-2 District will be considered the lowest classification). Further,
the Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend the conditional adoption of a
zoning classification amendment whereby certain conditions and/or restrictions
may be placed on the structures or uses allowed on the property if the zoning
classification were to be amended.
8.   City Council to Receive Planning and Zoning Commission’s Report. The
Council will not act upon a proposed amendment to this Zoning Code until it
shall have received and formally accepted a written report and recommendation
(s) from the Planning and Zoning Commission on the proposed amendment(s).
9.   Hearing on Application. The Council will hold a public hearing on each
amendment application within 30 days from the date of formal acceptance of the
Planning and Zoning Commission's written report and recommendation(s), subject
to the provisions of Section 170.37, but the hearing may not be held earlier
than the next regularly scheduled Council Meeting following the published
notice.
10.   Notice of Hearing. Notice of the time and place of any such public
hearing conducted under this section will be published at least once, not less
than seven days, nor more than 20 days before the hearing, in a newspaper of
general circulation in the City. In the case of a proposed amendment to the
district map, said notice will also be delivered by certified mail not less
than seven days, nor more than 20 days, before the hearing to all property
owners whose property boundaries lie within 200 feet, inclusive of any and all
public and quasi-public right-of-way distances, of the boundaries of the
property upon which the proposed amendment is to be considered. Supplemental or
additional notices may be published or distributed as the Council may require
from time to time.
11.   Approval or Denial of Application. As mentioned in Section 170.37, the
City Council may approve or deny, or conditionally approve or deny, any
application for any amendment, provided however, that if the Council’s action
(s) varies materially from the Planning and Zoning Commission’s recommendation
(s) or, in the case of a proposed zoning classification amendment, upon the
receipt by the Clerk of a written, signed protest by the property owners of 20
percent or more of the area included in the proposed zoning classification
amendment, or by the property owners of 20 percent or more of the property
which is located within 200 feet, inclusive of any and all public and quasi-
public right-of-way distances, of the exterior boundaries of the property which
is the subject of the proposed zoning classification amendment, such amendment
will not be approved except by the concurring vote of four-fifths of all the
members of the Council on the formal resolution considering said amendment.
(This protest, if filed, must be filed before or at the originally scheduled
public hearing). If the formal resolution considering said amendment is not
approved, the matter and process is complete, and no further action(s) will be
taken. If the formal resolution considering said amendment is approved, then
the final, effective approval of any amendment request occurs only after the
successful passage and adoption of the amending ordinance by a simple majority
of all of the members of the Council.
170.38   ZONING CERTIFICATES AND OCCUPANCY PERMITS.
1.   Zoning Certificates. Except as hereinafter provided, no permit pertaining
to the use of land or buildings will be issued by an officer, department, or
employee of the City unless the application for such permit has been examined
by the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer and has affixed to it an
acknowledgement, indicating that the proposed building or structure complies
with all the provisions of this Code. Any permit or certificate issued in
conflict with the provisions of the Code will be null and void.
   A.   Plats. In order to insure that the building or structure conforms with
the provisions of this code, the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer will
require the following prior to the issuance of a building permit;
      (1)   A plat (original or reproduction thereof), in duplicate of the
piece or parcel of land, lot, lots, block, or blocks drawn to scale showing the
actual dimensions, as certified by a registered land surveyor as a true copy of
the piece or parcel, lot or lots, block, or blocks, or portions thereof,
according to the registered or recorded plat of such land; or,
      (2)   A plat, in duplicate, drawn to a scale in such form as may, from
time to time, be prescribed by the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer
showing the ground area, height, and bulk of the building or structure, the
building lines in relation to lot lines, the use to be made of the building,
structure, or land, and such other information as may be required by the
Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer for the proper enforcement of this
Code.
2.   Occupancy Permits. No building or addition thereto, constructed after the
effective date of this Zoning Code, and no addition to a previously existing
building will be occupied, and no land, vacant on the effective date of this
Zoning Code, will be used for any purpose until an occupancy permit has been
issued. No change in a use, other than that of a permitted use to another
similar permitted use, will be made until an occupancy permit has been issued
by the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer. Every occupancy permit will
indicate that the use or occupancy complies with the provision of this Code.
   A.   Application for Occupancy Permit. Every application for a building
permit will be deemed to be an application for an occupancy permit. Every
application for an occupancy permit for a new use of land where no building
permit is required will be made directly to the Building and Zoning Enforcement
Officer; and,
   B.   Issuance of Occupancy Permit. No occupancy permit for a building or
portion thereof, constructed after the effective date of this Zoning Code, will
be issued until construction has been completed and the premises inspected and
certified by the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer to be in conformity
with the plans and specifications upon which the zoning certificate was based.
      (1)   Pending the issuance of a regular certificate, a temporary
certificate may be issued to be valid for a period not to exceed six months
from its date during the completion of any addition or during partial occupancy
of the premises. Reasons in writing for refusal to issue an occupancy permit
must be forwarded to the applicant no later than three days after the request
for an occupancy permit.
170.39   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
Except as hereinafter provided, no building, structure, or land will be
erected, constructed, reconstructed, occupied, moved, altered, or repaired,
except in conformity with the regulations herein specified for the district in
which it is located. Where the conditions imposed by any provisions of this
Zoning Code upon the:
1.   Use of land or buildings;
2.   Bulk of buildings;
3.   Floor area requirements;
4.   Lot area requirements; and
5.   Yard requirements are either more restrictive or less restrictive than
comparable conditions imposed by any other provisions of this Zoning Code or of
any other law, ordinance, resolution, rule, or regulation of any kind, the
regulations which are more restrictive, or which impose higher standards or
requirements will govern.
The requirements and regulations specified elsewhere in this Zoning Code will
be subject to the additional requirements, exceptions, modifications, and
interpretations contained in this section.
170.40   MISCELLANEOUS LOT PROVISIONS.
1.   Minimum Street Frontage for Lots. No lot will be created after the
adoption of this Zoning Code unless it abuts at least 60 feet on a public
street except as otherwise provided for herein.
2.   Lots Without Street Frontage. Every structure or group of structures, and
every use or group of uses, will be located upon a lot. Where unique land
planning designs are employed in a planned development district to conserve the
natural character of the land or to create afunctional or compatible
arrangement of structures or uses, a lot which does not abut upon a public or
private street may be permitted provided that:
   A.   Adequate provision is made for free access to the lot for the property
owner, or in the case of a nonresidential lot, for those persons who would
normally require access to the lot.
   B.   Adequate provision is made for the unobstructed access of firefighting
services, police protection, mail carrier letter service, rubbish collection,
and other governmental services.
   C.   Adequate provision is made for the extension and maintenance of public
and private utility services.
   D.   The arrangement will not contribute toward congestion in nearby streets
as a result of delivery services, lack of guest parking, or other reasons.
3.   Lot of Record. In any residentially zoned district on a lot of record at
the time of enactment of this Zoning Code, a single-family dwelling may be
established regardless of the size of the lot, provided all other requirements
of this Zoning Code are complied with. However, where two or more vacant and
contiguous substandard recorded lots are held in common ownership, they may be
combined into zoning lots which require a restrictive covenant and agreement
not to sever form and will thereafter be maintained in common ownership and
will be so joined and developed for the purpose of forming an effective and
conforming zoning lot. For the purpose of this section, the razing of a
building on a substandard lot will constitute the formation of a vacant lot.
4.   Division of Zoning Lot. No improved zoning lot will hereafter be divided
into two or more zoning lots unless all improved zoning lots, resulting from
each such division, conform with all the applicable regulations of the zoning
district in which the property is located.
5.   Two Uses on a Lot. Where two or more permitted or special uses, each
requiring a minimum lot area, are provided in the same building or on the same
lot, the required lot area will be the sum of the areas required for each use
individually.
6.   Number of Buildings and/or Uses on a Zoning Lot. Except in the case of
Planned Development Districts (PDD), or as otherwise allowed herein, not more
than one detached, principal building or use will be located on any one zoning
lot of record.
7.   Lots Unserved by Sewer. In any residentially zoned district where public
sanitary sewer is not reasonably available, one single-family detached dwelling
may be constructed, provided, the otherwise specified lot area and width
requirements will be a minimum of 20,000 square feet, and 100 feet
respectively, subject to the suitability of the lot for on-site sewerage
disposal, and provided the housing meets all requirements of the Iowa
Department of Public Health.
8.   Attached Accessory Structures. Construction of an accessory structure,
that is attached or adjoining the principal building, must be constructed of a
comparable, similar, or complimentary material as the adjacent or adjoining
principal building.
170.41   USE OR REDUCTION OF REQUIRED YARDS.
No lot, yard, court, parking area, or other open space will be so reduced in
area or dimension as to make any such area or dimension less than the minimum
required by this Zoning Code, and, if already less than the minimum required,
it will not be further reduced, except for additional right-of-way acquisition
by the City. No required open space provided about any building or structure
will be included as part of any open space required for another building or
structure.
170.42   CONVERSION OF DWELLINGS.
The conversion of any building into a dwelling, or the conversion of any
dwelling so as to accommodate an increased number of dwelling units or
families, will be permitted only within a district in which a new building for
similar occupancy would be permitted under this Zoning Code, and only when the
resulting occupancy will comply with the requirements governing new
construction in such district with respect to minimum lot size, lot area per
dwelling unit, dimensions of yards and other open spaces, and off-street
parking. Each conversion will be subject also to such further requirements as
may be specified herein.
170.43   SCREENING AND FENCING.

will be constructed thereon, consisting of two or more attached dwelling units
with each unit having a separate access and utility services.
3.   The division of the lot or parcel into two or more parcels will be in such
a manner as to result in one single-family dwelling unit being located on
either side of a common boundary line(s) with the common wall(s), floor(s),
and/or ceiling(s) located on the common boundary line(s) between the attached,
single-family dwelling units.
4.   Prior to the division into two or more parcels, there will be recorded in
the County Recorder’s Office, restrictive and protective covenants, agreement

liable and responsible for the maintenance and repair of the common elements
including, but not limited to, utilities, water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer,
easements and driveways, yards, green spaces, and other common areas, all to
the point of division.
5.   The two-family and single-family attached dwellings will, in all respects
other than the division thereof, be considered as any other single-family
dwelling and will meet all requirements pertaining thereto with express
understanding that nothing herein will be construed to allow other than
residential use of the resulting parcels of real estate in the event that the
attached dwelling(s) are partially or totally damaged or destroyed.
6.   The above requirements notwithstanding, no residential structure may be
constructed across any lot line except in the case of immediately adjoining
lots where the property owner(s) execute and record a Restrictive Covenant and
Agreement Not to Sever form. For the purpose of administering this section, the
adjoining residential lots shall be considered as one lot with respect to
establishing yard and set-back provisions. The authorizations and provisions of
this section apply only to proposed construction located on those lots which
were platted prior to June 20, 1983, which are immediately adjacent to and
adjoining each other, (sharing a common side lot line), for a distance of not
less than 100 feet, and which, when considered as one lot, will not create a
double-frontage lot as defined herein.
170.51   DETACHED ACCESSORY BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES, OR USES.
1.   Time of Construction. No detached, accessory building, structure, or use

principal building or use to which it is accessory except when the accessory
building, structure, or use is constructed in accordance with the following:
   A.   Is built on a residential lot that is immediately adjoining that lot
upon which is located the principal structure or use and is not separated, in
any way, by an alley, street, easement of any sort, or any other public way or
any fence or other such structure.
   B.   The above-referenced adjoining residential lot is owned by the owner of
the lot upon which is located the principal use or building only, and the owner
(s) execute and record a Restrictive Covenant and Agreement Not to Sever form.
For the purpose of administering this section, the adjoining lots shall be
considered as one lot with respect to establishing yard and set-back
provisions.
   C.   The proposed building, structure, or use is intended to be used solely
for the private and non- commercial benefit of the adjoining property owner.
   D.   At such time as the lot, upon which is constructed an accessory use or
structure, is no longer under the joint ownership of the person owning the lot
immediately adjacent to it, then the accessory use or structure will cease to
exist and the City may cause said use or structure to be removed by whatever
legal means may be available for said remedy at the property owner’s expense.
   E.   Percentage of Required Yard Occupied. No detached accessory building or
buildings will occupy more than 30 percent of the area of a required yard.
   F.   Height of Accessory Buildings. No detached accessory building or
structure will exceed the maximum height as specified for each zoning district.

immediately adjoining lot(s) as specified in Section
170.55, will not exceed the total ground floor area of the related principal
building or structure in question nor more than seven percent of the total lot
area(s), whichever is larger. Any detached accessory building shall be stick-
built with a permanent foundation, or the detached accessory building must be
designed, manufactured, and originally intended to be used as an accessory
structure and have a permanent foundation. There shall not be more than two
detached accessory buildings associated with any one principal building at any
time. No detached accessory building shall be used as a residence or dwelling
unit.
   H.   Location on Lot. No detached accessory building or structure located in
a residential district will be erected in any front yard and will be so located
as to conform with all other applicable set-back requirements. In any
residential district, no detached accessory building or structure shall be
closer than eight feet to the principal building, and for each foot over 20
feet in length that the wall of an accessory structure, (except swimming
pools), parallels and is next to the principal building, the required distance
between the structures shall be increased by an additional one foot.

as the use for which provided, except as otherwise specifically provided for
herein:
   A.   Parking in Yards –
      (1)   Residential Districts. In any residentially zoned districts, no
vehicle will be parked in any yard except upon a permanently constructed
driveway, built in accordance to provisions elsewhere in this Code. Parking
lots may be allowed in residentially zoned districts if authorized by the Board
of Adjustment and provided that the district does not require that the front
yard be landscaped and devoted to another use, and further provided that the
parking is in accordance with all other Zoning Code provisions.  
      (2)   Commercial and Industrial Districts. In commercial and industrial
districts, no vehicle will be parked in any front yard except upon a
permanently constructed parking lot. Parking lots are allowed in the front yard
of commercial and industrial districts provided that the district does not
require that the front yard be landscaped and devoted to another use, and
further provided that the parking is in accordance with all other Zoning Code
provisions.
   B.   Parkways. No parking will be permitted between the property line and
the curb line or edge of the pavement or roadway in the event no curb exists.
   C.   Combining of Spaces. Off-Street parking space will be provided for each
use. However, two or more uses located on the same zoning lot may jointly
provide for one combined parking facility.
      (1)   Where an off-street parking space is combined and used jointly by
two or more uses having different standards for determining the amount of off-
street parking space required, the parking space will be adequate in area to
provide the sum total of off-street parking space requirements of all such
uses.
      (2)   Where off-street parking space is combined and used jointly by two
or more uses having the same standard for determining the amount of off-street
parking space required, all such uses, for the purposes of this subsection,
will be considered a single unit and the gross floor area of all such uses in
all structures on the same lot or the number of employees of all such uses in
all structures on the same lot as fixed by the applicable standard, will be
taken as a single total for the purpose of determining the amount of off-street
parking space required.
   D.   Sharing of Spaces. Two or more uses may share the same off-street
parking space if the schedules of operation of all such uses are such that none
of the uses sharing the space require the off-street parking space at the same
time as any other use sharing the space. Each such use that is sharing space
will be considered as having provided such shared space individually.
   E.   Special Location Plan Option. Pursuant to the procedures thereinafter
set forth, either part or all of the required off-street parking space may be
located off the lot of the use for which the space is provided, if so granted
by a variance by the Board of Adjustment:

location plan hereunder will be filed with the Building and Zoning Enforcement
Officer by the owner(s) of the entire land area to be included within the
special location plan and the owner or owners of all structures then existing
on said land area and holders of all encumbrances of said land area and
structures then existing on said land area. The application will contain
sufficient evidence to establish to the satisfaction of the Board of Adjustment
that the applicants are the owners and/or encumbrancer of the designated land
and structures and will contain such information and representation required by
this Zoning Code or deemed necessary and will include plans showing the
following details: The location of the uses or structures for which off- street
parking space is required and the location at which the off-street parking
space is to be provided.

parking requirements, parking spaces will be provided on the same basis as
required for the most similar listed uses, or to satisfy the normal parking
demand both as determined by the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer.
   F.   Central Business District (C-2) Parking Provisions. The previous
parking provisions notwithstanding, and acknowledging the opportunities and
challenges associated with providing adequate and suitable off-street parking
in the City’s Central Business District, particularly recognizing, maintaining,
and expanding on the historic character of this area; fully utilizing the
available public parking area on the City’s riverfront levee immediately
adjacent to this area; recognizing and promoting the need for diversity and
balance in the residential and commercial development within this area and the
need for developing adequate parking space to service this development given
the limited size of many of the originally platted lots contained within this
area, the following provisions shall be specifically and only applied to the C-
2 zoning district area that encompasses primarily the Cody Road right-of-way
from Byron Street to May Street. No on-site customer or employee parking is
required.
7.   Special Parking Provisions–Recreational Vehicles, Mobile Homes, Trucks.
Unless otherwise authorized, recreational vehicles of all types, mobile homes,
and trucks will not be parked or stored on any lot occupied by a dwelling or
other structure or on any lot except in accordance with the following
provisions:
   A.   Recreational Vehicles. In residential districts, not more than two
recreational vehicles, as defined in Section
170.07, which are currently licensed and registered to the person or persons
residing on the premises, or on the immediately adjoining lot, may be parked,
or stored on an unenclosed parking space on the premises, or on the immediately
adjoining lot. The recreational vehicle may only be connected to the property’s
water and electrical utilities for charging or loading of the vehicle's
systems. A recreational vehicle will not be occupied while it is stored in any
area within the corporate limits except in a mobile home park authorized under
this Zoning Code or as otherwise provided for herein below.
      (1)   No portion of any recreational vehicle shall extend onto any public
right-of-way.
      (2)   Parking is permitted on residentially zoned property in the side or
rear yards. The parking of recreational vehicles in the side or rear yards must
be done in accordance with the applicable zoning setback requirements.
      (3)   Parking is permitted in the front yard when:
         a.   The recreational vehicle is parked or stored on a permanently
surfaced parking area; and,
         b.   There is insufficient space available to park the recreational
vehicle in the rear or side yard; or,
         c.   There is no reasonable and readily available access to the rear
or side yards.
      (4)   Recreational vehicles may only be parked on vacant residential lots
when:
         a.   The lot is immediately adjoining that lot upon which is located
the principal residence of the currently licensed and registered owner(s) of
the vehicle(s) and the lot is not separated, in any way, by an alley, street,
easement of any sort, or any other public way, or any fence, or other such
structure.
         b.   The above-referenced adjoining residential lot is owned by the
currently licensed and registered owner(s) of the vehicle(s).
         c.   At such time as the lot, upon which recreational vehicle is
parked or stored, is no longer under the joint ownership of the person owning
the lot immediately adjacent to it, then the recreational vehicle must be
removed immediately from said lot and, if not, the City may cause said
recreational vehicle to be removed by whatever legal means may be available for
said remedy at the property owner’s expense.
      (5)   Recreational vehicles shall not be used for the storage of goods,
materials, or equipment other than those items which are considered to be a
part of the vehicle and essential for immediate use.
      (6)   Recreational vehicles may not be used for human occupancy on any
premises outside of a campground or travel trailer park except when used for
construction purposes at a job-site location with the permission of the City.
A contractor’s storage or job trailer must be plainly and visibly labeled with
the contractor’s name, address, phone number, logo, etc. No more than two such
trailers will be allowed on any one construction site at one time unless
otherwise approved in writing by the Council. Such trailers and their location
may be allowed only upon the approval and notification of the City
Administrator or the Council. No mobile home will be used as a contractor’s
storage or job trailer. All such trailers will be removed no later than seven
days after completion of the construction activity.
      (7)   Those properties that are immediately and directly adjacent to and
whose boundaries border the Mississippi River are exempt from the private
property location provisions of this chapter relating to the storage or parking
of watercraft only, (i.e., Canal Shore Drive S.W., West Canal Shore Drive, and
the addresses of 2423, 2429, and 2435 S. Cody Road). Notwithstanding and
including those provisions contained within Section
170.40, any person, firm, corporation, agent, employee, or contractor who
violates the provisions of this specific section will be given notice of such
violation by the City and will be afforded a period of time not to exceed 14
days within which to correct said violation.
   B.   Mobile Home. A mobile home that is not a manufactured home will be
parked or stored only in a mobile home park or mobile home sales area. A mobile
home will not be occupied, either temporarily or permanently, while it is
parked or stored in any area within the incorporated limits except in a mobile
home park or campground as authorized under this Zoning Code.
   C.   Trucks. Unless otherwise provided for herein, no person will park or
store any truck one and one-half tons or larger in any residential district.
Trucks may be parked for the purpose of loading or unloading adjacent to the
place of parking for a period not to exceed 24 hours. The provisions of this
section will apply to school buses but will not apply to City Public Works
Department vehicles parked adjacent to an on-going project, or other vehicles
so designated by the Council.
170.53   SIGNS.
For all provisions relating to signs, their erection, and use, see
Chapter 161.
170.54   ASSIGNMENT OF BUILDING ADDRESSES.
Every new residence, or commercial, or industrial establishment built on any
property in the City subsequent to the date of the adoption of this Zoning
Code, will receive a building address as assigned by the Building and Zoning
Enforcement Officer in accordance with the current City street addressing and
numbering system, unless otherwise modified or granted by specific action of
the Council. (See
Chapter 150)
170.55   BUFFERS, GREENWAYS, AND OPEN SPACES.
A greenway, buffer, or open space reservation will be provided by easement in
all areas of interface between commercial, industrial, and residential zones.
1.   Definitions and Interpretations. For use in this section the following
definitions and interpretations will apply:
Buffer. In addition to definition, a buffer means any land use method that may
ease the effect between one land use and a different land use in the sense of
helping to achieve greater efficiency and economy of land development by
promoting the grouping of those activities which have similar needs and are
compatible, and in the sense of promoting the purpose of this Zoning Code. (See
Section
170.07(2)(K))
Greenway. In addition to the definition, greenway means a type of buffer in
which the use of land is open in the sense of being free of all structures,
parking areas, drives, signs, right-of-ways, easements, and the like, however,
a greenway may be fenced. Greenway easements will be a minimum of 50 feet wide
and may be developed for bicycle or pedestrian traffic and may have benches,
trees, and shrubs, and such uses must be specifically provided for in the
language of the easement. (See Definitions section)
Open Space. Means a type of buffer in which use of land is open in the sense of
being free of buildings only. Open space will be of a determined size and may
yield any desirable open space use (i.e., parks, parking lots, playgrounds,
etc.) (See Section
175.27(3))
2.   Use of Buffers Required. Buffer areas shall be provided when a use is
established in a more intensive zoning district which is adjacent to a less
intensive zoning district consisting of open spaces, greenways, landscaping,
berm fences, and other physical barriers, or some combination of the above, to
reduce the impact of the difference in activity, sound, light, and bulk of the
development within the less intense zone. Buffer areas shall be included and
shown on the site plan and shall include the following as a minimum:
Table of Buffer Requirements
(Distance Requirements Between Districts, in feet)
Table of Buffer Requirements
(Distance Requirements Between Districts, in feet)
    R*   C-1  C-2  C-3  I-1  I-2
R*  NONE 15   25   30   40   50
C-1 15   NONE 15   25   30   40
C-2 25   15   NONE 15   25   40
C-3 30   25   15   NONE 20   30
I-1 40   30   25   20   NONE 15
I-2 50   40   40   30   15   NONE
*Refers to any parcel containing a residential dwelling unit, including
A-1 and RR.
 
   A.   The buffer provision responsibility shall belong to the higher
intensity use when being established next to an existing lower density use.
   B.   When both properties are vacant and un-platted, half of the land
required to provide a buffer shall be provided by each use and the development
of buffer improvements shall be coordinated in conjunction with these
requirements.
   C.   The distance requirements for buffer areas may be reduced by up to 50
percent if an opaque structural barrier, decorative fence, wall, landscaping,
or other similar device or method is employed.
   D.   If landscaping is used as a buffer technique, it shall be capable of
effectively screening headlights, outdoor storage areas, and trash receptacle
areas from abutting uses.
3.   Provision of Greenways, Buffers, or Open Spaces. The provision of yards,
courts, and other open spaces and minimum lot areas legally required for a
building under this Code, will be a continuing obligation of the owner of such
building or of the property on which it is located as long as the building is
in existence. Such open spaces will be completely landscaped with such
aesthetic materials as, but not limited to, trees, shrubbery, and grass, and
continuously maintained. Such open space will be landscaped so as not to
encourage the storage of motor vehicles except as permitted by this Code.
Furthermore, no legally required yards, courts, or other open spaces, or
minimum lot areas allocated to any building, will be by virtue of change of
ownership or for any other reason, be used to satisfy yard, court, or other
open space or minimum lot area requirements for any other building.
4.   Location of Open Spaces. All yards, courts, and other open spaces
allocated to a building or group of buildings will be located on the same
zoning lots as such buildings or group of buildings are located.
170.56   CAMPGROUNDS.
The purpose of this section is to regulate campgrounds and travel trailer parks
in the City, and to provide the minimum standard specifications for the
construction, installation, maintenance, and operation of said parks. Further,
it is unlawful for any person to hereafter establish, maintain, conduct, or
otherwise operate within the City limits, any campground or travel trailer
park, unless such person will first obtain a special exception and other
approval for the use of the described area as provided for herein. Recreational
vehicles, tents, or other portable dwellings may not be used for human
occupancy on any premises outside of a campground or travel trailer park,
except when used for construction purposes at a job-site location with the
permission of the City.
1.   Annual License and Inspection and Fees. The annual license fee for each
campground will be set by resolution by the Council, (or any fractional portion
thereof), and will be due and payable to the Clerk by the licensee on or before
the last day of January of each year. Prior to the issuance of a license, the
owner will provide to the Clerk a statement by the County Treasurer stating
that payment of all fees and charges as required by Chapter 435 of the Code of
Iowa, have been paid. The campground operator will be required to report to the
Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer and the Building Inspector every year
at least 30 days prior to the opening for business of the park to inspect the
various facilities of the campground, and to issue to the operator of said
campground a notice showing compliance with the regulations of the City. The
charge for the inspection will be borne by the campground operator at the rate
per inspection set by resolution of the Council.
2.   Application for License to Operate a Campground. Any person desiring to
operate or expand a campground will first file an application for a campground
license with the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer. The application will

the Code of Iowa. The Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer will forward said
application and related materials to the Police Chief and Fire Chief for their
review and consideration and, when they have rendered their decision the
application materials will then be forwarded to the Planning and Zoning
Commission and Council for final review, consideration, and action thereon.
2.   Design, Development, and Maintenance Standards. The following listed
standards will be used in the design, development, and maintenance of
campground/parks:
   A.   A maximum of 15 recreational vehicles or tents will be permitted on any
acre of ground, including streets, within a campground.
   B.   The site, lot, or tract of land upon which the park is located, will be
well drained and graded to insure adequate and proper water drainage and to
eliminate the creation of pools of standing or stagnant water.

insect and rodent control on the premises of the park.
   L.   The park operator will be required to keep an accurate and complete
record of the overnight guests harbored in the park. Said records will include
the guest’s name, address, auto license number, and the year and make of car.
Also, the date of arrival and departure. This record will be shown upon request
to any duly authorized representative of any law enforcement agency.
   M.   No guest will stay in a travel trailer longer than 14 days, with
exceptions being made for sickness within the party or equipment breakdown of
the guest’s auto or trailer, in which case, another week will be allowed.
   N.   The park will be lighted at night with not less than 200-watt lamps at
intervals of 100 feet, or equivalent lighting approved by the City. Lamps must
be located at least 15 feet above the ground.

contained aircraft type units will be maintained by the park operator. Said
unit(s) will be conveniently located for units entering or leaving the park.
These facilities will be inspected by the City at least once a year. The
campground will be serviced by the public sewer system of the City or by a
private disposal system as approved by the City. All sewage disposal apparatus
including appurtenances thereto, will be provided, maintained, and operated in
such a manner so as not to create a nuisance or health hazard. All plumbing
provided in the campground will comply with State laws and local ordinances
governing plumbing.
   Q.   An adequate system of enclosed refuse and garbage collection and
necessary containers, therefore, will be provided by the campground operator
and full use will be made of these services available for waste and garbage
disposal. It will be the responsibility of the campground operator to provide
such adequate service as may be required by the City.
3.   All requirements with respect to expansions or additions to existing parks
will be with respect to said additions or expansion and will not require
anything with respect to parks existing as of the adoption date of this Zoning
Code, except as specifically provided for in this chapter, which would not have
been required in the absence of such addition or expansion.
170.57   SITE PLANS REQUIRED FOR UNDEVELOPED PARCELS.
1.   Site Plans - Purpose and Review Applicability.
   A.   Purpose. In accordance with the Comprehensive Plan of the City, it is
essential that new developments on currently undeveloped land and substantial
improvements made to existing properties meet established minimum standards for
the design of such developments, to protect existing developments, to insure
adequate provisions for public or private utilities, such as sewer, water, gas,
electricity, storm sewers and streets, and promote the health, safety, and
general welfare of the public.
   B.   Review Applicability. A site plan review is required whenever a person,
firm, corporation, or any other entity wishes to construct any structure or
make any improvements of any nature to a previously undeveloped tract of land
for any purpose other than for the construction of or improvements to a one or
two-family, residential use, or whenever a person, firm, corporation, or any
other entity wishes to construct any structure or make any improvements of any
nature to an existing, improved tract of land where the proposed use of the
tract of land will change or where the proposed construction or improvements:
      (1)   Significantly changes or alters the size or structure of the
building,
      (2)   Significantly changes or alters pedestrian or vehicular traffic
flow or parking requirements, either on or off-site, or
      (3)   Substantially increases the capacity or activity of the current
building or site.
If the proposed use is a principal permitted use within that zoning district,
the Planning and Zoning Commission will review the site plan. For special
permitted uses, the site plan will be reviewed by the Commission only after a
special exception has been considered and issued by the Board of Adjustment.
(See Section
170.34(3)(I))
2.   Application Review and Consideration Procedures. The site plan review
application, and consideration procedures will be the same as those used for
amendments to this Zoning Code, as listed in Section
170.34(3).
3.   Site Plan Review Standards. The standards of site design listed below are
intended only as minimum requirements so that the general development pattern
in the City may be adjusted to a wide variety of circumstances and topography,
and to insure reasonable and orderly growth in the City.
   A.   All proposed developments will conform to the land use policies of the
Comprehensive Plan of the City, the subdivision regulations and procedures,
where applicable; such other City ordinances as may pertain to such
developments; and any applicable rules and regulations of the Department of
Transportation, the Department of Health, the Department of Natural Resources,
other agencies of the State, and County.
   B.   Internal roads and streets will be constructed to accommodate the
traffic generated. Entrances and exits on to public streets will not unduly
increase congestion or traffic hazards on the public streets and the proposed
site.
   C.   The proposed development will be designed with appropriate regard for
topography, surface drainage, natural drainage-ways and streams, wooded areas,
and other naturally sensitive areas which lend themselves to protection from
degradation.
   D.   The proposed development will be designed with adequate water supply
and distribution systems and sewage treatment facilities and storm water drains
and structures necessary to protect the public health and welfare by not
overloading existing public utilities. Except when waived by the Council,
runoff from development will not be outletted into drainage facilities in
excess of the existing runoff prior to development.
   E.   The proposed development will be designed, and the buildings and
improvements will be located within the tract or parcel in such a manner as not
to unduly diminish or impair the use and enjoyment of adjoining or surrounding
property. And to such end, the developer will provide for such fences,
landscaping, screening, and other improvements as are proper and necessary to
buffer the proposed use from the existing or potential surrounding land uses.
   F.   The proposed development will be designed so as not to unduly increase
the public danger of fire, explosion, and other safety hazards to the general
public and the persons residing or working in adjoining or surrounding
property.
4.   Required Information on Site Plan(s). The purpose of the site plan is to
delineate the information needed by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the
Council to determine whether the proposed development meets the requirements of
this section and complies with the standards listed in Section
170.57(3).

developed according to the approved site development plan except where
authorized changes are permitted. The approved site development plan and
supporting data will be binding on the applicants, their successors, grantees,
and assigns. Any site development work, including structures, landscaping, and
any other improvements, considered and approved by the City under the site
review process must be fully completed, and any and all site developments and
improvements must be capable of being fully utilized for their intended purpose
(s), no later than 18 months from the date of the City’s approval of such plan,
unless some other time-frame is specified in the City’s formal approval. If the
site development work as approved has not commenced or is not fully completed,
(as specified above), within the above-stated time-frame, a Stop Work Order
will be issued by the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer, at which time
all site development work will cease on the site, and the site plan must be
resubmitted to the City, pursuant to the requirements of this section, for
their further review and reconsideration. No further site development work will
be permitted on the site until such time as the City has reviewed and re-
approved the site plan.
   B.   Major Changes. A change in the approved site development plan which
alters the concept or intent of the development including a change in the
configuration, increase in floor area or the height of buildings, an increase
in intensity, a reduction of proposed open space, a change in road locations or
standards, or other major changes, will be approved only by submission of a new
site plan in accordance with the procedures as previously set forth for the
approval of site development plans.
   C.   Minor Changes. The Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer may approve
minor changes in the site development plan which do not change the concept or
intent of the development.
   D.   Approved Plans Superseded by Approved Revised Plans. All approved site
development plans superseded by an approved revised site development plan will
be considered to be null and void at the time of approval of the revised plan.
6.   Fees. At the time an application and site development plan proposal are
filed with the City and prior to any consideration by the City, the applicant
will remit a site plan review fee in accordance with the fee schedule as listed
in the Petition for Hearing and Consideration of Action application form.
170.58   HARBORING AND MAINTAINING LIVESTOCK.
The harboring and maintaining of livestock is only permitted in the General
Agricultural and Rural Residential Districts where such activities in said
district are no closer than 500 feet to the nearest residential dwelling other
than that used by the party(s) conducting said activities.
170.59   WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FACILITIES.
The purpose of this section is to establish general guidelines for the siting
of wireless communications towers and antennas. The goals of these provisions
are to:
1.   Purpose.
   A.   Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts
of towers and antennas;
   B.   Encourage the location of towers in non-residential areas;
   C.   Minimize the total number of towers throughout the community;
   D.   Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as a
primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers;
   E.   Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent
possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal;
   F.   Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that
minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas through careful
design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques;
   G.   Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to
provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently;
   H.   Consider the public health and safety of communication towers; and
   I.   To avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
through engineering and careful siting of tower structures.
In furtherance of these goals, the City shall give due consideration to the
master plan, zoning map, existing land uses, and environmentally sensitive
areas in approving sites for the location of towers and antennas.
2.   Applicability. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to the
following:
   A.   All new towers or antennas constructed or placed in City shall be
subject to these regulations, except as provided in Paragraphs B-D shown below.
   B.   This section shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any
antenna, that is under 70 feet in height and is owned and operated by a
federally-licensed amateur radio station operator or is used exclusively for
receive-only antennas.
   C.   Preexisting towers and preexisting antennas shall not be required to
meet the requirements of this chapter, other than the requirements of Sections
170.59(8) and 170.59(9).
   D.   For purposes of implementing this chapter, an AM array, consisting of
one or more tower units and supporting ground systems which function as one AM
broadcasting antenna, shall be considered one tower. Measurements for setbacks
and separation distances shall be measured from the outer perimeter of the
towers included in the AM array. Additional tower units may be added within the
perimeter of the AM array by right.
3.   Principal or Accessory Use. Antennas and towers may be considered either
principal or accessory uses. A different existing use of an existing structure
on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on
such lot.
4.   Lot Size. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower
or antenna complies with district development regulations including, but not
limited to, setback requirements, lot-coverage requirements, and other such
requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the
antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lot.
5.   Inventory of Existing Sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower
shall provide to the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer an inventory of
its existing towers, antennas, or sites approved for towers or antennas, that
are either within the jurisdiction of City or within one mile of the border
thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design
of each tower. The Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer may share such
information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or
special use permits under this Zoning Code or other organizations seeking to
locate antennas within the jurisdiction of City, provided, however that the
Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer is not, by sharing such information, in
any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable.
6.   Aesthetics. Towers and antennas shall meet the following requirements:
   A.   Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to
any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce
visual obtrusiveness.
   B.   At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures
shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and
landscaping that will blend them into the natural setting and surrounding
buildings.
   C.   If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the
antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral
color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the
supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as
visually unobtrusive as possible.
7.   Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the
FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the lighting
alternatives and design chosen must cause the least disturbance to the
surrounding views.
8.   State or Federal Requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current
standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the
State or federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas.
If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers
and antennas governed by this section shall bring such towers and antennas into
compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the
effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a different compliance
schedule is mandated by the controlling State or federal agency. Failure to
bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and
regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at
the owner’s expense.
9.   Building Codes; Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity of
towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance
with standards contained in applicable State or local building codes and the
applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries
Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the City
concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and
constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to
the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into
compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into compliance
within said 30 days shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or
antenna at the owner’s expense.
10.   Measurement. For purposes of measurement, tower setbacks and separation
distances shall be calculated and applied to facilities located in the City
irrespective of municipal and County jurisdictional boundaries.
11.   Non-Essential Services. Towers and antennas shall be regulated and
permitted pursuant to this chapter and shall not be regulated or permitted as
essential services, such as, but not limited to public utilities or private
utilities.
12.   Filing of Franchises. Owners or operators of towers or antennas shall
certify that all franchises required by law for the construction and/or
operation of a wireless communication system in City have been obtained and
shall file a copy of all required franchises with the Building and Zoning
Enforcement Officer.
13.   Additional Public Notice Required. For purposes of this section, any
special use request, variance, or other request, shall be accompanied by a
public notice which shall be given to all abutting property owners and all
property owners of properties that are located within the corresponding
separation distance listed in Section 170.59(20)(I)(2), Table 2, in addition to
any notice otherwise required by this Code.
14.   Signs. No advertising signs shall be allowed on an antenna or tower.
15.   Buildings and Support Equipment. Buildings and support equipment
associated with antennas or towers shall comply with the requirements of
Section 170.59(21).
16.   Multiple Antenna/Tower Plan. The City encourages the users of towers and
antennas to submit a single application for approval of multiple towers or
antenna sites. Applications for approval of multiple sites shall be given
priority in the review process.
17.   Permitted Uses. The uses listed in this section are deemed to be
permitted uses and shall not require administrative approval or a special use
permit. The following uses are specifically permitted:
   A.   Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased, or otherwise
controlled by the City, provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna or
tower has been approved by City.
18.   Administratively Approved Uses. The following provisions shall govern the
issuance of administrative approvals for towers and antennas.
   A.   The Planning and Zoning Commission and the Council shall consider
requests for the siting of towers or antennas and the uses listed in this
section, following the procedures of the site plan review process, see Section
170.57.
   B.   Each tower or antenna siting applicant applying for administrative
approval shall apply to the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer providing
the information and application fee as set forth in the site plan review
process, see Section
170.57.
   C.   The Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer shall review the
application for administrative approval and determine if the proposed use
complies with the requirements of this Code.
   D.   In connection with the consideration of any tower or antenna siting
proposal, any zoning district setback requirements may be waived by up to 50
percent, if shared siting and uses are presented for the City’s consideration.
   E.   In connection with any such approval, and in order to encourage the use
of mono-poles, the reconstruction of an existing tower to mono-pole
construction may be allowed.
19.   List of Approved Locations and Uses. The following locations and uses may
be considered for siting:
   A.   Locating a tower or antenna, including the placement of additional
buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said tower or
antenna, may be considered in any A-1, RR, C-3, I-1, or I-2 zoning districts.
   B.   Locating antennas on existing structures or towers in accordance with
the following:
      (1)   Any antenna which is not attached to a tower may be approved by the
Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer as an accessory use to any commercial
or industrial structure, provided:
         a.   The antenna does not extend more than 30 feet above the highest
point of the structure.
         b.   The antenna complies with all applicable FCC and FAA regulations.
         c.   The antenna complies with all applicable building codes.
      (2)   An antenna which is attached to an existing tower may be approved
by the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer without further site plan review
by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Council, and, to minimize adverse
visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of towers,
collocation of antennas by more than one carrier on existing towers shall take
precedence over the construction of new towers, provided such collocation is
accomplished in a manner consistent with the following:
         a.   A tower which is modified or reconstructed to accommodate the
collocation of an additional antenna shall be of the same tower type as the
existing tower, unless the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer allows
reconstruction as a mono-pole.
      (3)   Height.
         a.   An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller height,
not to exceed 30 feet over the tower’s existing height, to accommodate the
collocation of an additional antenna.
         b.   The height change referred to in Section 170.59(19)(C) above may
only occur one time per communication tower.
         c.   The additional height referred to in Section 170.59(19)(B)(3)(a)
above shall not require any additional distance separation as set forth herein.
The tower’s pre-modification height shall be used to calculate such distance
separations.
      (4)   Onsite Location.
         a.   A tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate the collocation of
an additional antenna may be moved onsite within 50 feet of its existing
location.
         b.   After a tower is rebuilt to accommodate collocation, only one
tower may remain on the site.
         c.   A relocated onsite tower shall continue to be measured from the
original tower location for purposes of calculating separation distances
between towers pursuant to Section 170.59(20)(I). The location of a tower
hereunder shall in no way be deemed to cause a violation of Section 170.59(20)
(I).
         d.   The onsite relocation of a tower which comes within the
separation distances to residential units or residentially zoned lands as
established in Section 170.59(20)(I) shall only be permitted when approved by
the Council.
   C.   Installing a cable microcell network through the use of multiple low-
powered transmitters or receivers attached to existing wireline systems, such
as conventional cable or telephone wires, or similar technology that does not
require the use of towers.
20.   Special Exceptions Required. The following provisions shall govern the
considerations of granting special exceptions for towers or antennas by the
Board of Adjustment:
   A.   If the tower or antenna is not a permitted use or permitted to be
approved administratively pursuant to this chapter, then a special exception
shall be required for the construction of a tower or the placement of an
antenna in all zoning districts.
   B.   Applications for special exceptions under this section shall be subject
to the procedures and requirements of Section
170.34(8) of the Zoning Code, except as herein.
   C.   In granting a special exception, the Board of Adjustment may impose
conditions to the extent the Board of Adjustment concludes such conditions are
necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower on adjoining
properties.
   D.   Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant submits,
whether civil, mechanical, or electrical, shall be certified by a licensed
professional engineer.

drawings of the proposed tower and any other structures, topography, parking,
and other information deemed by the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer to
be necessary to assess compliance with this Zoning Code.
      (2)   Legal description of the parent tract and leased parcel (if
applicable).
      (3)   The setback distance between the proposed tower and the nearest
residential unit, platted residentially zoned properties, and un-platted
residentially zoned properties.
      (4)   The separation distance from other towers described in the
inventory of existing sites submitted pursuant to Section 170.59(20)(E) shall
be shown on an updated site plan or map. The applicant shall also identify the
type of construction of the existing tower(s) and the owner or operator of the
existing tower(s), if known.
      (5)   A landscape plan showing specific landscape materials.
      (6)   Method of fencing and finished color and, if applicable, the method
of camouflage and illumination.

proposed new tower.
      (11)   A description of the feasible location(s) of future towers or
antennas within the City based upon existing physical, engineering,
technological, or geographical limitations in the event the proposed tower is
erected.
   F.   Factors Considered in Granting Special Exceptions for Towers. In
addition to any standards for consideration of special exception applications
pursuant to Section
170.34, the Board of Adjustment shall consider the following factors in
determining whether to issue a special exception, although the Board of
Adjustment may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or more of
these criteria if the Board of Adjustment concludes that the goals of this Code
are better served thereby:
      (1)   Height of the proposed tower.
      (2)   Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential
district boundaries;
      (3)   Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
      (4)   Surrounding topography;
      (5)   Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
      (6)   Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual
obtrusiveness;
      (7)   Proposed ingress and egress; and
      (8)   Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or
alternative technologies not requiring the use of towers or structures, as
discussed in Section 170.59(20)(G) below of this ordinance.
   G.   Availability of Suitable Existing Towers, Other Structures, or
Alternative Technology. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant
demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the Board of Adjustment that no
existing tower, structure, or alternative technology that does not require the
use of towers or structures can accommodate the applicant's a proposed antenna.
An applicant shall submit information requested by the Board of Adjustment
related to the availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or
alternative technology. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing
tower, structure, or alternative technology can accommodate the applicant’s
proposed antenna may consist of any of the following:
      (1)   No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic
area which meet applicant’s engineering requirements.
      (2)   Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet
applicant’s engineering requirements.
      (3)   Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural
strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment.
      (4)   The applicant’s proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the
antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the
applicant’s proposed antenna.
      (5)   The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in
order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or
structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development
are presumed to be unreasonable.
      (6)   The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors
that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
      (7)   The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does
not require the use of towers or structures, such as a cable microcell network
using multiple low-powered transmitters or receivers attached to a wire-line
system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new tower or
antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable.
   H.   Setbacks. The following setback requirements shall apply to all towers
for which a special exception is required; provided, however, that the Board of
Adjustment may reduce the standard setback requirements if the goals of this
chapter would be better served thereby:
      (1)   Towers must be set back a distance equal to 100 percent of the
height of the tower from any adjoining lot line.
      (2)   Guys and accessory buildings must satisfy the minimum zoning
district setback requirements.
   I.   Separation. The following separation requirements shall apply to all
towers and antennas for which a special use permit is required; provided,
however, that the Board of Adjustment may reduce the standard separation
requirements if the goals of this chapter would be better served thereby:
      (1)   Tower separation from off-site uses or designated areas shall be
measured from the base of the tower to the lot line of the off-site uses or
designated areas and shall comply with the minimum standards as specified in
Table 1, except as otherwise provided in Table 1.

than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate anti-
climbing device; provided however, that the Board of Adjustment may waive such
requirements, as it deems appropriate.
   K.   Landscaping. All applicants shall abide by these landscaping
requirements, or those found in Section 170.61, whichever is greater, provided,
however, that the Board of Adjustment may waive such requirements if the goals
of this chapter would be better served thereby.
      (1)   Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant
materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from property
used for residences. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at
least four feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound.
      (2)   Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site
shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as
towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property
perimeter may be sufficient buffer.
21.   Buildings or Other Equipment Storage.
   A.   Antennas Mounted on Structures or Rooftops. The equipment cabinet or
structure used in association with antennas shall comply with the following:
      (1)   The cabinet or structure shall not contain more than 100 square

Sections 170.59(21)(A) – 170.59(2)(C) above may modified by the Planning and
Zoning Commission or Council, in the case of permitted uses, or by the Board of
Adjustment, in the case of uses permitted by special exception to encourage
collocation.
22.   Removal of Abandoned Antennas and Towers. Any antenna or tower that is
not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered
abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove the same within
90 days of receipt of notice from the City notifying the owner of such
abandonment. Failure to remove an abandoned antenna or tower within said 90
days shall be grounds to remove the tower or antenna at the owner’s expense. If
there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not
become effective until all users cease using the tower.
23.   Nonconforming Uses.
   A.   Not Expansion of Nonconforming Use. Towers that are constructed, and
antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter
shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or
structure.
   B.   Preexisting Towers. Preexisting towers shall be allowed to continue
their usage as they presently exist. Routine maintenance (including replacement
with a new tower of like construction and height) shall be permitted on such

shall be recorded in the County or have any validity until it has been approved
by the Council. Each person, firm, or corporation seeking the Council’s
approval of a map, plat, or subdivision will follow the procedures outlined
herein.
1.   In order to make the most of the opportunities related to the subdivision
and to conserve time, effort, and expense, the owner or subdivider should
consult with the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer prior to the
preparation of the tentative plan of the subdivision. The plan and its
component features shall be consistent with the City’s comprehensive land-use
and other long-range plans.
2.   Requirements of the master street development plan; school and
recreational sites; shopping centers, community facilities; sanitation; water
supply, drainage, and erosion; and relationship to other developments, existing
and proposed in the vicinity, should be determined in advance of the
preparation of the subdivision plan. Consultation should also be held with
those familiar with the economic factors affecting the subdivision. A thorough
estimate of the situation will result in sound decisions with respect to the
form, character, and extent of the proposed subdivision.
3.   Land, which the Planning and Zoning Commission finds to be unsuitable for
subdividing due to flooding or poor drainage characteristics, or topographic
features likely to be harmful to the safety, welfare, and general health of
future residents, will not be subdivided until the objectionable features have
been eliminated, or until adequate safeguards against such hazards are
provided.
In applicable cases, plats will be reviewed by the State Department of Natural
Resources (IDNR) and their findings and recommendations incorporated in the
approval of such plats.

adjacent landowners, of the subdivider plans and advising them that any
drainage tile entering the property that is the subject of the subdivision may
be affected by the development.
   B.   In the event that no field tile exists, or is reasonably expected to
exist, a sworn, certified affidavit must be filed in lieu of notification
documentation.
2.   The following methods of notification will be deemed sufficient compliance
with this subparagraph:
   A.   A return receipt for first class mail containing such notification

the subdivider will submit a written plan for continuation of existing drainage
tile to the City. As a condition for approval of the final plan by the Council,
such plan must be approved by the City Engineer, in writing.
175.12   PUBLIC NOTIFICATION.
At the time of filing, an application will be accompanied by a list of names
and addresses of all those people owning property adjacent to and within 200
feet of any part of the proposed subdivision. The Building and Zoning
Enforcement Officer will notify those property owners listed, by depositing
notices in the U.S. Mail, at least seven days prior to the scheduled date of
the regular Planning and Zoning Commission and Council meetings at which time
said plat is scheduled to be reviewed and considered. These notices will be
delivered by certified mail.
175.13   PREVIOUS SUBDIVISION REFERENCE LIST REQUIRED.
At the time of filing, an application will be accompanied by the subdivider’s
previous subdivision, (or other developmental), experience and reference

175.15   PRELIMINARY PLAT - REVIEW AND CONSIDERATION.
1.   Review by City Engineer, Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer, Public
Works Director, and County Board of Supervisors. Immediately upon the filing of
18 copies of the preliminary plat, the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer
will retain two copies for the City’s file (one copy is to indicate the
Planning and Zoning Commission and Council action), and the remaining copies of
the preliminary plat will be distributed as follows:
   A.   One copy to the City Engineer, if applicable;
   B.   One copy to the Public Works Director, if applicable;
   C.   One copy to each Planning and Zoning Commission member;
   D.   One copy to each Council member and the Mayor.
and, where a proposed plat is outside the City limits but within the area of
subdivision jurisdiction, one copy to the Zoning Administrator of the County.
The City Engineer, if applicable, the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer,
the Public Works Director, if applicable, and where concerned, the Board of
Supervisors for the County, will review the plat and application materials to
assure that the proposed subdivision complies with the applicable regulations
and requirements and report upon such to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
The Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer will determine if the proposed
subdivision complies with the zoning ordinance. The Building and Zoning
Enforcement Officer will also report upon conditions of the site or adjacent
properties which, while not evident in the application materials, may affect
development upon the site. (Review by the Soil Conservation Services may be
sought where erosion or sedimentation control considerations are evident).
2.   Review by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The Planning and Zoning
Commission will review the preliminary plat and application materials to assure
compliance with the various comprehensive plans of the City. Particular note
will be made that any planned major streets or other planned public facilities
of the community falling in the area of the subdivision being reviewed are
accommodated in the proposed plat. They also will review the reports of the
Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer, City Engineer, Public Works Director,
and County Zoning Administrator, where applicable, with regard to the proposed
subdivision. Within 30 days of the subdivider’s filing for preliminary plat
approval, the Planning and Zoning Commission will make known to the Council and
the Clerk that the preliminary plat has been:
   A.   Approved.
   B.   Approved, subject to modification.
   C.   Disapproved.
If disapproved, the Planning and Zoning Commission will submit to the
subdivider, with a copy to the Clerk, a statement setting forth reasons for the
disapproval, indicating particularly the aspects in which the proposed plat
fails to conform to ordinance requirements. Failure of the Planning and Zoning
Commission to act within 30 days of the filing of the plat application with the
Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer will be deemed approval of the plat
unless, however, an extension of time is mutually agreed upon by the subdivider
and the Planning and Zoning Commission or as such extension of time is
otherwise provided for herein.
The Planning and Zoning Commission will maintain one copy of the preliminary
plat in its files with the Planning and Zoning Commission action noted upon it.
The above-referenced review process notwithstanding, any petitioned matter
submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission may be withdrawn, amended, and/
or consideration and action upon said matter may be temporarily postponed,
once, for a period not to exceed 30 days from the date of the originally
scheduled meeting, providing a detailed, written, explanatory, request from the
petitioner asking for said withdrawal, time extension, and/or amendment of said
petition is received by the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer no later
than four working days prior to the originally scheduled meeting date. If such
a request is properly and timely filed, the Planning and Zoning Commission will
continue to meet as scheduled and, in the case of a request for a withdrawal of
the petition, the Planning and Zoning Commission will acknowledge the request
for the permanent record and grant the request. In the case of a request for a
temporary extension of time and/or an amendment to the original petition, the
Planning and Zoning Commission will continue to meet as scheduled and will
acknowledge the request for an extension and/or amendment for the permanent
record and consider and act upon the request(s) at the meeting.
The Planning and Zoning Commission may grant, deny, or conditionally grant or
deny the request for the full-time extension requested or some other time
extension as the Planning and Zoning Commission may deem appropriate, but any
such extension will not exceed 30 days as spelled out above. If the Planning
and Zoning Commission denies a request for extension, then the meeting will be
conducted as scheduled at the specified time and place.
The Planning and Zoning Commission may grant, deny, or conditionally grant or
deny the request to consider and act upon an amended petition as the Planning
and Zoning Commission may deem appropriate.
Any additional expenses incurred by the City as a result of granting an
extension and/or amendment request which was submitted by the petitioner will
be borne by the petitioner and paid in full to the City prior to the date set
for the rescheduled meeting.
Further, consideration and action upon said matter may be temporarily
postponed, once, for a period not to exceed 30 days from the date of the
originally scheduled meeting, providing a detailed, written, explanatory,
request for such action, signed by 20 percent or more of the property owners
whose property boundaries lie within 200 feet, (inclusive of any and all public
and quasi-public right-of-way distances), of the boundaries of the property
upon which the proposed matter is to be considered, is received by the Building
and Zoning Enforcement Officer no later than four working days prior to the
originally scheduled meeting date. If such a request is properly and timely
filed, the Planning and Zoning Commission’s action(s) will be conducted as
spelled out above.
3.   Approval or Rejection by the City Council. The Council will, after being
notified of the Planning and Zoning Commission’s action on the plat, consider
and act on the preliminary plat within 30 days after the first regular Council
meeting following the date of action of the Planning and Zoning Commission. If
the Planning and Zoning Commission does not approve the plat, the Council may
approve said plat and accompanying development proposals only by a four-fifths
vote of the entire membership of the Council.
4.   Action On Preliminary Plat to be Filed with the City Clerk. A certified
copy of the resolution approving the preliminary plat or disapproving the
preliminary plat and stating the reasons, therefore, will be attached to a copy
of the preliminary plat by the Clerk and filed in the office of the Clerk. (See
Appendix Form F.)
5.   Preliminary Plat Approval Not to Constitute Subdivision Approval and
Revocability. Approval of the preliminary plat by the Council does not
constitute approval of the subdivision, but is merely an authorization to the
subdivider to proceed with the preparation of the final plat and any
preliminary plat, or any portion thereof, not final platted is revocable by the
Council.
6.   Time Limitation of Preliminary Plat Approval. Approval of the preliminary
plat will be effective for 12 months; except, however, the Planning and Zoning
Commission, upon written request of the subdivider and advice of the Building
and Zoning Enforcement Officer, may grant an extension of time, not to exceed
an additional 12 months. If the final plat is not filed with the Building and
Zoning Enforcement Officer within 12 months, or within an authorized extension,
the Council’s approval of the preliminary plat will become automatically null
and void. If only a part of a preliminary plat is approved as a part of a
larger final plat, the approval of the remaining portion(s) of the preliminary
plat shall automatically gain an extension of 36 months before another phase of
the plat must be submitted in final form.
175.16   FINAL PLAT - PREPARATION AND FILING REQUIREMENTS.
Following approval of the preliminary plat, the subdivider will cause to be
prepared a final plat and other materials as required for final approval. The
filing for final approval will consist of a fully signed and stamped

part of the subdivided area, waive all formalities, rights of protest, and
rights of appeal to the construction and installation of the improvements by
the City and to the assessment of the total cost thereof against the subdivided
area, even though the cost may exceed the amount that can legally be assessed
against the subdivided area by the City.
The assessment waiver will further provide that the subdivider and the persons
who own the property benefited by the improvements at the time construction and
installation of the improvements is initiated by the City will be jointly and
severally liable for any difference between the cost of the improvements and

175.21   FINAL PLAT - REVIEW AND CONSIDERATION.
1.   Review by City Engineer, Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer, Public
Works Director, and County Board of Supervisors. Immediately upon the filing of
the reproducible final plat, the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer will
retain one copy for their own files, (on which is to be indicated Council
action), and they will distribute the remaining copies of the final plat, as

applicable), and where concerned, the County Board of Supervisors and, make its
own study to assure compliance with these regulations and substantial
conformity to the approved preliminary plat or conditionally approved plat
subject to any modifications requested. The Planning and Zoning Commission will
approve or disapprove the final plat within 30 days after submission of the
final plat materials by the subdivider to the Building and Zoning Enforcement
Officer. Failure of the Planning and Zoning Commission to act within 30 days
will be deemed to be approval; unless, however, the subdivider and the Planning
and Zoning Commission have mutually agreed to an extension of time, or as such
extension of time is otherwise provided for herein. The Planning and Zoning
Commission will make known immediately to the Clerk and the Council its action
upon the final plat.
The above referenced review process notwithstanding, any petitioned matter
submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission may be withdrawn, amended, and/
or consideration and action upon said matter may be temporarily postponed,
once, for a period not to exceed 30 days from the date of the originally
scheduled meeting, providing a detailed, written, explanatory request from the
petitioner asking for said withdrawal, time extension, and/or amendment of said
petition is received by the Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer no later
than four working days prior to the originally scheduled meeting date. If such
a request is properly and timely filed, the Planning and Zoning Commission will
continue to meet as scheduled and, in the case of a request for a withdrawal of
the petition, the Planning and Zoning Commission will acknowledge the request
for the permanent record and grant the request. In the case of a request for a
temporary extension of time and/or an amendment to the original petition, the
Planning and Zoning Commission will continue to meet as scheduled and will
acknowledge the request for an extension and/or amendment for the permanent
record and consider and act upon the request(s) at the meeting.
The Planning and Zoning Commission may grant, deny, or conditionally grant or
deny the request for the full-time extension requested or some other time
extension as the Planning and Zoning Commission may deem appropriate, but any
such extension will not exceed 30 days as spelled out above. If the Planning
and Zoning Commission denies a request for extension, then the meeting will be
conducted as scheduled at the specified time and place.
The Planning and Zoning Commission may grant, deny, or conditionally grant or
deny the request to consider and act upon an amended petition as the Planning
and Zoning Commission may deem appropriate.
Any additional expenses incurred by the City, as a result of granting an
extension and/or amendment request which was submitted by the petitioner, will
be borne by the petitioner and paid in full to the City prior to the date set
for the rescheduled meeting.
Further, consideration and action upon said matter may be temporarily
postponed, once, for a period not to exceed 30 days from the date of the
originally scheduled meeting, providing a detailed, written, explanatory
request for such action, signed by 20 percent or more of the property owners
whose property boundaries lie within 200 feet, (inclusive of any and all public
and quasi-public right-of-way distances), of the boundaries of the property
upon which the proposed matter is to be considered, is received by the Building
and Zoning Enforcement Officer no later than four working days prior to the
originally scheduled meeting date. If such a request is properly and timely
filed, the Planning and Zoning Commission’s action(s) will be conducted as
spelled out above.
3.   Approval or Rejection by the City Council. The Council will, after being
notified of the Planning and Zoning Commission’s action on the plat, consider
and act on the final plat within 30 days after the first regular Council
meeting following the date of action of the Planning and Zoning Commission. If
the Planning and Zoning Commission does not approve the plat, the Council may
approve said plat and accompanying development proposals only by a four-fifths
vote of the entire membership of the Council.
4.   Action on Final Plat to be Filed with the City Clerk. A certified copy of
the resolution approving the final plat, or disapproving the final plat and
stating the reasons, therefore, will be attached to a copy of the final plat by
the Clerk and filed in the office of the Clerk. (See Appendix – Form T)
5.   Appeal of Review or Disapproval. If the plat is disapproved or approved,
subject to condition(s) by the City, the applicant has the right to appeal,
subject to the provisions of Section 354.10 of the Code of Iowa, to the
District Court within 20 days after the date of the denial of the application
or the date of the receipt by the applicant of the requirements for approval of
the subdivision.
6.   Time Limitation for Recording of the Final Plat. An approved final plat
will be filed with the County Recorder within 45 days of the date of approval
by the Council, and the County Board of Supervisors, where applicable, and if
not filed within such time, will have no validity, and will not be recorded
without reapproval by the Council and recertification by the Clerk. Before it
is recorded in the office of the County Recorder, the provisions of Chapter 354
of the Code of Iowa, and amendments thereto, will be complied with. Within five
working days after recording, the duly certified copy will be filed with the
Clerk. No building permits will be issued until verification of such recording
is on file in the office of the Clerk, or unless such provisions are waived, in
writing, by the Council.
7.   Release, Expiration, or Extension of Bond. Prior to the release or
expiration of any bond, the Council will request that the City Engineer certify
that they were notified by the subdivider to witness the installation of the
required improvements at key times so as to be able to certify that all
required improvements were properly installed and that neither the subdivision
as constructed, nor improvements installed, deviate from the approved final
plat.
Should the required improvements not be completed within the duration of the
bond, the subdivider may request of the Council an extension of time for the
installation of the balance of the improvements. Should such a request be
granted, the subdivider will deposit with the City, a performance bond for the
length of time extension is granted. The bond format to be used will be that
form shown in the Appendix – Form O and will be approved as to adequacy of
amount by the City Engineer.
175.22   STREETS AND STREET RIGHT-OF-WAY CRITERIA.
1.   Streets to be Continued. Streets in new subdivisions shall be designed and
adjusted to the contour of the land so as to produce usable lots and streets of
reasonable gradient and to provide for the continuation of existing and planned
streets. In addition, the Planning and Zoning Commission and/or the Council may
require the provision of right-of-way for the connection of the proposed
subdivision to any adjoining unsubdivided land. The street and alley right-of-
way arrangements shall also be such as to cause no hardship to owners of
adjacent property when they plat their own land and seek to provide for
convenient access to it. Whenever a street or alley right-of-way abuts the
tract to be subdivided, the plat will include the additional right-of-way which
is necessary to make the width of the entire right-of-way conform to the
requirements of this Code. The width of right-of-ways will be no less than the
width required by this section except where:
   A.   The owner of the abutting property agrees, in writing, to dedicate
sufficient right-of-way to make a full width right-of-way and the subdivider
agrees to construct a full width street or alley on said right-of-way; or,
   B.   The City owns the abutting property and agrees to the use of it for
right-of-way purposes and the subdivider agrees to construct a full width
street or alley on said right-of-way.
2.   Street Construction. Those streets contained within the boundaries, and
the extensions thereof, and those non-developed, platted streets immediately
adjacent to and abutting any subdivision for a distance greater than 100 feet
will be constructed or reconstructed of concrete or asphalt. All such streets
will be constructed/reconstructed to those minimum standards as set forth
herein and as more specifically alluded to in the City’s Standard Public Works
Improvement Specifications.
3.   Discourage Through Traffic on Local Streets. Local streets will be laid
out so that their use by through traffic will be discouraged.
4.   Streets to Intersect at Right Angles. Intersection of streets will be as
nearly right angles as possible. No street will intersect any other street at
an angle less than 80 degrees, or greater than 100 degrees.
5.   Not More than Two Streets to Intersect. Intersection of more than two
streets at a point will be prohibited.
6.   Intersection Corners to be Rounded. Property lines at street intersections
will be rounded with a radius of not less than 25 feet. Comparable cut-offs or
chords in place of such rounded corners are acceptable.
7.   Obstruction to Visibility at Intersections Prohibited. There will be no
obstruction of any type to visibility at street intersections within the sight
triangle formed by the center of the intersection and two points 75 feet
distant, each point being on the centerline of any intersecting street.
8.   Minimum Centerline Offsets. Offset streets are to be avoided. Where they
are deemed necessary, a minimum horizontal distance of 150 feet will be
maintained between the centerline of the offset streets.
9.   Connecting Street Lines to be Joined by Curves. Connecting street lines,
deflecting from each other at any one point by more than 10 degrees, will be
joined by curves, the inner radius of which will be not less than 350 feet for
arterial streets, 250 feet for a collector street, and 100 feet for sub
collector and local streets.
10.   Reverse Curves to be Connected by Tangent. A tangent or portion of a
street in a straight alignment and of not less than 100 feet in length will be
introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
11.   Right-of-Way and Pavement Widths. Right-of-way widths and pavement widths
measured between the back of the curbs or to the edge of the pavement where
curbs may not be required, will be provided as follows:
 
Street Classifications                          Right-of-Ways Pavement Widths
Arterial                                        80 feet       48 feet
Collector                                       80 feet       45 feet
Sub-collector                                   60 feet       31 feet
Local (Drives, lanes, places, and cul-de-sacs)  60 feet       31 feet
(Without Parking Restrictions)
Local (Drives, lanes, places, and cul-de-sacs)  60 feet       31 feet
(With Parking Restrictions)
 
12.   Maximum and Minimum Street Grades. Street grades as measured along the
centerline will be not less than one-half of one percent and not greater than:
 
Arterial                          5 percent
Collector                         5 percent
Any cul-de-sac                    6 percent
Sub-collector                     6 percent
Local (drives, lanes, and places) 8 percent
 
13.   Cul-De-Sac and Loop Streets. Cul-de-sac streets will meet all the
requirements for a local street and, in addition, will be constructed to
provide a turnaround with a right-of-way radius of not less than 50 feet and a
pavement radius of not less than 40.5 feet. No cul-de-sac will exceed a six
percent grade. No cul-de-sac will exceed 600 feet in length. Cul-de-sacs and
loop streets will only be allowed on local classified streets. Exception: The
Council may determine a different street turnaround standard or classification
within a planned unit development based upon the applicable land use and the
number of lots served. All measurements will be made along the center line of
the cul-de-sac or loop street right-of-way. Lengths will be determined by
measuring from the center line of an intersecting street to the center line of
the intersecting street for a loop street or circle drive, or from the center
line of the intersecting street to the termination of the right-of-way for a
cul-de-sac.
Cul-de-sacs with islands will have a minimum island radius of 30 feet. Paving
width will be uniform around the island. Design of non-concentric or irregular
shaped islands may be approved by the City after consideration of the effects
of the design on water drainage, snow removal, garbage collection, and street
sweeping, etc.
14.   Change in Street Grade. All changes in street grades will be connected by
vertical curves of minimum length in feet equal to 25 times the algebraic
difference in percents of grade. In no case will the vertical curve be less
than 100 feet in length. Final decision on the above to be made by the City.
15.   Half Streets. Half streets will be prohibited.
16.   Buffer Treatment Between Subdivisions and Adjacent Uses. Where a proposed
subdivision contains an existing or proposed arterial street or abuts such a
street or land use which may have an adverse effect on a subdivision, the
Planning and Zoning Commission or Council may require some buffer treatment
such as frontage roads, reverse frontage with screen planting along the rear
lot lines, deep lots, or any other such treatment which may protect the
proposed subdivision from these outside influences. (See Sections
170.43 and
170.55).
17.   Access to Highways Under State Jurisdiction. If the tract of land
proposed to be subdivided, or any part thereof, lies adjacent to a highway over
which the Iowa Department of Transportation (IDOT) has jurisdiction with
respect to maintenance and upkeep thereof, and an entrance or entrances are
desired from such highway to lots, streets, roadways, or alleys in such
proposed subdivision, the subdivider will submit to the Planning and Zoning
Commission an approved permit from the IDOT, granting permission to obtain and
construct such an entrance or entrances. Whenever the proposed subdivision
contains or is adjacent to a highway designated as a controlled-access highway
by the IDOT, provisions will be made for a marginal-access street, a parallel
street at a distance acceptable for the appropriate use of the land between the
highway and such parallel street, or the limiting of access, where possible and
practical, to said street by restrictive covenants.
Whenever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to a street
designated as an arterial street or as a collector street in the master street
development plan, provisions may be made for limiting access, where possible
and practical, to said street by restrictive covenants.
18.   Street Names. Streets will be named in accordance with the present naming
system. Streets, that are obviously in alignment with others already existing
and named, will bear the name of the existing street. Otherwise, names will not
duplicate existing street names, and names similar to existing street names
will not be permitted.
19.   Sidewalks. Sidewalks of at least four feet in width will be provided on
both sides of all streets and the edge most distant from the curb will be
placed a distance of one foot from the property line, or as otherwise specified
by the City. The City reserves the right to require additional width depending
on the character of the development. The extra width is to be provided at the
subdivider’s expense. Materials, location, widths, and construction methods
will be determined by the City in accordance with the minimum standards set
forth in the City’s Standard Public Works Improvement Specifications.
175.23   ALLEYS AND ALLEY RIGHT-OF-WAY CRITERIA.
1.   Alleys in Commercial or Industrial Districts. Alleys may be provided in
commercial and industrial districts, except that the Planning and Zoning
Commission or Council may waive this requirement where other definite and
assured provisions are made for service access, such as off-street loading,
unloading, and parking, consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed.
2.   Alleys Prohibited in Residential Districts. Alleys are prohibited in
residential districts.
3.   Width of Alleys. Alleys will have right-of-way and pavement widths of not
less than 24 feet, and 18 feet, respectively.
4.   Alignment of Alleys. Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment
will be avoided, but where necessary, corners will be cut off sufficiently to
permit safe vehicular movement.
5.   Dead-End Alleys to be Avoided. Dead-end alleys will be avoided where
possible, but if unavoidable, will be provided with adequate turn-around
facilities at the dead-end, as determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission
or Council.
175.24   BLOCKS.
1.   Shape of Blocks. No specific rule concerning the shape of blocks is made,
but blocks must fit easily into the overall plan of the subdivision and their
design will show consideration of topography, lot planning, traffic flow, and
public areas.
2.   Length of Blocks. Block length will not exceed 1,200 feet. Where a
subdivision adjoins an arterial street, the greater dimension of the block will
front upon such arterial street to avoid unnecessary access or egress, except
upon approval by the City.
3.   Width of Blocks. The width of blocks will not be less than 220 feet and
not more than 350 feet, except upon approval by the City.
4.   Blocks in Commercial or Industrial Areas. Blocks intended for commercial
or industrial use will be designated as such, and the plan will show adequate
off-street areas to provide for parking, loading docks, and such other
facilities that may be required to accommodate motor vehicles.
5.   Pedestrian Cross Walks. The Planning and Zoning Commission or Council may
require the construction of pedestrian crosswalks in blocks which exceed 800
feet in length. Crosswalk easements not less than 10 feet in width will be
provided where deemed necessary at the approximate center of the block. The use
of additional crosswalks, in any instance, to provide safe and convenient
access to schools, parks, or other similar destinations, may be required by the
City.
175.25   LOTS.
1.   Lot Size, Width, Depth, Shape, and Orientation. The lot size, width,
depth, shape, and orientation will be appropriate for the location of the
subdivision and the type of development contemplated, and will be established
on all lots; providing, however, that such setback lines are not less than the
applicable requirements of the appropriate underlying zoning district. The
depth-to-width ratio of the usable area of a lot will be at a maximum of 3.0 :
1.0.
2.   Building Setback Lines to be Established. Building setback lines,
appropriate for the location of the subdivision and the type of development
contemplated, will be established on all lots; providing, however, that such
setback lines are not less than the applicable requirements of the appropriate
underlying zoning district.
3.   Lot Lines to be at Right Angles to Street Lines. Side lot lines will be
substantially at right angles or radial to the center line of the street or
center of a cul-de-sac turn-around.
4.   Corner Lots to be Extra Width. Corner lots for residential use will have
extra width to permit appropriate building setback from both streets.
5.   Every Lot to Have Frontage On and Access to a Public Street. Every
subdivision of land will be such as to provide, by means of a public street,
each lot with satisfactory access to an existing public street. No lot will
have a frontage width of less than 40 feet, or that as specified for the
underlying zoning district, whichever is larger.
6.   Reverse Frontage and Double Frontage Lots Not Normally Allowed. Double
frontage and reverse frontage lots will be avoided except where essential to
provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries, or to
overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation, or except where
desired, along arterial, limited access highways or streets, lots may face on
an interior street and back on such thoroughfares.
7.   Land Remnants (Outlots). All land within a subdivision shall be
encompassed into platted lots or dedicated public right-of-ways and no
undesignated land remnants will be permitted.
8.   Reserve Strips Not Allowed. Reserve strips created by the platting of
property lines, several feet inside the property line/street right-of-way line,
with the objective being the receiving of remuneration for access to an
improved street will not be allowed.
9.   Acre Subdivision. Whenever an area is divided into lots containing one to
three acres, inclusive, and there are indications that such lots will
eventually be resubdivided into smaller building lots, consideration will be
given to the street and lot arrangement of the original subdivision so as to
allow the opening of additional streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent
local streets which will permit a logical arrangement of smaller lots. Land
dedications and easements provided for the future opening and extensions of
such streets may, at the discretion of the Council, be made a requirement of
the original plat.
10.   Subdivision On or Overlapping City Limits. Should a subdivision be on or
overlap the City limits, it will be platted so the City limit boundary, will be
also a street right-of-way line or will be a lot line. In no case will a lot be
platted so as to be bisected by the City limit boundary line.
11.   Shopping Centers. Wherever possible, unit shopping centers, based upon
sound development standards, should be designed in contrast to the platting of
lots for unrestricted commercial use.
12.   Additional Width for Lots Abutting a Water Course. Lots abutting a water
course, drainageway, channel, or stream will have additional minimum width or
depth as required to provide an adequate building site and afford the minimum
usable area required for front, rear, and side yards while not restricting the
water course.
175.26   EASEMENTS.
1.   Utility Easements to be Provided. Easements across lots or centered on
rear or side lot lines will be provided for utilities and will be at least 10
feet wide on each side of all rear lot lines and side lot lines where
necessary.
Easements of greater width may be required where needed. Easements will be at
final grade before any utilities are provided for the property and the
subdivider, contractor, or builder will keep all easements free of any
excavation dirt, construction material, or any other obstacles during
construction.
2.   Utility Service Easements. A blanket easement will be provided to allow
individual utility service lines to be extended from utility trunk service
lines, providing that the individual service line traverse only that parcel on
which the structure to be served is located.
3.   Maintenance and Flowage Easements Provided for Natural Water Courses.
Whenever any stream or important surface watercourse is located in an area that
is being subdivided, the subdivider will, at their own expense, make adequate
provisions for straightening or widening the channel so that it will properly
carry the surface water and will also provide and dedicate to the City an
easement along each side of the stream, which easement will be for the purpose
of widening, improving, or protecting the stream and for recreational use. The
width of such easement will not be less than 20 feet on either side from the
watercourse centerline and the total width of the final easement will be
determined by the amount needed to adequately provide for any necessary channel
relocations and straightening. The subdivider will notify adjacent properties/
communities, the Corps of Engineers (C.O.E.), if applicable, and the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) prior to any alteration or relocation of
a watercourse, if the stream or watercourse drains an area in excess of 10
square miles, and a “401 Water Quality Permit” application shall be made
directly to the IDNR and (C.O.E., if applicable), in these instances. For
drainage areas less than 10 square miles, any changes in the stream or
watercourse as a result of the subdivision will be considered and acted upon by
the City during the subdivision review process.
If the outlet for surface drainage is outside of the boundaries of a
subdivision, the sub-divider shall also provide drainage easements and/or
flowage agreements from abutting property owners to said approved outlet.
4.   Free Access of Authorities to Easements. No tree, shrub, or structure will
be placed or erected in any easement for purposes of preventing the proper
authorities free access to and use of such easements at any time.
5.   Access Control. Each lot in a subdivision will have access to a local,
sub-collector, or collector street, except lots having a minimum of 150 feet
frontage on an arterial street may be granted direct access to that street,
provided that design standards for sight and stopping distances are met.
6.   Land for Public Purposes. Where sites for parks, schools, playgrounds, or
other public uses are located within the subdivision area as shown on the
City’s Comprehensive Plan, or where such sites appear to be desirable, the City
may request their dedication for such purposes, or their reservation for a
period of one year following the date of the approval of the plat. In the event
a governmental agency concerned passes a resolution expressing its intent to
acquire the land so reserved, the reservation period shall be extended for an
additional six months.
175.27   CHARACTER OF DEVELOPMENT.
1.   Generally. The Planning and Zoning Commission or Council will have the
right to require that certain minimum regulations, and restrictive and
protective covenants regarding and controlling the type and character of
development, be incorporated in the final platting process.
Such regulations will be intended to protect the character and value of the
surrounding development and will also tend to secure the most appropriate
character of development in the property which is being subdivided.
In addition to other approved regulations, stipulations, conditions, and
covenants provided by the subdivider, the following shall be incorporated into
each subdivision plat as a minimum:
   A.   Prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit and the actual occupancy
of any structure, any disturbed areas of a lot not otherwise landscaped or
paved, located between the rear building line and the front street curb line
(s), will be sodded. All other disturbed areas of the lot will be hand-seeded
or hydro-seeded.
   B.   With the exception of non-storage, recreational-related buildings or
uses, (i.e., swimming pools, gazebos, children’s playhouses, etc.), no detached
accessory building or use will be allowed on any lot within the subdivision.
   C.   Parking provisions relating to recreational vehicles and/or trucks will
be subject to those provisions contained within the Section
170.52
2.   Protection of Natural Vegetation Cover. Whenever a wooded site is to be
developed, no more than 15 percent of the naturally occurring canopy-tree cover
will be removed due to surface earth grading, roadway construction, building
site clearance, or any other improvement. Whenever removal of more than 15
percent of the naturally occurring vegetation cover is deemed necessary and
unavoidable, a mitigating, replanting measure will be implemented. Such
mitigation will require re-establishment of two native trees of a similar
species to those removed, for every three trees of four inch caliper or greater
removed or fatally damaged within two years after the acceptance of the
improvements.
3.   Open Space Requirement. In all residential subdivisions of 15 lots or more
there will be a minimum of 10 percent or a minimum of 6,000 square feet,
whichever is greater, of the subdivision dedicated or reserved as usable common
open space land. The land will be within or contiguous to the subdivision.
Common open space land will be clearly designated on the subdivision plan as to
character of use and development, be intended for the public use of all
citizens, and will not include: (i) areas reserved for the exclusive use or
benefit of an individual tenant or owner; (ii) dedicated streets, common wells,
sewage treatment facilities, and other public right-of-ways; or, (iii)
vehicular drives, parking, loading, and storage areas.
   A.   Large lot subdivisions, provided that at least 90 percent of all lots
have lot areas of one acre or more, will be exempt from the open space
requirements of this section, provided that adequate deed restrictions will
limit subsequent lot re-subdivisions. Exemptions may be provided if within one-
quarter of a mile to an existing public park or designated greenway.
   B.   Guidelines for designating open space land will be as follows:
      (1)   Areas may include environmentally sensitive land, such as stream
beds, marshes, and steep slopes, however, a minimum of 50 percent of the land
must be level ground that is within or contiguous to the subdivision and
suitable for active recreation.
      (2)   The length will not be more than five times the width, (except in
the case of a bikeway proposal).
      (3)   It will be easily accessible to the public.
      (4)   It must have topsoil and be able to grow grass.
      (5)   May include enclosed drainage easements that are compatible for
intended usage.
      (6)   May include land in a high power transmission line easement, but
only a maximum of 20 percent of the open space requirement may fall within this
type of area.
   C.   Bikeways constructed according to the following standards may be
included as a part of the reserved open space: (a) right-of-way at least 12
feet wide; and (b) a permanently paved surface of asphaltic cement concrete or
Portland cement concrete (ACC or PCC) at least eight feet wide, four inches
thick, on a well-drained subsoil base. As an incentive for the development of
bikeways, the land area occupied by the bikeway will be counted as double
towards fulfilling the minimum open space requirement, provided that at least
10,000 square feet of other open space has been set aside for active and
passive use.
   D.   Suitable provisions for the maintenance and upkeep of open space shall
be provided through a homeowners association, deed covenants, or through other
similar approved means as approved by the City.
4.   Perimeter Fences. Any subdivision boundary adjoining an existing
agricultural land use will be fenced with lawful fences to prevent livestock
and horses from entering the other property. Where no fence exists or where an
existing fence is in need of repair, the cost will be assigned to the
appropriate landowner. Future repair and maintenance will be done by the
agricultural landowner with the cost prorated according to length of fence
between the homeowners and the agricultural landowner.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 359A)
175.28   GENERAL INFORMATION.
All public or private utilities or improvements, including, but not limited to,
public and private sanitary sewers, storm sewers, water systems, and streets,
shall be constructed as set forth on the approved final subdivision plans, in
accordance with the City’s Standard Public Works Improvement Specifications and
standard drawings for construction in effect at the time of the subdivision
construction, and the provisions of Section
175.33.
1.   Construction Plans Prepared by a Registered Engineer. Construction plans
for all public improvements to be installed will be prepared by a registered
state professional engineer. (See Appendix – Form I)
2.   Construction to City Specifications. The type of materials and
construction for improvements in subdivisions will be in accordance with the
City’s Standard Public Works Improvement Specifications and standard drawings
for construction in effect at the time of construction. Said specifications and
standard drawings will be revised at such time as the City deems appropriate
and become effective on the following January first and remain in effect until
revised. Revisions to the City’s standard specifications and standard drawings
will be approved by the Council on or before November first of each year and
will take effect the following January. Subdivisions receiving final approval
after November first, but before January first, will use the new approved
standard specifications and standard drawings. Changes in the City Standard
Public Works Improvement Specifications will be incorporated into actual
construction at the earliest possible time prior to the approval of the final
plat or expiration of the performance bond.
Construction drawing review, construction observation, inspection, and testing
of the improvements will all be performed under the direction of the City, or
by a qualified engineer, or inspection and testing laboratory, as approved by
the City. The City may consult with the Soil Conservation District on erosion
control.
The inspecting agency, if different than the City, will submit daily reports to
the City on forms approved or furnished by the City, certifying compliance of
all construction performed under the City’s Standard Public Works Improvement
Specifications.
3.   Completion of Improvements. No public improvement will be considered as
completed until officially approved and formally accepted by the City.
4.   Improvement Costs to be Paid by Subdivider. Any and all costs associated
with the platting, development, and installation of improvements in connection
with a subdivision created under these provisions shall be paid for by the
subdivider, unless otherwise provided for by a formal agreement between the
City and the subdivider. (i.e., T.I.F. Development Agreement, Minimum
Assessment Agreement, etc.)
5.   Payment of City-Related Engineering and Inspection Fees. The cost of any
City related engineering and inspection of the improvements, based upon the
amount of time devoted to the project, will be paid for by the subdivider to
the City prior to the release of any bond and prior to the City’s acceptance of
the final plat, and/or improvements.
6.   Improvement Credit: Procedure Established. Upon the installation of
improvements required by this Code which may provide benefits to other
properties in the vicinity of the land to be subdivided, which cross or adjoin
other properties and can be used by such properties, the subdivider and the
City may, by contract, agree that upon the connection or use of the
installations made by the subdivider by others, within a period of 10 years
following their installation, the new user or users will pay to the City a fee
in an amount agreed upon by the subdivider and the City, the amount of such fee
to be credited to and paid to the subdivider.
175.29   STREET AND ALLEY IMPROVEMENTS.
1.   All Streets Constructed to Standards. The construction of all streets and
alleys will be in accordance with the design standards set forth in this Code
and in accordance with the City’s Standard Public Works Improvement
Specifications.
2.   Curb and Gutters. Curb and gutters will be required on all streets and
alleys and the design and construction will be in accordance with the City’s
Standard Public Works Improvement Specifications. The minimum grade of any
street gutter will not be less than four-tenths percent.
3.   Curb Corners. Curb corners of all streets will have radii of not less than
25 feet.
4.   Street Pavement Widths. The subdivider will be responsible for providing
street pavement widths in accordance with those provisions of Section 175.29
(5).
5.   Paving Requirements. The surface and pavement dimensions and
characteristics, including thickness and base courses, shall follow the
guidelines of the City Standard Public Works Improvement Specifications Manual.
6.   Stormwater Inlets. Stormwater inlets will be provided within the street
improvements at points specified by the City.
7.   Sidewalks. Sidewalks and crosswalks will be paved and constructed in
accordance with the standards set forth in Section
175.22(19) and the City Standard Public Works Improvement Specifications.
8.   Traffic Control Devices. All traffic control devices and other associated
street signs for intersections and/or other features as designated by the City,
will be paid for and/or provided by the subdivider and said devices, signs, or
other features, will be in conformance with the Manual on U.T.C.D.
9.   Street Lighting. Provisions will be made by the subdivider to pay for and
furnish streetlights in the number and types so designated to comply with the
standards set by Illuminating Engineering Society of North America in ANSI/IES
RP-8-18 and the Department of Transportation or as designated in the approved
street lighting plan for the City. Any additional, special, or ornamental
streetlights, not otherwise provided for in the City’s master street lighting
plan, requested by the subdivider, will be paid for by the subdivider.
10.   Acceptance of Street Dedications. No street in any subdivision that has
been approved by the City after July 1, 1983, will be officially accepted by
the City for the improvement and maintenance thereof until the minimum
improvements required by this Code have been made either by the subdivider(s)
or by the abutting property owners. Private streets, not dedicated to the City,
may be approved by the City where adequate covenants or other legal documents
ensure that the City will not have or need to assume any maintenance or other
responsibility for such street, unless or until it is brought up to full City
standards required by this and other City ordinances. In this regard, building
setback lines should accommodate the layout of such public streets in case of
future conversion.
11.   Driveways. All driveways, approaches, and associated appurtenances
constructed within the public right-of-way will be constructed in accordance
with the provisions enumerated in the Municipal Code.
12.   Designating Street Addresses. Street addresses will be assigned to each
lot in the subdivision by the City according to the City’s master addressing
guidelines and regulations, and shall be shown on each lot on the final plat or
in tabular form. Any variation from these procedures must be approved by the
Council.
175.30   SEWAGE DISPOSAL.
1.   Connection to Public Sewer System. Connection to the public sanitary sewer
is required for every lot in a proposed subdivision located within the
corporate limits. Whenever a subdivider can provide conclusive evidence to the
Planning and Zoning Commission and the Council that public sanitary sewers are
not readily and reasonably available, the subdivider will design the
subdivision to be served by private sewers accessible to each lot in the
subdivision and connected to a private treatment facility other than a septic
tank, approved by the City and the County Board of Health. All sewers will be
constructed to standard City specifications and will have prior approval of the
City that said private sewer system will be compatible for connection to public
sanitary sewer facilities when available. Maintenance of private sanitary
sewers and treatment facilities will be the responsibility of the subdivider or
a duly constituted homeowners association, until such time as it is connected
to public sewers. Sanitary sewer mains will be televised and inventoried with
GPS locations and depths to the City’s specifications immediately prior to
being dedicated and accepted by the City. The sewers will then be dedicated to
the City and thereafter be maintained as part of the public sanitary sewer
system. (A duly constituted homeowners association will be one whose articles
of incorporation have been approved by the City.)
Private or quasi-public sewage treatment and disposal systems and water well
systems allowed in any subdivision will be designed and constructed in
accordance with standard State and County Board of Health laws, rules, and
regulations.
Construction observation and testing of improvements mentioned will be
performed under the direction of the County Board of Health.
2.   Sewage Disposal Outside of the City Limits. Lots outside of the corporate
limits, but within the area of subdivision jurisdiction which cannot be served
by a central sewerage system, will have a minimum width of 100 feet, measured
at the building line, and a minimum area of 20,000 square feet, unless poor
percolation conditions exist in the area.
In this case, a minimum of one acre will be required, subject to the County
Health Department requirements.
3.   Sewer Installed to Comply with Specifications. Sanitary sewers will be
installed to comply with specifications established by the City and with the
approval of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR).
175.31   WATER SUPPLY.
1.   Connection to Public Water Supply System. Connection to the public water
supply system is required for every lot in a proposed subdivision located
within the corporate limits when a public water supply system is reasonably and
readily available.
2.   Water Supply Outside of the City Limits. Lots outside of the corporate
limits, but within the area of subdivision jurisdiction, may be served by a
public or quasi-public private well system.
3.   Water Supply Installed to Comply with Specifications. Water supply systems
will be installed to comply with specifications established by the City and the
Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR).
4.   Connection to Private Community Water Supply System Beyond Available
Public Water Supply. Any subdivision which is located within the City limits
and beyond a reasonable distance from the public water system, and if connected
to the public system would yield 15 or more water hook-ups and/or 25 or more
water users, may be allowed to use its own quasi-public water supply system.
This quasi-public water supply system will be installed in accordance with this
section and in compliance with specifications established by the City, Iowa
Department of Natural Resources (IDNR), County Health Department, and all other
applicable State agencies and in compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act of
1974, as amended.
This system will be so designed so that, at such time as the public water
supply, in the judgment of the City, passes within a reasonable distance of the
subdivision, it may be connected to the private supply and become a part of the
public water supply. No private water supply will be interconnected with any
public water supply.
5.   Lots Not Served by Public Sanitary Sewer and Water Supply Systems. In a
proposed subdivision located within the corporate limits, all lots served by
both individual subsurface sewage treatment facilities and individual water
supply systems will have a minimum width of 100 feet, measured at the building
line, and a minimum area of 30,000 square feet.
6.   Installation Of Dry Water Supply and Sanitary Sewer Systems. If the
proposed subdivision is to be constructed within an area of the City that is
not presently being served by the Municipal Water Supply and/or Sanitary Sewer
Systems, but is reasonably expected to be accessed by said systems within a
period of time not exceeding five years, then the Council may require the
subdivision improvements to include “dry” in-place, but inoperable conveyance
facilities and all associated appurtenances necessary to furnish each lot of
said subdivision with a public water supply and sanitary sewer services, when
they become available. Each such case in this matter will be evaluated and
considered on the merits of that case.
175.32   STORM DRAINAGE.
1.   Land Subject to Flooding or Containing Poor Drainage Characteristics. No
plat of a subdivision will be approved which is subject to periodic flooding or
which contains extremely poor drainage facilities, or where conditions are such
that adequate drainage of the streets, and the entire subdivision, is
impossible.
However, if the subdivider agrees to make improvements which will, in the
opinion of the Planning and Zoning Commission or Council, make the area
completely safe for occupancy and provide adequate street drainage, the
preliminary and final plat of the subdivision may be approved.
2.   Installation Of Storm Drainage Systems. The entire subdivision will be
served by one or more storm drainage systems which will be separated and
independent from the sanitary sewer system and which will provide adequate
outlets to other downstream storm drainage systems. All lots and internal
streets shall be adequately drained. The storm drainage system for the
subdivision will be composed of two distinct systems, one to handle low
intensity storms (the minor system) and another (the major system) which comes
into use when the minor system has insufficient capacity or becomes inoperable
due to temporary blockage.
The minor system will consist of closed and open conduits and their
appurtenances. The minor system will have the capacity and detention facilities
needed to capture and convey runoff from a 25-year storm occurring throughout
the drainage area served by this system and, in a way, which will cause only
minor public inconvenience. The release rate out of any stormwater collection,
conveyance, and/or detention facility shall be restricted so as not to exceed
the pre-development volume and conditions produced by a five year storm. The
velocity of water leaving the subdivision shall be reduced so as not to cause
erosion.
The major system is the route followed by runoff waters when the minor system
is inoperable or inadequate. The major system will have a capacity to convey
runoff from a 100 year storm occurring throughout the drainage area served by
this system. The major system will be designed so that no damage is caused to
private structures due to flooding. Surface flows on streets will be kept
within reasonable limits, and will not exceed the gutter capacities at any
time.
All storm drainage system designs will utilize runoff calculations based on all
tributary areas considered fully developed in accordance with the City
Comprehensive Land-Use Plan or other more intense development, when required by
the City.
All storm drainage system designs will consider and accommodate backwater
effects caused by the receiving storm drainage systems as such systems
currently exist. All storm drainage collection and conveyance system plans will
be designed and sealed by a professional engineer, licensed to practice within
the State.
175.33   UTILITIES.
1.   Underground Utilities. All utilities provided as new installations to any
area subdivided will be provided underground, except those utility services
which are listed under Subsection A as exceptions. All utilities provided as
new installations to any areas subdivided for industrial purposes will be
installed underground within any portion of the subdivision lying within 100
feet of a residentially zoned area that is already served by underground
utilities, except those utility services which are listed under Subsection A as
exceptions. The subdivider will be responsible for making the necessary
arrangements with appropriate utility companies for the proper installation of
underground utilities in accordance with the utility company's rules and
regulations.
   A.   The following instances, with the conditions listed for each of them,
may be considered exceptions to this section:
      (1)   Principal electric distribution feeder circuits and electric
transmission circuits will not be required to be installed underground.
      (2)   Any service which is considered by the utility company to be
unfeasible for undergrounding, due to high voltage or inordinately high and
unjustified cost, can be provided overhead, upon approval by the City.
      (3)   In the instance where topographic or soil conditions cause the cost
of underground installations to be extremely and unjustifiably high, these
services can be provided overhead, upon the approval of the City; however,
utility companies may provide services aerially on a temporary basis until
approval of the City is acquired for installation of permanent underground
facilities, but said utility companies will file with the building inspection
department, notice both of the installation of temporary services and their
termination.
      (4)   Where a subdivision is developed adjacent to or abutting an
existing development, and in such a way as the new development would normally
share primary feeder lines that have already been installed, and when those
feeder lines have been installed overhead, the new development can use those
feeder lines which do exist, providing that the service lines to the structures
in the new development are installed underground, and providing that all
additional necessary feeders are installed underground or in accordance with
the provisions of this section.
      (5)   Developments having preliminary plat approval prior to the
effective date of this section will not be subject to the requirements of this
section.
   B.   The following specific facilities will not be subject to the
requirements of this section:
      (1)   Poles used exclusively for police and fire alarm boxes, or any
similar municipal equipment installed under the supervision of and to the
satisfaction of the City.
      (2)   Poles used exclusively for street lighting.
      (3)   When authorized by the City, poles and overhead lines and
associated overhead structures crossing or entering any portion of a district
from which overhead wires have been prohibited and originating in an area in
which these structures are allowed.
      (4)   Overhead lines attached to the exterior of a building by means of a
bracket or similar device and extending from one location on the building to
another location on the same building, or to an adjacent building without
crossing any public street or right-of-way.
      (5)   Radio antenna and associated structures and equipment used for
furnishing communications service.
      (6)   Service terminals, and necessary pad-mounted electric equipment,
installed above ground used to distribute communication and electric services
in underground systems.
   C.   All underground electric distribution circuits installed by the utility
company for the purpose of distributing electrical current within the City will
be installed in accordance with the Safety Rules for the Installation and
Maintenance of Electric Supply and Communication Lines, U.S. Department of
Commerce, National Bureau of Standards.
175.34   MONUMENTS.
1.   Monuments. Unless otherwise specified by the City, monuments will be iron
rods, pipes, or steel bars at least 36 inches long and not less than five-
eighths inches in diameter.
Monuments will have a cap affixed to the top of same that is capable of being
detected by magnetic or electronic equipment and is made of a reasonably inert
material, bearing an embossed or stencil-cut marking of the State registration
number of the registered land surveyor that prepared the survey. These
monuments will be placed not more than one quarter mile apart in any straight
line and at all lot corners, at each end of all curves, at the point where a
curve changes its radius, and at all angle points in any line, except when such
corners or points fall within a street or proposed future street, the monuments
shall be placed in the sideline of the street.
175.35   OVERLAY FLOOD DISTRICT.
1.   Land Contours. Land contours of all lots with elevation of sufficient
height to permit construction of the lowest habitable floor of a building at or
above the base flood level as defined in the Overlay Flood District of the City
Zoning Code, will be provided.
2.   Streets. Streets with grades being at or above the base flood level as
defined in the Overlay Flood District of the City Zoning Code, will be
provided.
3.   Drainage Facilities. Facilities designed to store and convey the flow of
surface waters and flood flows, without unduly increasing flood heights and
without causing danger of life loss to persons and/or severe damage to
properties, will be provided.
4.   Water and Sewer Systems. Water systems and/or sanitary sewerage systems,
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems
and discharges from the systems into flood waters and required waste disposal
systems located so as to avoid impairment of them or contamination from them
during a flood, will be provided.
175.36   EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL.
1.   Generally. For areas of the subdivision that may have ground cover,
removed at any one time, the subdivider will provide a plan including, but not
limited to, the following provisions:
   A.   The type of soil comprising the premises and the physical properties of
each type;
   B.   The type of temporary vegetation and/or mulching that will be used in
these areas to control soil losses from the construction site so as not to
exceed five tons per acre. Erosion control structures will be designed for 25-
year storm frequencies at a minimum. Both measures will maintain soil losses to
a minimum during:
      (1)   The construction period for any type improvement thereon; or,
      (2)   The changes being made in the land contours thereof; or,
      (3)   The removal or destruction of topsoil, trees, and other vegetation
located thereon.
   C.   The location, construction, and maintenance program of temporary
sediment basins (debris basins, de-silting basins, or silt traps) or other
control measures in the subdivision.
A statement of the time period within which temporary control measures will be
removed after construction ends and be replaced by permanent measures.
   D.   The type of permanent and final vegetation and structures that will be
planted or installed on the described premises.
A statement of the time period within which all vegetation and structures are
to be planted or installed.
   E.   In those instances where five or more acres of any subdivision will be
disturbed at any one time, the subdivider will acquire a National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit and submit a copy to the City prior
to receiving authorization to proceed with site development.
2.   County Soil Conservation District Recommendations. The submitted plan from
the subdivider will incorporate the appropriate recommendations, if any, of the
County Soil Conservation District.
If any of the Soil Conservation District’s recommendations are not incorporated
into the plan, the subdivider will set forth, in writing as part of the
platting procedure, the reasons for the deletion, and the City will determine
their inclusion or exclusion.
A copy of the approved soil conservation plan will be filed with the County
Soil Conservation District and the City.
175.37   ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICE AND APPOINTMENT OF A BUILDING AND ZONING
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.
1.   Establishment of Position. The position of Building and Zoning Enforcement
Officer has been established in which is vested the duty of the administration
of these regulations as specified herein, and such other related regulations as
are assigned to that office.
2.   Appointment to Office. The Building and Zoning Enforcement Officer is
appointed by the City Administrator and shall be a person who is qualified by
professional or practical training and experience to conduct the affairs of
that position.
175.38   STANDARDS AND MINIMUMS.
These land subdivision regulations are adopted and enforced only as minimum
standards, and all developers may develop their subdivisions at higher
standards. The subdivider is encouraged, at any time, to surpass these
regulations.
175.39   AMENDMENTS TO AND REQUIRED OF THIS CHAPTER.
This chapter will be reviewed, in its entirety, not less than once every 10
years by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Amendments to this subdivision
chapter may be made by the Council as provided by statute. No amendment will be
adopted without first referring the proposed amendment to the Planning and
Zoning Commission and receiving a written recommendation therefrom. However, if
no recommendation is received within 90 days, the amendment will be deemed to
be approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
175.40   BUILDING PERMITS.
No building permit will be issued by the City for the construction of any
building or structure, within a subdivision as defined herein, which has been
approved for platting or re-platting, until the required utilities have been
installed and made ready to service the property, and streets providing access
to the subject lot or lots have been reconstructed or are in the process of
being constructed, or unless specifically approved for issuance, in writing, by
the Council.
175.41   OCCUPANCY PERMITS.
No occupancy permit will be granted by any governing official for the use of
any building or structure within a subdivision approved for platting or re-
platting until the required utilities have been installed and made ready to
service the property, and streets providing access to the subject lot or lots
have been reconstructed or are in the process of being constructed, or unless
the provisions of Section
170.38 have been met in full, or unless specifically approved for issuance, in
writing, by the Council. Notwithstanding the provisions enumerated above,
occupancy permits may be granted where a cash bond is filed with the City for
incomplete subdivision improvements. The cash bond will be on a form approved
by the City and will be in the amount of 150 percent of the cost of completing
the remaining improvements. The exact amount of the cash bond and the date the
bond may be called by the City, if improvements are not completed, will be
determined by the City at its sole discretion. In addition, a waiver of
liability will be executed by the subdivider, which will hold the City and the
public harmless for any damages that may be caused to yet unaccepted
improvements by their use of incomplete facilities, and will be filed with the
City along with the cost of recording said waiver. No occupancy permit will be
granted where the total estimated cost of the incomplete subdivision
improvements necessary to serve the lot(s) exceed $20,000.00 or when, in the
determination of the City, the streets are inadequate to allow City services to
be provided to the lot.
175.42   APPROVAL REQUIRED - RESTRICTIONS ON UNAPPROVED PLATS.
1.   No plat of any subdivision will be recorded in the County Recorder’s
Office or have any validity until it has been approved in the manner prescribed
in this Code.
2.   Any subdivision or resubdivision platted after the adoption of this Code,
which has not been approved in accordance with the provisions contained in this
title, will be subject to the following:
   A.   No building or repair permits will be issued for any structure located
therein.
