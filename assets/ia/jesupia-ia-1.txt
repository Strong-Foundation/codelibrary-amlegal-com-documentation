A person may submit a proposal to the City Council to receive prior approval
for eligibility for a tax exemption on new construction. If the City Council
resolves to consider such proposal, it shall publish notice and hold a public
hearing thereon. Thereafter, at least thirty (30) days after such hearing, the
City Council, by ordinance, may give its prior approval of a tax exemption for
new construction if the new construction is in conformance with City zoning.
Such prior approval shall not entitle the owner to exemption from taxation
until the new construction has been completed and found to be qualified real
estate.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 427B.4)
8.08Â Â Â EXEMPTION REPEALED.

46.02 Cigarettes and Tobacco 46.04 Minors in Billiard Rooms
Â 
46.01Â Â Â CURFEW.
The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote the
public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and specifically
to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults responsible for
minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors committed after
the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences and criminal
activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.
1.Â Â Â Definitions. For use in this section, the following terms are defined:

of life.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â â€œKnowinglyâ€ means knowledge that a responsible adult should reasonably
be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that responsible
adultâ€™s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful or careless
adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult responsibility
through an objective test. It is therefore no defense that an adult responsible
for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or
whereabouts of the minor.

years.

secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically
accompanied by a law enforcement officer or a person employed by the facility
where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to
providing nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate
juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the personâ€™s
parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but
not for longer than six (6) hours without the oral or written order of a judge
or magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â â€œPublic placeâ€ includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys, and sidewalks dedicated to public use and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises, whether publicly or privately owned,
that are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited
commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is
permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has

custody or control of a minor.

following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Minorâ€™s place of employment in a business, trade or occupation in
which the minor is permitted by law to be engaged or, if traveling, within one

Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in the

a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance, use his
or her best judgment in determining age.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody. Grounds for arrest are that
the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the personâ€™s
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any nonsecured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into
custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into custody,
the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the minor as
soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible for the
minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at such
time as the court may direct.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minorâ€™s parent, guardian or other person
legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the
law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative
of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person
who is known to the child.
6.Â Â Â Penalties.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Responsible Adultâ€™s First Violation. In the case of a first violation
by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall, by certified mail, send to the

that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew
ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with applicable
penalties.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Responsible Adultâ€™s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as defined
in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows the minor
to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a municipal
infraction.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Minorâ€™s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a minor,
the law enforcement officer shall give the minor a written warning, which
states that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the
curfew ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with applicable
penalties, or, at the law enforcement officerâ€™s discretion, may issue the minor
a citation for a first violation.

claim, or interest of the owner, lienholders, or claimants after the expiration
of the 10-day reclaiming period.

and addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders, notice by one
publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the
vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice

1Â Â Â Deep and shallow wells, as defined in 567-40.2 (455B): A deep well is a
well located and constructed in such a manner that there is a continuous layer
of low permeability soil or rock at least 5 feet thick located at least 25 feet
below the normal ground surface and above the aquifer from which water is to be
drawn. A shallow well is a well located and constructed in such a manner that
there is not a continuous layer of low permeability soil or rock (or equivalent
retarding mechanism acceptable to the department) at least 5 feet thick, the
top of which is located at least 25 feet below the normal ground surface and
above the aquifer from which water is to be drawn.
2Â Â Â The separation distances are dependent upon two factors: the type of piping
that is in the existing sewer or drain, as noted in the table, and that the
piping was properly installed in accordance with the standards.
3Â Â Â Solid wastes are those derived from the treatment of water or wastewater.
Certain types of solid wastes from water treatment processes may be
landâ€“applied within the separation distance on an individual, case-by-case
basis.
4Â Â Â Solid waste means garbage, refuse, rubbish, and other similar discarded
solid or semisolid materials, including but not limited to such materials
resulting from industrial, commercial, agricultural, and domestic activities.

on, over or under the right-of-way of any public street or alley in the City in
such a manner as the City may reasonably require for the purposes of
facilitating the construction, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of the

removals does not coincide with the Company facilities relocation schedule and
the Company must remove trees that are included in the Cityâ€™s portion of the
project, the City shall either remove the trees or reimburse the Company for

not deprive the Company of its right to operate and maintain existing
facilities on, below, above, or beneath the vacated property. Prior to the City
abandoning or vacating any street, avenue, alley or public ground where the
Company has electric facilities in the vicinity, the City shall provide Company
with not less than sixty (60) days advance notice of the cityâ€™s proposed action

before the last business day of the calendar quarter following the close of the
calendar quarter in which the franchise fee is charged.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The City agrees to modify the level of franchise fees imposed only once
in any 24-month period. Any such ordinance exempting classes of customers,
increasing, decreasing, modifying or eliminating the franchise fee shall become
effective, and billings reflecting the change shall commence on an agreed upon
date which is not less than sixty (60) days following written notice to the
Company by certified mail. The Company shall not be required to implement such
new ordinance unless and until it determines that it has received appropriate
official documentation of final action by the City Council.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The City recognizes the administrative burden collecting franchise fees
imposes upon the Company and the Company requires lead time to commence
collecting said franchise fees. The Company will commence collecting franchise
fees on or before the first Company billing cycle of the first calendar month
following ninety (90) days of receipt of information required of the City to
implement the franchise fee, including the Cityâ€™s documentation of customer
classes subject to or exempted from City-imposed franchise fee. The City shall
provide the information and data required in a form and format acceptable to
the Company. The Company will, if requested by the City, provide the City with
a list of premises considered by the Company to be within the corporate limits
of the City.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The City shall be solely responsible for identifying customer classes
subject to or exempt from paying the City imposed franchise fee. The City shall
be solely responsible for notifying Company of its corporate limits, including,
over time, annexations or other alterations thereto, and customer classes that
it wishes to subject to, or to the extent permitted by law, exempt from paying
the franchise fee. The City shall provide to the Company, by certified mail,
copies of annexation ordinances in a timely manner to ensure appropriate
franchise fee collection from customers within the corporate limits of the
City. The Company shall have no obligation to collect franchise fees from
customers in annexed areas until and unless such ordinances have been provided
to the Company by certified mail. The Company shall commence collecting
franchise fees in the annexed areas no sooner than sixty (60) days after
receiving annexation ordinances from the City.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The City shall indemnify the Company from claims of any nature arising
out of or related to the imposition and collection of the franchise fee. In
addition, the Company shall not be liable for collecting franchise fees from
any customer originally or subsequently identified, or incorrectly identified,
by the City as being subject to the franchise fee or being subject to a
different level of franchise fees or being exempt from the imposition of
franchise fees.

of any changes made in this collection schedule, including any alterations in
the calendar quarters or any other changes in the remittance periods.

not charged directly to the City and agrees it shall, if required by the
Company, reimburse the Company for any initial or ongoing costs incurred by the
Company in collecting franchise fees that Company in its sole opinion deems to
be in excess of typical costs of franchise fee administration.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â The Company shall not, under any circumstances be required to return or
refund any franchise fees that have been collected from City customers and
remitted to the City. In the event the Company is required to provide data or
information in defense of the City's imposition of franchise fees or the
Company is required to assist the City in identifying customers or calculating
any franchise fee refunds for groups of or individual customers the City shall
reimburse the Company for the expenses incurred by the Company to provide such
data or information.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â The obligation to collect and remit the fee imposed by this ordinance
is modified or repealed if:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Any other person is authorized to sell electricity at retail to City
consumers and the City imposes a franchise fee or its lawful equivalent at zero
or a lesser rate than provided in this ordinance, in which case the obligation
of Company to collect and remit franchise fee shall be modified to zero or the
lesser rate;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The City adds additional territory by annexation or consolidation
and is unable or unwilling to impose the franchise fee upon all persons selling
electricity at retail to consumers within the additional territory, in which
case the franchise fee imposed on the revenue from sales by Company in the
additional territory shall be zero or equal to that of the lowest fee being
paid by any other retail seller of electricity within the City; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Legislation is enacted by the Iowa General Assembly or the Supreme
Court of Iowa issues a final ruling regarding franchise fees or the Iowa
Utilities Board issues a final nonappealable order (collectively, â€œfinal
franchise fee actionâ€) that modifies, but does not repeal, the ability of the
City to impose a franchise fee or the ability of Company to collect from City
customers and remit franchise fees to City. Within 60 days of final franchise
fee action, the City shall notify Company and the parties shall meet to
determine whether this ordinance can be revised, and, if so, how to revise the
franchise fee on a continuing basis to meet revised legal requirements. After
final franchise fee action and until passage by the City of revisions to the
franchise fee ordinance, Company may temporarily discontinue collection and
remittance of the franchise fee if in its sole opinion it believes it is
required to do so in order to comply with revised legal requirements.
Â Â Â The other provisions of this ordinance to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Company shall be completely relieved of its obligation to collect and remit to
the City the franchise fee as, effective as the date specified below with no
liability therefore under each of any of the following circumstances as
determined to exist in the sole discretion of Company:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Any of the imposition, collection or remittance of a franchise fee
is ruled to be unlawful by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date
of such ruling or as may be specified by that Court.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The Iowa General Assembly enacts legislation making imposition,
collection or remittance of a franchise fee unlawful, effective as of the date
lawfully specified by the General Assembly.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The Iowa Utilities Board, or its successor agency, denies the
Company the right to impose, collect or remit a franchise fee provided such
denial is affirmed by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date of
the final agency order from which the appeal is taken.
111.15Â Â Â MANAGEMENT FEES.
The City shall not, pursuant to Chapter 480A.6 of the Code of Iowa, impose or
charge right of way management fees upon the Company or fees for permits for
Company construction, maintenance, repairs, excavation, pavement cutting or
inspections of Company work sites and projects or related matters.
111.16Â Â Â TERMINATION.
Either City or Company (â€œpartyâ€) may terminate this franchise if the other
party shall be materially in breach of its provisions. Upon the occurrence of a
material breach, the non-breaching party shall provide the breaching party with
notification by certified mail specifying the alleged breach. The breaching
party shall have sixty (60) days to cure the breach, unless it notifies the
non-breaching party, and the parties agree upon a longer period for cure. If
the breach is not cured within the cure period, the non-breaching party may
terminate this franchise. A party shall not be considered to be in breach of
this franchise if it has operated in compliance with state or federal law. A
Party shall not be considered to have breached this franchise if the alleged
breach is the result of the actions of a third party or the other party.

permits and directions of the City and of any agency of the City having
jurisdiction over its acts or defaults under the franchise or this chapter, and
its payment of any claims, liens and taxes due the City which arise by reason

or default of the Grantee in connection with the franchise, or fails, after
three daysâ€™ notice, to comply with any provisions of the franchise which the
Council reasonably determines can be remedied by an expenditure from the
security fund, the City may immediately withdraw or claim from surety the
amount thereof, with interest and any penalties, and, upon such withdrawal, the

the return of any security fund or the portion thereof then remaining on
deposit, provided that there is then no outstanding default on the part of the
Grantee. Interest earned by the investment of the security fund shall accrue to

160.02Â Â Â STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
1.Â Â Â The Legislature of the State of Iowa has, in Chapter 414 of the Code of
Iowa, as amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to
secure safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
2.Â Â Â Findings of Fact.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation
which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of
the community.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by:
(i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
3.Â Â Â Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Paragraph 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows so
that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03Â Â Â GENERAL PROVISIONS.

160.05Â Â Â ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOODPLAIN (OVERLAY) DISTRICT.
The floodplain areas within the jurisdiction of this chapter are hereby divided
into the following districts:
1.Â Â Â Floodplain (Overlay) District. Those areas identified as Zone A on the
Official Floodplain Zoning Map established in Section
160.03(2) of this chapter.
The boundaries shall be as shown on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map. Within
these districts, all uses not allowed as permitted uses are prohibited unless a
variance to the terms of this chapter is granted after due consideration by the
Board of Adjustment.
160.06Â Â Â STANDARDS FOR FLOODPLAIN (OVERLAY) DISTRICT.
All development must be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and
meet the following applicable performance standards. Where base flood
elevations and floodway data have not been provided in the Flood Insurance
Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute
such data. The applicant will be responsible for providing the Department of
Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make such
determination.
1.Â Â Â All Development. All development within the Floodplain (Overlay) District
shall:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood damage.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant to
flood damage.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Obtain all other necessary permits from federal, State, and local
governmental agencies including approval when required from the Iowa Department
of Natural Resources.
2.Â Â Â Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the base flood elevation. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed subject to favorable
consideration by the Board of Adjustment, where existing topography, street
grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods
used must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various
forces and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential structures
located in areas that would become isolated due to flooding of surrounding
ground shall be provided with a means of access that will be passable by
wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this criterion shall not apply
where the Administrator determines there is sufficient flood warning time for
the protection of life and property. When estimating flood warning time,
consideration shall be given to the criteria listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa
Administrative Code.
3.Â Â Â Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be flood proofed to such a level. When
flood proofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State of
Iowa shall certify that the flood proofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and
other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the
base flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
4.Â Â Â All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including basements)
that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A minimum of two openings, with positioning on at least two walls,
having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot
of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access and
low damage potential storage. Where the distance between the floor and ceiling
of the fully enclosed area below the lowest floor is five feet or more, the
applicant shall be required to sign and record with the Buchanan County
Recorder a Non-Conversion Agreement that ensures the lower enclosed area
remains compliant with the criteria outlined in this subsection.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures must be constructed with
electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and
other service facilities elevated or flood proofed to a minimum of one foot
above the base flood elevation.
5.Â Â Â Factory-Built Homes.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including those
placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be elevated
on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the structure is a
minimum of one foot above the base flood level.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including those
placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be anchored
to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may
include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground
anchors. Anchorage systems may include, but are not limited to, use of over-
the-top or frame ties to ground anchors as required by the State Building Code.
6.Â Â Â Utility and Sanitary Systems.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located or
designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system as well as
the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment facilities
(other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood protection
equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood elevation.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water supply
treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a
level of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood
elevation.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
7.Â Â Â Storage of Materials and Equipment. Storage of equipment and materials
that are flammable, explosive, or injurious to human, animal, or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or:
(i) not subject to major flood damage and be anchored to prevent movement due
to flood waters; or (ii) readily removable from the area within the time
available after flood warning.
8.Â Â Â Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as levees,

consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements of
Subsection 5 of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built
homes.
13.Â Â Â Pipeline Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be buried
in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent
rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
14.Â Â Â Maximum Damage Potential Development. All new or substantially improved
maximum damage potential development shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated a minimum of one foot above the elevation of the 500-year
flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed
to such a level. When flood proofing is utilized, a professional engineer
registered in the State of Iowa shall certify that the flood proofing methods
used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact
and uplift forces and other factors associated with the base flood; and that
the structure, below the base flood elevation is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water. A record of the
certification indicating the specific elevation (in relation toÂ North American
Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are flood proofed shall be
maintained by the Administrator. Where 0.2% chance flood elevation data has not
been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The applicant will be
responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient
technical information to make such determinations.
160.07Â Â Â ESTABLISHMENT OF APPEAL AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide: (i) appeals; and (ii) requests
for variances to the provisions of this chapter, and shall take any other
action which is required of the Board.
1.Â Â Â Appeals. Where it is alleged there is any error in any order, requirement,
decision, or determination made by the Administrator (or any administrative
official) in the enforcement of this chapter, the aggrieved party may appeal
such action. The notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board of Adjustment
and with the official from whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the
specific reason for the appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken
shall transmit to the Board of Adjustment all the documents constituting the
record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
2.Â Â Â Variance. The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in specific
cases such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary
hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection
for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the applicant
shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator that: (i)
the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage;
and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
3.Â Â Â Hearings and Decisions of the Board of Adjustment.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Hearings. Upon the filing with the Board of Adjustment of an appeal or
a request for a variance, the Board shall hold a public hearing. The Board
shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing and give public notice thereof, as
well as due notice to parties in interest. At the hearing, any party may appear
in person or by agent or attorney and present written or oral evidence. The
Board may require the appellant or applicant to provide such information as is
reasonably deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or
evaluation of a professional engineer or other expert person or agency,
including the Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal or
variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an appeal, the Board may, so
long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter,
reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision in
writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision.
In granting a variance, the Board shall consider such factors as contained in
this section and all other relevant sections of this chapter and may prescribe
such conditions as contained in Subsection 5 of this section.
4.Â Â Â Factors Upon Which the Decisions of the Board of Adjustment Shall be
Based. In passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or downstream
to the injury of others.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
City.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for
the proposed use.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for the area.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood water expected at the site.
Â Â Â L.Â Â Â The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
Â Â Â M.Â Â Â Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this chapter.
5.Â Â Â Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such
conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:

Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative to achieving
the purpose of this chapter.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the flood
protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration, rate
of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated with
the regulatory flood. The Board of Adjustment shall require that the applicant
submit a plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that
the flood proofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
6.Â Â Â Appeals to the Court. Any person or persons, jointly or severally,
aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Adjustment may present to a court of
record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal,
in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition
shall be presented to the court within 30 days after the filing of the decision
in the office of the Board.
160.08Â Â Â NONCONFORMING USES.
1.Â Â Â A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before
the passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but which
is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be continued
subject to the following conditions:

entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless
it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary, building or safety codes or regulations or the
cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
designation.
2.Â Â Â Except as provided in Subsection 1 of this section, any use which has been
permitted as a variance shall be considered a conforming use.
160.09Â Â Â PENALTY FOR VIOLATION.
Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with grants of variances) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any
person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its
requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $500.00. Each
day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing
herein contained shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful action as

The Board of Adjustment, as established under applicable provisions of the Code
of Iowa, is the Board referred to in
Chapters 165A through
165D of this Code of Ordinances.
1.Â Â Â Appointment; Terms; Removal. The Board shall consist of five members, who
are residents of the City, to be appointed by the Mayor and subject to approval
by the Council for a term of five years except when the Board shall first be
created, one member shall be appointed for a term of five years, one for a term
of four years, one for a term of three years, one for a term of two years, and
one for a term of one year. A majority of the members of the Board shall be
persons representing the
publicÂ atÂ large.Â Â TheÂ BoardÂ ofÂ AdjustmentÂ membersÂ shallÂ notÂ alsoÂ beÂ membersÂ ofÂ the
Planning and Zoning Commission or be City staff, and members shall not hold an

Board may be removed from office by the City Council for cause upon written
charges and after public hearing. Vacancies shall be filled by the Mayor,
subject to City Council approval, for the unexpired term of the
memberÂ affected.
2.Â Â Â Powers and Duties. The Board of Adjustment is hereby vested with the
following powers and duties:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â To hear and decide all applications for variances from the terms

in the enforcement of the Zoning Code. The Board shall also interpret the
Official Zoning Map, ifÂ necessary.
3.Â Â Â Meetings and Rules. The Board shall adopt rules necessary to the conduct
of its affairs, and in keeping with the provisions of this section. Meetings
shall be held at the call of the chairperson and at such other times as the
Board may determine. The chairperson, or in his absence, the acting
chairperson, may administer oaths and compel attendance of witnesses. All
meetings shall be open to theÂ public.
4.Â Â Â Meeting Minutes and Records. The Board shall keep minutes of its
proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each agenda item requiring
action, or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep
records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be
public record and be filed in the offices of the Zoning Administrator and City
Clerk.
5.Â Â Â Voting. The concurring vote of three members of the Board shall be
necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of the
Zoning Administrator, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon
which it is required to pass under this title, or to effect any variation in
application of thisÂ title.
6.Â Â Â Finality of Decisions of the Board of Adjustment. All decisions and
findings of the Board of Adjustment on appeals applications, applications for
variances, or applications for special exceptions, after a hearing, shall, in
all instances, be the final administrative decisions and shall be subject to
judicial review as is stated in the Code ofÂ Iowa.
165B.06Â Â Â ZONING VARIANCES.
The Board of Adjustment, after a public hearing, may determine and vary the
Zoning Code in harmony with their general purpose and intent, only in the
specific instances hereinafter set forth, where the Board of Adjustment makes
written findings of fact in accordance with the standards hereinafter
prescribed and further, finds that there are no practical difficulties or
particular hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the Zoning
Code.
1.Â Â Â Application for Variance. An application for a variance shall be filed in
writing with the Zoning Administrator. Said application shall contain such
information, and appropriate non-refundable fee, as the Board of Adjustment
may, by rules,Â require.
2.Â Â Â Hearing on Application. Upon receipt in proper form of the application
referred to in Subsection 1, the Board of Adjustment shall hold at least one
public hearing on the proposed variance. Notice of time and place of such
hearing shall be published not less than seven days nor more than 20 days in
advance of the public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the
City. Property owners within 200 feet of the property for which the change is
being requested shall be notified as a courtesy as well. Before an application
is filed with the Board of Adjustment, the applicant shall pay a non-refundable
fee to the City to cover the publishing and administration costs of said
request, per the adopted fee schedule established in SectionÂ 
165B.15.
3.Â Â Â Standards for Variance. The Board of Adjustment shall not vary the
regulations of the Zoning Code, as authorized in this section, unless there is
evidence presented to it in each specific caseÂ that:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Special conditions and circumstances exist which are unique to the
land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district. Special conditions shall
include but not be limited to a property owner who can show that their property
was acquired in good faith and where by reason of exceptional narrowness,
shallowness, or shape of a specific piece of property, or where by reason of
exceptional topographic conditions or other exceptional or extraordinary
situations the strict application of the terms of the Zoning Code actually
prohibits the use of the property in manner reasonably similar to that of other
property in theÂ district.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Literal interpretation of the provisions of the Zoning Code would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the
same district under the terms of the Zoning Code. In other words, an
unnecessary hardship would result from literal enforcement of the Zoning Code.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of
the applicant.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any
special privilege that is denied by the Zoning Code to other lands, structures,
or buildings in the same district.
4.Â Â Â Further Requirements.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The Board of Adjustment shall make a finding that the reasons set forth
in the application justify the granting of the variance, and that the variance
is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land,
building, orÂ structure.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The Board of Adjustment shall further make a finding that the granting
of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the
Zoning Code and the Comprehensive Plan, and will not be injurious to the
neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental to the publicÂ welfare.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the Zoning Code.
Violations ofÂ such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this title
and punishableÂ under Section
165B.16.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Under no circumstances shall the Board of Adjustment grant a variance
to allow for a use not permissible under the terms of the Zoning Code in the
district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the
terms of the Zoning Code in the district.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â If property lines cannot be determined through existing surveys or
property markers, the request must be accompanied by a certifiedÂ survey.
5.Â Â Â Denial and Revocation ofÂ Variance.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Denial: No application for a variance that has been denied wholly or in
part by the Board of Adjustment shall be resubmitted for a period of one year
from the date of denial, except on the grounds of new evidence or proof of
change of conditions that may be found to be valid by the Board ofÂ Adjustment.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Revocation: In any case where variance has not been established within
one year after the date of granting thereof, the Board shall provide notice to
the applicant that the approved variance may be revoked. Said notice shall
offer the applicant an opportunity to be heard by the Board of Adjustment. The
Board may, after this process, revoke or extend the approvedÂ variance.
165B.07Â Â Â SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS.
The development and administration of this Zoning Code is based upon the
division of the City into zoning districts, within said districts the use of
land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in
relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized that there are
certain uses, because of their unique characteristics, which cannot be properly
classified in any particular district or districts, without special
consideration in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land
and of the public need for the particular use that locations. Such special
exceptions fall into two categories: (i) uses publicly operated or
traditionally affected with a public interest; and (ii) uses entirely private
in character, but of such an unusual nature that their operation may give rise
to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property or
publicÂ facilities.
1.Â Â Â Initiation of Special Exceptions. Any person having a freehold interest in
land, a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, or a contractual
interest which may become a freehold interest of an exclusive possessory
interest, either of which is specifically enforceable, may file an application
to use such land for one or more of the special exceptions provided for in the
Zoning Code in the zoning district in which the land isÂ located.
2.Â Â Â Application for Special Exception. An application for a special exception
shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator on a form as the Zoning
Administrator shall prescribe.Â Â The application shall be accompanied by an
appropriate non-refundable fee and such plans and date prescribed by the Board
of Adjustment and shall include a statement indicating the sections of the
Zoning Code under which the special exception is sought and stating the grounds
on which it isÂ requested.
3.Â Â Â Hearing on Application. Upon receipt in proper form of the application and
statement referred to in Subsection 2, the Board of Adjustment shall hold at
least one public hearing on the proposed special exception. Notice of time and
place of such hearing shall be published not less than seven days nor more than
20 days in advance of the public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation
in the City. Property owners withinÂ 200 feet of the property for which the
exception is being requested shall be notified as a courtesy as well. Before an
application is filed with the Board of Adjustment, the applicant shall pay a
non-refundable fee to the City to cover the publishing and administration costs
of said request, per the adopted fee schedule established in Section
165B.15.
4.Â Â Â Authorization. For each application for a special exception the Zoning
Administrator shall prepare and file with the Board of Adjustment findings and
recommendations, including the recommended stipulations of additional
conditions and guarantees that are deemed necessary for the protection of the
publicÂ interest.
5.Â Â Â Standards. No special exception shall be granted by the Board of
Adjustment unless such Board shallÂ find:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â That the establishment, maintenance, or operation of the special
exception will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety,
morals, comfort, or generalÂ welfare;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â That the special exception will not be injurious to the use and
enjoyment of other property already permitted, nor substantially diminish and
impair property values within theÂ neighborhood;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â That the establishment of special exceptions will not impede the normal
and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses
permitted in theÂ district;
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and necessary
facilities have been or are being provided and that the request not impair an
adequate supply of air or light to adjacentÂ properties;
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress
and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public
streets;Â 
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â That the special exception shall, in all other respects, conform to the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such
regulations may, in each instance, be modified by the Board of Adjustment; and
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â That the special exception shall be consistent with the Comprehensive
Plan and the Zoning Code.
6.Â Â Â Conditions and Guarantees. Prior to the granting of any special use, the
Board of Adjustment shall stipulate such conditions and restrictions upon the
establishment, location, construction, maintenance, and operation of the
special exception as is deemed necessary for the protection of the public
interest and to secureÂ complianceÂ withÂ the
standardsÂ andÂ requirementsÂ specifiedÂ inÂ Subsection 5 above. In all cases in
which special exceptions are granted, the Board of Adjustment shall require
such evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary as proof that the
conditions stipulated in connection therewith are being, and will be,Â met.
7.Â Â Â Denial and Revocation of SpecialÂ Exception.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Denial: No application for a special exception that has been denied
wholly or in part by the Board of Adjustment shall be resubmitted for a period
of one year from the date of denial, except on the grounds of new evidence or
proof of change of conditions found to be valid by the Board ofÂ Adjustment.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Revocation: In any case where special exception has not been
established within one year after the date of granting thereof, the Board shall
provide notice to the applicant that the approved exception may be revoked.
Said notice shall offer the applicant an opportunity to be heard by the Board
of Adjustment. The Board may, after this process, revoke or extend the
approvedÂ exception.
165B.08Â Â Â APPEALS AND OTHER POWERS OF THE BOARD.
1.Â Â Â Appeals.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Appeals to the Board of Adjustment may be taken by any person
aggrieved, or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the City affected
by a decision of the Zoning Administrator. Such appeal shall be taken to the
Board within a reasonable time, as prescribed by the Boardâ€™s rules of
procedure. The Zoning Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Board all
the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from
isÂ taken.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
from, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Board, after notice of
appeal shall have been filed, that by reason of the facts stated in the
certificate a stay would, in the Administratorâ€™s opinion, cause imminent peril
to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise
than by a restraining order that may be granted by the Board or by a court of
record on application of notice to the Zoning Administrator and due cause
shown.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The Board shall hold one public hearing and shall give a reasonable
time for the hearing on the appeal. Notice of time and place of such hearing
shall be published not less than seven days nor more than 20 days in advance of
the public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the City. Property
owners within 200 feet of the property for which the exception is being
requested shall be notified as a courtesy as well. Before an application is
filed with the Board of Adjustment, the applicant shall pay a non-refundable
fee to the City of Jesup to cover the publishing and administration costs of
said request, per the adopted fee schedule established in Section 165B.15. In
exercising the above-mentioned powers, the Board may, in conformity with the
provisions of the law, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or modify the
order, requirement, decision, or determination as it believes proper and to
that end will have the powers of the Zoning Administrator. The concurring vote
of three members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order,
requirement, decision, or determination of the Zoning Administrator, or to
decide in favor of the applicant on any matter which it is required to pass
under the Zoning Code, provided that the action of the Board shall not become
effective until after the written decision or resolution of the Board, setting
forth the full reason for its decision and the vote of each participating
member, has been recorded in the minutes. Said written decision or resolution
shall be filed in the office of the Zoning Administrator and shall be open to
public inspection.
2.Â Â Â Other Powers of the Board ofÂ Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment is hereby
vested with the additional authority and jurisdiction to interpret the Official
Zoning Map. Where the application of the rules for interpretation of district
boundaries contained in Section
165A.09 leaves a reasonable doubt to the boundary between two zoning districts,
the Board of Adjustment, after notice to the owners of the property and after
public hearing, shall interpret the Official Zoning Map in such a way as to
carry out the intent and purposes of the Zoning Code.
165B.09Â Â Â APPEALS OF BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT DECISIONS.
Any person or persons, or any board, taxpayer, department, or board or bureau
of the City aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Adjustment may seek
review by a court of record of said decision, in the manner provided by the
laws of the State and particularly by the Code of Iowa.
165B.10Â Â Â AMENDMENTS.
The Zoning Code regulations, restrictions, and boundaries may from time to
time, be amended, supplemented, changed, modified, or repealed by the City
Council. No such amendments shall be made final without: (i) the applicant
completing a rezoning application; (ii) holding a public hearing before the
Planning and Zoning Commission, who shall thereafter send a recommendation to
the City Council; and (iii) after a public hearing is held by the City Council
and the proper amendment process is followed.
1.Â Â Â The notice of the time and place of the hearings shall be published in a
newspaper with general circulation in the City not less than seven days nor
more than 20 days before either of the public hearings. In no case shall the

2.Â Â Â In the case of a protest filed with the City Council against such change
signed by the owners of 20 percent or more, either of the area of the lots
included in such proposed change or of those immediately adjacent to, not to
exceed 200 feet, such amendments shall not be passed except by the favorable
vote of three-fourths of all members of the City Council.
3.Â Â Â As part of an amendment to the Zoning Code, changing land from one zoning
district to another zoning district, or as part of approving a site development
plan, the City Council may impose conditions on a property owner which are in
addition to existing regulations if the additional conditions have been agreed
to in writing by the property owner before the public hearing required under
this section or any adjournment of that hearing. The conditions must be
reasonable and imposed to satisfy public needs that are directly caused by the
requested change.
4.Â Â Â Rezoning Application: An application for rezoning shall contain the
followingÂ items:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The legal description and local address, if applicable, of the property

as established in Section
165B.15. The applicant shall pay this fee to the credit of the general revenue
fund of the City. Failure to approve the change, by either the Planning and
Zoning Commission or City Council, will not be construed as any reason for
refunding the fee to theÂ applicant.
165B.11Â Â Â BUILDING CONSTRUCTION.
The City will utilize the more restrictive of either the Zoning Code or the
Building Code, as may be amended and adopted by the City, for building
construction standards and certificates. No building or structure shall
hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered, repaired,
moved, improved, removed, converted, or demolished unless a separate permit for
each building or structure has first been obtained from the Building Official.
Said permit and the application for the permit shall contain a plot plan
showing the actual dimensions of the lot to be built upon, the size, shape, and
location of the building or structure to be erected or affected, the name and
address of the owner or owners of the involved lot, and such other information
as may be necessary to provide for the enforcement of the Zoning Code. The
application and permit shall be on forms prepared by the Building Official and

which the permit is issued within six months from and after the date of issue
of said permit, and is bound to finish said construction within 12 months from
and after said date of issue. Failure to commence construction within six
months shall cause the permit to expire. A building permit issued under the
provisions of this chapter shall be valid for a period of 12 months from and
after the date of issue of said permit. Upon expiration of a permit, the holder
shall make a new application for a new permit under the provisions of the
Zoning Code and shall otherwise go through the same procedure as required for
issuance of the original building permit. The fee for the second permit, as in
the case of the original permit fee, shall be set by resolution by the
CityÂ Council.

Code.
165B.14Â Â Â CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
No change in the use or occupancy of land, nor any change in use or occupancy
in an existing building shall be made, nor shall any new building be occupied
for any purpose or use until a certificate of occupancy, permanent or
temporary, has been issued by the Building Official. Every certificate of
occupancy, permanent or temporary, shall state that the new occupancy complies,
or upon completion will comply, with the provisions of the Zoning Code.
Temporary certificates of occupancy may be issued by the Building Official at
his discretion. If a temporary certificate of occupancy is issued by the
Building Official, it shall be valid for a period of six months unless extended
by the Building Official after making a finding of extenuatingÂ circumstances.
165B.15Â Â Â APPLICATIONS AND NON-REFUNDABLE FEES.
The Zoning Administrator is instructed to issue permits upon proper
applications under the Zoning Code, and charge a non-refundable fee as

of the Zoning Code is being violated, he shall notify in writing the person
responsible for such violations, indicating the nature of the violation and
ordering the action necessary to correct it. The Building Official shall order:
discontinuance of illegal buildings or structures or of additions, alterations,
or structural changes thereto; discontinuance of any illegal work being done;
or shall take any other action authorized by the Zoning Code or by this Code of
Ordinances to insure compliance with, or to prevent violation of, its
provisions.
2.Â Â Â Responsibility. The owners or tenants of any building, structure, land, or
part thereof and any architect, builder, contractor, agent, or other person who
commits, participates in, assists in, or maintains a violation of the Zoning
Code may each be charged with a separate offense and upon conviction suffer the
penalties herein provided.
3.Â Â Â City Remedies. If any building or structure is erected, constructed,
reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted, or maintained, or any building,
structure, or land is used in violation of the Zoning Code, the City may, in
addition to other remedies, institute an injunction, municipal infraction,
mandamus, or other appropriate lawful action necessary to prevent, correct, or
abate such violation. A violation of the Zoning Code shall be deemed a
violation of this Code of Ordinances and, thus, a municipal infraction under
Chapter 3 of this Code of Ordinances and punishable as such. Any construction
started without a permit or which does not comply with the requirements of this
Code of Ordinances shall be removed immediately. The City Council may, without
limitation, provide for abatement of such infraction, pursue civil action in
court, or prosecute such violation, such action to be prosecuted in the name of
the City, or may pursue any combination of remedies. Each day that said
violation is continued shall constitute a separate violation. Nothing in this
section shall limit the remedies and enforcement powers of the City, which
shall include injunctive relief.

Â Â Â D.Â Â Â If located along a State or federal highway, an Iowa Department of
Transportation permit must beÂ obtained.
3.Â Â Â Permit Process. An initial application for a home occupation or home
industry permit shall be completed by the property owner and presented to the
City staff for review and consideration. The staff shall also charge an initial
non-refundable fee, per Section
165B.15 of the Zoning Code, that is to be collected with the completed
application. When reviewing the application, the City staff shall consider the
provisions of the Zoning Code as well as the effect of the proposed home
occupation or home industry upon the character of the neighborhood, traffic
conditions, public utility infrastructure, and other matters pertaining to the
general welfare of theÂ City.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â If approved or issued by the City staff, a home occupation or home
industry permit will be valid until the home occupation or home industry
ceases, or the property changes ownership. Because operating a home occupation
or home industry is a privilege, a previously approved application may be
revoked by the City Council upon substantiated complaint of the surrounding
neighborhood, or upon violation of this Code of Ordinances.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If denied by the City staff or revoked by the City Council, a property
owner must wait for a period of one year before reapplying for a home

Federal regulations and shall be approved, upon the review and recommendation
of the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council, under a standard
taking into consideration public safety, aviation safety, and aesthetics as
well as all setback requirements as outlined in Table 166.05.
3.Â Â Â Meteorological towers may utilize guy wires.
4.Â Â Â Color and Finish. All wind turbines and towers that are part of a
commercial WECS shall be white, grey, or another non-obtrusive color. Blades
may be black in order to facilitate deicing. Finishes shall be matte or non-
reflective. Exceptions may be made for metrological towers, where concerns
exist relative to aerial spray applicators.
5.Â Â Â Lighting. Lightning, including lighting intensity and frequency of strobe,
shall adhere to but not exceed requirements established by Federal Aviation
Administration permits and regulations. Red strobe lights are preferred for
night-time illumination to reduce impacts on migrating birds and for aircraft
awareness. Red pulsating incandescent lights should be avoided. Exceptions may
be made for metrological towers, where concerns exist relative to aerial spray
applicators.
6.Â Â Â Other Signage. All signage on site shall comply with Sign Regulations of
the Jesup Zoning Ordinance. The manufacturerâ€™s or ownerâ€™s company name and/or
logo may be placed upon the nacelle or base of the WECS.
7.Â Â Â Feeder Lines. All communications and feeder lines, equal to or less than
thirty-four and one-half (34.5) kilovolts in capacity, installed as part of a
WECS shall be buried where reasonably feasible.
8.Â Â Â Waste Disposal. Solid and hazardous waste, including but not limited to
crates, packaging materials, damaged or worn parts, as well as used oils and
lubricants, shall be removed from the site promptly and disposed of in
accordance with all applicable local, State, and federal regulations.
9.Â Â Â Impact on Public Infrastructure. Reimbursement of all costs related to
excessive wear and tear to any public infrastructure such as, but not limited
to, County roads and bridges, and to any highway system, storm water management
related improvements and/or public utilities that are caused by the
construction, maintenance, or removal of any WECS shall be reimbursed to the
affected local government. A determination shall be made by the Board of
Supervisors after consultation with the engineer or applicable official to
establish if excessive wear and tear or damage has occurred and to estimate the
costs of repair for said work. Any damage to any haul routes, as determined by
the engineer, shall be reimbursed to the local government affected and shall be
billed to the corporation or company owning said WECS to be paid within forty-
five (45) days of issuance and may be subject to late charges, interest, or
penalties as allowed by law. All haul routes shall be reviewed and approved by
the engineer on use of any County roads prior to construction, maintenance, or
removal of any WECS.
In order to review proposed haul routes and/or work locations, WECS
manufacturer(s) or owner(s) and/or their contractors shall contact the engineer
a minimum of one (1) month prior to starting any work in the City of Jesup. In
addition to the rezoning fee, the applicant must also file a bond in an amount
determined by the City of Jesup and approved by the City Engineer. Said bond
shall be from a surety company authorized to do business in the State of Iowa
and Buchanan County. The bond shall be conditioned that the applicant under
this section will pay to the County any and all damages caused to the streets,
highways, and bridges, by applicant.
10.Â Â Â Shadow Flicker. WECS shall be sited in a manner that does not result in
significant shadow flicker impacts. Significant shadow flicker is deemed to be
more than thirty (30) hours per year on affected occupied structures. The
applicant has the burden of proving that the shadow flicker will not have
significant adverse impact on neighboring or adjacent uses. Potential shadow
flicker will be addressed through siting or mitigation measures.
The owner and operator of a Commercial WECS shall make reasonable efforts to
minimize shadow flicker to any occupied structure on a non-participating
landownerâ€™s property, both through the initial design of the system and as a
result of any shadow flicker complaints occurring after the facility is
operational. A shadow flicker mitigation plan shall be submitted with the
Commercial WECS application, outlining steps that will be taken to minimize
shadow flicker. Reasonable efforts shall include, but not be limited to the
use, of computer modeling to identify optimum location and orientation of each
Commercial WECS and programs to ensure wind turbine blades do not rotate during
times when shadow flicker may adversely affect a non-participating landownerâ€™s
property.
11.Â Â Â Discontinuation and Decommissioning. Any WECS which remains non-
functional or inoperative for a period of one (1) year shall be considered
discontinued, unless a plan is developed and submitted to the Jesup Zoning
Administrator outlining the steps and schedule for returning the WECS to
service.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All WECS and accessory facilities shall be removed to a depth of four
(4) feet including footing and foundations within one-hundred eighty (180) days
of the discontinuation of use.

boundaries. The provisions of this chapter apply to the division of any lot or
parcel of land entered of record in the office of the County Recorder as a
single lot or parcel on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified
in this chapter.
2.Â Â Â Plats within Two Miles of the City. In accordance with the provisions of
Section 354.9 of the Code of Iowa, as amended, a proprietor or other agent
shall file a copy of all preliminary and final subdivision plats, including
minor plats, for the unincorporated areas within Buchanan and Black Hawk
Counties that are within two miles of the City. The City may review and comment

right to review all plats within the extraterritorial area defined herein. The
plat(s) shall be filed with the City Clerk prior to or at the same time as
filing with the County. Approval by one political entity does not automatically
constitute approval by the others unless the political entities have so agreed.
3.Â Â Â Subdivision Classification. Any proposed subdivision or re-subdivision
shall be classified as a minor subdivision or a major subdivision by the Public
Works Director. To aid in this, the proprietor shall submit in writing or other
appropriate documentation the principle features of access, relationship and
location of existing roads, proposed water and sanitary sewer systems, public
utilities and improvements, the number and location of the proposed lots and
other pertinent data or information. Any subdivision may be classified as a
major subdivision at the proprietorâ€™s request.
(Subsection 3 â€“ Ord. 665 â€“ Mar. 25 Supp.)
4.Â Â Â Zoning. Any property proposed for subdivision shall be correctly zoned to
accommodate the proposed uses before the subdivision process is begun.

submit their findings to the Public Works Director.
(Subsection 5 â€“ Ord. 665 â€“ Mar. 25 Supp.)
170.05Â Â Â SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS.
The standards and details of design herein contained are intended only as the
minimum requirements so that the general arrangement and layout of a
subdivision may be adjusted to a wide variety of circumstances. However, in the
design and development of the plat, the proprietor should use standards
consistent with the site conditions so as to assure an economical, pleasant and
desirable neighborhood, and shall conform to design standards as approved by
the City Council.
170.06Â Â Â LAND SUITABILITY.
No land shall be subdivided for residential purposes that is found to be
unsuitable for subdividing by reason of flooding, ponding, poor drainage,
adverse soil conditions, adverse geological formations, unsatisfactory
topography or other features likely to be harmful to the health, safety or
general welfare unless such suitable conditions are corrected to the
satisfaction of the City.
1.Â Â Â If a subdivision is found to be unsuitable for any of the reasons cited in
this section, the Planning and Zoning Commission or City Council shall state
its reasons in writing and afford the proprietor an opportunity to present data
regarding such unsuitability. Thereafter, the Commission or Council may re-
affirm, modify, or withdraw its determination of unsuitability.
2.Â Â Â All lots located within a floodplain shall contain adequate area above the
elevation of flooding for essential and planned installations. All land in a
subdivision that lies in a floodplain shall be:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Identified as such on the individual lots in the preliminary plat, and
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Encouraged to remain as open space for use by all proprietors of lots
in the subdivision with an appropriate instrument providing for its care by
such proprietors.
3.Â Â Â Subdivisions (including mobile home parks) shall be consistent with the
need to minimize flood damages and shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood damage. Development associated with subdivision
proposals shall meet the applicable performance standards.
170.07Â Â Â DESIGN STANDARDS FOR STREETS.
1.Â Â Â Private Streets. Private streets, not dedicated to and accepted by the
City, proposed after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this
chapter are discouraged. If private streets are utilized they shall be built to
public standards, and they shall be platted as such and be under the control of
the subdivision, homeowners association, and/or proprietor.
2.Â Â Â Continuation of Existing Streets. Proposed streets shall provide for
continuation or completion of any existing streets (constructed or recorded) in
adjoining property, at equal or greater width to those defined in subsection 14
of this section.
3.Â Â Â Circulation. The street pattern shall provide ease of circulation within
the subdivision as well as convenient access to adjoining streets,
thoroughfares, or unsubdivided land as may be required by the City so as to not
impede the future growth and development of the community. In a case where a
street will eventually be extended beyond the plan, but is temporarily dead-
ended, an interim turnaround shall be required and built to City standards.
4.Â Â Â Street Intersection. Street intersections shall be as near to right angles
(90 degrees) as possible. Street offsets shall be discouraged; however, if
permitted, there shall be a minimum of 150 feet offset between centerlines of
intersecting streets.
5.Â Â Â Cul-de-Sac. If a cul-de-sac is permitted, such street shall be no longer
than 500 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a turn-a-round
having a street property line diameter of at least 110 feet in the case of
residential subdivisions. The right-of-way width of the street leading to the
turn-a-round shall be equal or greater to those defined in subsection 14 of
this section. The property line at the intersection of the turn-a-round and the
lead-in portion of the street shall be rounded at the radius of not less than
30 feet. A paved cul-de-sac with concrete curb and gutter shall have a minimum
paved diameter of 90 feet measured from the back of the curb to back of curb.
6.Â Â Â Street Names. All newly platted streets shall be named in a manner
consistent with the present street name system. A proposed street that is
obviously in alignment with other existing streets, or with a street that may
be logically extended through the various portions, shall bear the same name.
New street names shall be subject to the recommendation of the Commission and
approval by the Council so as to avoid duplication or similarity of names.
7.Â Â Â Physical and Cultural Features. In general, streets shall be platted with
appropriate regard for topography, creeks, wooded area, and other natural
features which would lend themselves to attractive treatment.
8.Â Â Â Half Streets. Dedication of a half street, which is defined as the area
between the right-of-way line and centerline of one side of a street, will be
prohibited unless there exists a dedicated or platted half street or alley
adjacent to the tract to be subdivided, the other half shall be platted if
recommended by the Commission and approved by the Council.
9.Â Â Â Alleys. Alleys may be required in business areas and industrial districts
for adequate access to block interiors and for off-street loading and parking
purposes. Dead-ended alleys shall be provided with a means of turning around at
the dead end thereof.Â Â Â Â Â Â

easement or drainage easement may be required. The width of such easement shall
be adequate for the anticipated drainage but not less than 20 feet and shall be
