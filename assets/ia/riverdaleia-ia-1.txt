(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.1)
1.04 INDEMNITY.
The applicant for any permit or license under this Code of Ordinances, by
making such application, assumes and agrees to pay for any injury to or death
of any person or persons whomsoever, and any loss of or damage to property
whatsoever, including all costs and expenses incident thereto, however arising

or comply with any of the provisions of this Code of Ordinances or the terms
and conditions of such permit or license, and such applicant, by making such

court where the action is pending, a brief statement of the alleged facts from
which the cause arose, that the City believes that the person notified is
liable to it for any judgment rendered against the City, and asking the person
to appear and defend. A judgment obtained in the suit is conclusive in any
action by the City against any person so notified, as to the existence of the
defect or other cause of the injury or damage, as to the liability of the City
to the plaintiff in the first named action, and as to the amount of the damage
or injury. The City may maintain an action against the person notified to
recover the amount of the judgment together with all the expenses incurred by
the City in the suit.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.14)

49.01   PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to beautify and preserve the appearance of the
City by requiring property owners and occupants to maintain grass lawns at a
uniform height within the boundaries of their property and on abutting street
right-of-way in order to prevent unsightly, offensive, or nuisance conditions.
49.02   UNIFORM HEIGHT SPECIFICATIONS.
Grass, weeds or brush shall be cut, mowed, and maintained so as not to exceed
the following height specifications:
   1.   Developed Areas – Not to exceed 8 (eight) inches.
   2.   Undeveloped Areas – Not to exceed 15 (fifteen) inches.
   3.   Agriculture Areas – Not to exceed 15 (fifteen) inches.
   4.   Designated Pollinator Habitat or Prairie Areas – No requirement to mow
if requested and designated by City.
   5.   Requested “Mow Less May” Areas – Not to exceed 12 (twelve) inches.

specified limitations are deemed to be violations of this chapter. Any property
within the City, whether vacated or non-vacated, is required to conform to
these specifications.
49.03   NOXIOUS WEEDS.
Every property owner shall cut and control noxious weeds upon the owner’s
property and adjacent to the curb line or outer boundary of any street, which
shall include the parking area abutting the owner’s property, by cutting
noxious weeds to ground level. The use of herbicides alone to eliminate or
eradicate such weeds shall not appropriately abate the nuisance if the subject
vegetation is in violation of the height limit.
Noxious weeds include any weed growth or plant designated as noxious by the
State Department of Natural Resources rules and regulations or by the Code of
Iowa Chapter 317 to include both primary and secondary noxious weeds.
49.04   ABATEMENT NOTICE AND PROCEDURE.
   1.   Publication of Notice. Annual spring publication of this ordinance
codified in this chapter in the official newspaper shall serve as one official
notice to the property owners.
   2.   Written Notice. The property owner of record will receive one regular
mail notice and will receive a one-week timeframe from the date of mailing in
which to comply with the ordinance.
      A.   The written notice is to include:
         (1)   A description of what constitutes the nuisance.
         (2)   The location of the nuisance.
         (3)   Act(s) necessary to abate the nuisance.
         (4)   A reasonable time within which to complete the abatement, not to
exceed fourteen (14) calendar days.
         (5)   A statement that if the nuisance or condition is not abated as
directed and within the time prescribed, the City will abate it and assess the
costs against the property owner.
      B.   After the reasonable time period for the initial violation has
passed, the property owner shall continue to abate the nuisance without further
notice.
      C.   Subsequent violations per subdivided lot in a mowing year shall not
require additional notice prior to the City’s abatement of the nuisance.
      D.   The City may abate the nuisance itself or by hiring an independent
contractor. Independent contractors shall be paid upon their completion and
submission of an invoice, regardless of whether the cost has been received from
the property owner. If the nuisance is abated by the City, the property owner
shall be charged $100 per hour per incident, with a minimum billing of $100 per
incident regardless of the time required to abate the nuisance. If the nuisance
is abated by an independent contractor, the property owner shall be charged the
greater of the fees incurred by the City from the contractor, or $100 per
incident. The property owner shall also be charged a $75 administrative fee for
the first abatement in a mowing year, and a $125 administrative fee for
subsequent violations.
      E.   Collection of Costs. The Clerk shall issue a billing statement of
the total expense incurred by certified mail to the property owner who has
failed to abide by the notice to abate, and if the amount shown by the
statement has not been paid a within one month, the Clerk shall assess a $100

Notes
  †  EDITOR’S NOTE: A suggested form of notice for the abatement of nuisances is
  included in the Appendix of this Code of Ordinances. Caution is urged in the use of
  this administrative abatement procedure, particularly where cost of abatement is
4 more than minimal or where there is doubt as to whether or not a nuisance does in
  fact exist. If compliance is not secured following notice and hearings, we
  recommend you review the situation with your attorney before proceeding with
  abatement and assessment of costs. Your attorney may recommend proceedings in court
  under Chapter 657 of the Code of Iowa rather than this procedure.
50.07 MUNICIPAL INFRACTION ABATEMENT PROCEDURE.

50.08   ADULT ESTABLISHMENTS.
   1.   As used in this section, “adult establishment” means any business that
provides nude or topless dancing or operates any other adult-oriented business.
   2.   A public safety nuisance exists when it is established by clear and
convincing evidence that an owner, manager, employee, contemporaneous patron,
or guest of an adult establishment commits any of the following acts either on
the premises or in any parking lots or areas, including but not limited to
public rights-of-way, adjacent to the premises:
      A.   Unlawfully discharges a firearm or uses an offensive weapon, as
defined in Section 724.1 of the Code of Iowa, regardless of whether it inflicts
injury or death.

Since excessive noise is a serious hazard to the public health, welfare, safety
and the quality of life and because a substantial body of science and
technology exists by which excessive noise may be substantially abated, and
because the people have a right to and should be ensured an environment free
from excessive noise that may jeopardize their health, welfare or safety or
degrade the quality of life, it is the policy of the City to prevent such
excessive noise.
53.02 PURPOSE; TITLE AND SCOPE.
This chapter may be cited as the “Riverdale Noise Control Ordinance.” The
purpose of this chapter is to establish standards for the control of noise
pollution in the City by setting maximum permissible sound levels for various
activities, to protect the public health, safety and general welfare. These
provisions apply to the control of all noise originating within the City limits
of the City or originating from properties lying outside the limits of the City
owned or controlled by the City, except where either: (i) a State or federal
agency has adopted a different standard or rule than that prescribed in this
chapter and has so preempted the regulations of noise from a particular source
as to render this chapter inapplicable; or (ii) the Council has determined
that, by reason of public acceptance of the activity producing a particular
noise or noises, such noise is deemed acceptable to the residents of the City.
53.03 DEFINITIONS.

   2.   “Demolisher” means a person licensed under Chapter 321H of the Code of
Iowa whose business it is to convert a vehicle to junk, processed scrap or
scrap metal, or otherwise to wreck, or dismantle vehicles.
   3.   “Garage keeper” means any operator of a parking place or establishment,
motor vehicle storage facility, or establishment for the servicing, repair, or
maintenance of motor vehicles.
   4.   “Police authority” means the Iowa State Patrol or any law enforcement
agency of a county or city.
80.02 AUTHORITY TO TAKE POSSESSION OF ABANDONED VEHICLES.
A police authority, upon the authority’s own initiative or upon the request of
any other authority having the duties of control of highways or traffic, shall
take into custody an abandoned vehicle on public property and may take into
custody any abandoned vehicle on private property. The police authority may
employ its own personnel, equipment, and facilities or hire a private entity,
equipment, and facilities for the purpose of removing, preserving, storing, or
disposing of abandoned vehicles. A property owner or other person in control of
private property may employ a private entity that is a garage keeper to dispose
of an abandoned vehicle, and the private entity may take into custody the
abandoned vehicle without a police authority’s initiative. If a police
authority employs a private entity to dispose of abandoned vehicles, the police
authority shall provide the private entity with the names and addresses of the
registered owners, all lienholders of record, and any other known claimant to
the vehicle or the personal property found in the vehicle.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[2])
80.03 NOTICE BY MAIL.
The police authority or private entity that takes into custody an abandoned
vehicle shall notify, within twenty (20) days, by certified mail, the last
known registered owner of the vehicle, all lienholders of record, and any other
known claimant to the vehicle or to personal property found in the vehicle,
addressed to the parties’ last known addresses of record, that the abandoned
vehicle has been taken into custody. Notice shall be deemed given when mailed.
The notice shall describe the year, make, model and vehicle identification
number of the vehicle, describe the personal property found in the vehicle, set
forth the location of the facility where the vehicle is being held, and inform
the persons receiving the notice of their right to reclaim the vehicle and
personal property within ten (10) days after the effective date of the notice
upon payment of all towing, preservation, and storage charges resulting from
placing the vehicle in custody and upon payment of the costs of the notice. The
notice shall also state that the failure of the owner, lienholders or claimants
to exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property within the
time provided shall be deemed a waiver by the owner, lienholders and claimants
of all right, title, claim and interest in the vehicle or personal property and
that failure to reclaim the vehicle or personal property is deemed consent to
the sale of the vehicle at a public auction or disposal of the vehicle to a
demolisher and to disposal of the personal property by sale or destruction. If
the abandoned vehicle was taken into custody by a private entity without a
police authority’s initiative, the notice shall state that the private entity
may claim a garage keeper’s lien as described in Section 321.90 of the Code of
Iowa, and may proceed to sell or dispose of the vehicle. If the abandoned
vehicle was taken into custody by a police authority or by a private entity
hired by a police authority, the notice shall state that any person claiming
rightful possession of the vehicle or personal property who disputes the
planned disposition of the vehicle or property by the police authority or
private entity or of the assessment of fees and charges provided by this
section may ask for an evidentiary hearing before the police authority to
contest those matters. If the persons receiving notice do not ask for a hearing
or exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property within the
ten-day reclaiming period, the owner, lienholders or claimants shall no longer
have any right, title, claim, or interest in or to the vehicle or the personal
property. A court in any case in law or equity shall not recognize any right,
title, claim, or interest of the owner, lienholders or claimants after the
expiration of the ten-day reclaiming period.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3a])
80.04 NOTIFICATION IN NEWSPAPER.
If it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identity and
addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders, notice by one
publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the
vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice
under Section
80.03. The published notice may contain multiple listings of abandoned vehicles
and personal property but shall be published within the same time requirements
and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed notice in Section
80.03.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3b])
80.05 FEES FOR IMPOUNDMENT.
The owner, lienholder, or claimant shall pay three dollars ($3.00) if claimed
within five (5) days of impounding, plus one dollar ($1.00) for each additional
day within the reclaiming period plus towing charges, if stored by the City, or
towing and storage fees, if stored in a public garage, whereupon said vehicle
shall be released. The amount of towing charges, and the rate of storage
charges by privately owned garages, shall be established by such facility.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3a])
80.06 DISPOSAL OF ABANDONED VEHICLES.
If an abandoned vehicle has not been reclaimed as provided herein, the police
authority or private entity shall make a determination as to whether or not the
motor vehicle should be sold for use upon the highways, and shall dispose of
the motor vehicle in accordance with State law.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[4])
80.07 DISPOSAL OF TOTALLY INOPERABLE VEHICLES.
The City or any person upon whose property or in whose possession is found any
abandoned motor vehicle, or any person being the owner of a motor vehicle whose
title certificate is faulty, lost or destroyed, may dispose of such motor
vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without notification
procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more wheels or
other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable. The police
authority shall give the applicant a certificate of authority. The applicant
shall then apply to the County Treasurer for a junking certificate and shall
surrender the certificate of authority in lieu of the certificate of title.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.90[2e])
80.08 PROCEEDS FROM SALES.
Proceeds from the sale of any abandoned vehicle shall be applied to the expense
of auction, cost of towing, preserving, storing, and notification required, in
accordance with State law. Any balance shall be held for the owner of the motor
vehicle or entitled lienholder for ninety (90) days, and then shall be
deposited in the State Road Use Tax Fund. Where the sale of any vehicle fails
to realize the amount necessary to meet costs the police authority shall apply
for reimbursement from the Department of Transportation.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[4])
80.09 DUTIES OF DEMOLISHER.
Any demolisher who purchases or otherwise acquires an abandoned motor vehicle
for junk shall junk, scrap, wreck, dismantle, or otherwise demolish such motor
vehicle. A demolisher shall not junk, scrap, wreck, dismantle, or demolish a
vehicle until the demolisher has obtained the junking certificate issued for
the vehicle.

95.015 INTENT AND CONSTRUCTION.
This chapter seeks to implement provisions of the Act, the General Pretreatment
Regulations, and the Iowa Administrative Code, Chapter 567, Sections 62.4 and
62.8. This chapter is to be construed and applied in accordance with the Clean
Water Act Amendments, the General Pretreatment Regulations, the Iowa
Administrative Code and the purpose and policy provision set forth in Section
95.020 below.
95.020 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish rules and regulations governing the
treatment and disposal of sanitary sewage within the City of Riverdale in order
to protect the public health, safety and welfare. This chapter regulates the
use of sewers, private wastewater disposal, the installation and connection of
building sewers, the discharge of water and waste into the sewers and drains of
the JCSC system, the discharge of water and waste into the sewers and drains of
the Riverdale Sewage System systems, and the discharge to the Davenport JCSC
Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW). This chapter sets forth uniform
requirements for discharges into the wastewater collection and treatment
systems of Davenport and the JCSC constituents. The objectives of this chapter
are:
   1.   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that may
interfere with the operation of the system or interfere with sludge management
and disposal.
   2.   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that may pass
through the system inadequately treated and ultimately into receiving water,
the atmosphere, or otherwise be incompatible with the system.
   3.   To protect workers’ safety and health and to protect against damage to
the POTW.
   4.   To provide for equitable distribution of treatment and industrial
pretreatment costs resulting from pollutants introduced into the POTW.
   5.   To enable the POTW to comply with its NPDES permit conditions, sludge
use and disposal requirements, and any other federal or State laws to which the
POTW is subject.
95.025 JURISDICTION.
The provisions of this chapter are applicable in their entirety to all Users
and contributors of wastewater, directly or indirectly, into the wastewater
treatment works of the City of Davenport or into the wastewater collection and
treatment system of the City of Davenport or the JCSC without regard to whether
the physical facilities of such contributors, or the physical portion of the
wastewater collection system is situated within or outside the corporate limits
of the City of Davenport. Unless otherwise expressly provided by contract
providing for extension of service by the city outside of the city, such city
extended services and each particular thereof shall be subject to the
provisions of this chapter. The City of Davenport requests each municipality in
which Users or contributors to the Davenport POTW are located adopt this
chapter in its entirety. Failure of any contributing municipalities to so act
shall not diminish the jurisdiction of the City of Davenport under this
chapter.
95.030 SEVERABILITY.
If any provision of this chapter or the application thereof to any particular
person or particular circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity shall not
affect other provisions or application of this chapter which can be given
effect without the invalid provision or application. To this end, the
provisions of this chapter are severable.

water or waste.
         (4)   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and
treatment of water and waste or any combination thereof.
         (5)   Reduce the maximum or average mass loading of present and
prospective individual users on any reasonable prorated basis to meet headworks
loading limits at the POTW treatment plant.
         (6)   Require the user to obtain a wastewater discharge permit and be
subject to any of the rules and regulations contained therein.
         (7)   Require the user to meet local limits or NCPS in cases where
local limits are more restrictive than NCPS provided that headworks loading
limits are met.
         (8)   Initiate enforcement action in response to any noncompliance
with this chapter using the enforcement procedures outlined in this chapter.
         (9)   Take any combination of Steps (1) through (8), as appropriate.
      B.   Users discharging wastewater to the POTW having pollutant
concentrations or flows greater than the limits in Table 8 shall be considered
nondomestic for purposes of sewer charges and may be regulated or permitted by
the Water Pollution Control Plant Manager as appropriate:
 
Table 8
Domestic Pollutant Limits
Pollutant Domestic Limit
BOD       250 mg/l
TSS       300 mg/l
 
   4.   No provision of this section shall be construed to provide lesser
discharge standards than are presently or may hereafter be imposed and required
by USEPA or IDNR, nor to allow the average allowable total loading for any
pollutant at the headworks of the POTW treatment plant to be exceeded.
(Section 95.080 – Ord. 04-2024 – Jun. 24 Supp.)
95.085 NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
Users subject to National Categorical Pretreatment Standards (NCPS) as
contained in 40 CFR Chapter I, Chapter N, Part 405-471 or future promulgated
regulations shall comply with the standards and applicable reporting
requirements under 40 CFR 403.12. New sources of categorical discharge shall
meet NCPS in the shortest feasible time but in no case longer than ninety (90)
days from the commencement of discharge. Failure to comply shall be a violation
of this ordinance and subject the User to enforcement action. The POTW shall
notify all known affected Categorical Users of the applicable reporting
requirements under 40 CFR 403.12. Failure of the POTW to notify the User shall
not relieve the User of the duty, if any, to comply with NCPS.
95.090 STATE REQUIREMENTS.
State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where
they are more stringent than USEPA or City of Riverdale requirements and
limitations unless allowed by the state.
95.095 CITY OF RIVERDALE RIGHT OF REVISION.
The City of Riverdale reserves the right to establish more stringent
limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW than those contained in
this chapter if deemed necessary to comply with the purpose and policy
objectives presented in Section
95.020.
95.100 PRETREATMENT.
   1.   A User discharging, or with potential to discharge, any waste into the
POTW as set forth in Sections
95.075,
95.080,
95.085,
95.090 or
95.095 shall be required by the Water Pollution Control Plant Manager to
construct, install and operate, at the User's sole expense, such pretreatment
facilities as may be required in order to:
      A.   Reduce the objectionable characteristics or constituents to within
the maximum limits provided for in Sections
95.075,
95.080,
95.085, and
95.090;
      B.   Control the quantities and rates of discharge of such wastewater;
      C.   Reduce the pollutants to such concentration and flows as may be
contained in the User's wastewater discharge permit;
      D.   Prevent the discharge of liquid waste containing O&G, sand in
excessive amounts, any flammable waste, or other harmful pollutants. All traps
or similar devices shall be of a type and capacity needed to perform
effectively and shall be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. All traps or devices shall be provided and maintained in efficient
operating condition at all times. Materials removed from traps shall be
considered unacceptable for disposal at the POTW treatment plant unless
specifically approved by the Water Pollution Control Plant Manager.
   2.   All plans, specifications, technical operating data and other
information pertinent to the proposed operation and maintenance of pretreatment
facilities shall be reviewed and approved by the Water Pollution Control Plant
Manager prior to construction. Design and installation of such facilities shall
be subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, chapters and laws,
including local zoning regulations. The review and approval of such plans and
operating procedures shall in no way relieve the User from the responsibility
of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the
Water Pollution Control Plant Manager under the provisions of this chapter. Any
subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operations shall
be reported to and be acceptable to the Water Pollution Control Plant Manager
prior to the User’s initiations of the changes.
   3.   Users shall continuously maintain all pretreatment facilities required
by this chapter in satisfactory and effective operating condition at the sole
expense of such User.
   4.   No provision contained in this chapter shall be construed to prevent or
prohibit a separate or special agreement between the City of Riverdale and any
User whereby wastewater containing waste of unusual strength, character or
composition may be accepted by the City of Riverdale for treatment, subject to
additional payment by such User; provided however, that such agreement shall
have the prior approval of the Water Pollution Control Plant Manager, shall not
conflict with IDNR and USEPA requirements, and shall be consistent with
Sections
95.080(2),
95.085,
95.090 and
95.100(6) of this chapter.
   5.   The Water Pollution Control Plant Manager may reject any waste, which,
in the opinion of the Water Pollution Control Plant Manager, may cause
interference or pass-through.
   6.   Users shall obtain the specific approval of the Water Pollution Control
Plant Manager prior to discharging any waste resulting from a pretreatment
facility to the POTW.
The Water Pollution Control Plant Manager may develop a documentation system to
track the transportation and final disposition of any pretreatment waste.
Pretreatment waste regulated by this paragraph shall include waste generated as
a result of pretreatment processes used to comply with NPDES permits, air
pollution permits, wastewater discharge permits, soil/groundwater reclamation
processes, and pollutants resulting from a spill of any liquid or solid
material or the clean-up of any such spill. Pretreatment waste is prohibited
from disposal to the water of the state except as specifically permitted by
IDNR.
95.105 DILUTION PROHIBITED.
Users shall not increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt to
dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
pretreatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the NCPS,
or with any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the City of
Riverdale.
95.110 SLUG/SPILL CONTROL.
   1.   Users who, upon internal review by the User personnel or upon review by
the Water Pollution Control Plant Manager, are determined to have the ability
to cause interference or pass-through at the POTW or to discharge a slug shall
provide protection from accidental discharge to the POTW of prohibited
materials or other substances regulated by this chapter. Facilities to prevent
accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be at the User’s cost and
expense.
   2.   Slug/Spill Control Plan (SCP). Users meeting the criteria in subsection
1 hereof shall develop a SCP and implement the plan after approval by the Water
Pollution Control Plant Manager. The plan shall contain the following:
      A.   A description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
      B.   A description of stored chemicals;
      C.   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of slug discharges,
including any that would violate the discharge prohibitions in Section
95.075 of this chapter. Notification procedures shall comply with paragraphs
(3) and (4) of this subsection;
      D.   A description of procedures and structures necessary to prevent
adverse POTW impact from accidental spills including inspection and maintenance
of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading
operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building of
containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
      E.   A schedule for the completion or implementation of necessary
procedures and structures. Complete implementation and installation of any
procedures or structures shall be according to the shortest possible schedule,
but in no case longer than one year. Review and approval of such plans and
operating procedures shall not relieve the User from the responsibility to
modify and operate its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this
chapter.
   3.   Users shall immediately telephone and notify the POTW in the case of:
      A.   Any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges,
discharges of a non-routine episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge,
or a slug discharge that may cause potential problems for the POTW.
      B.   Any discharge which violates Section
95.075 of this chapter.
      C.   Any discharge into the POTW of a substance which is a listed or
characteristic waste under 40 CFR 261. This type of discharge will also require
additional immediate reporting to the USEPA Regional Director and IDNR.
   4.   Immediate notification requirements shall include the name of caller,
location and time of discharge, pollutant concentration, volume and the
corrective actions taken.
   5.   Users shall submit a written report to the Water Pollution Control
Plant Manager within five (5) days following such an accidental or deliberate
discharge describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by
the User to prevent similar future occurrences. Users shall submit follow-up
reports as may be required by the Water Pollution Control Plant Manager. Such
report, or reports, shall not relieve the User of any expense, loss, damage or
other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish
kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such report relieve
the User of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed
by this chapter or otherwise. Failure to report accidental or deliberate
discharges may, in addition to any other remedies available to the City of
Riverdale, result in the revocation of the discharger’s wastewater discharge
permit.
   6.   Users shall control production or all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with all applicable regulations upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its pretreatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of pretreatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
to the User's pretreatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
   7.   Users required to have a SCP must permanently post a notice in English
and the language of common use on the User’s bulletin board or other prominent
place advising employees whom to call should a prohibited discharge occur.
Users shall ensure that all employees who are in a position to cause, discover,
or observe such an accidental discharge are advised of the emergency
notification procedures.
95.115 TREATMENT UPSETS.
   1.   For the purposes of this section, Upset means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
Pretreatment Standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
User. An Upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   2.   An Upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards if the requirements
of paragraph 3 of this section are met.
   3.   A User who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of an Upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed contemporaneous operating logs, or
other relevant evidence that:
      A.   An Upset occurred and the User can identify the cause(s) of the
Upset;
      B.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures;
      C.   The User has submitted the following information to the POTW within
24 hours of becoming aware of the Upset (if this information is provided
orally, a written submission must be provided within five days):
         (1)   A description of the Indirect Discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (2)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue;
         (3)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   4.   In any enforcement proceeding, the Industrial User seeking to establish
the occurrence of an Upset shall have the burden of proof.
   5.   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only if an enforcement action is brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment.
   6.   The User shall control production or all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
95.120 TREATMENT BYPASS.
   1.   Bypass is prohibited unless it is unavoidable to prevent loss of life,
personal injury, or severe property damage or no feasible alternatives exist
such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated
waste, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime.
   2.   The User may allow a bypass to occur which does not cause a violation
of pretreatment standards, but only if it is for essential maintenance to
assure efficient operation.
   3.   Notification of Bypass.
      A.   Anticipated Bypass. If the User knows in advance of the need for a
bypass, it shall submit prior written notice, at least ten (10) days before the
date of the bypass, to the Water Pollution Control Plant Manager.
      B.   Unanticipated Bypass. The User shall immediately notify the Water
Pollution Control Plant Manager and submit a written notice to the POTW within
five (5) days. This report shall specify:
         (1)   A description of the bypass, its cause, and the duration;
         (2)   Whether the bypass has been corrected;
         (3)   The steps being taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and
prevent a reoccurrence of the bypass.
   4.   Proper notification shall not relieve the User of liability for
treatment costs and fees or other remedies as provided for in Section
95.100.
95.125 COMPREHENSIVE SEWER SERVICE CHARGE.
Every person whose premises are served by connection to the sanitary sewer
system of the city, either directly or indirectly, shall pay to the City of
Riverdale a comprehensive sewer service charge for the use of and for services
supplied by the wastewater facilities of the City of Riverdale, which charges
shall consist of:
   1.   A base sewer service charge;
   2.   A customer usage charge;
   3.   A surcharge for Operating and Maintenance (O & M) of the wastewater
treatment plant for wastewater contributed of strengths greater than domestic
wastewater;

(Section 95.125 – Ord. 04-2024 – Jun. 24 Supp.)
95.130 SEWER RENTAL FUND.
All monies received by the City Clerk of Riverdale from any source of sewer
service charges shall be kept in a separate and distinct fund to be known as
the “Sewer Rental Fund” and shall be paid out only upon legal checks of the
City of Riverdale.
95.135 RATES.
The rates for the comprehensive sewer service charges shall be reviewed
annually and established from time to time by City of Riverdale Council
ordinance and shall be as follows:
   1.   Basic Sewer Service Charge. The basic sewer service charge shall be
charged on each bill to each customer regardless of usage. The charge is based
on the user classification. The classes are Residential (RESID), Other Public
Authority (Large OPA), Commercial (COMM) and Industrial (INDU). In no case
shall the minimum bill be less than the basic service charge. The basic sewer
service charge on each quarterly bill will be charged as follows for the next
seven fiscal years:
 
Minimum Fee Per Quarter 2023    2024    2025    2026    2027    2028    2029
by User Class
INDU                    $275.00 $385.00 $500.50 $600.60 $612.61 $624.86 $637.36
COMM                    $85.00  $119.00 $154.70 $185.64 $189.35 $193.14 $197.00
Large OPA               $85.00  $119.00 $154.70 $185.64 $189.35 $193.14 $197.00
RESID/Small OPA         $6.50   $9.10   $11.83  $14.20  $14.48  $14.77  $15.06
 
   2.   The Customer Usage Charge. The customer usage charge is determined by
the amount of water used as measured by the meter type. The unit flow cost
shall be the same for each class. This charge is in addition to the Basic
Service Charge. The charge for each unit used will be charged quarterly as
follows for the next seven fiscal years:
 
Cost Per Unit by 2023     2024     2025     2026     2027     2028     2029

Gallon (per 100) $0.147   $0.206   $0.267   $0.321   $0.328   $0.334   $0.341
 
Rate to Be Charged. Effective January 1, 2023, or after the last meter reading
for the fourth quarter of 2022, whichever occurs first, applicable each
subsequent fiscal year, the comprehensive sewer service charge, as provided in
this section, to be paid by users of the wastewater treatment facilities of the
City and billed beginning January 1, 2023, or after the last meter reading for
the fourth quarter of 2022, whichever occurs first, applicable each subsequent
fiscal year, is hereby established per the tables above. The rate charged is
subject to review by the City Council and may be adjusted by ordinance. For
fiscal year 2030 and following, the rates will remain at 2029 levels until
modified by the City Council.
   3.   Surcharge for Wastes of Strength Greater than Domestic Water. The
surcharge for the operation and maintenance (O & M) cost of the wastewater
treatment works shall be collected from those users who contribute wastes of
strengths greater than domestic wastewater. These users shall be sampled, and
the sample analyzed at least once per quarter. A moving average of excess
biological oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids (SS), expressed in pounds,
shall be used to compute the quarterly charge.
      A.   Quarterly Excess BOD. The quarterly excess BOD, expressed in
milligrams per liter, shall be calculated by subtracting the BOD of domestic
wastewater (two hundred fifty milligrams per liter) from the monthly average
BOD of a user. If the value is less than zero, zero shall be used to compute
the average of excess BOD.
      B.   Moving Average Excess BOD Value. The moving average of excess BOD,
expressed in pounds, shall be computed by adding the latest quarterly excess
BOD, expressed in pounds, to the previous three quarters’ excess BOD, expressed
in pounds, and divided by four.
      C.   BOD Surcharge Amount. The surcharge for BOD shall be calculated by
multiplying the moving average excess BOD value by the unit BOD cost per pound.
The unit BOD cost per pound shall be determined by multiplying the anticipated
budget by thirty-five percent (35%) and dividing by the previous year’s total
BOD load at the wastewater treatment works measured in pounds. The unit BOD
cost per one hundred (100) cubic feet of domestic wastewater is obtained by
multiplying the unit BOD cost per pound by 1.564.
      D.   Quarterly Excess SS. The quarterly excess SS, expressed in
milligrams per liter, shall be calculated by subtracting the SS of domestic
wastewater (three hundred milligrams per liter) from the monthly average SS of
a user. If the value is less than zero, zero shall be used to compute the
moving average of excess SS.
      E.   Moving Average Excess SS Value. The moving average excess SS,
expressed in pounds, shall be computed by adding the latest quarterly excess
SS, expressed in pounds, to the previous three quarters’ excess SS, expressed
in pounds, and divided by four.
      F.   SS Surcharge Amount. The surcharge for SS shall be calculated by
multiplying the moving average excess SS value by the unit SS cost per pound.
The unit SS cost per pound shall be determined by multiplying the said
anticipated budget by forty percent (40%) and dividing by the previous year’s
total SS load at the wastewater treatment works measured in pounds. The unit SS
cost per one hundred (100) cubic feet of domestic wastewater is obtained by
multiplying the unit SS cost per pound by 1.877 pounds. The total surcharge
shall then be a summation of the surcharge for BOD and the surcharge for SS.
   4.   Measurement by Meters. Such rates or charges shall be based upon the
amount of water supplied by the Water Company by the water meter readings of
that company. By virtue of agreement between the City of Riverdale and the
Water Company, the comprehensive sewer service charges will be billed,
accounted for, and collected by the City of Riverdale. All persons required to
pay the comprehensive sewer service charge established in this chapter shall
receive billing for such charge separately stated on the sewer bill and shall
pay such charges to the City of Riverdale as billed. Those users who are billed
by the City of Riverdale quarterly shall pay their comprehensive sewer user
charges quarterly. .
   5.   Date Due; Penalty. All comprehensive sewer user charges are due and
payable thirty (30) days after the date of billing. The penalty of ten dollars
($10.00) shall be added each quarter to the comprehensive sewer service charge
billed quarterly to any user when the charge is not paid within thirty (30)
days.
   6.   Special Rates: Grounds; Approval; Private Water Supply Users. Where, in
the judgment of the Riverdale City Council, special conditions surround the use
of water to the extent that the application of the comprehensive sewer service
charge or method of measurement would be inequitable or unfair to either the
City of Riverdale or the user, a special rate or method of measurement shall be
established by the City of Riverdale. Such rates or methods of measurement
shall be subject to approval by resolution of the Riverdale City Council. In
such cases, the Riverdale City Council may require that water consumed on the
premises concerned shall be separately metered at the expense of the user, who
shall also pay the cost of reading such meters and any increased billing or
collecting charges resulting. In such cases where a major portion of the water
consumed is not discharged into or does not reach the sanitary sewer system,
the following shall apply:
      A.   Said water so consumed shall be metered by a separate water meter
that meets the performance standards as determined by the Riverdale City
Council.
   Where private or quasi-public water well systems are used and discharged
directly or indirectly into a sanitary sewer system, the comprehensive sewer
service charges shall be on an equal basis as nearly as may be with the charges
which would apply to an equal quantity and character of wastewaters originating
through the use of the public water supply.

95.140 PROPERTY LIEN FOR UNPAID CHARGES; ASSESSMENT; PRIVATE USERS.
   1.   Failure to pay comprehensive sewer service charges shall create a lien
upon the property served by the public sanitary sewer system and the wastewater
treatment works as provided by State law. The owner of the premises served and
any lessee or tenant thereof shall be jointly and severally liable for
comprehensive sewer service charges to the premises. The Clerk shall certify
for taxation purposes, in establishing property liens to the County Treasurer,
all delinquent comprehensive sewer service payments. For the purpose of
certification, the comprehensive sewer service payment shall be designated as
delinquent when same is shown and appears on the books carrying comprehensive
sewer service payments that have been unpaid for a period of three (3) months
following their due date.
   2.   A lien for delinquent service charges shall not be certified to the
County Treasurer unless prior written notice of intent to certify a lien is
given to the property owner and the tenant. If a tenant requests a change of
name for service under the account, such request shall be made to the property
owner for approval. The notice shall be sent to the property owner and the
tenant by certified mail not less than thirty (30) days prior to certification
of the lien to the County Treasurer.
   3.   Where the user is an operator of a private or quasi-public water
supply, failure to pay usage shall be subject to similar rules as to
delinquency and suspension of service, property lien and certification of
delinquency, as provided in Subsection 1 above.
(Section 95.140 – Ord. 04-2024 – Jun. 24 Supp.)
95.145 PROPERTY LIEN FOR UNPAID FEES.
   1.   The City Clerk of Riverdale shall certify to the County Treasurer any
comprehensive sewer user charge which is owing after the 30-day payment period.
All certified charges constitute a lien upon the premises served by the
sanitary sewer system for which the charges were made and shall be collected in
the same manner as taxes. Failure to send or receive a bill for comprehensive
sewer user charges is not a defense to the collection of the charges.
   2.   The City Council of Riverdale may order suspension of service to those
premises for which the comprehensive sewer user charge is delinquent.
95.150 FEES. [Reserved.]
III. WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITS
AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
95.155 CLASS OF PERMIT. [Reserved.]
95.160 PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.
   1.   All new Industrial Users shall notify the Water Pollution Control Plant
Manager of the nature and characteristics of their proposed discharge one
hundred eighty (180) days prior to commencing discharge. A notification form
prescribed by the POTW shall be used for this purpose.
   2.   Significant Users shall discharge wastewater, either directly or
indirectly, into the POTW only after obtaining a wastewater discharge permit
from the Water Pollution Control Plant Manager. Obtaining a wastewater
discharge permit does not relieve a User of the obligation to obtain other
permits required by federal, state, or local law.
   3.   Other Users, including waste haulers, shall obtain permits as required
by the Water Pollution Control Plant Manager.
95.165 PERMIT APPLICATIONS -BASELINE MONITORING REPORTS.
Users applying for a wastewater discharge permit or submitting a baseline
monitoring report shall submit the following information as required by 40 CFR
403.12 or by the Water Pollution Control Plant Manager:
   1.   Users applying for a wastewater discharge permit must submit an
application form prescribed by the POTW and accompanied by the application fee.
All new significant Users must submit such application one hundred eighty (180)
days prior to the date of any wastewater discharge. Existing Users subject to
new NCPS must, within one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of
the standard, submit such an application. The following information is
required:
      A.   Name, address, and location of facility (if different from the
mailing address);
      B.   Name of a person or agent authorized to accept legal service of
process;
      C.   Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code of both the industry
as a whole and any processes for which NCPS have been promulgated and a list of
any environmental control permits held by or for the facility;
      D.   Wastewater constituents and characteristics, including any
pollutants in the discharge which are limited by any federal, state, or local
standards with sampling and analysis performed in accordance with EPA approved
methods, and meeting the following requirements:
         (1)   The User shall identify the pretreatment standards applicable to
each regulated process if the User is a Categorical User.
         (2)   All samples shall be representative of daily operations.
         (3)   A minimum of six (6) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organics. For all other
pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-
proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The Water Pollution
Control Plant Manager may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any
User that demonstrates that flow-proportional sampling is not feasible. In such
cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional techniques or through
a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the User demonstrates that such
sampling will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged.
         (4)   Where the flow of the stream being sampled is less than or equal
to 250,000 gpd, the User must analyze three (3) samples within a two-week
period. Where the flow of the stream being sampled is greater than 250,000 gpd,
the User must analyze six (6) samples within a two-week period.
         (5)   Samples must be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process
if no pretreatment exists and prior to mixing with other waste. If non-
regulated wastewater is mixed with regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment,
the User must measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of
the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate
compliance with pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentrations or
mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e), this
adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the Water
Pollution Control Plant Manager. Users not subject to categorical standards
shall submit analysis of wastewater representative of the effluent discharged
to the POTW.

Iowa, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent
basis and, if not, whether additional O & M or additional pretreatment is
required for the User to meet pretreatment standards and requirements.
      M.   If additional pretreatment or O & M will be required to meet
pretreatment standards or requirements, then the User shall supply a compliance
schedule indicating the shortest time schedule necessary to accomplish
installation or adoption of such additional pretreatment or O & M. The
completion date in this schedule shall not be longer than the compliance date
established for the applicable pretreatment standard. The following conditions
apply to this schedule:
         (1)   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the User to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such schedule shall include, where

   1.   Significant Users shall submit to the Water Pollution Control Plant
Manager in the months of January and July, a report indicating the nature,
concentration, and flow of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by
permit or pretreatment standards for the preceding six-month period. This
report shall include a record of the monthly average flows and the daily flow
for each analysis date during the reporting period. At the discretion of the
Water Pollution Control Plant Manager and in consideration of such factors as
local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the Water
Pollution Control Plant Manager may agree to alter the months during which the
above reports are to be submitted. More frequent reports may be required by the
Water Pollution Control Plant Manager.
   2.   The Water Pollution Control Plant Manager may impose mass limitations
on Users. In such cases, the report required by the above paragraph shall
indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the
effluent of the User. All analysis shall be performed using EPA approved
methods using sampling techniques approved by IDNR.
   3.   Users shall meet the certification and signatory requirements in
Section
95.215 for each report submitted under this section. Where the City of
Riverdale itself collects all the information required for the report,
including flow data, the Industrial User will not be required to submit a
periodic compliance report.
   4.   Users must notify the POTW of all violations identified as a result of
self monitoring to the POTW by telephone, during normal business hours, within
24 hours of the time the User becomes aware of such violation. The User must
also submit the results of repeat analyses to the POTW within thirty (30) days
after becoming aware of the violation, together with a complete report on all
steps taken to resolve the violation. The User need not repeat the analyses if:
      A.   The POTW performs sampling of the Industrial User at a frequency of
at least once per month, or
      B.   The POTW performs sampling of the User between the time when the
User performs its initial sampling and the time when the User receives the
results of this sampling;
   5.   If the User monitors any pollutant more frequently than required, using
test procedures prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 or amendments thereto, or
otherwise approved by EPA or as specified by the Water Pollution Control Plant
Manager, the results of such monitoring shall be included in any calculations
of actual daily maximum or monthly average pollutant discharge and results
shall be reported in the monthly report.
   6.   If the User utilizes a laboratory other than the Davenport Water
Pollution Control Plant Laboratory to sample or analyze any pollutant, the
Davenport Water Pollution Control Plant Manager must be informed in writing.
All external sampling plans must be approved prior to uses of the third-party
data in the monitoring reports.
   7.   The Davenport Water Pollution Control Plant Manager has selected the
Davenport Water Pollution Control Plant Laboratory as the primary laboratory

   1.   Permitted Users, when required by the Water Pollution Control Plant
Manager, shall provide and operate monitoring facilities to allow inspection,
sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer, or internal drainage
systems at their own expense. The Water Pollution Control Plant Manager may
require the placement of such monitoring facilities at the end of each process
where pollutants are used, produced, or treated. The monitoring facility should
normally be situated on the User’s premises and located so that it will not be
obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
   2.   When required by permit and within ninety (90) days of written
notification, Users shall install a sampling chamber for each separate
discharge of the building sewer in accordance with plans and specifications
approved by the City of Riverdale. Users shall provide ample room in or near
such sampling chamber to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for
analysis. Users shall maintain all sampling and measuring equipment in a safe
and proper operating condition at all times and at the expense of the User
which shall be safely, easily and independently accessible to authorized
representatives of the City of Riverdale. Users shall certify all flow
measuring devices to be in proper working condition once per year using a
qualified technician acceptable to the Water Pollution Control Plant Manager.
      A.   Each sampling chamber shall contain a flume unless another device is
approved by the City of Riverdale, with a recording and totalizing device for
measurement of the liquid quantity.
      B.   At the discretion of the Water Pollution Control Plant Manager,
metered water supply to a User may be used as the volume quantity where it is
substantiated that the metered water supply and waste quantities are
approximately the same, or where a measurable adjustment agreed to by the Water
Pollution Control Plant Manager is made in the metered water supply to
determine the liquid waste quantity. Separate meters may be used to subtract
water which is not discharged to the POTW or is discharged to a sewer other
than the sampled location.
      C.   Samples shall be taken at a frequency and volume determined by the
Water Pollution Control Plant Manager, and shall be properly refrigerated and
preserved in accordance with EPA approved methods. The sample shall be
composited in proportion to the flow for a representative 24-hour sample. A
time proportioned 24-hour sample may be used if flow proportioned sampling is
determined by the City of Riverdale to be impractical. Grab samples shall be
used where appropriate.
   3.   Users must inform the Water Pollution Control Plant Manager prior to
breaking a sampler seal, used by the City of Riverdale to detect sample
tampering, unless necessary to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe
property damage. Users must not place additional seals or locks upon a sampler
which may be used by the City of Riverdale without first obtaining approval
from the Water Pollution Control Plant Manager.
95.225 INSPECTION, SAMPLING, AND RECORD-KEEPING AUTHORITY.
Users shall give the following authorities to the City of Riverdale:
   1.   Users shall permit authorized representatives or agents of the City of
Riverdale to enter upon all properties and all parts of the premises within the
corporate limits of the city, within the extended jurisdiction of the City of
Riverdale, or upon properties of Users with wastewater discharge permits for
the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination, records copying, or
the performance of any of their duties. This shall include the right to set up,
on the User’s property, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling,
inspection, compliance monitoring, or metering operations as may be required in
pursuance of the implementation and enforcement of this chapter.
   2.   Where a User has security measures in force which would require proper
identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the User shall
make necessary arrangements in the security measures so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, personnel from the City of Riverdale will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities.
   3.   All Users subject to any of the reporting requirements of this chapter
shall maintain copies of reports and records of all information as required in
40 CFR 403.12(o) resulting from any monitoring activities required by this
chapter for a minimum of five (5) years and shall make such records available
for inspection and copying by the City of Riverdale. This period of retention
shall be extended until the completion of any unresolved negotiation, hearing,
or litigation involving a purported violation.
95.230 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   1.   Except as herein provided, information and data obtained from User
reports, questionnaires, permit applications and inspections, shall be made
available to the public or other governmental agencies without restriction. If
the User specifically requests and is able to demonstrate that the release of
such information would divulge information concerning processes or methods of
production entitled to protection under law as trade secrets of the User or
would give advantage to competitors and serve no public purpose, the Water
Pollution Control Plant Manager shall not make such information available to
the public but such information shall be available to the USEPA or IDNR.
   2.   In determining whether information is confidential, the provision of
561-2 of the Iowa Administrative Code shall prevail.

The POTW shall at a minimum annually publish, in the largest daily newspaper
published in the JCSC community, a list of Users which at any time during the
previous calendar year, were in significant noncompliance as defined in Section
95.315 of this chapter.
95.315 SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE (SNC).
Any violation of pretreatment requirements (i.e., but not limited to: limits,
sampling, analysis, reporting, meeting compliance schedules, and regulatory
deadlines) is an instance of noncompliance for which the User is liable for
enforcement, including penalties and injunctive relief. Instances of SNC are
User violations which meet one or more of the following criteria:
   1.   Violations of Wastewater Discharge Limits.
      A.   Chronic Violations. Sixty-six percent (66%) or more of the
measurements exceed the same daily maximum limit or the same average limit in a
six-month period (any magnitude of exceedance).
      B.   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) Violations. Thirty-three percent
(33%) or more of the measurements exceed the same daily maximum limit or the
same average limit by more than the TRC in a 6-month period (e.g., limit X TRC
= the point at which a violation becomes a TRC violation). There are two groups
of TRCs:
Group I for conventional pollutants
(BOD, TSS, O&G)            TRC = 1.4
Group II for all other pollutants      TRC = 1.2
      C.   Any other violations of a wastewater discharge permit limit (average
or daily maximum) that the Water Pollution Control Plant Manager believes has
caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference (including
slug loads) or pass through; or endangered the health of City of Riverdale
personnel or the public.
      D.   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment
to human health/welfare or to the environment and has resulted in the City of
Riverdale’s exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a
discharge.
   2.   Violations of compliance schedule milestones, contained in a wastewater
discharge permit or enforcement order, for starting construction, completing
construction, and attaining final compliance by ninety (90) days after the
schedule date.
   3.   Failure to provide reports for compliance schedules, self-monitoring
data, or any other report required by the POTW within thirty (30) days from the
due date.
   4.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance.
   5.   Any other violations or group of violations that the Water Pollution
Control Plant Manager considers to be significant.
When a User is in SNC, the Water Pollution Control Plant Manager is directed
to:
   1.   Report the information to IDNR as part of the annual pretreatment
performance summary of Permitted User noncompliance;
   2.   Include the User in the annual public notification according to Section
95.310;
   3.   Address SNC through appropriate enforcement actions.

the violation;
      B.   An order requiring specific action for accomplishing remediation;
      C.   An order requiring the User to respond in writing within thirty (30)
days.
   2.   The Water Pollution Control Plant Manager is empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with the User responsible for any noncompliance. Such
orders will include specific action to be taken by the User to correct
noncompliance within a time period specified by the order.
   3.   The Water Pollution Control Plant Manager may issue enforceable orders
or schedules to require compliance with pretreatment standards, including
appropriate interim limits. Such orders and schedules may be incorporated into
a revised wastewater discharge permit and shall not require the consent of the
User.
95.325 ACTIONS AUTHORIZED.
   1.   Where there has been noncompliance with any provision of this chapter,
the Water Pollution Control Plant Manager may request, and corporation counsel
(or any attorney representing the POTW) is authorized to bring an action in
equity or at law to seek the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction
or both or such other relief as may be appropriate to compel compliance by the
User with this chapter. No other authorization from the Riverdale City Council
for the bringing of such action shall be required.
   2.   In addition to other remedies provided under this or other provisions
of this chapter, in any action brought to enforce the provisions of this
chapter the Riverdale City Council authorizes and directs corporation counsel
to seek to recover all actual damages suffered by the City of Riverdale,
including all actual damages and losses related to costs of repair and
remediation of the POTW, costs of administration reasonably related to any
particular violation, and attorneys’ fees.
95.330 CIVIL PENALTIES.
   1.   Each violation of any provision of this chapter or of a permit issued
under this chapter is declared to be a municipal infraction. Each day that a

In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties
shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
   4.   In addition to the penalties established in this section for municipal
infractions, corporation counsel shall seek all other appropriate remedies
allowed by law in regard to the abating correction or discontinuance of
activities which constitute municipal infractions under this chapter.

order or previous permit issued hereunder unless such User first files a
satisfactory bond payable to the POTW in a sum not to exceed the value
determined by the Water Pollution Control Plant Manager to be necessary to
achieve compliance giving due consideration to the number and magnitude of
previous violations, potential need for remediation, and stating the reasons
which support the amount of bond in a written order directed to the User, but
in no case shall said bond be required to be greater than twenty-five thousand

or his or her designee may continue suspension of or revoke the permit. The
determination of whether to revoke such permit shall be in the discretion of
the Water Pollution Control Plant Manager or his or her designee and shall be
dependent upon the circumstances surrounding violations by the User of Section
95.345(1) and their severity.
      C.   A User whose permit has been revoked shall not be eligible for
another permit until thirty (30) days after the violating conditions have been
corrected to the satisfaction of the Water Pollution Control Plant Manager.

following manner:
   1.   Upon payment to the City of Riverdale of any delinquency in full, plus
penalties, plus the cost of the disconnection and the one hundred dollar
($100.00) City of Riverdale supervision fee, and an inspection by the Water
Pollution Control Plant Manager to determine whether the original cause for
termination has been corrected, the City of Riverdale will issue a permit for
reconnection of the building service line to the POTW.
Such reconnection costs, plus inspection fees for the City of Riverdale in
accordance with City of Riverdale chapters, shall be at the sole expense of the
User.
   2.   Upon reconnection and payment of all costs described above, the City of
Riverdale through its agents, shall remove the red tag from the building and
the building shall, so far as the City of Riverdale is concerned, be “fit for
human occupancy.”
95.355 EMERGENCY DISCONNECTION OF SERVICE.
   1.   Conditions for Immediate Disconnection of Service. The Water Pollution
Control Plant Manager may, after informal notice, suspend the wastewater
treatment service or wastewater permit of a User whenever such suspension is
necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge presenting or
causing an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons, the POTW, or the environment.
   2.   Procedures for Immediate Disconnection.
      A.   When the Water Pollution Control Plant Manager determines that a
discharge exists, a verbal order shall be issued (followed immediately by a
written order) to the User stating the problem and requiring immediate
cessation of the discharge. Users verbally notified of a suspension of the
wastewater treatment service or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or
eliminate all discharges. In the event of a User’s failure to immediately
comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Water Pollution Control Plant
Manager shall take immediate action to eliminate the discharge, including
disconnection from the POTW.
Methods of informal notice to a User shall include, but not be limited to, any
of the following: personal conversations between User and City of Riverdale
personnel, telephone calls, letters, hand delivered messages, or notices posted
at the User’s premises or point of discharge.

shall submit a detailed written report describing the causes of the
endangerment and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the
Water Pollution Control Plant Manager prior to the hearing described in Section
95.345(2).
95.360 ELIMINATION OF DISCHARGE/REINSTATEMENT.
Users notified of a disconnection of wastewater treatment service under
Sections
95.345 or
95.355 shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge. In the event of a
failure of the User to comply voluntarily with the disconnection or revocation
order, the POTW shall take such steps as are deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection. The Water Pollution Control Plant
Manager shall reinstate the wastewater discharge permit or the wastewater
treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the non-complying discharge.
95.365 ADDITIONAL REMEDIES.
   1.   In addition to remedies available to the City of Riverdale set forth
elsewhere in this chapter, if the POTW is fined by IDNR or USEPA for violations
of the POTW NPDES permit or violations of water quality standards as the result
of a discharge of pollutants by identifiable User(s), then the fine, including
all city legal, sampling, analytical testing costs and any other related costs
shall be charged to the responsible User(s). Such charge shall be in addition
to any other remedies the City of Riverdale may have under this chapter, at law
or in equity.
   2.   If the discharge from any User results in a deposit, obstruction,
damage or other impairment to the POTW, the User shall become liable to the
POTW for any expense, loss, or damage caused by the violations or discharge.
The City of Riverdale may add to the User’s charges and fees the costs assessed
for any cleaning, repair, or replacement work caused by the violations or
discharge.
   3.   The remedies provided in this chapter shall not be exclusive and the
POTW may seek whatever other remedies are authorized by ordinance, statute, at
law or in equity against any persons violating the provisions of this chapter.
   4.   In addition to any other remedies provided in this chapter, the POTW

responsible for creating, maintaining and presenting a long-range, capital
improvements plan (CIP) for the City’s Sanitary Sewer System and other
utilities (if they exist).
      A.   An updated version of that plan is to be presented to and reviewed
with the Committee at every meeting.
      B.   Following the review of the long-range CIP the Committee is required
to vote to either recommend adoption, recommend adoption with restrictions or
recommend rejection of the plan by the City Council at its next meeting.
   5.   Review, Comment and Recommend Rates for Services. Once a year, City
staff is responsible for creating, maintaining and presenting recommended

neighboring communities) and “justifiable” (with regard to actual and forecast
expenses).
      C.   Following the review of the proposed rates, the Committee shall vote
to either recommend adoption of the new rates, modify some or to recommend
rejection of the new rates due to the new rates failure to be considered either
“reasonable” or “justifiable” or both.
   6.   Fiscal Responsibilities. The Committee shall have authority to expend
such funds as are appropriated to it by the City Council in the manner directed
by the Council by resolution.
   7.   Limitations on Entering Contracts. The Committee shall have no power to

same time each year;
      A.   Review a financial report prepared by City staff reflecting the
business operation (both income and expenses) of the Sewer Utility for the
City.
      B.   The Committee is expected to provide additional, insightful
commentary on that report and then certify the report as being an accurate
representation of both the business activity of the City’s sanitary sewer
operation and
      C.   The opinions of the Committee with regard to the on-going service
and value the system provides to the City.
      D.   That report should be delivered to and reviewed by the ex-officio
member of the Committee (who is also a member of the Council) with the Council.
      E.   That review should occur within one month of the end of the calendar
year it covers in the report.

   7.   “Excess storm water passageway” means a channel formed in the
topography of the earth's surface to carry storm water runoff through a
specific area.
   8.   “Natural drainage” means channels formed by the existing surface
topography prior to changes made by unnatural causes.
   9.   “Safe storm drainage capacity” means the flow of storm water runoff
that can be transported by a channel or conduit without causing a rise of the
water surface over the conduit or land adjacent to the channel.
   10.   “Soil erosion inspector” means a person employed by the City who is
authorized to enforce all the provisions of this chapter and to make reports
thereon.
   11.   “Storm water runoff” means the flow of water resulting from
precipitation which is not absorbed by the soil or plant material.
   12.   “Storm water runoff release rate” means the rate at which storm water
runoff is released from dominant to subservient land.
   13.   “Tributary watershed” means all of the area that contributes storm
water runoff to a given point.
   14.   “Wet bottom storm water storage area” means a facility designed to be
maintained as a pond or free water surface, and which has the capacity to
contain excess storm water runoff.
   15.   “X-year storm” means the average recurrence intervals within which a
rainfall of given intensity and duration will be equaled or exceeded only once.
A one hundred-year storm would have an intensity and duration of rainfall which
would, on the average, be equaled or exceeded only once in one hundred years.
This does not imply that it will occur once in one hundred years, or having
occurred, will not happen again for one hundred years.
100.04 DESIGN CRITERIA.
The design of storm water runoff systems, structures, and facilities shall be
based on the following minimum standards which do not preclude the use of
higher design standards.
100.05 STORM SEWERS AND STORM WATER ROUTING.
   1.   Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to the
following areas under development:
      A.   All residential development of one acre or more and all commercial,
industrial and other nonresidential development in excess of one-fourth (¼)
acre.
      B.   Any development where the percentage of the impervious area of the
lot is fifty percent or greater.
      C.   Any development which, in the opinion of the City, lacks an adequate
internal or external excess storm water passageway.
   2.   Runoff Calculation. Design flows shall normally be calculated using the
procedures outlined in the Soil Conservation Services, Technical Release No. 55
Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds and the Iowa Users Guide and Supplement
for said Technical Release No. 55. For drainage basins of twenty acres or less,
the Rational Method may be used.
   3.   Storm Sewers.
      A.   Storm sewers and intakes shall be designed for a five-year frequency
storm in such a manner that the flooded street width shall not exceed:
 
Street Width Allowable Flooded Width Each Side Required
                                               Non-Flood Lanes
27 feet      8 feet                            1-10' Lane
31 feet      10 feet                           1-10' Lane
35 feet      9 feet                            2-8' Lanes
41 feet      10 feet                           2-10' Lanes
 
      B.   Hydraulic calculations shall be submitted to the City to
substantiate storm sewer and catch basin design features.
   4.   Excess Storm Water Passageway.
      A.   An excess storm water passageway shall be provided for all
developments. Such passage shall have the capacity to convey through the
proposed development the excess storm water from the tributary watershed. The
capacity of such excess storm water passage shall be constructed in such a
manner as to transport the peak rate of runoff from a one hundred-year return
frequency storm, assuming all storm sewers are inoperative, all upstream areas
are fully developed in accordance with the City’s current land use plan, and
that antecedent rainfall has saturated the tributary watershed.
      B.   No buildings or structures shall be constructed within such passage.
However, streets, parking lots, playgrounds, park areas, pedestrian walkways,
utility easements and other open space uses shall be considered compatible
uses. In the event such passageway is reshaped or its capacity to transport
excess storm water otherwise restricted, the City shall notify the agency,
party or parties causing said restriction to remove the same and set a
reasonable time for its removal. If said persons refuse to or are unable to
comply with said order, the City shall cause said restrictions to be removed at
the expense of said persons.
      C.   Where specifically approved by the City, the excess storm water
passageway may consist of a conduit. In such cases, the inlet capacity shall be
twice the capacity necessary to convey the one hundred-year storm water flow.
      D.   Where a proposed development contains existing natural drainage,
appropriate land planning shall be undertaken to preserve said natural drainage
as part of the excess storm water passage.
      E.   Water entry levels for structures adjacent to the excess storm water
passageway shall be established at least one foot above the one hundred-year
flood elevation. No structures should be placed lower than the top of the
freeboard elevation.
   5.   Open Channels. The size and shape of open channels shall be designed to
meet the requirements of runoff, depth, side slopes, gradient, and velocity
limitations in accordance with the site conditions. Runoff shall be based on
one hundred-year storm frequency. Manning's Formula, as cited in most civil
engineering handbooks, shall be used in hydraulic design of open channels.
Channel banks shall be protected by use of low vegetation, rip-rap, or paving
as design velocity dictates subject to the approval of the City.
   6.   Easements.
      A.   Drainage easements shall be provided for all conduits and those
bypass channels where the one hundred-year runoff exceeds one cubic foot per
second.
      B.   Whenever any stream or water course is located in an area that is
being subdivided, the subdivider shall dedicate a public right-of-way or
drainage easement conforming substantially with the lines of such stream or
water course and shall include such additional area adjoining both edges of
such stream or water course that has been affected by damaging flood waters
and/or inundated by the one hundred-year flood waters, as determined by the
City. Maintenance of the stream and banks shall be the responsibility of the
landowners upon which the stream is located. This maintenance responsibility
shall be clearly defined in a recorded document. The subdivider shall also
provide reasonable public easements for access.
      C.   It shall be noted on the final plat: Owners of lots on which a
drainage easement has been established as a storm water passageway shall
maintain said easement and keep free of structures, fences, fill, bushes,
trees, shrubs, or other landscaping that would impede the flow of water. In the
event that the area established as a drainage easement is reshaped or otherwise
restricted for use as a drainage easement, the City will cause the restrictions
to be removed at the expense of the parties causing the restriction.
100.06 STORM WATER DETENTION FACILITIES.
   1.   Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to the
following areas under development:
      A.   All residential development of one acre or more and all commercial,
industrial and other nonresidential development in excess of one-fourth (¼)
acre located within the City limits.
      B.   Any development which, in the opinion of the City, lacks an adequate
external or internal system for the passage of storm waters.
      C.   The City shall have the right to waive detention requirements on a
case-by-case basis.
   2.   Release Rate.
      A.   The release rate of storm water from any detention basin required
under this chapter shall not exceed the storm water runoff rate from the
drainage area from a five-year frequency storm having a runoff coefficient “c”
of 0.15, when using the rational method for areas under 20 acres or a curve
number of 60 when using the S.C.S. TR-55.
      B.   The City may require a lesser release rate when the downstream
outlet is insufficient to safely convey the release rate as determined in
subsection A above.
      C.   Applicants may claim a higher natural rate of runoff if documented
by detailed computations to show that higher capacity exists in the natural
outlets serving the area. However, only the safe storm drainage capacity of the
conduit or channel may be included in these calculations.
   3.   Detention Requirements.
      A.   The required volume of storm water detention shall be that necessary
to handle the runoff of a one hundred-year rainfall, for the critical duration
from the drainage area tributary to the storm water storage area based on full
development of said tributary area, less the volume discharged during the same
duration at the approved release rate.
      B.   For sites less than twenty acres, the required detention storage
(RDS) will be that found to be the most critical resulting from the inflow from
the run-off of a fully developed tributary area from a one hundred-year storm
and the outflow of the five-year storm with the same area as computed utilizing
Section
100.05(2). This can be expressed by the following equation:
 
 
      Inflow rate from          Release rate from 5-   Duration of the critical
     critical 100-year storm  year storm (cfs)      100-year storm (sec)
      (cfs)
RDS = -                       x
      
 
      C.   For sites greater than twenty acres, the method of sizing of the
detention storage volume must be approved by the City.
      D.   Detention storage may be provided as a dry bottom or wet bottom
storage area.
         (1)   Dry bottom storm water storage areas may be designed to serve a
secondary purpose for recreation, open space, parking, or other types of uses
that will not be adversely affected by intermittent flooding.
            a.   A method of carrying the low flow through these areas shall be
provided in addition to a system of drains to prevent soggy areas.
            b.   Outlet control structures shall be designed as simply as
possible and shall require little or no attention for proper operation. Each
storm water storage area shall be provided with a method of emergency overflow
in the event that a storm in excess of the one hundred-year frequency storm
occurs. This emergency overflow facility shall be designed to function without
attention and shall become part of the excess storm water passageway described
in subsection 4 of this section. Hydraulic calculations shall be submitted to
substantiate all design features.
            c.   All outlet control structures and emergency overflow
facilities shall be designed and constructed to fully protect the public
health, safety and welfare. Storm water runoff velocities shall be kept at a
minimum and turbulent conditions at an outlet control structure will not be
permitted without complete protection for the public safety. The use of fences
shall be kept to a minimum and used only as a last resort when no other method
of protection is feasible.
            d.   Paved surfaces that are to serve as storm water storage areas
and rooftop storage shall be designed with permanent-type control outlets.
Emergency overflow areas shall be provided.
         (2)   Wet bottom storm water storage areas shall be designed with all
of the items required for dry bottom storm water storage areas, except that the
provisions of subsection D(1)(a) of this section shall not be required.
However, the following additional conditions shall be complied with:
            a.   Water surface areas shall not exceed one-fifteenth of the
tributary drainage area.
            b.   Facilities shall be provided to lower the pond elevation by
gravity flow for cleaning purposes and shoreline maintenance. Shoreline
protection shall be provided to prevent erosion from wave action.
            c.   Minimum normal water depth shall be four feet. If fish are to
be maintained, some portion of the pond area should be a minimum of nine feet
deep.
            d.   Control structures for storm water release shall be designed
to operate with only a minor increase in the water surface level when the
design storage capacity has been exceeded. Hydraulic calculations shall be
submitted to substantiate all design features.
            e.   Only that portion of the detention area above the normal water
level shall be used in calculating the storage capacity.
   4.   Construction.
      A.   Where development of a property presents the threat of flooding or
damage by flash runoff to downstream residents, the facilities for storm water
runoff control shall be constructed as part of the first phase of construction
of that project.
      B.   The construction of the storm water control system shall be
accomplished as part of the cost of land development. If the amount of storage
capacity can be increased to provide benefit to the City, negotiations for
public participation in the cost of development shall be initiated.
      C.   All flood control items including, but not limited to, earthen
embankments, conduits, outlet structures, flood control structures, spillways
and excess storm water passageway channels shall be built as permanent
facilities and all materials and their manner of construction shall be
assembled to accomplish as much permanency as is possible.
   5.   Maintenance. All plans submitted for storm water detention systems
shall describe an adequate procedure of normal maintenance for the detention
system. Any failure of the storm water detention system due to inadequate
normal or capital maintenance shall be the responsibility of the owner of the
property on which the detention system is located. It shall also be the
property owner's responsibility to remedy any negligence in maintenance that
resulted in the failure of the system. The submittal of plans for such a system
or the purchase of property on which such system is located shall be deemed as
acceptance of responsibility for normal and capital maintenance of the system.
In the event that maintenance is not provided, the City shall notify the party
responsible for maintenance to perform the work and set a reasonable time for
its completion. If said party refuses or is unable to comply with said order,
the City shall cause the maintenance to be completed at the expense of said
party.
   6.   Easements.
      A.   Drainage easements shall be provided for all areas of the detention
basin including the outlet structures and emergency spillway.
      B.   No structures shall be constructed in the easement areas nor any
filling, fencing or other obstacles which will impede its intended use or
capacity.
      C.   The developer shall provide reasonable public easements reserving
the land for use as a storm water detention facility providing the City with
the right to inspect the facility and for ingress and egress.
   7.   Procedure.
      A.   Plans, specifications and all calculations for storm water runoff
control for any project to be constructed or completed in the City shall be
submitted to the City for review and approval prior to the approval of a final
plat (in the case of a subdivision or planned unit development) or issuance of
a building permit (in the case of commercial or industrial construction).
      B.   As-built plans, including pond volume certification by a licensed
surveyor, for all such projects shall be submitted to the City for review and
approval upon completion of the project. No certificate of occupancy for any
building in the development will be issued until the storm water detention
facilities are constructed, inspected and approved by the City.
      C.   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all plans,
specifications and calculations required by subsections A and B above, shall be
submitted for City review and approval for all projects to be constructed or
completed in the City prior to construction, regardless of whether further City
action, including but not limited to, plat approval, building permit issuance,
or certificate of occupancy issuance is requested or required. The City
reserves all rights to take any and all steps deemed necessary or appropriate
by the City to protect its interests in the event that construction is
initiated in violation of this subsection.

101.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the health, safety, and general
welfare of the citizens of the City through the regulation of non-storm water
discharges to the Storm Water Drainage System, to the maximum extent
practicable, as required by federal and State law. This chapter establishes
methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the Municipal
Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) in order to comply with requirements of the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase II permit and the
Federal Clean Water Act. The objectives of this chapter are to:
   1.   Establish legal authority to conduct inspection and monitoring
procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter.
   2.   Investigate and eliminate, to the maximum extent practicable, the
contribution of pollutants to the MS4 by storm water discharges introduced by
system users.
   3.   Prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the MS4.
101.02 DEFINITION.
As used in this chapter, the term “City Engineer” includes any other
representative of the City Engineer’s office who is designated by the Council
to act in the place and with the authority of the City Engineer.
101.03 APPLICABILITY.
This chapter applies to all water entering the MS4, generated on developed or
undeveloped lands, unless explicitly exempted by the NPDES permit, federal and
State regulations, and the City Council.
101.04 AUTHORITY OF CITY ENGINEER.
   1.   The City Engineer shall administer, implement, and enforce the

within the City limits on residential, commercial, industrial, and City-owned
properties for the presence of illicit discharges as defined by this chapter
and which may contaminate storm water runoff.
      E.   Review and enforce remediation programs as required for properties
where illicit discharge to the storm sewer system is found to exist.
      F.   Develop programs to control the discharge of pollutants, and the
dumping or disposal of materials other than storm water (e.g. industrial and
commercial waste, trash, motor vehicle fluids, yard waste, grass clippings,
animal waste, etc.) into the MS4.
      G.   Acquire and authorize testing of water samples through field-testing
programs.
      H.   Audit City use of herbicides, fertilizers, and pesticides to
determine compliance with federal and State regulations and recommend
alternative solutions where practicable for the reduction of the use of these
items through education and out-reach programs.
      I.   Audit City department procedures to confirm that the City is in
compliance with federal and State NPDES regulations and determine if the City
has obtained, and is in compliance with, permits required by federal and State
environmental laws.
101.05 EXEMPTED NON-STORM-WATER DISCHARGES.
The following non-storm-water discharges are exempt from the discharge
prohibitions of this chapter, unless a particular discharge has been determined
to be a substantial contributor of pollutants to the MS4 and the discharge
continues more than ten (10) days after delivery of written notice of such
determination to the discharger:

101.06 ILLICIT DISCHARGES AND ILLICIT CONNECTIONS PROHIBITED.
   1.   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the MS4 any
materials, including (but not limited to) pollutants or waters containing any
pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality
standards, other than storm water.
   2.   The construction, use, maintenance, or continued existence of illicit
connections to the MS4 is prohibited.
   3.   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
   4.   A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the person
connects a line conveying a pollutant to the MS4, or allows such a connection
to continue. The prohibition shall not apply to any non-storm-water discharge
permitted under this chapter, an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order
issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal
Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full
compliance with all requirements of this chapter, the permit, waiver, or order
and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval
has been granted for any discharge to the MS4.
101.07 ILLICIT DISCHARGE ITEMS.
The following direct or indirect discharges into community waters, Waters of
the State, or Waters of the United States are, without limitation, examples of
illicit discharges. This listing of discharges is not intended to be
exhaustive, nor shall it be construed as such, but is illustrative only.
   1.   Sewage dumping or dumping of sewage sludge.
   2.   Chlorinated swimming pool discharge with chlorine concentrations
greater that one PPM.

The City Engineer shall monitor concentration of pollutants in storm water
discharges from locations as designated in the City Storm Water Management
Program or as otherwise determined by the City Engineer.
101.09 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
Every person owning property in the city through which a watercourse passes, or
other responsible person, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse
that is within their property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and
other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the
flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or other
responsible person shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or
adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures shall not become a hazard to
the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
101.10 REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORM WATER POLLUTANTS BY
THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   1.   The City Engineer may adopt requirements identifying best management
practices (BMPs) for any activity, operation, or facility that may cause or
contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water runoff in the MS4.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the requirements of this section shall
not apply to any activity, operation, or facility that is subject to an NPDES
permit that governs the storm water runoff or discharges of such activity,
operation, or facility, except as may be necessary for the owner or operator to
comply with requirements of the applicable NPDES permit.
   2.   The owner or operator of a nonresidential establishment shall provide,
at said person’s own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge
of prohibited materials or other wastes into the MS4 or watercourses through
the use of structural and non-structural BMPs.
   3.   Any person responsible for a property or premises that is or may be the
source of an illicit discharge may be required to implement, at said person’s
expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further
discharge of pollutants to the MS4. Compliance, to the maximum extent
practicable, with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing
the discharge of storm water associated with any activity, operation, or
facility shall be deemed in compliance with the provisions of this section.
Structural and non-structural BMPs shall be part of a storm water pollution
prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the
NPDES permit.
101.11 SUSPENSION OF DISCHARGE RIGHTS DUE TO ILLICIT DISCHARGES IN EMERGENCY
SITUATIONS.
   1.   The City Engineer may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge
rights to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop actual or
threatened discharge that presents or may present imminent and substantial
danger to the environment, health, or welfare of persons or to the MS4. If the
violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the
City Engineer may take such steps as are, in the discretion of the City
Engineer, deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4, or to
minimize danger to persons.
   2.   A person violates this chapter if the person reinstates MS4 discharge
to a premises terminated pursuant to this chapter, without the prior written
approval of the City Engineer.
101.12 SUSPENSION DUE TO THE DETECTION OF ILLICIT DISCHARGE IN NON-EMERGENCY
SITUATIONS.
   1.   Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have
said person’s MS4 discharge rights terminated if such termination would abate
or reduce an illicit discharge. The City Engineer shall notify a violator of
the proposed termination of its MS4 discharge rights no less than 30 days
before the date of proposed termination. The violator may petition the City
Engineer for a reconsideration and hearing.
   2.   A person violates this chapter if the person reinstates MS4 discharge
to a premises terminated pursuant to this chapter, without the prior written
approval of the City Engineer.
101.13 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   1.   The City Engineer, bearing proper credentials and identification, may
enter and inspect properties within the City if there is reasonable cause to
believe that an illicit discharge to the MS4 is occurring. These inspections
may include investigations, monitoring, observation, measurement, enforcement,
sampling, and testing, to determine if suspected discharge is in fact illicit.
   2.   The City Engineer shall duly notify the owner of said property, or the
representative of the owner or other responsible person on-site, of the
inspection. The inspection shall be conducted at reasonable times during the
course of the business day.
   3.   In the event the City Engineer reasonably believes that discharges from
the property into the MS4 may cause an imminent and substantial threat to human
health or the environment, the inspection may take place without notice to the
owner of the property or a representative on-site. The inspector shall present
proper credentials upon reasonable request by the owner or the owner’s
representative when contacted.
   4.   Upon refusal by any property owner to permit an inspector to enter a
site or continue an inspection, the inspector shall terminate the inspection or
confine the inspection to areas to which no objection is raised. The inspector
shall immediately report the refusal and the grounds of the refusal to the City
Engineer. The City Engineer may seek appropriate compulsory process.
   5.   The City Engineer shall have the right to place monitoring devices on
the property necessary, in the discretion of the City Engineer, to conduct
monitoring and/or sampling of discharges.
101.14 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
Notwithstanding any other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for an activity, operation, or facility, or responsible for
emergency response for an activity, operation, or facility, has information of
any known or suspected release of materials which is resulting or may result in

102.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the health, safety, and general
welfare of the citizens of the City through the regulation of non-storm-water
discharges to the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4), to the maximum
extent practicable, as required by federal and State law. This chapter
establishes methods for controlling the introduction of soil and construction
debris into the MS4 in order to comply with requirements of the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase II permit and the Federal
Clean Water Act. The objectives of this chapter relating to construction site
erosion and sediment control (during new construction) are to:
   1.   Retain soil on residential, commercial, industrial, recreational, and
roadway construction sites. Soil erosion from these sites can result in a
change in the natural cover, topography, or drainage from the land, and can
significantly interfere with existing drainage courses established.
   2.   Reduce erosion from construction sites that may cause obstructions on
roadways, restrict storm sewer capacity, create silt in road ditches, increase
road and storm sewer maintenance costs, cause dust and mud on streets and
sidewalks, leave deposits of silt in creeks and streams, and increase the
potential for flooding.
   3.   Reduce the occurrence of soil erosion and sedimentation that result in
damage caused by the change in a course as a result of nonagricultural earth-
moving activities.
   4.   Require the issuance of a General Permit #2 and approval of a Storm
Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) prior to the occurrence of any grading
activity on a new construction site as required by the City.
   5.   Establish legal authority to conduct review of a permit application and
inspection of construction site to ensure compliance with this chapter.
   6.   Investigate, eliminate, and enforce, to the maximum extent practicable,
the contribution of soil erosion and construction debris to the MS4 by storm
water discharges from new construction sites during storm water events.
102.02 DEFINITIONS.
Terms or acronyms used in this chapter have the meanings given to them in
Chapter 100 of this Code of Ordinances.
102.03 CONSTRUCTION SITE GRADING ACTIVITIES.
During grading operations, the contractor/owner shall be responsible for the
following:
   1.   The prevention of damage to public utilities or services within the
limits of grading operations and along routes of travel of construction
equipment.
   2.   The prevention of damage of adjacent property.
   3.   Carrying out proposed work so as not to grade on land so close to the
property line as to endanger an adjoining public street, sidewalk, alley, or
any other public or private property without supporting and protecting such
property from settling, cracking, or other resulting damage.
   4.   Carrying out the proposed work in accordance with the approved plan and
in compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   5.   Prompt removal of excessive soil, miscellaneous debris, or other
materials applied, dumped, or otherwise deposited on public streets, highways,
sidewalks, or other public thoroughfares during transit to and from the
construction site.
   6.   Completion of the grading operation and the erosion control measures
within the approved time schedule.
   7.   Conduct any grading in such a manner as to effectively reduce
accelerated soil erosion and resulting sedimentation from the site.
   8.   Implement and maintain acceptable soil erosion and sediment control
measures throughout construction.
   9.   Design, construct, and complete grading in such manner that the exposed
area of any disturbed land shall remain exposed for the shortest possible
period of time.
   10.   Obtaining a General Permit #2 from the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources and developing a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) for
the site prior to conducting any grading activity, whether temporary or
permanent.
   11.   Maintaining a copy of Permit #2 and SWPPP on the premises at all
times. Such permit and SWPPP shall be available for inspection by the City
Engineer.
(Section 102.03 – Ord. 16-2023 – Dec. 23 Supp.)
102.04 REQUIREMENT TO OBTAIN APPROVAL OF GENERAL PERMIT #2 AND STORM WATER
POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN (SWPPP).
The developer/owner of all new residential additions and subdivisions,
commercial, industrial, and institutional developments, unless considered
exempt by the City Engineer, pursuant to the guidelines set forth in this
section, shall submit and obtain approval of a General Permit #2 to the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources. The developer/owner, unless considered exempt
by the City Engineer pursuant to the guidelines set forth in this section,
shall also submit to the City, and obtain approval of, a Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWPPP) for the development prior to the approval of
construction plans and/or final plat. Obtaining approval of a General Permit #2
and a SWPPP is required, in addition to any other applicable permits required
by the City, State, or federal Government, for storm water discharges
associated with construction and/or grading. Construction and grading
activities shall be classified in one of four categories as determined by the
City Engineer and as set forth below:
   1.   A General Permit #2 and SWPPP are not required for construction sites
with an area of disturbed land less than one acre, unless the construction site
falls within subsection 2 or 3 of this section. However, the owner of a site is
required to plan and implement erosion control measures as described in the
brochure Erosion Control for Small Site Development. The brochure is available
upon request from City Engineer.
   2.   A SWPPP will be required for sites with a disturbed land area of less
than one acre if the City Engineer determines such a requirement is warranted
by site conditions. Such site conditions may include, but are not limited to:
      A.   Construction site with slopes of nine percent or greater;
      B.   Construction site adjacent to a water body or open drainage channel;
and/or
      C.   Construction sites that have been identified as having severe
erosion potential, or identified as having potential to create a significant
impact on adjacent properties, water bodies, or open drainage channels due to
erosion and sediment deposition.
   3.   A SWPPP is required for land grading activities that are less than one
acre in size if such activities are part of a larger common plan of
development. Even though multiple separate and distinct land development
activities less than one acre may take place at different times and on
different schedules, the developer/owner shall submit the required SWPPP plan.
   4.   Construction sites with a disturbed land area greater than or equal to
one acre are required to submit a Permit #2 and a SWPPP in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter.
When a SWPPP is required under Subsections 2, 3 and 4 of this section, the
SWPPP shall be certified by a design professional and approved by the City
Engineer prior to commencement of construction or grading activities. The
developer/owner shall allow the City Engineer access to the construction site
for the purposes of plan review and observation prior to the commencement of
work and during progression of work. The property owner shall give the City
Engineer written notice of completion of erosion and sediment control
requirements within 30 days after completion of construction activity.
102.05 SWPPP – CONTENT.
A Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP), including an addition to a
previously approved plan, shall include provisions for erosion and sediment
control in accordance with, but not limited to, the Statewide Urban Design and
Specifications (SUDAS) standards. Copies of such standards will be made
available to the public for review in the office of the City Engineer. The
SWPPP shall demonstrate how the developer/contractor will control the quantity
and quality of storm water runoff leaving a construction site. The plan shall
include structural controls and non-structural measures adequate to prevent
soil erosion. The SWPPP will be reviewed by the City Engineer prior to the
approval of construction drawings and the approval of a final plat, if
applicable. Information required on the SWPPP will be maintained on the City’s
Sediment and Erosion Control Checklist. This list will be provided to the
developer/contractor by the City Engineer.
102.06 SWPPP REVIEW PROCEDURE.
The owner/developer shall submit a SWPPP for the development of a site, meeting
the requirements established in this chapter, to the City Engineer for review
and approval, as follows:
   1.   The City Engineer shall review the submittal for compliance with the
requirements of the SWPPP as set forth in the current edition of the City’s
Sediment and Erosion Control Checklist. Following the review, the City Engineer
will return comments to the design professional within 30 days of initial
submittal.
      A.   Following receipt of comments from the City Engineer, the applicant
shall provide a revised submittal to the City Engineer, if required, in
accordance with requested revisions.
      B.   The City Engineer may require supporting documentation as needed to
demonstrate conformance with City, State, and federal storm water pollution
prevention requirements. Approval of construction drawings and/or final plat
may be delayed pending receipt of this documentation.
   2.   If a submittal is deemed complete, and meets the requirements as set
forth herein, the City Engineer shall approve the Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan and authorize approval of construction plans and/or final plat.
102.07 EXTENSION OF TIME TO COMPLETE WORK.
If the developer/owner or an authorized representative is unable to complete
the work within the time specified in the SWPPP, said person may, at least ten
(10) days prior to the expiration of the General Permit #2, present in writing
to the City Engineer a request for an extension of time, setting forth the
reasons for the request for extension. If such an extension is warranted and
the conditions at the site present no accelerated soil erosion potential, the
City Engineer shall grant additional time for the completion of the work. The
developer/owner shall also submit documentation indicating the coverage of the
General Permit #2 with the Iowa DNR is also extended a sufficient time to allow
completion of construction.
102.08 FAILURE TO COMPLETE WORK.
Failure to complete construction and/or grading activity in accordance with the
approved General Permit #2 and SWPPP shall constitute a nuisance. The City may
give notice to the owner to abate such nuisance or cause such nuisance to be
abated in accordance with this Code of Ordinances and the laws of the State.
102.09 MODIFICATIONS TO APPROVED GENERAL PERMIT #2 AND STORM WATER POLLUTION
PREVENTION PLAN.
Any modification to an approved General Permit #2 and SWPPP shall be submitted
to, and approved by, the Iowa DNR and City Engineer prior to construction of
such modification. All necessary reports shall be submitted with any proposal
to modify the approved General Permit #2 and SWPPP.
Grading work in connection with any proposed modification shall not be
permitted without the approval of the City Engineer. If the proposed
modifications are considered substantial, the City Engineer may require a
revised Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan to be submitted prior to further
grading activity.
102.10 CERTIFICATION OF COMPLETION.
The developers/owner or a designated representative shall inspect the work and
certify the satisfactory completion of all work required by the General Permit
#2 and SWPPP.
Upon satisfactory completion of all approved grading, the City Engineer shall
issue a written letter certifying acceptable completion of the project.
102.11 RESPONSIBILITY OF NEW OWNER.
The responsibility of fulfilling requirements of the General Permit #2 and
SWPPP when a new owner purchases a parcel of property becomes the
responsibility of the new owner. The previous owner shall inform the new owner
in writing of the requirements of the General Permit #2 and the SWPPP prior to
the completion of the transfer of ownership.
102.12 REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE ON-SITE STORM WATER DETENTION.
On-site storm water detention facilities shall be required for all new
residential (three-plex and greater), commercial, industrial, and institutional
developments. On-site detention shall also be required when a new building is
constructed on an existing developed site, or when parking lot construction
occurs. Parking lot construction includes the construction of new parking
areas, expansions, reconstruction, or hard surfacing of existing gravel parking
lots. Developments shall detain on-site storm water run-off equal to the
difference between the storm water generated from the 10-year frequency
rainfall event for the site in the developed condition, as applied to the
entire lot including the proposed improvements, and the 5-year frequency
rainfall event applied to the site as the site existed in its natural
undeveloped state. A construction plan and calculations shall be submitted to
the City Engineer showing the location, size, and capacity of the storm water
detention facility. The plan shall also show the method of controlling the
release from the facility with all necessary construction details included.
Computations for sizing the detention facility and release rate shall also be
submitted with the construction plan. A list of items to be shown on the
construction plan related to on-site storm water detention can be obtained from
the City Engineer upon request. Detention facilities shall be designed to have
at least one foot of additional elevation above the design storm. The maximum
level in the detention facility shall be a minimum one foot below finished
floor level for the new development. The construction plan, including on-site
storm water detention facilities, shall be reviewed and approved by the City
Engineer prior to the approval to begin construction. The on-site detention
shall be constructed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for
the site. For sites on which privately owned and maintained storm water
detention and/or conveyance facilities are located, the property owner shall be
responsible for the following:
   1.   Future grading, repairs, and maintenance;
   2.   Maintenance of the minimum storm water detention volume, as approved by
the City Engineer;
   3.   Maintenance of detention basin control structures and discharge pipes
to insure the maximum theoretical storm water release rate, as approved by the
City Engineer, is not increased.
The property owner shall not place fill material, or erect any buildings,
obstructions, or other improvements on the area reserved for storm water
detention purposes, unless approved otherwise by the City Engineer. Upon
determination that a site is not in compliance with detention facility
specifications, the City Engineer may issue a notice of violation in accordance
with this chapter. Except as provided in this chapter, no person shall engage
in construction of storm water detention or conveyance facilities, unless
construction drawings and calculations have been reviewed and approved by the
City Engineer.
102.13 ACTIVITIES EXEMPT FROM GENERAL PERMIT #2 AND SWPPP REVIEW.
The City Engineer hereby considers the following activities exempt from SWPPP
submittal and review, except as otherwise required and described in Section
102.04 of this chapter:
   1.   Activities with land disturbance of less than one acre in size.
   2.   Minor activities such as home gardens and individual home landscaping,
home repairs, home maintenance work, and other related activities, which result
in the possibility of minor soil erosion.
   3.   The construction of single-family residences when built separately on
property less than one acre in size. Excavation should be limited to trenches
for the foundation, basement, water, and sewer service connections, and minor
grading for driveways, yard areas, and sidewalks. These activities have a minor
chance of producing offsite discharge of sediments. Erosion control for single-
family residences shall be installed in accordance with the Erosion Control for
Small Site Development brochure provided by the City. This brochure will be
made available by the City Engineer for review by the public.
   4.   Individual service and sewer connections for single- or two-family
residences.
   5.   Agricultural practices involving the establishment, cultivation or
harvesting of products of the field or orchard, preparing and planting of
pasture land, forestry land management practices including harvesting, farm
ponds, dairy operations, and livestock and poultry management practices, and
the construction of farm buildings within the City limits.
   6.   Installation, maintenance, and repair of any underground public utility
lines when such activity occurs within existing right-of-way on a hard-surfaced
road, street, or sidewalk. This work shall be confined to the public right-of-
way.
   7.   Larger utility installations will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis
with regard to the necessity for installation of sediment and erosion controls.
   8.   Cemetery grave preparation.
   9.   Emergencies posing an immediate danger to life or property.
102.14 MAINTENANCE COVENANT FOR STORM WATER CONTROL FEATURES.
Maintenance of all storm water management facilities shall be ensured through
the creation of a formal maintenance covenant that shall be approved by the
City and recorded with the land record, or deed of dedication, prior to final
plan (final plat) approval. As part of the covenant, a schedule shall be
developed for when, and at what frequency, maintenance shall occur to storm
water management features to ensure proper function of the storm water
features. The covenant shall also include an outline for periodic inspection to
monitor proper performance of the drainage features between scheduled cleaning
and maintenance. Subsequent owners of property shall be bound by the
maintenance covenant approved for the property. The subsequent property owner
shall maintain temporary and permanent erosion control measures in proper
condition. A legally binding covenant specifying the parties responsible for
the proper maintenance of all storm water management facilities shall be
provided to the City prior to issuance of construction permits and/or site
approval documentation.
102.15 RESPONSIBILITY.
No condition of this plan shall release the owner/developer from any
responsibility or requirements under other environmental statutes or
regulations.
102.16 RIGHT OF INSPECTION ON PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROPERTY.
The City Engineer may enter public or private property for the purpose of
investigating and inspecting erosion control measures approved under a SWPPP
reviewed by the City. The City Engineer may also investigate and inspect
conditions and practices that may contribute to storm water pollution, and
inspect on-site detention or retention facilities to determine compliance with
approved design plans. The City Engineer shall also have the right to inspect
public and private property within the City to determine the source and nature
of pollutants, hazards, and/or activities creating or promoting storm water
pollution within the City limits.
102.17 GRANTING A VARIANCE.
The City Engineer may grant a variance from the requirements of this chapter,
providing this action would not result in a violation of City, State, or
Federal regulations. The City Engineer shall review circumstances applicable to
the construction site, and if determined that strict adherence to the
provisions of this chapter would result in unnecessary hardship to the owner/
developer, the City Engineer may grant a variance to specific requirements of
the chapter. A written request for a variance shall be required from the owner/
developer and shall state the specific variance sought and the reasons, with
supporting data, why a variance shall be granted. The request shall include all
information necessary to evaluate the proposed variance. The petition shall be
filed with the City Engineer. The City Engineer shall conduct a review of the
request for variance within fifteen (15) days after receipt, and may either
support or reject the request. If the City Engineer rejects the request, the
owner/developer may request review of the request for variance by the City
Council. City Council decision shall be considered final.

102.21 ENFORCEMENT MEASURES AFTER APPEAL.
If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth
in the Notice of Violation, or in the event of an appeal, within fourteen (14)
days of the decision of the Zoning Board of Adjustment upholding the decision
of the City Engineer, the City Engineer shall enter upon the subject property
and take measures as are reasonably necessary to abate the violation and/or
restore the property to a condition that is in compliance with the provisions
of this chapter. It is unlawful for any person to refuse to allow the City or
the City’s designated contractor to enter upon any premises in the City for the
purposes of investigating, correcting, or abating violations, or otherwise
enforcing the provisions of this chapter.
102.22 COST OF ABATEMENT OF THE VIOLATION.
After abatement of the violation, the owner of the property shall be notified
of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property owner
may, within 30 days following notice of abatement costs, file a written protest
objecting to the amount of the assessment. If the amount due is not paid within
a timely manner as determined by the City Engineer, the assessment shall
constitute a lien on the property pursuant to Section 384.84 of the Code of
Iowa. Any abatement costs not paid in full within 30 days of final
determination shall bear interest at the legal rate of interest provided by
law, until paid in full. Prior written notice of intent to certify a lien shall
be given to the property owner at least 30 days prior to certification. The
notice shall be sent to the property owner by ordinary mail not less than 30
days prior to the certification of the lien to the County Treasurer. After
compliance with the foregoing provisions, the City Clerk shall certify for
taxation purposes and for purposes of the establishing of the property lien to
the County Treasurer all delinquent abatement costs, together with an
administrative expense of $5.00. The lien shall not be certified to the County
Treasurer for a delinquent cost of less than $5.00. For the purpose of the
certification and for no other purpose whatsoever, assessment costs shall be
designated as delinquent when the payments are shown and appear on the books of
the City to have been unpaid for a period of six (6) months following their due
date.
102.23 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
It is unlawful for any person to violate or fail to comply with any of the
requirements of this chapter. If a person has violated, or continues to
violate, the provisions of this chapter, the City Engineer may petition a court
for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from violation
of the provisions of this chapter, or compelling the person to perform
abatement or remediation of any such violations.
102.24 COMPENSATORY ACTION.
In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized by this
chapter, the City Engineer may impose upon a violator alternative compensatory
actions. These actions may include, but are not limited to, storm drain
labeling, attendance at storm water pollution prevention compliance workshops,
the cleanup of local waterways or creeks, or any other activity as determined
appropriate by the City Engineer. The failure of any person to complete any
compensatory actions imposed by the City Engineer shall be a violation of this
chapter.
102.25 VIOLATIONS DEEMED A PUBLIC NUISANCE.
In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any condition
caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this
chapter shall be considered a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and
is hereby declared and deemed a nuisance. Any such nuisance may be summarily
abated or restored at the violator’s expense, or a civil action to abate,
enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may be undertaken as
authorized by law.
102.26 MUNICIPAL INFRACTION.

102.28 COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER REQUIREMENTS.
This chapter is not intended to repeal, interfere with, abrogate, impair, or
annul any existing article, rule, or regulation, statute, or other provision of
law. The requirements of this chapter shall be considered minimum requirements,
and where any provision of this chapter imposes restrictions different from
those imposed by any other article, rule or regulations, or other provision of
law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective
standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take
precedence.
102.29 ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY.
The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this chapter are
minimum standards; therefore, this chapter does not intend or imply that
compliance by any person shall ensure that there will be no contamination,
pollution, or unauthorized discharge of pollutants into the MS4, waters of the

103.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish erosion, sediment controls, and
inspection procedures for controlling the introduction of pollutants to the
Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) from developed or redeveloped
properties. Post-construction storm water inspections are limited to developed
sites of one acre in size (43,560 square feet) or greater. The City Engineer
herein grants an exemption to post-construction inspections for sites less than
one acre, given the amount of impervious surface created is not in excess of
11,000 square feet (approximately ¼ acre).
103.02 INSPECTION OF STORM WATER MANAGEMENT FEATURES.
   1.   The City Engineer or an authorized representative shall establish and
maintain a storm water inspection schedule that includes (but is not limited
to):
      A.   Routine inspections;
      B.   Random inspections;
      C.   Inspections based upon public complaints;
      D.   Inspections based upon notice of possible violation;
      E.   Inspection of areas identified as having a higher than typical
potential for sediment or pollutant exposure, such as construction sites,
detention and retention basins;
      F.   Inspections of businesses or industries of a type associated with
discharges that are more likely than the typical discharge to cause violations
of State or Federal water or sediment quality standards, or the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase II storm water permit and
the Clean Water Act; and
      G.   Joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under environmental
or safety regulations as deemed necessary.
   2.   Inspections may include (but are not limited to) the following:
      A.   Evaluating the condition and current need for maintenance of storm
water control features such as inlets, manholes, piping, detention, and
retention basins;
      B.   Sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, sediment material
or standing water in drainage control facilities as deemed necessary;
      C.   Reviewing maintenance and repair records of storm water facilities;
      D.   Verification that storm water facilities, approved during
construction plan review, such as detention basins, retention basins, piping
and inlets are present and in good condition.
103.03 RIGHT OF ENTRY FOR INSPECTION.
   1.   The City Engineer, bearing proper credentials and identification, may
enter and inspect properties within the City for regular periodic inspections,
random inspections, investigations, monitoring, observation, measurement,
enforcement, sampling, and testing to enforce Federal, State and local
regulations related to the protection of storm water runoff quality and the
City’s Storm Water Management Program.
   2.   The City Engineer shall duly notify the owner of said property, or the
representative of the owner on-site, of the inspection. The inspection shall be
conducted at reasonable times during the business day.
   3.   Right of entry includes the right to enter a property for routine and
random inspections, or when the City Engineer has a reasonable basis to believe
that a violation of Federal, State, or local regulations is occurring or has
occurred. Following inspection, the City Engineer shall require abatement or
corrections of violations of storm water regulations.
103.04 REQUIREMENTS FOR MAINTENANCE.
   1.   All storm water management features shall undergo an annual inspection
to document maintenance and repair needs, and ensure compliance with
requirements of this chapter and federal and State regulations.
   2.   Repair needs may include (but are not limited to) removal of silt,
litter, and other debris from all catch basins, inlets, and drainage pipes,
grass cutting, vegetation removal, replacement of landscape vegetation and
maintenance to detention basins and retention basins.
   3.   Any maintenance needs found shall be addressed in a timely manner, as
determined by the City Engineer, and the inspection and maintenance frequency
may be increased or decreased as deemed necessary to ensure proper functioning
of the storm water facilities.
103.05 RECORDS OF INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.
Parties responsible for the operation and maintenance of a storm water
management facility shall maintain records of the installation, maintenance,
and repair of storm water facilities. These records shall be made available to
inspection personnel upon request. Records shall be maintained for a period of
three years from the date of maintenance.
103.06 FAILURE TO MAINTAIN DRAINAGE FEATURES.
   1.   If a responsible party fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the
maintenance agreement, the City Engineer, after reasonable notice, may correct
a violation of the drainage facility or conduct necessary maintenance by
performing all necessary work to place the facility in proper working
condition.
   2.   In the event that the storm water management facility becomes a danger
to public safety or public health, or violates federal, State, or local
regulations, the City Engineer shall notify the party responsible for
maintenance of the storm water management facility in writing. Upon receipt of
that notice, the responsible person shall have 14 days from the date of the
notice to effect maintenance and repair of the facility in an approved manner.
After proper notice, the City may assess the owners of the facility for the
cost of repair work and any penalties; and the cost of the work shall be a lien
on the property, or prorated against the beneficial users of the property, and
may be placed on the tax bill and collected as ordinary taxes.
103.07 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
When the City Engineer determines that a storm water facility is in need of
maintenance, in accordance with the requirements of this chapter, the City

   7.   A statement of the penalty, or penalties, that shall be assessed
against the person to whom the notice of violation is directed; and
   8.   A statement that the determination of violation may be appealed to the
Zoning Board of Adjustment by filing a written notice of appeal within 14 days
of service of notice of violation.
The notice shall also advise that, if the violator fails to take required
remedial action within the stated deadline, the work may be done by a
designated governmental agency or a private contractor, in either case at the
sole expense of the violator.
103.08 APPEAL OF NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
Persons receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of the
City Engineer. The notice of appeal must be received within 14 days from the
date of the notice of violation. Hearing on the appeal before the Zoning Board
of Adjustment shall take place within 14 days after the date of receipt of the
notice of appeal, unless extended for good cause. The decision of the Zoning
Board of Adjustment shall be final.
103.09 ENFORCEMENT MEASURES AFTER APPEAL.

purpose of investigations, correcting or abating violations, or otherwise
enforcing the provisions of this chapter.
103.10 VIOLATIONS.
After abatement of the violation, the owner of the property shall be notified
of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property owner
may, within 30 days following notice of abatement costs, file a written protest
objecting to the amount of the assessment. If the amount due is not paid within
30 days, the assessment shall constitute a lien on the property pursuant to
Section 384.84 of the Code of Iowa. Any abatement costs not paid in full within
30 days of final determination shall bear interest at the legal rate of
interest provided by law, until paid in full. Prior written notice of intent to
certify a lien shall be given to the property owner at least thirty (30) days
prior to certification. The notice shall be sent to the property owner by
ordinary mail not less than 30 days prior to the certification of the lien to
the County Treasurer. After compliance with the foregoing provisions, the City
Clerk shall certify for taxation purposes and for purposes of the establishing
of the property lien to the County Treasurer all delinquent abatement costs,

chapter, the City Engineer may impose upon a violator alternative compensatory
actions. These actions may include, but are not limited to, storm drain
labeling, attendance at storm water pollution prevention compliance workshops,
the cleanup of local waterways or creeks, or any other activity as determined
appropriate by the City Engineer. The failure of any person to complete any
compensatory actions imposed by the City Engineer shall be a violation of this
chapter.
103.13 VIOLATIONS DEEMED A PUBLIC NUISANCE.
In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any condition
caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this
chapter shall be considered a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and

abated or restored at the violator's expense, or a civil action to abate,
enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may be undertaken as
authorized by law.
103.14 MUNICIPAL INFRACTION.
Any violation of any provision of this chapter is hereby declared to be a

   3.   Prohibited Trees. No person shall plant in any street right-of-way any
fruit-bearing tree or any tree of the kinds commonly known as cottonwood,
poplar, box elder, Chinese elm, evergreen, willow or black walnut.
151.03 DUTY TO TRIM TREES.
The owner or agent of the abutting property shall keep the trees on, or
overhanging the street, trimmed so that all branches will be at least fifteen
(15) feet above the surface of the street and eight (8) feet above the
sidewalks. If the abutting property owner fails to trim the trees, the City may
serve notice on the abutting property owner requiring that such action be taken
within five (5) days. If such action is not taken within that time, the City
may perform the required action and assess the costs against the abutting
property for collection in the same manner as a property tax.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[2c, d & e])
151.04 TRIMMING TREES TO BE SUPERVISED.
Except as allowed in Section
151.03, it is unlawful for any person to trim or cut any tree in a street or
public place unless the work is done under the supervision of the City.
151.05 DISEASE CONTROL.
Any dead, diseased or damaged tree or shrub which may harbor serious insect or
disease pests or disease injurious to other trees is hereby declared to be a
nuisance.
151.06 INSPECTION AND REMOVAL.
The Council shall inspect or cause to be inspected any trees or shrubs in the
City reported or suspected to be dead, diseased or damaged, and such trees and
shrubs shall be subject to the following:
   1.   City Property. If it is determined that any such condition exists on
any public property, including the strip between the curb and the lot line of
private property, the Council may cause such condition to be corrected by
treatment or removal. The Council may also order the removal of any trees on
the streets of the City which interfere with the making of improvements or with
travel thereon.
   2.   Private Property. If it is determined with reasonable certainty that
any such condition exists on private property and that danger to other trees or
to adjoining property or passing motorists or pedestrians is imminent, the
Council shall notify by certified mail the owner, occupant or person in charge
of such property to correct such condition by treatment or removal within
fourteen (14) days of said notification. If such owner, occupant or person in
charge of said property fails to comply within fourteen (14) days of receipt of
notice, the Council may cause the condition to be corrected and the cost
assessed against the property.

shall be included in the estimated cost of repair.
   34.   “Substantial improvement” means any improvement to a structure which
satisfies either of the following criteria:
      A.   Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost
of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the
structure either: (i) before the “start of construction” of the improvement; or
(ii) if the structure has been “substantially damaged” and is being restored,
before the damage occurred.
      The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a
structure to correct existing violations of State or local health, sanitary, or
safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living
conditions. The term also does not include any alteration of an “historic
structure,” provided the alteration will not preclude the structure’s
designation as an “historic structure.”
      B.   Any addition which increases the original floor area of a building
by 25 percent or more. All additions constructed after the effective date of
the first floodplain management regulations adopted by the community shall be
added to any proposed addition in determining whether the total increase in
original floor space would exceed 25 percent.
   35.   “Variance” means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of
the floodplain management regulations.
   36.   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to

160.02   STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
   1.   The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 364, Code of Iowa,
as amended, delegated the power to cities to exercise any power and perform any
function it deems appropriate to protect and preserve the rights, privileges
and property of the City or of its residents, and to preserve and improve the
peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort and convenience of its residents.
   2.   Findings of Fact.
      A.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Riverdale are subject to
periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare of the community.
      B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by: (i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
      C.   This ordinance relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing
flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the
Department of Natural Resources.
   3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to protect
and preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City of Riverdale and
its residents and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare,
and comfort and convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses
described in 160.02(2)(A) of this ordinance with provisions designed to:
      A.   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows
so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
      B.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
      C.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
      D.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
      E.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   1.   Lands to Which Ordinance Apply. The provisions of this ordinance shall
apply to all lands and development which have significant flood hazards. The
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Scott County and Incorporated Areas, City
of Riverdale, Panels 19163C0386H, 0387H, and 0388H, dated April 11, 2024 and
0389G dated March 23, 2021, which were prepared as part of the Scott County
Flood Insurance Study, shall be used to identify such flood hazard areas and
all areas shown thereon to be within the boundaries of the base flood shall be
considered as having significant flood hazards. The Flood Insurance Study for
the County of Scott County is hereby adopted by reference and is made a part of
this ordinance for the purpose of administering floodplain management
regulations.
   2.   Rules for Interpretation of Flood Hazard Boundaries. The boundaries of
the Special Flood Hazard Areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the
official Flood Insurance Rate Map. Where uncertainty exists with respect to the
precise location of the base flood boundary, the location shall be determined
on the basis of the base flood elevation at the particular site in question.
When an interpretation is needed as to the exact location of a boundary, the
Scott County Director of Planning and Development shall make the necessary
interpretation. The City Council shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
made by the Scott County Director of Planning and Development in the
enforcement or administration of this ordinance.
   3.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no
structure shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without
full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this ordinance.
   4.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this
ordinance to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions,
the provision of this ordinance shall prevail. All other ordinances
inconsistent with this ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of the
inconsistency only.
   5.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this ordinance shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be
liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a
limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
   6.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
ordinance are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This ordinance
does not imply that areas outside the designated areas of significant flood
hazard will be free from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance shall not
create liability on the part of the City of Riverdale or any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made there under. 
   7.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision or portion of this
ordinance is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected thereby.

Notes
  EDITOR’S NOTE: Pursuant to a 28E agreement by and between the City and the
  Scott County Board of Supervisors, the City delegates the duties and
responsibilities of administering the floodplain regulations to the Scott
  County Planning and Development Department, except the legal enforcement of
  floodplain ordinance violations.
160.05   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT STANDARDS.
   1.   General Floodplain Standards. All development must be consistent with
the need to minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance
standards. Where base flood elevations have not been provided in the Flood
Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to
determine (i) whether the land involved is either wholly or partly within the
floodway or floodway fringe and (ii) the base flood elevation. Until a
regulatory floodway is designated, no development may increase the base flood
elevation more than one (1) foot. The applicant will be responsible for
providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical
information to make such determination.
Review by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources is not required for the
proposed construction of new or replacement bridges or culverts where (i) the
bridge or culvert is located on a stream that drains less than two (2) square
miles, and (ii) the bridge or culvert is not associated with a channel
modification that constitutes a channel change as specified in 567.71.2(2),
Iowa Administrative Code.
      A.   All Development. All development within the Special Flood Hazard
Areas shall:
         (1)   Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement.
         (2)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
         (3)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are
resistant to flood damage.
      B.   Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved
residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Construction
shall be upon compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than 1.0
ft. above the base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18
feet beyond the limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of
elevating (such as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed subject to
favorable consideration by the City Council, where existing topography, street
grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods
used must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various
forces and hazards associated with flooding.
      All new residential structures located in areas that would become
isolated due to flooding of surrounding ground shall be provided with a means
of access that will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the base flood.
However, this criterion shall not apply where the Administrator determines
there is sufficient flood warning time for the protection of life and property.
When estimating flood warning time, consideration shall be given to the

engineer registered in the State of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing
methods used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities,
impact and uplift forces and other factors associated with the 0.2% annual
chance flood; and that the structure, below the 0.2% annual chance flood
elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water. A record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in
relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator. Where 0.2% chance flood
elevation data has not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The
applicant will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources
with sufficient technical information to make such determinations.
   2.   Special Floodway Provisions. In addition to the general floodplain
standards, development within the floodway must meet the following applicable
standards. The floodway is that portion of the floodplain which must be
protected from developmental encroachment to allow the free flow of flood
waters. Where floodway data has been provided in the Flood Insurance Study,
such data shall be used to define the floodway. Where no floodway data has been
provided, the Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to provide a
floodway delineation. The applicant will be responsible for providing the
Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make
such determination.
      A.   No development shall be permitted in the floodway that would result
in any increase in the base flood elevation. Consideration of the effects of
any development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption that an
equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly situated lands.
      B.   All development within the floodway shall:
         (1)   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
         (2)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
         (3)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are
resistant to flood damage.
      C.   No development shall affect the capacity or conveyance of the
channel or floodway of any tributary to the main stream, drainage ditch or any
other drainage facility or system.
      D.   Structures, buildings, recreational vehicles, and sanitary and
utility systems, if permitted, shall meet the applicable general floodplain
standards and shall be constructed or aligned to present the minimum possible
resistance to flood flows.
      E.   Structures, if permitted, shall have a low flood damage potential
and shall not be for human habitation.
      F.   Storage of materials or equipment that are buoyant, flammable,
explosive or injurious to human, animal or plant lift is prohibited. Storage of
other material may be allowed if readily removable from the floodway within the
time available after flood warning.
      G.   Watercourse alterations or relocations (channel changes and
modifications) must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within
the altered or relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations
must be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
      H.   Any fill allowed in the floodway must be shown to have some
beneficial purpose and shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary.
      I.   Pipeline river or stream crossings shall be buried in the streambed
and banks or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due to channel
degradation and meandering or due to the action of flood flows.

160.06   VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   1.   The City Council may authorize upon request in specific cases such
variances from the terms of this ordinances that will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances
granted must meet the following applicable standards.
      A.   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
      B.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
      C.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      D.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for structures than what is ordinarily required by this ordinance,
the applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the
Administrator that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of
insurance coverage and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and
property.
      E.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
   2.   Factors Upon Which the Decision of the City Council Shall Be Based. In
passing upon applications for variances, the Council shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this ordinances and:
      A.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
      B.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
      C.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.
      D.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      E.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the City.
      F.   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
      G.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
      H.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
      I.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for the area.
      J.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      K.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood water expected at the site.
      L.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and bridges.
      M.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
ordinance.
   3.   Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the City Council may attached such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this ordinance. Such
conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
      A.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
      B.   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
      C.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
      D.   Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this ordinance.
      E.   Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the flood
protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration, rate
of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated with
the regulatory flood. The Council shall require that the applicant submit a
plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
160.07   NONCONFORMING USES.
   1.   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful
before the passage or amendment of this ordinance, but which is not in
conformity with the provisions of this ordinance, may be continued subject to
the following conditions:
      A.   If such use is discontinued for six (6) consecutive months, any
future use of the building premises shall conform to this ordinance.
      B.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
      C.   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than fifty
(50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred,
unless it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance.
This limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with
existing State or local health, sanitary, building or safety codes or
regulations or the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National
Register of Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude
its continued designation.
   2.   Except as provided in 160.07(1)(B), any use which has been permitted as
a variance shall be considered a conforming use.
160.08   PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
Violations of the provisions of this ordinance or failure to comply with any of
the requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this
ordinance or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction
thereof be fined not more than $100.00 (one hundred dollars) or imprisoned for
not more than thirty (30) days. Nothing herein contained prevent the City of
Riverdale from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy violation.
160.09   AMENDMENTS.
The regulations and standards set forth in this ordinance may from time to time
be amended, supplemented, changed, or repealed. No amendment, supplement,
change, or modification shall be undertaken without prior approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
