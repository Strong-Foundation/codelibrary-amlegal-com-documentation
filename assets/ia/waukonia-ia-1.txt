alternative relief may include, but is not limited to, an order for abatement
or injunctive relief.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.22[9])

this section, all of the taxes levied and collected upon the taxable property

46.01   CURFEW.
The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote the
public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the City and specifically
to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults responsible for
minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors committed after
the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences and criminal

reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that
responsible adult’s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful

where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to

parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but

magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
      E.   “Public place” includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys, and sidewalks dedicated to public use and also includes such

considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.

within the time periods prohibited by this section unless the minor’s presence
falls within one of the above exceptions.

      A.   Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in
the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driver’s
license, a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance,
use his or her best judgment in determining age.
      B.   Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody. Grounds for arrest are
that the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the person’s
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any nonsecured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into
custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.

minor as soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible
for the minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at
such time as the court may direct.
      D.   Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minor’s parent, guardian or other person
legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the
law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative
of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person
who is known to the child.

minimum of every 30 days from May 1 through October 1.
   4.   Grading or Leveling. In the event any such nuisance cannot be cut,
removed or destroyed by the usual and ordinary methods because of the terrain
or rough surface of the property, then the person designated to remove or
destroy the weeds may cause the property to be graded or otherwise leveled
sufficiently so that such cutting, removal or destruction can be accomplished.
   5.   Additional Control Required. In addition to the May 1, June 1, July 1,

person shall certify the costs and expenses thereof to the Clerk, who shall
notify the property owner of said costs by ordinary or certified mail. Any

be delivered personally or by certified mail to the Clerk. The hearing of such
appeal shall be scheduled within seven days of the receipt of the notice of

identities and addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders,
notice by one publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area
where the vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of
notice under Subsection 2 of this section. The published notice may contain

time requirements and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed

abandoned motor vehicle, or any person being the owner of a motor vehicle whose
title certificate is faulty, lost, or destroyed, may dispose of such motor
vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without notification
procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more wheels or
other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable. The police
authority shall give the applicant a certificate of authority. The applicant

substance that, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, is capable
of creating a public nuisance or hazard to life or of preventing entry into
sewers for their maintenance and repair.
   12.   Damaging Substances. Any waters, wastes, materials, or substances that
react with water or wastes in the sewer system to release noxious gases,
develop color of undesirable intensity, form suspended solids in objectionable
concentration, or create any other condition deleterious to structures and
treatment processes.
   13.   Untreatable Wastes. Waters or wastes containing substances that are
not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes
employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage
treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having
jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.
97.05   RESTRICTED DISCHARGES; POWERS OF SUPERINTENDENT.
If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the
public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in Section 97.04 and which in the judgment of the
Superintendent may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes,
equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or
constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent may:
   1.   Rejection. Reject the wastes by requiring disconnection from the public
sewage system;
   2.   Pretreatment. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for
discharge to the public sewers;
   3.   Controls Imposed. Require control over the quantities and rates of
discharge; and/or
   4.   Special Charges. Require payment to cover the added cost of handling
and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under
the provisions of
Chapter 99.
97.06   SPECIAL FACILITIES.
If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows,
the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the Superintendent and subject to the requirements of
all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws. Where preliminary treatment or
flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be
maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at
the owner’s expense.
97.07   CONTROL MANHOLES.
When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner’s
expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
97.08   TESTING OF WASTES.
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from
periodic grab samples).
97.09   SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS.
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as preventing any special agreement
or arrangement between the City and any industrial concern whereby industrial
wastewater of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the City for
treatment, subject to payment therefor by the industrial concern.

Commercial wastewater haulers transporting wastewater collected from sources
not connected to the wastewater system shall be permitted to discharge their
loads to the wastewater system provided the Superintendent determines the
strength of such wastewater is not significantly greater than or less than
normal domestic wastewater. The locations, procedures, and permitted frequency
of such discharges shall be determined by the Superintendent. For purposes of
this section, “commercial wastewater hauler” means any private entity that
collects and disposes of wastewater for a fee or accumulates and disposes of
wastewater as part of a commercial enterprise, such as a bus service or

110.01   FRANCHISE GRANTED.
The City of Waukon, Iowa, (hereinafter referred to as “Grantor”) hereby grants
a non-exclusive franchise to Aquila, Inc, d/b/a Aquila Networks, a Delaware
corporation, (hereinafter called “Grantee”), its lessees, successors, and
assigns. Grantee is hereby granted the right, privilege, franchise, permission,
and authority to lay, construct, install, maintain, operate, and extend in,
along, over, or across the present and future streets, alleys, avenues,
bridges, and public rights-of-way as are now within the present or future
limits of said Grantor, a natural gas distribution system and all facilities
necessary for the purpose of supplying natural gas or processed gas for all
purposes to the inhabitants of said Grantor and consumers in the vicinity
thereof, and for the distribution of natural gas from or through said Grantor
to points beyond the limits thereof. Such facilities shall include, but not be
limited to, all mains, services, pipes, conduits, and appliances necessary or
convenient for transmitting, transporting, distributing, and supplying natural
gas for all purposes for which it may be used, and to do all other things
necessary and proper in providing natural gas service to the inhabitants of
Grantor and in carrying on such business. 5
 
Notes
5 †  EDITOR’S NOTE: Ordinance No. 599, adopting a natural gas franchise for the
  City, was passed and adopted on September 6, 2005.
110.02   TERM; PERIODIC REVIEW.
The rights and privileges granted by this chapter shall remain in effect for a
period of 10 years from the effective date of the ordinance codified in this
chapter (the “initial term”), followed by an additional period of 10 years
after the expiration of the initial term (the “renewal term”), and an
additional period of five years after the expiration of the renewal term,
unless the City notifies the Company in writing at least 180 days before the
expiration of the initial term or renewal term that it desires not to renew the
franchise. The effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall
be determined pursuant to State law.
110.03   GOVERNING RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   1.   This franchise is granted subject to all conditions, limitations, and
immunities now provided for, or as hereafter amended, and applicable to the
operations of a public utility, by State or federal law. The rates to be
charged by Grantee for service within the present or future corporate limits of
Grantor and the rules and regulations regarding the character, quality, and
standards of service to be furnished by Grantee shall be under the jurisdiction
and control of such regulatory body or bodies as may, from time to time, be
vested by law with authority and jurisdiction over the rates, regulations, and
quality and standards of service to be supplied by Grantee. Provided however,
should any judicial, regulatory, or legislative body, having proper
jurisdiction, take any action that precludes Grantee from recovering from its
customers any cost associated with services provided hereunder, then Grantee
and Grantor shall renegotiate the terms of this franchise in accordance with
the action taken. In determining the rights and duties of the Grantee, the
terms of this franchise ordinance shall take precedence over any conflicting
terms or requirements contained in any other ordinance enacted by the Grantor.
   2.   If an energy supplier is unable to furnish an adequate supply of energy
due to an emergency, an order or decision of a public regulatory body, or other
acts beyond the control of the Grantee, then the Grantee shall have the right
and authority to adopt reasonable rules and regulations limiting, curtailing,
or allocating extensions of service or supply of energy to any customers or
prospective customers, and withholding the supply of energy to new customers,
provided that such rules and regulations shall be uniform as applied to each
class of customers or prospective customers, and shall be non-discriminatory as
between communities receiving service from the Grantee.
110.04   CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF COMPANY FACILITIES.
   1.   Any pavements, sidewalks, or curbing taken up and any and all
excavations made shall be done in such a manner as to cause only such
inconvenience to the inhabitants of Grantor and to the general public as is
reasonably necessary; and repairs and replacements shall be made promptly by
Grantee, leaving such properties in as good a condition as existed immediately
prior to excavation.
   2.   Grantee agrees, that for the term of this grant, it will maintain
facilities and equipment sufficient to meet the current and future energy
requirements of Grantor, its inhabitants, and industries. While maintaining its
facilities and equipment, Grantee shall obtain permits as required by
ordinance, except that in emergency situations Grantee shall take immediate
unilateral actions as it determines are necessary to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare; in which case, Grantee shall notify Grantor as soon as
reasonably possible.
   3.   Grantor will give Grantee reasonable notice of plans for street
improvements where paving or resurfacing of a permanent nature is involved that
affect Grantee’s facilities. The notice shall contain the nature and character
of the improvements, the rights-of-way upon which the improvements are to be
made, the extent of the improvements and the time when the Grantor will start
the work, and, if more than one right-of-way is involved, the order in which
this work is to proceed. The notice shall be given to the Grantee a sufficient
length of time, considering seasonable working conditions, in advance of the
actual commencement of the work to permit the Grantee to make any additions,
alterations, or repairs to its facilities.
110.05   FRANCHISE FEE.
   1.   Franchise Fee. The City of Waukon, Iowa, (hereinafter referred to as
the “Municipality”) hereby establishes a franchise fee on every natural gas
company, firm or corporation, their successors and assigns, owning, operating,
controlling, leasing or managing a natural gas plant or system and/or
generating, manufacturing, selling, distributing, or transporting natural gas
(hereinafter referred to, collectively, as “Natural Gas Providers,” each,
individually, as “Natural Gas Provider”). Natural Gas Providers shall collect
from their customers located within the corporate limits of the Municipality as
depicted on the Map (as defined below), excluding the Municipality and its
municipal hospital, and pay to the Municipality an amount equal to three
percent of gross receipts Natural Gas Providers derive from the sale,
distribution, or transportation of natural gas delivered within the present
limits of the Municipality. Gross receipts as used herein are revenues received
from the sale, distribution, or transportation of natural gas, after adjustment
for the net write-off of uncollectible accounts and corrections of bills
theretofore rendered.
   2.   Exemption from Other Fees. The amount paid by Natural Gas Providers
shall be in lieu of, and Natural Gas Providers shall be exempt from, all other
fees, charges, taxes, or assessments which the Municipality may impose for the
privilege of doing business within the Municipality, including, without
limitation, excise taxes, occupation taxes, licensing fees, or right-of-way
permit fees, and in the event the Municipality imposes any such fee, charge,
tax, or assessment, the payment to be made by Natural Gas Providers in
accordance with this chapter shall be reduced in an amount equal to any such
fee, charge, tax, or assessment imposed upon the Natural Gas Providers. Ad
valorem property taxes imposed generally upon all real and personal property
within the Municipality shall not be deemed to affect Natural Gas Providers’
obligations under this chapter.
   3.   Payment of Fees. Natural Gas Providers shall report and pay any amount
payable under this chapter on a monthly basis. Such payment shall be made no
more than 30 days following the close of the period for which payment is due.
Initial and final payments shall be prorated for the portions of the periods at
the beginning and end of any franchise granted by the Municipality to a Natural
Gas Provider.
   4.   Notice of Fees. Natural Gas Providers shall list the franchise fee
collected from customers as a separate item on bills for utility service issued
to their customers. If at any time the Iowa Utilities Board or other authority
having proper jurisdiction prohibits such recovery, Natural Gas Providers will
no longer be obligated to collect and pay the franchise fee until an alternate
lawful franchise fee can be negotiated and implemented. In addition, with prior
approval of the Municipality, Natural Gas Providers may reduce the franchise
fee payable for natural gas delivered to a specific customer when such
reduction is required to attract or retain the business of that customer.
   5.   Determination of Customers. Within 10 days of the date of this chapter,
the Municipality shall provide the Natural Gas Providers with a map of its
corporate limits (the “Map”). The Map shall be of sufficient detail to assist
Natural Gas Providers in determining whether their customers reside within the
Municipality’s corporate limits. The Map, along with Natural Gas Provider’s
Geographic Information System (“GIS”) mapping information, shall serve as the
sole basis for determining Natural Gas Provider’s obligation hereunder to
collect and pay the franchise fee from customers; provided, however, that if
the Municipality’s corporate limits are changed by annexation or otherwise, it
shall be the Municipality’s sole responsibility to (a) update the Map, so that
such changes are included therein, and (b) provide the updated Map to the
Natural Gas Providers. A Natural Gas Provider’s obligation to collect and pay
the franchise fee from customers within an annexed area shall not commence
until the later: (a) of 60 days after such Natural Gas Provider’s receipt from
the Municipality of an updated Map including such annexed area, or (b) such
time after such Natural Gas Provider’s receipt from the Municipality of an
updated Map including such annexed area as is reasonably necessary for such
Natural Gas Provider to identify the customers in the annexed area obligated to
pay the franchise fee.
   6.   Annexation Ordinances. The Municipality shall provide copies of
annexation ordinances to Natural Gas Providers on a timely basis to ensure
appropriate Franchise fee collection from customers within the corporate limits
of the City as set forth in Subsection 4 above.
   7.   Books and Records. The Municipality shall have access to and the right
to examine, during normal business hours, Natural Gas Provider’s books,
receipts, files, records, and documents as is reasonably necessary to verify
the accuracy of payments due hereunder; provided, that the Municipality shall
not exercise such right more than twice per calendar year. If it is determined
that a mistake was made in the payment of any franchise fee required hereunder,
such mistake shall be corrected promptly upon discovery such that any under-
payment by a Natural Gas Provider shall be paid within 30 days of recalculation
of the amount due, and any over-payment by a Natural Gas Provider shall be
deducted from the next payment of such franchise fee due by such Natural Gas
Provider to the Municipality; provided, that neither party shall have the
obligation to correct a mistake that is discovered more than one year after the
occurrence thereof.
110.06   EXTENSION OF COMPANY FACILITIES.
Upon receipt and acceptance of a valid application for service, Grantee shall,
subject to its own economic feasibility criteria and the applicable regulations
of the Iowa Utilities Board, make reasonable extensions of its distribution
facilities to serve customers located within the current or future corporate
limits of Grantor.
110.07   RELOCATION OF COMPANY FACILITIES.
   1.   The Grantee shall, at its cost and expense, locate and relocate its
installations in, on, over, or under any public street or alley in the City in
such manner as the Grantor may at any time reasonably require for the purposes
of facilitating the construction, reconstruction, maintenance, or repair of the
street or alley or any public improvement of, in, or about any such street or
alley or reasonably promoting the efficient operation of any such improvement;
provided, however, that Grantee shall not be obligated to relocate its
facilities or equipment situated in a public right-of-way, at its expense,
unless the Grantor’s request for relocation is made to facilitate a public
improvement and the Grantor provides the Grantee with a reasonable alternative
location for its facilities. If the Grantee believes that the Grantor has a
reasonable alternative route for the street, alley, or public improvements,
which alternative route would not cause the relocation of the Grantee
installations, the Grantor will consider said alternative route. If relocation
of the Grantee facilities could be avoided by relocating other franchisee’s or
facility user’s equipment and facilities and said other franchisee’s or user’s
cost of relocation is less than the Grantee’s cost of relocation, the Grantor
will consider the route that requires the other franchisees or users to
relocate. If project funds from a source other than the Grantor are available
to pay for the relocation of utility facilities, the Grantor shall use its best
efforts to secure said funds and provide them to the Grantee to compensate the
Grantee for the costs of relocation.
   2.   Grantor shall give Grantee written notice of the vacation of a public
right-of-way. The vacation of a public right-of-way shall not deprive the
Grantee of its right to operate and maintain existing facilities in such right-
of-way unless the reasonable cost of relocating the same is first paid to the
Grantee.
   3.   Any person or corporation desiring to move a building or other
structure along, or to make any unusual use of any street, alley, avenue,
bridge, public right-of-way, or public place which shall interfere with the
facilities or equipment of the Grantee, shall first give notice to the Grantor
and the Grantee and a pay a sum sufficient to cover the expense and damage
incident to the moving of Grantee’s facilities and equipment.
110.08   CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
Grantor acknowledges that certain information it might request pursuant to this
franchise may be of a proprietary and confidential nature. If Grantee requests
that any information provided by Grantee to Grantor be kept confidential due to
such proprietary or commercial value, Grantor and its employees, agents, and
representatives shall maintain the confidentiality of that information, to the
extent allowed by law. If Grantor is requested or required by legal or
administrative process to disclose any such confidential information, Grantor
shall promptly notify Grantee of such request or requirement so that Grantee
may seek an appropriate protective order or other relief. Grantor shall use all
reasonable efforts to ensure that the confidentiality of Grantee’s confidential
information is maintained.
110.09   FORCE MAJEURE.
It shall not be a breach or default under this franchise if either party fails
to perform its obligations hereunder due to Force Majeure. Force Majeure shall
include, but not be limited to, the following: 1) physical events such as acts
of God, landslides, lightning, earthquakes, fires, freezing, storms, floods,
washouts, explosions, breakage or accident or necessity of repairs to
machinery, equipment, or distribution or transmission lines; 2) acts of others
such as strikes, work-force stoppages, riots, sabotage, insurrections or wars;
3) governmental actions such as necessity for compliance with any court order,
law, statute, ordinance, executive order, or regulation promulgated by a
governmental authority having jurisdiction; and any other causes, whether of
the kind herein enumerated or otherwise, not reasonably within the control of
the affected party to prevent or overcome. Each party shall make reasonable
efforts to avoid Force Majeure and to resolve such event as promptly as
reasonably possible once it occurs in order to resume performance; provided,
however, that this provision shall not obligate a party to settle any labor
strike.
110.10   EMERGENCY RESPONSE.
Grantee, during the term of the franchise, shall respond within a reasonable
amount of time, in accordance with applicable state law, as may be amended from
time to time, to gas leaks or other emergency situations involving Grantee’s
facilities upon a request for assistance from fire, police, or rescue
authorities.
110.11   HOLD HARMLESS.
Grantee, during the term of this franchise, agrees to save harmless Grantor
from and against all claims, demands, losses, and expenses arising directly out
of the negligence of Grantee, its employees or agents, in the constructing,
operating, and maintaining of distribution and transmission facilities or
appliances of Grantee; provided, however, that Grantee need not save harmless
Grantor from claims, demands, losses and expenses arising out of the negligence
of Grantor, its employees, or agents.
110.12   NON-WAIVER.
Any waiver of any obligation or default under this franchise shall not be
construed as a waiver of any future defaults, whether of like or different
character.
110.13   CONFLICTING ORDINANCES REPEALED.
This franchise ordinance, when accepted by Grantee, shall constitute the entire
agreement between the Grantor and the Grantee relating to this franchise and
the same shall supersede all prior ordinances pertaining to this franchise
agreement, and any terms and conditions of such prior ordinances or parts of
ordinances in conflict herewith are hereby repealed. Ordinance No. 279 of the
City is hereby repealed as of the effective date hereof.

111.02   CONSTRUCTION; MAINTENANCE; INDEMNIFICATION.
The poles, lines, wires, circuits, and other appliances shall be placed and
maintained so as not to unnecessarily interfere with the travel on said
streets, alleys, and public places in said City nor unnecessarily interfere
with the proper use of the same, including ordinary drainage, or with the
sewers, underground pipe, and other property of the City. The said Company, its
successors, and assigns shall hold the City free and harmless from all damages

In making any excavations in any street, alley, or public place, Company, its
successors and assigns, shall protect the site while work is in progress by
guards, barriers or signals, shall not unnecessarily obstruct the use of the

or depressions in surface, pavement, or sidewalk of such excavations with same
materials, restoring the condition as nearly as practical. The Company shall
not be required to restore or modify public right-of-way, sidewalks, or other
areas in or adjacent to the Company project to a condition superior to its
immediate previously existing condition.
111.04   LOCATION AND RELOCATION.
The Company shall, at its cost, locate and relocate its existing facilities or
equipment in, on, over, or under any public street or alley in the City in such
a manner as the City may at any time reasonably require for the purposes of
facilitating the construction, reconstruction, maintenance, or repair of the
street or alley or any public improvement thereof, in or about any such street
or alley or reasonably promoting the efficient operation of any such
improvement. If the City requires the Company to relocate facilities in the
public right-of-way that have been relocated at Company expense at the
direction of the City during the previous 10 years, the reasonable costs of
such relocation will be paid by the City. If the City orders or requests the
Company to relocate its existing facilities or equipment for any reason other
than as specified above, or as the result of the initial request for a
commercial, private, or other non-public development, the Company shall receive
payment for the cost of such relocation as a precondition to relocating its
existing facilities or equipment. The City shall consider reasonable
alternatives in designing its public works projects so as not arbitrarily to
cause the Company unreasonable additional expense in exercising its authority
under this section. The City shall also provide a reasonable alternative
location for the Company’s facilities as part of its relocation request.
111.05   UTILITY EASEMENTS.
Prior to the City abandoning or vacating any street, avenue, alley, or public

The Company is authorized and empowered to prune or remove at Company expense
any tree extending into any street, alley, or public grounds to maintain
electric reliability, safety, to restore utility service and to prevent limbs,
branches, or trunks from interfering with the wires and facilities of the
Company. The pruning and removal of trees shall be performed in accordance with
Company’s then current line clearance vegetation plan as filed and approved by
the Iowa Utilities Board, as well as all applicable codes and standards
referenced therein.
111.07   STATE REGULATIONS.
During the term of this franchise, the Company shall furnish electric energy in

casualties, or reasonable interruptions necessary to properly service the
Company's equipment, and in such event service shall be resumed as quickly as
is reasonably possible.
111.09   FRANCHISE FEE.
There is hereby imposed a franchise fee of three percent upon the gross revenue
generated from sales of electricity by the Company within the corporate limits
of the City. The Company shall begin collecting the franchise fee upon receipt

Board. The amount of the franchise fee shall be shown separately on the utility
bill to each customer. The Company shall remit franchise fee receipts to the
City no more frequently than on or before the last business day of the month
following each calendar year quarter. The Company shall not, under any
circumstances, be required to return or refund any franchise fees that have
been collected from customers, and remitted to the City. In the event the
Company is required to provide data or information in defense of the City's
imposition of franchise fees or the Company is required to assist the City in
identifying customers or calculating any franchise fee refunds for groups of or
individual customers the City shall reimburse the Company for the expenses
incurred by the Company to provide such data or information.

thereunder shall continue for the period of 10 years from the effective date
hereof (the “Initial Term”), followed by an additional period of 10 years after
the expiration of the Initial Term (the “Renewal Term”), and an additional
period of five years after the expiration of the Renewal Term, unless the City
notifies the Company in writing at least 180 days before the expiration of the
Initial Term or Renewal Term that it desires not to renew the franchise. Said
term shall begin upon the written acceptance by the Company of the franchise.
The acceptance shall be filed with the Clerk within 90 days from passage of
this chapter.
111.11   USE OF PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
The rights granted to the Company under this chapter shall be exercised in
compliance with the provisions of City Code
Chapter 141, Use of Public Rights-of-Way, as those provisions existed as of the
date of enactment of this chapter. If any amendments to
Chapter 141 in conflict with the terms of this franchise chapter are enacted,
the terms of this franchise chapter will control until the expiration of the
current term of the franchise.
111.12   ENTIRE AGREEMENT.
This chapter sets forth and constitutes the entire agreement between the
Company and the City with respect to the rights contained herein, and may not
be supplemented, superseded, modified, or otherwise amended without the written
approval and acceptance of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall the City, during the term of the franchise, enact any ordinance or
place any limitations, either operationally or through the assessment of fees
other than those approved and accepted by the Company within this chapter, that
create additional burdens upon the Company, or which delay utility operations.

the City by the permit holder/property owner.
   4.   Bond Required. Before any permit for the excavation of any street,
alley, or any other public property is issued, the applicant therefor shall
file a cash bond in the amount of $750.00 with the City. Such bond shall be
conditioned that said applicant shall pay all damages and injuries resulting
from any work done under such permit. The amount of such bond, less any sum
deducted for damages, shall be refunded to said applicant not later than six
months after any work done under said permit is completed.
   5.   Insurance Required. Each applicant shall also file a certificate of
insurance indicating that the applicant is carrying public liability insurance
in effect for the duration of the permit covering the applicant and all agents

City’s Standard Specifications for Street Patch After Excavating contained in
the Appendix of this Code of Ordinances.
   7.   Inspection. All work shall be subject to inspection by the Water and
Sewer Superintendent. Backfill shall not be deemed completed, nor resurfacing

inspection of backfill is desired.
   8.   Completion by the City. Should any excavation in any street or alley be
discontinued or left open and unfinished for a period of 24 hours after the
approved completion date, or in the event the work is improperly done, the City
has the right to finish or correct the excavation work and charge any expenses
for such work to the permit holder/property owner. Failure to make payment will
constitute a lien on the premises and shall be certified by the Clerk to the
County Treasurer for collection in the same manner as property taxes.
   9.   Excavations During Winter Months. No person shall make or cause to be
made, and no permits shall be issued for, any excavation in any public street

property lines and inside the curb lines upon public streets and shall keep
such area in a safe condition, free from nuisances, obstructions, and hazards. 
In the absence of a curb, such property shall extend from the property line to
that portion of the public street used or improved for vehicular purposes. The
abutting property owner shall not be required to remove diseased trees or dead
wood on the publicly owned property or right-of-way. Maintenance includes, but

136.01   PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to enhance safe passage by citizens on
sidewalks, to place the responsibility for the maintenance, repair,
replacement, or reconstruction of sidewalks upon the abutting property owner
and to minimize the liability of the City.
136.02   DEFINITIONS.
For use in this chapter the following terms are defined:
   1.   “Defective sidewalk” means any public sidewalk exhibiting one or more
of the following characteristics:
      A.   The sidewalk is cracked with a vertical edge existing of more than
three fourths-inch high. (See Repair Code A in Appendix to this Code of
Ordinances for illustration.)
      B.   The sidewalk has raised more than two inches in an eight- to 10-foot
area from the normal line of grade of the sidewalk. (See Repair Code B in
Appendix to this Code of Ordinances for illustration.)
      C.   The sidewalk is depressed more than two inches in an eight- to 10-
foot area from the normal line of grade of the sidewalk. (See Repair Code C in
Appendix to this Code of Ordinances for illustration.)
      D.   The sidewalk has cracked into more than three pieces per each four-
by four-foot square and sections are distorted or distressed with a vertical
height difference of one-half inch or more or a horizontal separation of two
inches or more. (See Repair Code D in Appendix to this Code of Ordinances for
illustration.)
      E.   The sidewalk has cracked and part of the sidewalk is missing,
forming holes. (See Repair Code E in Appendix to this Code of Ordinances for
illustration.)
      F.   The sidewalk has settled or for some other reason is sloped and
tilted more than one inch per foot (toward either side). (See Repair Code F in

      G.   The sidewalk has spalled and the surface is gone. (See Repair Code G
in Appendix to this Code of Ordinances for illustration).
   2.   “Established grade” means that grade established by the City for the
particular area in which a sidewalk is to be constructed.
   3.   “One-course construction” means that the full thickness of the concrete
is placed at one time, using the same mixture throughout.
   4.   “Owner” means the person owning the fee title to property abutting any
sidewalk and includes any contract purchaser for purposes of notification

Except where sidewalk concrete is provided by a ready-mix company, the
following mix quantities per square foot shall apply: 7.5 lbs. cement, 16.5
lbs. sand, 20.5 lbs. gravel, and 0.5 gallons water (the equivalent to a six-bag
mix with 4,000 lbs. per square inch compression strength). Ready-mix concrete
shall be of equivalent minimum strength.
   6.   “Sidewalk” means all permanent public walks in business, residential or
suburban areas.

the surface of the sidewalk with a wooden trowel.
136.03   REMOVAL OF SNOW, ICE, AND ACCUMULATIONS.
The abutting property owner shall remove snow, ice, and accumulations promptly
from sidewalks. If a property owner does not remove snow, ice, or accumulations
within a reasonable time, the City may do so and assess the costs against the
property owner for collection in the same manner as a property tax. The
abutting property owner may be liable for damages caused by failure to remove
snow, ice, and accumulations promptly from the sidewalk.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[2b and e])
136.04   RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAINTENANCE.
It is the responsibility of the abutting property owners to repair, replace, or
reconstruct, or cause to be repaired, replaced, or reconstructed, all broken or
defective sidewalks and to maintain in a safe and hazard-free condition any
sidewalk outside the lot and property lines and inside the curb lines or
traveled portion of the public street. The owner of any lot or parcel who fails
to maintain the sidewalk in a safe condition, in a state of good repair, and
free from defects shall be liable to any person injured as a result of such
failure and shall, further, save, defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the City
from and against any claim arising out of the failure to maintain said
sidewalk.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[2c])
136.05   CITY MAY ORDER REPAIRS.
If the abutting property owner does not maintain sidewalks as required, the
Council may serve notice on such owner, by certified mail, requiring the owner
to repair, replace or reconstruct sidewalks within a reasonable time and if
such action is not completed within the time stated in the notice, the Council
may require the work to be done and assess the costs against the abutting

person shall obtain a written permit from the Street Superintendent. A written
application for the permit shall be filed with the Street Superintendent. The
application shall include the address and legal description of the property,
the name of the property owner, the name and address of the person who will do

include the depth, width, and type of surfacing material to be used. No other
plan shall be followed except by written permission of the Street
Superintendent, who may allow amendments to the application or permit that do
not conflict with this chapter. The Street Superintendent shall issue the
permit, bearing the Street Superintendent’s signature and the date of issuance,
without charge, if the proposed plan meets all of the requirements of this
chapter. Each permit shall expire 60 days after the date of issuance, but the
Superintendent may grant an extension of time for good cause.

the curb. Each section shall be not less than four inches thick and no more
than 36 square feet in area.
      C.   Driveway areas shall be not less than six inches in thickness.
      D.   If a new or replacement sidewalk has a different width than an
existing sidewalk to which it is to be connected, the last section of the new

(edge nearest the abutting private property) on the property line, unless the
Council establishes a different distance due to special circumstances.
   8.   Grade. Curb tops shall be on level with the centerline of the street
which shall be the established grade, unless the Council establishes a

applied uniformly over 100 percent of the sidewalk surface after pouring.
   14.   Protection After Pouring. Sidewalk cement shall be protected from
traffic for a minimum of 48 hours after pouring, and during such time, adequate
safety barriers shall be placed and maintained on all sides of the sidewalks.
136.09   BARRICADES AND WARNING LIGHTS.
Whenever any material of any kind is deposited on any street, avenue, highway,
passageway or alley when sidewalk improvements are being made or when any
sidewalk is in a dangerous condition, it shall be the duty of all persons
having an interest therein, either as the contractor or the owner, agent, or
lessee of the property in front of or along which such material may be
deposited, or such dangerous condition exists, to put in conspicuous places at
each end of such sidewalk and at each end of any pile of material deposited in
the street, a sufficient number of approved warning lights or flares, and to
keep them lighted during the entire night and to erect sufficient barricades
both at night and in the daytime to secure the same. The party or parties using
the street for any of the purposes specified in this chapter shall be liable
for all injuries or damage to persons or property arising from any wrongful act
or negligence of the party or parties, or their agents or employees or for any
misuse of the privileges conferred by this chapter or of any failure to comply
with provisions hereof.
136.10   FAILURE TO REPAIR OR BARRICADE.

chapter. The Street Superintendent shall issue the permit, bearing the Street
Superintendent’s signature and the date of issuance, without charge, if the
proposed plan meets all of the requirements of this chapter, and if the
construction or repair as planned will not create any substantial hazard in the
use of the street or sidewalk for public travel or drainage, or create any
defect. Each permit shall expire 60 days after the date of issuance, but the
Superintendent may grant an extension of time for good cause.,

curb. The saw cut shall be clean and even and shall be done in a good and
workmanlike manner. Excavations to do work under this chapter shall be dug so
as to occasion the least possible inconvenience to the public and to provide

the property owner. Such assessment shall be collected with the general
property taxes and in the same manner.

141.07 Work Permits                 
 
141.01   PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish uniform rules and controls for the
use of public rights-of-way by utility companies in order to ensure public
safety, protect public and private investment, and ensure the orderly and
efficient use of public property.
141.02   APPLICABILITY.
This chapter shall apply to all utility companies and their agents using or
proposing to use the streets and other public ways of the City and shall be in
addition to, and not in lieu of, any other provisions of this Code of
Ordinances. To the extent of any conflict between the terms and conditions of
this chapter and those of any other ordinance, the terms of this chapter shall
control. However, in the event of a conflict between this chapter and a
franchise ordinance, the terms and condition of the franchise ordinance shall
be controlling, unless otherwise contrary to state or federal law. Section
135.09 of this code shall govern excavations within a street or any other
public right-of-way which are not made by utility companies or their agents.
141.03   DEFINITIONS.
For purposes of this chapter the following terms are defined:
   1.   “Facility” or “facilities” means any tangible asset in a public right-
of-way used to provide utility service.
   2.   “Public right-of-way” means the surface and space above, on, and below
any public highway, avenue, street, lane, alley, boulevard, driveway, bridge,
parkway, waterway, or public easement within the City in which the City now or
hereafter holds any property interest which, consistent with the purposes for
which it was dedicated or otherwise acquired, may be used for the purpose of
constructing, operating, and maintaining a facility.
   3.   “Utility company” means any person or entity, including franchise
holders, using, or proposing to use any public right-of-way to make utility
services available to the public including, but not limited, to electricity,
natural gas, and communication services. “Utility company” shall not include
the City nor any entity providing solid waste collection services.
   4.   “Work permit” means a written authorization issued by the City to enter
upon a public right-of-way at specified times and places to erect, construct,
install, or replace facilities.
141.04   FRANCHISE OR LEASE REQUIRED.
No utility company shall use any public right-of-way without first obtaining a
franchise or lease from the City. The City shall not enter into or issue any
franchise or lease granting exclusive rights. A franchise confers the right to
use City rights-of-way generally for the placement of facilities and are issued
pursuant to Section 362.4 of the Code of Iowa. A lease, which is not required
of franchise holders, confers the right to place facilities at specific
locations. An application for a lease shall be filed with the City Clerk on a
form provided by the City and shall include, as a minimum, the following
information:
   1.   Name, address, and telephone number of the utility company.
   2.   Name, address, and telephone number of a person whom the City may
notify or contact at any time concerning the lease.
   3.   An engineering site plan showing the proposed location of the
facilities, including any manholes, and the size, type, and proposed depth of
any conduit or other enclosures.
141.05   REGISTRATION REQUIRED.
Each utility company placing or maintaining or proposing to place or maintain
any facility in a public right-of-way shall file a registration with the City
which shall include the following information:
   1.   Name of utility company.
   2.   Name, address, and telephone number of utility company’s primary
contact person in connection with its facilities.
   3.   Name, address, and telephone number of the utility company's agent to
contact in case of an emergency.
   4.   Evidence of insurance coverage required under this chapter.
   5.   Acknowledgement that the utility company has received and reviewed a
copy of this chapter.
   6.   A copy of the registrant’s certificate of authorization or license to
provide service issued by the Iowa Utilities Board, the Federal Communications
Commission, or other federal or state authority, if any.
The registration shall be filed with the Clerk by April 1 of each even-numbered
year. Within 30 days of any change in the information that must be submitted as
provided above, the utility company shall provide updated information to the
City. A work permit shall not be issued to any utility company that does not
have a current registration on file.
141.06   LOCATION AND MARKING.
Upon the request of any officer or agent of the City, every utility company
maintaining underground facilities within the City shall, in the manner and
within the time provided by Section 480.4 of the Code of Iowa (the One-Call
System), mark the location of its underground facilities in any designated part
of the public right-of-way.
141.07   WORK PERMITS.
   1.   Except for the repair of existing above ground facilities, and except
for emergencies as provided hereafter in this section, no person shall install,
erect, hang, lay, bury, draw, emplace, construct, or reconstruct any facility
upon, across, beneath, or over any public right-of-way in the City without
first obtaining a work permit therefore.
   2.   Applications for work permits shall be filed with the Clerk on a form
provided by the City at least 14 days before the proposed commencement of the
work. The application shall state the name and address of the applicant, the
name of the utility company (if different from the applicant), the name and
telephone number of the contact person with respect to the particular work
proposed, and a description of the work to be done, including particular
location within the public right-of-way and the estimated length of time
necessary to complete the work.
   3.   After referring the application to the Water and Sewer Superintendent
and/or the Street Superintendent, the Clerk shall issue the permit if the
proposed work is within the scope of the franchise or lease of the utility
company and a current registration is on file.
   4.   In cases of emergency involving public safety, a work permit need not
be secured before the work commences, but the Water and Sewer Superintendent or
the Street Superintendent or their designees shall be notified as soon as
reasonably possible.
   5.   No fees shall be charged in connection with the issuance of work
permits.
141.08   CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   1.   Construction, operation, maintenance, and repair of facilities shall be
in accordance with all applicable law and regulation, and with sound industry
practice. All safety practices required by law shall be used during
construction, maintenance, and repair of facilities.
   2.   No utility company or holder of any work permit for any facility shall
dig, trench, or otherwise excavate in the public rights-of-way without
complying with the provisions of the Iowa One-Call System, Section 480.3 of the
Code of Iowa et. Seq., or its successor.
   3.   A utility company shall at all times employ at least ordinary care and
shall install and maintain in use commonly accepted methods and devices
preventing failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage, injury, or
nuisance to the public.
   4.   In the event of a conflict among applicable codes and standards, the
most stringent code or standard shall apply (except insofar as those standards,
if followed, would result in a system that could not meet requirements of
federal, State, or local law, or is expressly preempted by other such
standards).
   5.   A utility company shall have the authority to trim trees that overhang
public rights-of-way of the City so as to prevent the branches of such trees
from coming in contact with the facilities of the utility company.
Notwithstanding that grant of authority, if the utility company performs the
work, it shall be fully liable for any damages caused thereby, and shall be
responsible for replacing damaged trees and shrubs. The utility company shall
be responsible for notifying abutting property owners prior to trimming trees
and shall obtain permission from the Street Superintendent of the City.
   6.   The City may adopt additional standards as required to ensure that work
continues to be performed in a safe, orderly, and workmanlike manner.
   7.   Any contractor or subcontractor used for work or construction,
installation, operation, maintenance, or repair of facilities in the public
rights-of-way must be properly licensed under laws of the State and all
applicable local ordinances. Each contractor or subcontractor shall have the
same obligations with respect to its work as the utility company would have if
the work was performed by the utility company. A utility company shall be
responsible for all activities carried out by its contractors, subcontractors,
and employees at the utility company's request.
   8.   The utility company shall notify the public prior to commencing any
construction that will significantly disturb or disrupt public property or have
the potential to present a danger or affect the safety of the public generally.
A notice shall be provided to those persons most likely to be affected by the
work in at least one of the following ways: by telephone, in person, by mail,
by distribution of flyers to residences, by publication in local newspapers, or
in any other manner reasonably calculated to provide adequate notice.
141.09   PLACEMENT OF FACILITIES.
   1.   All facilities shall be installed and located to minimize interference
with the rights and convenience of the public and of other property owners.
   2.   A utility company shall not place facilities where they will interfere
with any other utility or facilities, or obstruct or hinder in any manner the
various utility companies serving the residents of the City or their use of any
public rights-of-way.
   3.   The City may reasonably direct the specific placement of facilities to
ensure that users of the public rights-of-way do not interfere with each other
and that the public rights-of-way are used safely and efficiently.
   4.   Any above ground facility that has not been used or operated by the
utility company for a period of two years shall be promptly removed by the
utility company upon the written request of the City. Should the utility
company neglect, refuse, or fail to remove such facility, the City may remove
the facility at the expense of the utility company.
   5.   No utility company shall erect new aerial plant in or on a public
right-of-way in which one or more utility companies has placed its lines
underground.
   6.   The City may require that wires, cables, or other like facilities of
public utilities be installed underground in new subdivisions.
   7.   In the event any provision of this chapter is subject to or in conflict
with any present or future Iowa law, Iowa Utilities Board rules, regulations or
utility company tariffs, such provision shall be deemed void.
141.10   RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   1.   A utility company shall, at its own expense, upon written notice from
the City reasonably in advance, promptly relocate any facility located on or
within the public rights-of-way for any public project the City may deem
necessary or appropriate to facilitate the realignment, reconstruction,
improvement, or repair of public streets, sidewalks, curbs, drains, sewers, and
other public improvements, provided, however, a utility company may be
permitted to abandon any facilities in place with the written consent of the
City.
   2.   A utility company shall not be obligated to relocate its facilities
located in a public right-of-way, at its own expense, unless the City provides
the utility company with a reasonable alternative location for its facilities.
   3.   The City shall give written notice of the vacation of any public right-
of-way to all utility companies having facilities located within said right-of-
way. The vacation of a public right-of-way shall not deprive a utility company
of its right to operate and maintain existing facilities in such right-of-way
unless the reasonable cost of relocating the same is first paid to the utility
company.
141.11   RESTORATION.
If a utility company disturbs a pavement, sidewalk, driveway, or other
surfacing, or landscaping, in any public right-of-way, the utility company
shall, in a manner approved by the City, replace and restore all pavement,
sidewalk, driveway, or other surfacing, or landscaping disturbed, in
substantially the same condition and in a good, workmanlike, timely manner, in
accordance with the City’s Standard Specifications for Street Patch After
Excavating contained in the Appendix of this Code of Ordinances. Such
restoration shall be undertaken within no more than 30 days after the damage is
incurred, and shall be completed as soon as reasonably possible thereafter. The
utility company shall guarantee and maintain such restoration for at least one
year against defective materials or workmanship.
141.12   INSURANCE REQUIREMENT.
Except as provided in this section, every utility company maintaining
facilities in the public rights-of-way of the City shall keep and maintain at
its own cost and expense, a policy of commercial general liability insurance
issued by a financially responsible insurance company licensed to do business
in the State with minimum policy limits of not less than two million dollars
for each claim and two million dollars general aggregate. The utility company
shall provide for not less than 30 days’ written notice to the City before the
policy may be cancelled. The City shall be named as an “additional insured” for
the negligent acts of the utility company arising out of its use of the public
right-of-way. A certificate of insurance or self-insurance evidencing
compliance with the requirements of this section shall be delivered to the
Clerk. A public utility may satisfy the insurance requirement under this
section by self-insurance provided that it maintains the same long-term rating
and the same minimum net assets as required by the Iowa Utilities Board for
railroad crossings as set forth in 191 IAC 42.9(5), including any amendments
thereto. A self-insured utility shall provide proof of satisfaction of said
requirements and shall inform the City if it no longer qualifies for self-
insurance under the state rule.
141.13   INDEMNIFICATION.
A utility company maintaining any facilities in the public rights-of-way shall,
at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the City,
its officials, boards, commissions, commissioners, agents, and employees,
against any and all claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings, and judgments
for damages or equitable relief arising out of the company’s negligent (1)
construction, maintenanc,e or operation of its facilities in the public rights-
of-way, (2) conduct of its business in the City, or (3) activities in the
City’s public rights-of-way, regardless of whether the act or omission
complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited by this chapter; provided
however, that a utility company need not indemnify or save the City harmless
from claims, demands, losses, and expenses arising out of the negligence of the
City, its employees, or agents. The indemnity provided hereunder includes, but
is not limited to, the City’s reasonable attorney’s fees and other expenses
incurred in defending against any such claim, suit, or proceeding.

145.02   GENERAL DEFINITION OF UNSAFE.
All buildings or structures that are structurally unsafe or not provided with
adequate egress, or that constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise dangerous
to human life, or that in relation to existing use constitute a hazard to
safety or health, or public welfare, by reason of inadequate maintenance,
dilapidation, obsolescence, or abandonment, are, for the purpose of this
chapter, unsafe buildings. All such unsafe buildings are hereby declared to be
public nuisances and shall be abated by repair, rehabilitation, demolition, or
removal in accordance with the procedure specified in this chapter.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 657A.1 and 364.12[3a])
145.03   UNSAFE BUILDING.
“Unsafe building” means any structure or mobile home meeting any or all of the
following criteria:
   1.   Various Inadequacies. Whenever the building or structure, or any
portion thereof, because of:

   2.   Manifestly Unsafe. Whenever, for any reason, the building or structure,
or any portion thereof, is manifestly unsafe for the purpose for which it is
being used.
   3.   Inadequate Maintenance. Whenever a building or structure, used or
intended to be used for dwelling purposes, because of dilapidation, decay,
damage, faulty construction, or otherwise, is determined by any health officer
to be unsanitary, unfit for human habitation or in such condition that it is
likely to cause sickness or disease.
   4.   Fire Hazard. Whenever any building or structure, because of dilapidated
condition, deterioration, damage, or other cause, is determined by the Fire
Marshal or Fire Chief to be a fire hazard.
   5.   Abandoned. Whenever any portion of a building or structure remains on a
site after the demolition or destruction of the building or structure or
whenever any building or structure is abandoned for a period in excess of six
months so as to constitute such building or portion thereof an attractive
nuisance or hazard to the public.
145.04   NOTICE TO OWNER.
The enforcement officer shall examine or cause to be examined every building or
structure or portion thereof reported as dangerous or damaged and, if such is
found to be an unsafe building as defined in this chapter, the enforcement
officer shall give to the owner of such building or structure written notice
stating the defects thereof. This notice may require the owner or person in
charge of the building or premises, within 48 hours or such reasonable time as
the circumstances require, to commence either the required repairs or
improvements or demolition and removal of the building or structure or portions
thereof, and all such work shall be completed within 90 days from date of
notice, unless otherwise stipulated by the enforcement officer. If necessary,
such notice shall also require the building, structure, or portion thereof to
be vacated forthwith and not reoccupied until the required repairs and
improvements are completed, inspected, and approved by the enforcement officer.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[3h])
   1.   Notice Served. Such notice shall be served by sending by certified mail
to the owner of record, according to Section 364.12[3h] of the Code of Iowa, if

charge is required to comply with the order of the enforcement officer shall
begin as of the date the owner receives such notice.
   2.   Hearing. Such notice shall also advise the owner that he or she may
request a hearing before the Council on the notice by filing a written request
for hearing within the time provided in the notice.
145.05   CONDUCT OF HEARING.

Notes
  †  EDITOR’S NOTE: Suggested forms of notice and of a resolution and order of the
  Council for the administration of this chapter are provided in the APPENDIX to
8 this Code of Ordinances. Caution is urged in the use of this procedure. We
  recommend you review the situation with your attorney before initiating
  procedures and follow his or her recommendation carefully.
145.06   POSTING OF SIGNS.
The enforcement officer shall cause to be posted at each entrance to such
building a notice to read:
“DO NOT ENTER.
UNSAFE TO OCCUPY.
CITY OF WAUKON, IOWA.”
Such notice shall remain posted until the required demolition, removal or
repairs are completed. Such notice shall not be removed without written
permission of the enforcement officer and no person shall enter the building
except for the purpose of making the required repairs or of demolishing the
building.
145.07   RIGHT TO DEMOLISH; MUNICIPAL INFRACTION.
In case the owner fails, neglects, or refuses to comply with the notice to
repair, rehabilitate, or to demolish and remove the building or structure or
portion thereof, the Council may order the owner of the building prosecuted as
a violator of the provisions of this chapter and may order the enforcement
officer to proceed with the work specified in such notice. A statement of the
cost of such work shall be transmitted to the Council. As an alternative to
this action, the City may utilize the municipal infraction process to abate the
nuisance.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[3h])
145.08   COSTS.
Costs incurred under Section 145.07 shall be paid out of the City treasury.
Such costs shall be charged to the owner of the premises involved and levied as
a special assessment against the land on which the building or structure is
located, and shall be certified to the County Treasurer for collection in the
manner provided for other taxes. In addition, the City may take any other
action deemed appropriate to recover costs incurred.

property as part of a retailer’s or a manufacturer’s stock not used as a place
for human habitation.
   2.   Existing Homes. A taxable mobile home or manufactured home that is
located outside of a manufactured home community or mobile home park as of
January 1, 1995, shall be assessed and taxed as real estate, but is exempt from
the permanent foundation requirement of this chapter until the home is
relocated.
146.03   FOUNDATION REQUIREMENTS.

150.01   PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish a uniform system for the naming of
streets and the numbering for addressing purposes of all properties within the
City.
150.02   DEFINITIONS.
For use in this chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the
context clearly requires otherwise:
   1.   “Addressing system zone” means the territory or geographical area,
including areas outside the corporate limits of the City, to which this chapter
applies or is intended to apply, as indicated on the map contained on page 22
of the Appendix of this Code of Ordinances.
   2.   “Building” means principal building.
   3.   “Business” or “business enterprise” means any nonresidential human
activity conducted in all or part of a building which does not constitute a
dwelling unit (as defined in the Zoning Code).
   4.   “Main entrance” means a door or doorway on the outside of a building
which serves as the primary or most direct access to one or more occupancies
located within the building; provided, however, in the case of a building
having more than one external door through which the same occupancy can be
accessed, if only one door opens to or faces a street or avenue, such door
shall be deemed the “main entrance” for all occupancies which may be accessed
through that door.
   5.   “Occupancy” means a dwelling unit (as defined in the Zoning Code) or
business enterprise occupying an entire building or an apartment, suite, group
of adjacent rooms, or a single room within a building. All areas occupied by a
business under common control or ownership within the same building shall be
deemed part of a single-business occupancy.
   6.   “Principal building” means any enclosed structure which is regularly
occupied by or is designed or intended to be regularly occupied by one or more
persons for residential or business purposes and is not an “accessory building”
as defined in the Zoning Code.
   7.   “Zoning lot” means a single tract of land, under common ownership and/
or legal control, used as a unit or designated in a zoning permit application
to be used, developed, or built upon as a unit. A zoning lot may be composed of
all or part of one or more platted lots or parcels described by metes and
bounds.
150.03   OFFICIAL ADDRESSING MAPS.
There are hereby adopted as the official street-naming and property-numbering
maps of the City two maps, entitled Waukon Addressing Map: North-South Streets,
and Waukon Addressing Map: East-West Avenues, respectively, which maps,
including all designations and information set forth therein, are hereby made a
part of this chapter as if the same were fully set forth herein. Said maps
shall be referred to jointly as the “Official Addressing Maps” of the City, and
they shall be on file in the office of the Clerk. Said maps may be amended or
altered only by ordinance. Said maps are intended to reflect the provisions of
this chapter, but in the event of any conflict between the addressing standards
set forth in this chapter and the designations and information set forth in the
Official Addressing Maps the Official Addressing Maps, shall control.
150.04   ADDRESSING STANDARDS.
The general standards for the naming of streets and numbering of properties
within the City are as follows:
   1.   Base Line Streets. East Main - West Main shall constitute the east-west
base line which divides the City into northern and southern parts for
addressing purposes, and Highway 9 North - Allamakee Street - Spring Avenue -
Rossville Road - Highways 9 and 76 South shall constitute the north-south base
line which divides the City into eastern and western parts.
   2.   Street and Avenue Designation. Each City street running generally in a
northerly-southerly direction shall be designated as a “Street” and each City
street running generally in a easterly-westerly direction shall be designated
as an “Avenue,” except as otherwise provided in the Official Addressing Maps.
   3.   Quadrant Designation. The name of each street or avenue, except base
line streets and avenues, shall include the “NE,” “SE,” “SW,” or “NW” suffix
corresponding to the quadrant of the City in which such street or avenue, or
portion thereof, is located with reference to the base lines established in
this chapter. As an example, the name of a portion of any street or avenue
located north of the east-west base line and east of the north-south base line
shall include the “NE” quadrant suffix.
   4.   Street Names. Except as otherwise provided in the Official Addressing
Maps or this subsection, the names of all streets and avenues shall be ordinal
numbers, commencing with the first street or avenue, in both directions,
parallel to each base line, which shall be “First Street” or “First Avenue”
(plus the appropriate quadrant suffix), with each successive street or avenue
to bear the name of the next consecutive ordinal number extending outward to
the boundaries of the City’s addressing system zone. However, in the case of
new streets and avenues and in the case of existing streets and avenues in
areas which are not fully developed, the next consecutive ordinal number shall
not necessarily be used; and instead, such streets and avenues shall be
assigned ordinal number names corresponding to the nearest block designation
grid lines set forth on the Official Addressing Maps. In addition to those
street names designated in the Official Addressing Maps which do not conform to
the general standards for street names as set forth in this subsection, the
following nonconforming street names are hereby established:
      A.   The public street extending to the west from Second Street NW, lying
between Block 2 and Block 3 of Northgate Addition to the City, which is
sometimes referred to as Ninth Avenue NW, is hereby renamed as Northgate
Avenue.
   5.   Addressing Blocks. Subject to the exceptions set forth on the Official
Addressing Maps, the standard addressing block shall be approximately 440 feet
in length along the frontage of each street and avenue.
   6.   Property Numbering System. For addressing purposes, one whole number
shall be assigned for every 20 feet of property frontage along every street and
avenue within the City’s addressing system zone. The assignment of numbers
shall begin at the east-west base line for streets and at the north-south base
line for avenues and shall be progressive and consecutive in both directions
from each base line. Odd numbers shall be assigned to the east sides of street,
including base line streets, north of the east-west base line; on the west
sides of streets, including base line streets, south of the east-west base
line; on the south sides of avenues, including base line avenues, east of the
north-south base line; and on the north sides of avenues, including base line
avenues, west of the north-south base line. Even numbers shall be assigned to
all other sides of streets and avenues. Numbers from one to 99 shall be
assigned to properties along the first block of each street and avenue and each
successive block shall commence with consecutive hundreds and one. Property
numbering along streets and avenues which are new or are located in areas not
fully developed shall be assigned according to the block designation grid lines
set forth on the Official Addressing Maps. Property numbers shall be assigned
as if each street and avenue extended to the base line, regardless of whether
such extensions exist.
150.05   BUILDING AND OCCUPANCY NUMBERING STANDARDS.
This section is intended to establish a uniform system for assigning address
numbers to buildings and to separate occupancies within buildings, based upon
the principle that the ideal numbering system is one which best facilitates the
location of buildings and of entrances to separate occupancies within a single
building. It is anticipated that separate occupancies within the same building
will, in a few situations, have different address numbers and different street
addresses. The general standards are as follows:
   1.   Single Occupancy Buildings. All buildings which contain a single
occupancy shall be assigned an address number corresponding to one of the
addressing numbers applicable to the zoning lot on which the building is
located, as provided in Section 150.04(6) of this chapter. The specific address
number for such building shall be the number corresponding to the 20-foot
interval in which the main entrance to the building is located. In the case of
single occupancy buildings located on zoning lots with frontage on more than
one street or avenue, the address number assigned shall be determined by
reference to the street or avenue upon which the main entrance is located or
from which the main entrance is most directly accessed. The complete address
for a single occupancy building shall consist of the address number and the
name of the street or avenue upon which the address number is based.
   2.   Multiple Occupancy Buildings.
      A.   Single Main Entrance. If a building contains more than one
occupancy, all of which are served by the same main entrance from the street or
avenue, the address of all the occupancies shall include the same address
number and street or avenue name determined as provided in the case of single
occupancy buildings under Subsection 1 of this section. If the occupancies
include a business enterprise which is the only business located on the ground
floor of the building, that business’ complete address shall consist solely of
the address number and the street or avenue name. In all other cases, the
address of each occupancy shall also include a three-digit apartment or suite
number determined in accordance with Subsection 4 of this section.
      B.   Multiple Main Entrances from the Same Street or Avenue. If a
building contains more than one occupancy and there is more than one main
entrance serving separate occupancies, each main entrance serving any business
shall be assigned a separate address number determined as provided in the case
of single occupancy buildings under Subsection 1 of this section, and the
complete addresses for all business and dwelling units served by that main
entrance shall otherwise be determined in the same manner as provided in
Paragraph A of this subsection. However, main entrances on the same street or
avenue in the same building which serve only dwelling units shall be assigned
the same address number as the business main entrance on such street or avenue,
or if there are no business main entrances on that same street or avenue, the
same address number as all other dwelling unit main entrances. In cases where
more than one dwelling unit main entrance is required to share the same address
number, the address number shall be determined with reference to the main
entrance closest to the relevant base line. All dwelling units whose main
entrances share the same address number as some other main entrance in the same
building shall be assigned different three-digit apartment numbers, pursuant to
subsection 4 of this section, the same as if they shared the same main
entrance.
      C.   Multiple Main Entrances from Different Streets or Avenues. If a
building has frontages on more than one street or avenue and the main entrances
to separate occupancies within the building are located on or are most directly
accessed from different streets or avenues, the address for each occupancy,
including street name, address number and three-digit apartment or suite
number, if applicable, shall be determined with reference to the street or
avenue on which its main entrance is located or from which its main entrance is
more directly accessed, in accordance with the standards set forth in
Paragraphs A and B of this subsection and without regard for occupancies whose
main entrances are located on or accessed from another street or avenue.
      D.   Condominiums. Separately owned condominium units which do not share
a main entrance with any other condominium units in the same structure shall
each be assigned a separate address number. The address numbers assigned shall
be selected from the addressing numbers applicable to the zoning lot on which
the condominium structure is located. Condominium units which share the same
main entrance shall be assigned the same address number plus separate three-
digit unit numbers. The address number shall be one of the addressing numbers
applicable to the zoning lot as provided in Section 150.04(6) of this chapter,
and the three-digit unit number shall be determined in accordance with
Subsection 4 of this section. In the case of zoning lots having frontage on
more than one street or avenue, the applicable street name and addressing
number for each condominium unit shall be determined with reference to the
street or avenue on which the unit’s main entrance is located or from which its
main entrance is most directly accessed.
   3.   Zoning Lots Containing More Than One Principal Building. If a single
zoning lot contains more than one principal building, each building shall be
assigned a separate address number which shall be one of the addressing numbers
applicable to the zoning lot on which the buildings are located, as provided in
Section 150.04(6) of this chapter. Separate occupancies within each building
shall be assigned a three-digit apartment or suite number determined in
accordance with Subsection 4 of this section. However, Subsection 4 of this
section does not apply to residential buildings completed and occupied prior to
January 1, 1995, which are otherwise subject to this subsection, and the
separate occupancies within them may retain the occupancy address numbers in
use as of such date unless the property owner elects the use of these
standards.
   4.   Three-digit Numbering System for Occupancies in Multiple Occupancy
Buildings. Whenever the standards set forth in Subsections 1, 2, or 3 of this
section require the assignment of a three-digit number to a separate occupancy
within a building, such occupancy shall be assigned a number consistent with
the following system:
 
Location of Occupancy       Applicable Range of Three-Digit Numbers
Basement                    001 to 099
Ground Level or First Floor 101 to 199
Second Floor                201 to 299
Third Floor                 301 to 399
Fourth Floor                401 to 499
Fifth Floor                 501 to 599
 
The three-digit number shall be preceded by the term “Apartment” or “Apt.” in
the case of a dwelling unit, by the term “Suite” in the case of a business
occupancy, and by the term “Unit” in the case of a condominium. No two
occupancies having the same address number shall have the same three-digit
number.
   5.   Mobile Home Parks. Except as provided in this subsection, each mobile
home park (as defined in the Zoning Code) shall be assigned a single address
number which shall be one of the addressing numbers applicable to the zoning
lot on which the park is located, as provided by Section
150.04(6) of this chapter, and each mobile home lot within the park shall be
assigned a three-digit lot number. The lot numbers shall begin with 001, shall
be consecutive, and shall be noted on the map required to be filed with the
Clerk under Section
165.20(4)(J) of the Zoning Code. The complete address of each mobile home shall
consist of the lot number and the address number of the park. However, in the
case of parks having internal streets with posted street names as of January 1,
1995, the address of each mobile home shall consist of the mobile home park
street name and lot number as determined by the park owner.
   6.   Prohibited Address Designations. No fractional numbers shall be used as
part of any building, main entrance, or occupancy address number, nor shall any
letters (such as “Apt. A”) be used unless such letters are part of a pre-
existing address designation which is exempted from the provisions of this
chapter.
150.06   UNDEVELOPED LAND AND FUTURE BUILDINGS.
It is not necessary to post any addressing number on any vacant lots or
parcels. In the event of future development, the owner of the zoning lot on
which a building is to be erected shall be informed of the addressing number or
numbers applicable to all principal buildings, main entrances, and anticipated
occupancies, including three-digit apartment, suite, or unit numbers, by the
addressing officer at the time of issuance of the zoning permit.
150.07   EXCEPTIONS FOR EXISTING BUILDINGS.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter and the Official Addressing
Maps, it is not necessary for any property owner to alter the posted or
utilized addressing number applicable to any building, main entrance, or
occupancy as of the effective date of this chapter if all of the following
conditions exist:
   1.   The street name used in such address corresponds to the street name
established pursuant to this chapter and the Official Addressing Maps; and
   2.   The posted or utilized addressing number is within the range of numbers
permitted for the block in question as provided in this chapter and in the
Official Addressing Maps and does not duplicate any other posted or utilized
addressing number; and
   3.   The posted or utilized addressing number is proper under the odd-even
numbering system established by this chapter; and
   4.   The posted or utilized addressing number is in the correct sequential
order as compared to the addressing numbers for other buildings, main
entrances, or occupancies located in the same block; and
   5.   There are available unused addressing numbers in the proper sequential
order for use in connection with any vacant lots in the event of future
development.
However, except as provided in Section
150.05(3), there shall be no exemptions from the three-digit apartment or suite
numbering system applicable to multiple occupancy buildings as set forth in
Section
150.05.
150.08   SPECIFIC STREET NAME CHANGES.
Without limitation upon any other street name changes which may be necessitated
pursuant to the street naming provisions of Section 150.04 of this chapter,
certain streets within the City are hereby re-named, as follows:
   1.   Fifth Street SE shall hereafter be known and referred to as Fourth
Street SE.
   2.   Sixth Street SE, located in the first Hidden Creek Estates Addition to
the City, shall hereafter be known and referred to as Fifth Street SE.
   3.   Seventh Street SE, located in the second Hidden Creek Estates Addition
to the City, shall hereafter be known and referred to as Sixth Street SE.
150.09   EXTRATERRITORIAL APPLICABILITY.
This chapter shall apply throughout the corporate limits of the City and shall
also apply outside of the corporate limits of the City throughout the
addressing system zone. Enforcement of the provisions of this chapter beyond
the corporate limits of the City shall be pursued with the cooperation of the
Allamakee County Board of Supervisors pursuant to Section 1-16 of the Rural
Addressing Ordinance of the County, as illustrated on the map shown on page 22
of the Appendix to this Code of Ordinances.
150.10   ADDRESS NUMBER POSTING REQUIREMENTS.
It is the duty of the owner of any zoning lot to post and maintain, at his or
her sole expense, all addressing numbers assigned under the provisions of this
chapter to any present or future buildings, main entrances, and occupancies
located or to be located on the zoning lot in accordance with the following
requirements:
   1.   Existing Buildings. In the case of existing buildings, main entrances,
and occupancies, all required addressing numbers, including three-digit
apartment, suite, and unit numbers, shall be posted within 60 days of the
receipt by the owner from the addressing officer of written notice of the
addressing number information applicable to such property, if such numbers have
not already been posted, and within that same time period any existing
addressing information inconsistent with the numbers assigned pursuant to this
chapter shall be removed or permanently concealed.
   2.   New Construction. In the case of new construction, the applicable
addressing numbers, including three-digit apartment, suite, and unit numbers,
shall be posted prior to any occupation of the new building or within 60 days
of completion of construction, whichever first occurs.
   3.   Front Facing Main Entrances. The addressing number applicable to any
main entrance to a building which is located on a side of the building facing a
street or avenue shall be posted on or in the immediate vicinity of the main
entrance.
   4.   Side or Rear Main Entrances. In the case of a main entrance located on
a side of a building other than the side facing the street or avenue upon which
the address number is based, the address number shall be posted on the front
side of the building at the corner of the building around or by which the main
entrance is most directly accessed from the street or avenue.
   5.   Distant or Obscured Buildings. In the case of buildings located more
than 150 feet from the street or avenue, or buildings the view of which from
the street or avenue is obscured by vegetation or other structures, in addition
to posting on the building as above provided, the address numbers shall also be
posted at the front edge of the zoning lot in the immediate vicinity of the
driveway by which the main entrance is accessed. This requirement shall apply
in all cases where a single zoning lot contains more than one principal
building and one of the principal buildings is located between the street or
avenue and any other principal building.
   6.   Condominiums. In the case of separately owned condominium units which
do not share a main entrance with any other condominium units, the address
numbers for units whose main entrances face the street or avenue shall be
posted according to the same rules applicable to main entrances in other
buildings. The address numbers for condominium units whose main entrances do
not face the street or avenue upon which the address number is based shall be
posted both on or in the immediate vicinity of the main entrance of the
condominium unit and at the front edge of the zoning lot in the immediate
vicinity of the driveway by which the main entrance for the condominium unit is
accessed.
   7.   External Posting of Three-digit Number. In addition to the addressing
number applicable to a main entrance, there shall also be posted on the outside
of a building and in the immediate vicinity of the address number applicable to
the main entrance, the three-digit numbers applicable to all apartments,
suites, and units served by the main entrance. In the case of main entrances
serving numerous apartments, suites, or units, this requirement may be
satisfied by posting, for each floor, the range of apartment, suite, or unit
numbers (example, Apts. 101-105 and 201-204).
   8.   Number Visibility Requirements. All addressing numbers required to be
posted on buildings shall be conspicuously displayed and of such size and color
as to be identifiable in daylight at a distance of 150 feet. All three-digit
apartment, suite, and unit numbers required to be posted shall be identifiable
in daylight at a distance of 25 feet. All addressing numbers required to be
posted at the entrance to driveways, as provided in Subsections 5 and 6 of this
section, shall be displayed in such manner as to be readily identifiable from
the street or avenue.
   9.   Internal Three-digit Numbers. In the case of buildings having any main
entrance which serves more than a single occupancy, the three-digit apartment,
suite, or unit number applicable to each occupancy shall, in addition to the
external posting requirement, be posted on or immediately adjacent to the
internal entrance door for such occupancy. This number shall be conspicuously
displayed.
   10.   Mobile Homes. The address number of a mobile home park shall be
conspicuously posted in the immediate vicinity of each driveway or entrance to
the mobile home park from the street or avenue. The mobile home lot number
shall be posted on the side of the mobile home from which the number may be
most readily observed from the public street or avenue or from the internal
mobile home park street from which the mobile home is most readily accessed.
150.11   ADDRESSING OFFICER.
The zoning officer of the City shall also serve as the address officer of the
City. The duties of the addressing officer include the following:
   1.   Correcting and Updating Official Addressing Maps. Make any necessary

forth correct and current names for all existing and future streets, and block
designation grid lines, subject to Council approval by ordinance.
   2.   Assignment of Addressing Numbers. To assign, upon investigation,
addressing numbers, including three-digit apartment, suite, and unit numbers,
to new and remodeled buildings, and to furnish such information to the
applicant when zoning permits are issued; and to otherwise furnish proper
addressing numbers to building owners upon request.
   3.   Investigation and Notification. To review addresses currently used for
occupancies in existing buildings and address number posting practices and,
upon determination of non-compliance with the requirements of this chapter, to
send written notice to building owners informing them of the correct addressing
numbers, including three-digit apartment, suite, and unit numbers, and of the
number posting requirements, and requesting compliance. Such investigation and
notification may be made in conjunction with the Allamakee County E911 Board.
   4.   Interpretation. To exercise reasonable discretion in the interpretation
and application of the standards and requirements of this chapter.
   5.   Enforcement. To notify the Mayor and the City Attorney of any non-
compliance, following notice, with the requirements of this chapter by any
property owner and to assist as may be necessary in any enforcement
proceedings.

151.01   PLANTING RESTRICTIONS.
No person shall plant or cause to be planted any tree or other vegetation,
other than common varieties of grass or flowers, on any real property owned by
the City, including the parking or boulevard areas between streets and
sidewalks or abutting private properties, except in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter. The provisions of this section shall not apply in
the following cases:
   1.   To City employees or agents acting under the direction of City
officials responsible for the supervision of City property;
   2.   To trees or other vegetation planted or growing on City property on the
effective date of this section.
151.02   TREE PLANTING SPECIFICATIONS.
Trees may be planted on City-owned parking or boulevard areas along public
streets by City employees or agents, but only in accordance with all of the
following requirements and restrictions:
   1.   Spacing.
      A.   All trees planted in any street shall be planted midway between the
outer line of the sidewalk and the curb. In the event a curb line has not been
established, trees shall be planted midway between the sidewalk and the
traveled portion of the street. In the event a sidewalk has not been
established, trees shall be planted midway between the property line and the
curb or, if none, the traveled portion of the street. However, in no case shall
a tree be planted closer than 20 feet from the centerline of the street
pavement; nor shall any tree be planted in a boulevard strip which is narrower
than five feet between the edge of the sidewalk and the edge of the curb (or
traveled portion of the street if no curb), or, if there is no sidewalk, which
is narrower than nine feet between the property line and the edge of the curb
(or traveled portion of the street if no curb).
      B.   Trees planted on such public parking or boulevard areas shall have a
minimum spacing of 40 feet between trees.
   2.   Distance From Street Corners and Fire Hydrants. No street tree shall be
planted closer than 35 feet from any street corner, measured from intersecting
street right-of-way lines. No street tree shall be planted closer than 20 feet
from any fire hydrant.
   3.   Utilities. No trees may be planted under or within 10 lateral feet of
any overhead utility wire except those species identified in Subsections L
through U of Subsection 7 of this section.
   4.   Quality of Trees Planted. All standard sized trees shall have
comparatively straight trunks, well-developed leaders, and top and root
characteristics of the species or variety showing evidence of proper nursery
pruning. All trees must be free of insect, disease, mechanical injuries, and
other objectionable features at the time of planting. To compensate for any
serious loss of roots, the top of the tree should be reduced by thinning or
cutting back as determined by the growth characteristics of the tree species.
The leader(s) shall not be cut off in such trimming.
   5.   Planting of Trees.
      A.   Newly planted bare root trees shall be guyed or supported in an
upright position. The guys or supports shall be fastened in such a way that
they will not girdle or cause serious injury to the trees or endanger public
safety. Each tree shall have at least two guys or supports.
      B.   Trees not purchased from a commercial nursery shall have an adequate
root system and branches shall be pruned back from one-fourth to one-third from
its pre-planted size.
   6.   Trimming.
      A.   Trees that may interfere with ungrounded electric supply conductors
shall be trimmed or removed.
      B.   The topping of trees on public property, as a method of pruning, is
prohibited unless approved by the Street Superintendent with respect to
specific trees where, because of severe damage by storms or other causes or
location under utility wires or other obstructions, other pruning practices are
impractical. Selective branch thinning, proper early training, or entire tree
removal should be favored over the practice of topping.
   7.   Permitted Tree Species. Only those tree species listed in this
subsection may be planted on City property along public streets. Varieties of
these species are permissible provided they are thornless or fruitless
varieties.
      A.   Beech (American and European)

All the trees planted on City-owned real estate become the property of the City
and the planting of a tree shall not create any property rights in any person
or entity other than the City. Any trees planted on City property in violation
of law or these rules shall be subject to removal by the City.
151.03   DUTY TO TRIM TREES.
The owner or agent of the abutting property shall keep the trees on, or
overhanging the street, trimmed so that all branches will be at least 15 feet
above the surface of the street and eight feet above the sidewalks. If the
abutting property owner fails to trim the trees, the City may serve notice on
the abutting property owner requiring that such action be taken within five
days. If such action is not taken within that time, the City may perform the
required action and assess the costs against the abutting property for
collection in the same manner as a property tax.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[2c, d, and e])
151.04   TRIMMING TREES TO BE SUPERVISED.
Except as allowed in Section
151.03, it is unlawful for any person to trim or cut any tree in a street or
public place unless the work is done under the supervision of the City.
151.05   DISEASE CONTROL.
Any dead, diseased, or damaged tree or shrub which may harbor serious insect or
disease pests or disease injurious to other trees is hereby declared to be a
nuisance.
151.06   INSPECTION AND REMOVAL.
The Council shall inspect or cause to be inspected any trees or shrubs in the
City reported or suspected to be infected with or damaged by any disease or
insect or disease pests, and such trees and shrubs shall be subject to removal
as follows:
   1.   Removal from City Property. If it is determined that any such condition
exists on any public property, including the strip between the curb and the lot
line of private property, and that danger to other trees within the City is
imminent, the Council shall immediately cause such condition to be corrected by
treatment or removal so as to destroy or prevent as fully as possible the
spread of the disease or the insect or disease pests. The Council may also
order the removal of any trees on the streets of the City which interfere with
the making of improvements or with travel thereon.
   2.   Removal from Private Property. If it is determined with reasonable
certainty that any such condition exists on private property and that the
danger to other trees within the City is imminent, the Council shall
immediately notify by certified mail the owner, occupant, or person in charge
of such property to correct such condition by treatment or removal within 14
days of said notification. If such owner, occupant, or person in charge of said
property fails to comply within 14 days of receipt of notice, the Council may
cause the nuisance to be removed and the cost assessed against the property.

155.01   TITLE.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited and referred to as the “Sign
Ordinance” of the City of Waukon, Iowa.
155.02   PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish the authority of the City with
regard to the type of construction of signs located within the City and for
sign regulations that are intended to facilitate an easy and agreeable
communication between people. The regulations recognize the need to protect the
safety and welfare of the public, the need for well-maintained and attractive
signs in the community, and the need for adequate public and business
identification, advertising, and communication. These regulations do not
attempt to regulate design or copy content of any permitted sign. However, a
great percentage of that which is unattractive can be eliminated by sensible
quality control, through adequate maintenance and inspection, and by reasonable
guidelines formulated to minimize clutter.

Temporary signs, including all portable signs, do not qualify for permanent
sign permits under Section
155.13 and it is unlawful to erect, place, locate, or maintain a temporary sign
unless a temporary sign permit has been issued for such sign, in accordance
with this section, for each location where such sign is erected, placed, or
located. Application for temporary sign permits shall be made on the same form
and in the same manner as provided in Section
155.13, except that the application and permit shall also specify the number of
days for which the permit shall be valid and the permit fee shall be $5.00.

terms of this chapter, may appeal to the Zoning Board of Adjustment following
the same procedures for appeals and variances as set forth in
Chapter 165 of this Code of Ordinances, including the fee provisions. In acting
on any such appeal or variance request, the Board shall be subject to the same
procedural requirements and limitations provided for such matters under the
Zoning Code, except that, in the case of variances, unnecessary hardship shall
not be found to have been established by the applicant unless a commercial need
for a sign is shown and no sign of any type would be permitted without a
variance on the premises in question under the applicable provisions of this
chapter. In no event may unnecessary hardship be established with respect to an
off-premises sign or sign structure nor shall any sign or sign structure be
authorized which would constitute a traffic hazard or which, without Council
approval, would be erected or located in whole or in part on any public
property.

location being advertised. Obsolete signs shall be removed no later than 60
days after they become obsolete.
   2.   Portable Signs. As defined in Section
155.03, except as may otherwise be permitted in this chapter pursuant to a

hereto which was lawful under all laws, including zoning laws, in effect
immediately prior to the effective date, but which would not be allowed under
the terms of this chapter or any amendment, such sign may continue to be used
and maintained so long as it remains otherwise lawful and no sign permit shall
be required for it.
   2.   The use and maintenance of a sign described in Subsection 1 shall be
subject to the provisions of the Zoning Code relating to nonconforming uses,
insofar as they are logically applicable to signs.
   3.   For purposes of Subsection 1, no sign shall be construed to exist on

not more than 30 days prior to said date.
   4.   Nothing contained in this section shall permit the continued existence
of those signs prohibited under Section
155.18.

If the Zoning Administrator finds that any sign, sign structure, or other
structure regulated hereunder is unsafe or not securely fastened or is a menace
to the public, or has been constructed or erected or is being maintained in
violation of the provisions of this chapter, such officer shall give written
notice thereof to the permit holder or, if no permit has been issued, to the
owner of the property on which the sign or structure is located. Such notice
shall include a statement explaining the alleged violations and deficiencies,
an order to repair or remove said sign, and an explanation of the consequences
of failure to comply with said order. If the permit holder or property owner
fails to remove or alter said sign so as to comply with the order within 10
days after such notice, said sign or other structure may be removed or altered
to comply by the Zoning Administrator at the expense of the permit holder or,
if no permit has been issued, the owner of the property on which it is located.
The permit holder or property owner may appeal the order of the Zoning
Administrator to the Council, and, if such an appeal is on file, the 10-day
compliance period shall be extended until 10 days following the Council’s
decision on the matter. Before deciding the appeal the Council shall afford the
appellant the opportunity for a public hearing. If, however, the Zoning
Administrator finds that any sign or other structure poses a serious and
immediate threat to the health or safety of any person, the Zoning
Administrator may order the removal of such sign summarily and without notice
to the permit holder or property owner. Such an order may be appealed to the
Council, and if the Council reverses, it shall order restitution at the City’s
expense.
155.21   PERMIT REVOCATION.
The sign permit of any permit holder who fails to comply with an order of the
Zoning Administrator issued under Section
155.20 within the allotted time period, or who fails to pay reasonable repair
or removal costs assessed under Section
155.20, shall be revoked by the Zoning Administrator, who shall, in such cases,

revoked, a new sign permit for the same or any similar sign shall not be issued
to the former permit holder for a period of one year from the date of
revocation.

chapter, the City Attorney, at the direction of the Council, shall, in addition

or who resists the enforcement of, any of the provisions of this chapter or any
of the terms and conditions of any permit, regulation, or lawful order of the

of a simple misdemeanor and a municipal infraction. Each day that a violation
exists or continues shall constitute a separate offense.

      D.   “Zoning map” or “official zoning map” means the scaled map
designating zoning district boundaries within the City of Waukon adopted by
reference in Ordinance No. 465 on March 16, 1998, on file in the office of the
Clerk, as amended from time to time thereafter.
      E.   “Zoning permit” means the written authorization issued by the Zoning
Administrator to an applicant permitting the applicant to proceed with the
erection, construction, alteration, enlargement, extension, reconstruction feet
or moving of any building or structure or portion thereof, including the
excavation of a basement for a structure, or the use of a lot or a structure
thereon, and certifying that the applicant’s plans and proposed use comply with
all applicable provisions of this chapter and that all other preliminary
requirements, including the issuance of any other necessary permits, approvals
or variances, have been satisfied.

   1.   Except as hereinafter provided, no structure or premises shall
hereafter be used, and no structure shall be extended, erected, converted,
moved, rebuilt, or altered except in conformity with all the district
regulations established by this chapter for the district in which it is or will
be located and, if the cost or value of the construction or alteration is
$500.00 or more, until a zoning permit has been secured from the Zoning
Administrator as provided herein.
   2.   The principal use on a lot and the lot itself shall have access to a
public street.
   3.   No structure in the rear of any principal building on the same interior
lot shall be used for residence purposes.
   4.   Not more than one principal permitted use is permitted on an undivided
quarter-quarter section of land or lot of record until the same has been
subdivided according to the Code of Iowa and the ordinances of the City into a
separate lot of record for each principal use. This requirement does not apply
to farm dwellings provided for in the agricultural zoning district.
   5.   No lot shall hereafter be so reduced in size that any required yard or
other open space, or lot width or area, will be smaller than is prescribed in
this chapter for the district in which it is located.
   6.   No zoning lot in any residence district shall be hereafter platted or
reduced in size so as to have a street frontage of less than 60 feet, except
for “zero-lot line” development.
   7.   No yard or other open space on one lot shall be considered as providing
a yard or open space for any other lot, and no yards or other open space about
an existing structure or any structure hereafter constructed shall be
considered as providing a yard or open space for any other structure.
   8.   If actual construction has been started on any structure pursuant to a
permit at the effective date of this chapter, or any amendment thereto, nothing
contained herein shall require any change in the plans, construction, or
designated use of any structure or part thereof.
   9.   Every building hereafter erected, converted, moved, enlarged, or
structurally altered shall be located on a zoning lot and there shall not be
more than one principal building or use on one zoning lot, except that the
Council may authorize more than one principal building or use on one lot after
review and recommendation by the Commission.
   10.   One-family dwellings shall have a minimum gross floor area of 900
square feet per unit, except mobile homes may have a minimum of 720 square feet
per unit.
   11.   Mobile homes shall be located only within mobile home parks (R-
5 District) and in an Agricultural District.
   12.   Fences, walls, trees, and shrubs which interfere with traffic
visibility shall not be permitted within vision clearance triangles, except in
a B-1 District. Fences and walls not prohibited above are permitted in a
required side or front yard provided such fence or wall, other than a retaining
wall, shall not be higher than six feet, measured from ground level, unless any
part above such height has at least 50 percent of the surface uniformly open
and unobstructed; provided, however, that the 6-foot limitation does not apply
to fences on or adjacent to side lot lines if the adjoining lot is not in a
residential zoning district. Fences not prohibited above having a height of 10
feet or less measured from ground level may be located within a required yard.
   13.   No statuary, memorial, or work of art in a public place, and no public
building, bridge, or public structure, shall be located or erected, or site
therefor obtained, nor shall any permit be issued by any department of the City
for the erection or location thereof, until the design and proposed location of
any such improvement shall have been submitted to the Commission and its
recommendations thereon obtained. Such requirement for recommendations shall
not act as a stay upon action for any such improvement where the Commission,
after 30 days’ written notice requesting such recommendations, shall have
failed to file the same with the Council.
   14.   Any structure which has been damaged by fire, explosion, act of God,
or the public enemy or left to deteriorate to the extent of more than 50
percent of its value, shall be restored, or the property shall be leveled to
the grade as prescribed by the City within six months.
   15.   If construction of a structure is started and then abandoned for a
period of two years, the property shall be returned to its original condition.
If the property owner fails to comply with this subsection, the work will be
done by the City and the cost shall be assessed to the property.
   16.   All minimum setback requirements shall be applicable to principal and
accessory buildings and structures and no accessory building or structure shall
occupy any part of a required yard, except for accessory buildings or
structures in rear yards if and to the extent permitted under the applicable
zoning district regulations.
   17.   All provisions contained in the definitions set forth in Section
165.05 of this chapter which are regulatory in nature are substantive and
enforceable regulations under this chapter.
   18.   Except as provided in this subsection, the issuance of a zoning permit
under this chapter for the construction of a new principal building or
structure imposes on the owner of the lot for which the permit was issued a
duty to repair, replace, or reconstruct any defective public sidewalks abutting
said lot or, if no sidewalk exists, to construct public sidewalks abutting the
lot, all in accordance with the regulations and standards of
Chapter 136 of this Code. At the time the zoning permit is issued, the Zoning
Administrator shall inspect any existing abutting sidewalks and shall inform
the owner or the owner’s agent, in writing, of any sidewalk work required. The
required sidewalk work shall be completed within one year after the zoning
permit is issued and a Certificate of Compliance shall not be issued until the
required sidewalk work is satisfactorily completed unless a waiver is granted.
Upon the owner’s application, the Council may grant a renewable, five-year
waiver of the requirements of this subsection for lots located in Agricultural
A, Conservancy C, General Business B-2, and Manufacturing M-1 Zoning Districts
if it reasonably appears that pedestrian traffic utilizing such sidewalks would
be insignificant. The owner or any successor shall complete the required
sidewalk work within one year from the expiration of such a temporary waiver.
The Council may also grant permanent waivers of these requirements for any lot
where topographical conditions render sidewalk construction unfeasible. The
requirements of this subsection shall not apply to zoning permits issued for
accessory buildings or for the alteration or enlargement of any building or
structure.
165.08   OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
   1.   Similar Uses. For uses not specifically mentioned in this section, the

      A.   No vehicle parking shall be allowed within the required front or
side yard of any permitted use in any R District except in driveways or
garages, or in established parking areas which have been approved by the City
for parking. In any residence district, no parking space shall be located
closer to the front lot line than the main building on the same lot, unless
such parking space is in a private or storage garage or in a standard driveway.
In multiple residence zones the Council, following recommendation by the
Commission, may approve site plans which vary from these requirements, provided
parking spaces are shielded from the street by landscaping, hedges, decorative
fences, or similar means.
      B.   Any lighting used to illuminate any off-street parking area,

with natural plant material, screening fences, or walls. Only those sides of a
parking lot facing upon public streets or upon any R District lots are required
to be screened. Screening shall be a minimum of two feet and a maximum of six
feet high except adjacent to driveways or street intersections. Within 10 feet
of a parking lot driveway or within 20 feet of a street intersection, screening
shall be less than two feet high. If planting material is to be utilized,
plants must be a minimum of 12 inches high at the time of planting. Screening
plans must accompany the parking lot plans at the time of zoning permit
application.
      D.   An allowance of 25 percent of the total number of off-street parking
spaces required may be identified, constructed, and used as compact car spaces.
Compact spaces shall be conveniently located and provided with adequate above-
grade signage to identify the compact spaces and shall be identified as compact
spaces only.
      E.   All 90º full-size parking spaces shall be a minimum of nine feet
wide and 20 feet long exclusive of required driveways, access aisles, and
turning space. All 90º compact car parking spaces shall be a minimum of seven
and one-half feet wide and 15 feet long.
   4.   Off-Street Loading Spaces Required.
      A.   In any district, in connection with every building or part thereof
hereafter erected, which is to be occupied by manufacturing, storage,
warehouse, goods display, retail store, wholesale store, market, hotel,
hospital, mortuary, laundry, dry-cleaning, or other uses similarly requiring
the receipt or distribution by vehicles of material or merchandise, there shall
be provided and maintained on the same lot with such building at least one off-
street loading space plus additional loading spaces necessary to avoid problems
with traffic or with adjacent property.
      B.   Each loading space shall not be less than 10 feet in width, and
shall be long enough to adequately accommodate the type of vehicles expected to
use such loading spaces.
      C.   Loading and unloading spaces for uses in all districts except the B-
1 District shall be located on the same lot as the use it serves with safe and
convenient driveway access and maneuvering space, and such space shall be
located or designed so that no vehicle will encroach upon or obstruct any part
of a public street while loading or unloading.
      D.   A loading space cannot be considered a parking space for purposes of
meeting the off-street parking requirement of this section.
165.09   NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES.
   1.   Statement of Intent. Within the various districts established by this
chapter or its amendments, there exist structures and uses of land, with or
without structures, which were lawful or vested uses prior to the adoption of
this chapter or its amendments, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or
restricted under the provisions of this chapter. Such uses and structures are
referred to as “nonconforming” uses and structures in this chapter. It is the
intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue even though
they are incompatible with the district in which they are located so long as
provisions hereinafter set forth are complied with. However, it is the general
intent to restrict nonconforming uses and structures and discourage indefinite
prolongation of the life of nonconforming uses and structures so that
ultimately conformance with this chapter will prevail.
   2.   Nonconforming Uses of Land. If a use of land upon which no building or
structure is erected or constructed exists at the effective date of this
chapter or any amendment hereto which was lawful under all laws, including
zoning laws, in effect immediately prior to the effective date, but which would
not be allowed under the terms of this chapter or any amendment, the use may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
      A.   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged, increased, or extended
to occupy a greater area of land.
      B.   No such nonconforming use shall be moved, in whole or in part, to
any other portion of the lot or parcel.
      C.   No structure or building shall be constructed on or moved onto the
land, unless the use is changed to a use permitted in that district.
      D.   If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than 12 months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to
the district regulations for the district in which such land is located.
   3.   Nonconforming Uses of Structures. If a use of a structure, or of a
structure and land in combination, exists at the effective date of this chapter
or any amendment hereto which was lawful under all laws, including zoning laws,
in effect immediately prior to the effective date, but which would not be
allowed under the terms of this chapter or any amendment, the use may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
      A.   No existing structure devoted entirely or in part to a use not
permitted by this chapter in the district in which it is located shall be
enlarged, extended, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered, unless the
use is changed to a use permitted in the district in which such structure is
located.
      B.   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of a
building which was manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time it
became nonconforming. No such use shall be extended to any land outside such
building.
      C.   If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a
structure may be changed to another nonconforming use of a similar nature or a
more restricted use. Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a more
restricted use or to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed
to a less restrictive use or a nonconforming use.
      D.   In the event that a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure
and land in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for a period of 12
months, the use of the same shall thereafter conform to the uses permitted in
the district in which it is located. Where nonconforming use status applied to
a structure and land in combination, removal or destruction of the structure
shall terminate the authorization for the nonconforming use of the land.
      E.   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the restoration
of a building destroyed to the extent of not more than 65 percent of its
reasonable value by casualty.
   4.   Nonconforming Structures. Where a structure is nonconforming by reason
of restriction on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics
of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so
long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
      A.   That it is not enlarged or altered in a way which increases its
nonconformity.
      B.   Nothing in this chaptershall be deemed to prevent the restoration of
a building destroyed to the extent of not more than 65 percent of its
reasonable value by casualty.
   5.   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict or prohibit the
sale of a nonconforming use or land containing nonconforming uses or
structures. However, no purchaser of a nonconforming property or use may claim
unnecessary hardship as a basis for a variance under this chapter.
   6.   The foregoing provisions shall also apply to nonconforming uses and
structures in districts hereafter changed and to property hereafter annexed to
the City. In such cases the effective date of this chapter shall be the date of
amendment or annexation.
165.10   CONDITIONAL USES.
   1.   Intent. It is intended that some uses which are unique, or which would
have greater impact on a neighborhood than the typical permitted use of that
district, be allowed as permitted uses if they are generally compatible with
the land use intent of the district and if such use meets or can be adjusted to
meet necessary conditions or performance standards which would make such use
basically compatible with the permitted uses of the district. Such uses are
referred to as “conditional uses” in this chapter. Conditional uses may be
allowed in any district providing for them without rezoning land. The intent of
conditional use provisions is to allow certain border-line or unique uses in a
district subject to performance standards or conditions without which the use
would not be permissible within that particular district. These provisions are
intended to provide flexibility in the Zoning Code and give the City an
opportunity to review and regulate specialized or unique uses, and to decide if
such uses are conducive to being located in a specific proposed location rather
than forcing the applicant to rezone land which would also allow many other
permitted uses under the new district if the proposed use is not actually
developed.
   2.   Procedure. Only those uses listed as conditional uses in an individual
zoning district can be considered for being permitted in such district.
      A.   Application and Fee. Written application must be made to the Zoning
Administrator for a conditional use permit. The necessary information as
determined by the Zoning Administrator shall be supplied with such application.
A nonrefundable fee of $50.00 shall be paid when an application is submitted.
Applications shall be made on forms provided by the City.
      B.   Board of Adjustment Hearing and Decision. The ZoningAdministrator
shall promptly refer a conditional use permit application to the Board of
Adjustment. The Board shall conduct a public hearing and render its decision on
the application in conformity with the notice and procedural requirements of
Section
165.29(4)(C) of this chapter and the rules of the Board. The Board shall
approve or deny the application and, if approved, may attach conditions
consistent with the intent of this section to the issuance of the permit.
      C.   Permit Issuance. The Zoning Administrator shall issue, in writing,
all conditional use permits approved by the Board. The permit shall describe
the lot to which the permit applies and shall set forth all conditions
prescribed by the Board.
      D.   Compliance Review. Each property for which a conditional use permit
has been issued shall be inspected by the Zoning Administrator on or about the
first anniversary date following the issuance of the permit to check compliance
with all attached conditions. The Zoning Administrator shall report his
findings following inspection to the Board. If noncompliance with any
conditions attached to the permit is found, the Board, following written notice
to the permit holder and an opportunity for hearing, may revoke the conditional
use permit. If compliance with all conditions is found to exist, a Certificate
of Compliance shall be issued by the Zoning Administrator.
   3.   Standards. No conditional use shall be approved by the Board unless the
Board shall find:
      A.   That the establishment, maintenance, or operation of the use will
not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort,
or general welfare;
      B.   That the use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other
property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, or
substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood;
      C.   That the establishment of the use will not impede the normal and
orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district;
      D.   That the exterior architectural appeal and functional plan of any
proposed structure will not be so at variance with either the exterior
architectural appeal and functional plan of the structures already constructed
in the immediate neighborhood or with the character of the applicable district
as to cause a substantial depreciation in the property values within the
neighborhood;
      E.   That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary
facilities have been or are being provided;
      F.   That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress
and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets;
      G.   That the proposed use is not contrary to the objectives of any duly
adopted comprehensive plan for the City; and
      H.   In the case of the uses enumerated in the following Subparagraphs
(1) and (2), that there be a minimum distance of 500 feet between such use and
all places of human habitation, public assembly, or business not associated
with such use and that such use not be so located that prevailing winds would
carry any fumes, odors, or gasses from such use toward developed properties or
into the City:
         (1)   Bulk storage of any flammable or explosive substance including,
but not limited to, liquid petroleum, gasoline, fuel oil, dynamite, and
fireworks. For purposes of this subsection, “bulk storage” means storage for
other than retail or on-premises sales.
         (2)   Storage, blending, mixing or on-premises sales of toxic
substances, whether or not under pressure, for commercial or agricultural
purposes including, but not limited to, anhydrous ammonia, fertilizer,
pesticide, and herbicide.
      I.   In the case of telecommunication towers, adequate aviation warning
lights will be mounted.
      J.   That the establishment, maintenance, and operation of the use will
be in compliance with any applicable State and federal laws and regulations,
including permit and license requirements.
   4.   The minimum standards for conditional uses shall be the same as the
minimum standards for the permitted uses in the same zoning district except as
provided in Subsections 5 and 6 of this section.
   5.   In insuring that all standards are maintained, the Board may attach any
reasonable site, building or aesthetic development conditions over and above
the minimum standards of the zoning district in which the conditional use will
be located. Such conditions must be in place before a Certificate of Compliance
may be issued by the Zoning Administrator.
   6.   Provisions shall be made to buffer the conditional use from adjacent
properties if judged necessary by the Board. Such buffering can take the form
of setbacks, vegetation, fences, open space, noise abatement or mitigation of
the effects of on-site activities through the location and design of a proposed
activity or use.
   7.   All conditional uses in place on the effective date of this chapter are
presumed to be approved conditional uses.
   8.   A conditional use permit shall be valid only for the use specified on
said permit and the permit shall expire at the time the specified use
terminates, except in the case of a home occupation conditional use permit
which shall expire if the business use ceases for a continuous period of two
years or more. The permit shall not be transferable to other uses on the same
lot nor shall the permit authorize the permit holder to conduct or establish
the specified conditional use at a location other than the location specified
in the permit. A conditional use permit is transferable to subsequent owners of
the conditional use or the lot on which it is located, except in the case of a
home occupation conditional use permit which shall not be transferable to a
subsequent owner of the lot and which shall automatically expire upon any
transfer of ownership of the lot for which the permit was issued.
   9.   No person shall engage in any conditional use on any lot in any zoning
district unless a conditional use permit has been issued for such use on such
lot, and unless all conditions attached to the permit are complied with, nor
continue such conditional use after revocation or expiration of a conditional
use permit.
   10.   Conditional Use Permits for Functional Families.
      A.   Purpose. The purpose of this subsection is to authorize several
unrelated people to qualify as a “functional family” and live together in a
single-dwelling unit. Notwithstanding any contrary or inconsistent provision in
this chapter, a “functional family” use shall be deemed a conditional use in
every residential zoning district.
      B.   Standards. In addition to the standards imposed by Subsection 3 of
this section, a conditional use for a “functional family” shall not be approved
by the Board unless the Board finds:
         (1)   The members of the functional family share a strong bond or

   1.   Approval by Board of Adjustment. Subject to the restrictions and
limitations set forth in this section, the Board shall have authority to
approve, deny, or conditionally approve applications for special exception use
permits in the various zoning districts.
   2.   Procedure. An application for a Special Exception Use Permit shall be
filed with the Zoning Administrator. The applicant shall also pay a non-
refundable $50.00 application shall describe, in detail, the proposed use or
structure for which the permit is sought and shall include a detailed plan of
any involved structure, including the location of such structure upon the lot
and the location of all lot lines and street right-of-way lines, unless such
information has been submitted as part of pending Zoning Permit application.
Upon receipt of a Special Exception Use Permit application meeting the
foregoing requirements, the Zoning Administrator shall promptly forward the
same to the Board. The Board shall conduct a public hearing and render its
decision on the application in conformity with the procedural guidelines set
forth in Section
165.29(4)(C) of this chapter and the rules of the Board. If approved, the
permit shall be issued by the Zoning Administrator and shall identify the
permit holder and the lot to which the permit applies and shall set forth the
permit expiration date, if any, and all conditions attached by the Board to the
permit.   
(Subsection 2 – Ord. 842 – Oct. 24 Supp.)
   3.   Permitted Special Exception Uses. Only the following specific special
exception uses are eligible for consideration for a special exception use
permit in any zoning district:
      A.   Non-municipal utility structures, transmission lines, and related
structures.
      B.   Temporary buildings, including trailers, for commerce or industry or
for construction purposes, but no permit shall be granted for any such purpose
for a period of more than 18 months or permit the changing of one nonconforming
use to another.
      C.   Temporary sawmills located no closer than 200 feet from the nearest
residential zoning district and securely fenced from unauthorized entry.
      D.   Temporary locations for concrete and asphalt production plants.
   4.   Conditions. In granting any such application, the Board may attach
conditions to special exception uses which, in the judgment of the Board, are
necessary to protect the health, safety, and general welfare, protect property
values, insure compatibility with neighborhood character, mitigate effects of
traffic, insure visual acceptability including required landscaping and
buffering from adjacent uses, and insure compatibility with City plans and
development policies. Conditions may also include time limits on the duration
of a special exception use or periodic review of the use and the conditions, if
any, attached thereto.
   5.   Compliance Review. The inspection to be conducted by the Zoning
Administrator on the anniversary date of the issuance of any zoning permit as
provided in Section
165.28 of this chapter shall also include an inspection and report concerning
compliance by the applicant with the terms and conditions of any special
exception use permit which has been issued. The Zoning Administrator shall also
make an inspection and report and, if appropriate, issue a Certificate of
Compliance in connection with a special exception use at such times as may be
required in the conditions attached by the Board in approving any special
exception use permit. If noncompliance with any terms and conditions of the
permit is found by the Board, after written notice to the permit holder and an
opportunity for a hearing, the Board shall revoke the permit.
   6.   Expiration and Transfer. A special exception use permit shall not be
transferable from one person or location to another person or location and
shall expire upon termination of the use or on the date specified by the Board.
   7.   Violations. No person shall engage in any special exception use on any
lot in any zoning district unless a special exception use permit has been
issued to such person for such lot, and unless all conditions attached to the
permit are complied with, nor continue such special exception use after
revocation or expiration of a special exception use permit.
165.12   VARIANCES.
   1.   Authorization by Board of Adjustment. Upon appeal from a decision of
the Zoning Administrator, the Board shall have authority in specific cases to
authorize such variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will, in an individual case,
result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of the Zoning Code shall
be observed and substantial justice done.
   2.   Procedure. Following an adverse decision by the Zoning Administrator,
based upon a determination that a particular structure or use would be contrary
to the terms of this chapter, written application may be made to the Board, in
connection with an appeal to the Board, requesting that a variance from the
terms of this chapter be granted. Such application for a variance shall
specifically cite the provision of this chapter as to which a variance is
sought, shall specifically describe the nature and scope of the variance
requested, and shall specifically identify the lot to which it relates. The
variance application shall be made on forms provided by the City and shall be
accompanied by a non-refundable $50.00 application fee. The Board, upon receipt
of a variance application satisfying the foregoing requirements, shall conduct
a public hearing and issue its decision on the application in accordance with
the procedural requirements set forth in Section
165.29 of this chapter. If the variance application is granted, the Zoning
Administrator shall reverse the decision from which the appeal was taken. Any
Zoning Permit issued shall contain a statement of the variance granted and any
conditions attached thereto.   
(Subsection 2 – Ord. 842 – Oct. 24 Supp.)
   3.   Council Review of Variance Grants. No grant of a variance by the Board
shall be effective until after review of the variance grant by the Council. The
Zoning Administrator shall forward all variance applications which have been
approved by the Board to the Council for review at its next meeting following
such approval. The Council shall, at such meeting, by motion, either approve
the variance grant or remand the matter to the Board for further study. If
remanded to the Board by the Council, the Board shall reconsider its decision
and may either confirm its prior decision or deny the variance grant. If a
variance grant is remanded to the Board for further consideration and the Board
confirms its initial decision to approve the variance, the variance grant shall
become effective 30 days after the Council’s decision to remand.
   4.   Unnecessary Hardship. Before a variance application may be granted, the
Board must specifically find that the applicant has established that the zoning
restrictions applicable to the zoning lot in question impose an unnecessary
hardship upon the property. Unnecessary hardship is established only if all of
the following elements are shown to exist:
      A.   No beneficial use may be made of the property if used only for a
purpose allowed in, or subject to the restrictions applicable to, the zoning
district in which it is located; and
      B.   The plight of the applicant is due to unique circumstances and not
to the general conditions in the neighborhood; and
      C.   The use to be authorized by the variance will not alter the
essential character of the locality.
   5.   Other Requirements. In addition to the requirement that unnecessary
hardship, as defined above, be shown by the applicant, the Board shall grant a
variance application only if all of the following conditions are found to
exist:
      A.   There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the
particular property in question, because of its size, shape, or topography,
that are not applicable to other lots or structures in the same district.
      B.   Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the applicant
any special privileges that are denied to other persons in the district in
which the lot is located.
      C.   A literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other persons in the
district in which the property is located.
      D.   The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the
applicant nor were the same in existence at the time the lot was acquired by
the applicant.
      E.   The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make
possible the lawful use of the land, buildings, or structure so that the
variance, if granted, would not totally eliminate the zoning restrictions in
question.
      F.   The variance requested is not prospective in nature (i.e., does not
involve a structure or use which will not be commenced within one year from the
date of approval).
The existence of nonconforming structures or nonconforming uses of land or
structures elsewhere in the same district, or of permitted or nonconforming
structures or uses in other districts, shall not be grounds for granting a
variance application.
   6.   Intent. It is intended by this section to restrict the granting of
variances to those rare occasions in which unnecessary hardship has been
established, as required by the laws of the State of Iowa.
   7.   Conditions. Conditions may be attached to the approval of variance
applications which, in the judgment of the Board, are necessary to protect
public health, safety and welfare, protect property values, insure
compatibility with neighborhood character, mitigate effects of traffic, insure
visual acceptability, including required landscaping and buffering from
adjacent uses, and insure compatibility with City plans and development
policies.
   8.   Compliance Review. In each inspection and report on the anniversary
date of the issuance of any zoning permit, as required pursuant to Section
165.28, the Zoning Administrator shall also inspect and report upon the
compliance by the variance applicant with any conditions attached by the Board
to the approval of any variance application. Any Certificate of Compliance
issued as required under Section
165.28 shall include a certification regarding compliance with such conditions.
   9.   Transfer and Duration. A variance grant applies to the particular lot
for which it is requested and not to the applicant. A variance shall not be
transferable from one lot or person but remains applicable to the lot when the
lot is transferred, unless terminated as hereafter provided. A variance shall
be permanent unless the use or structure permitted by the variance is not
commenced within one year of variance approval, in which case the variance
shall automatically terminate.
   10.   Violations. No person shall make use of any land or structure or
erect, construct, alter, enlarge, reconstruct, or move any structure or portion
thereof in a manner contrary to any conditions attached to the approval of a
variance application nor commence or continue such use or structure after the
termination of a variance grant.

lot, or quarter-section lines, such street, alley, lot, or quarter-section
lines shall be interpreted to be the boundary of the district.
      B.   Where no indication of the district boundary is made and no
dimensions are shown, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the
use of the scale appearing on the map.
      C.   Whenever any street, alley, or other public way is vacated by
official action of the City, the zoning district adjoining each side of such
street, alley, or public way shall be automatically extended to the center of
such vacation and all area included in the vacation shall then and henceforth
be subject to all appropriate regulations of the extended districts.
      D.   All territory annexed to the City shall automatically become a part
of the R-2 Single-Family Residence District, until definite boundaries and
zoning districts are recommended by the Commission and adopted by ordinance by
the Council; provided, however, that the Council shall adopt definite
boundaries and district regulations within 90 days from the date of the
annexation. The Commission may recommend definite zoning districts and
boundaries to the Council prior to or at the time the Council acts on a
proposed annexation, and the Council may adopt definite boundaries at the time
of annexation provided the public notice procedure is followed.

165.24   PDD PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT REGULATIONS.
The Council may, upon application for rezoning, establish special zoning
districts, with regulations in each, which will over a period of time tend to
promote the maximum benefit from coordinated site planning, diversified
location of structures, and mixed compatible uses. Such regulations shall
provide for a safe and efficient system for pedestrian and vehicular traffic,
attractive recreation, and landscaped open spaces, economic design, and
location of public and private utilities and community facilities, and insure
adequate standards for construction and planning. Such regulations may also
provide for the development of the land in such districts with one or more
principal structures and related accessory uses, and in such districts the
regulations need not be uniform. This district is established to permit greater
incentives and flexibility for promoting creative and imaginative design for
the development of residential neighborhoods and of special areas having mixed
use potential. This district can be used to provide cluster residential
development with commonly owned and managed open space and recreational areas
and to allow integration of compatible non-residential land uses in a
controlled manner which would not be subject to repeated governmental reviews
and approvals such as rezonings, plat submission, or spot zoning requests. It
is further intended to promote more economical and efficient use of land while
providing a harmonious variety and mixture of housing choices, shopping and
employment activities, recreation and natural areas, utility and circulation
systems and building styles. This district is also intended to preserve to the
greatest extent possible natural and valuable landscape features and to allow
variability in the yard, area, height, and street setback requirements for the
purpose of accomplishing other extensions of this district. This district is
also intended to be a management tool for the City and for private developers
to be applied as a floating zone to stimulate and regulate land uses having
special development characteristics, all in accordance with the City’s
Comprehensive Plan.
   1.   Permitted Uses: Any permitted use of the C, R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, B-2,
and M-1 Districts.
   2.   PDD Zoning Procedures. A PDD rezoning application shall be accompanied
by a Preliminary Sketch Plan which shall be reviewed by the Commission and
Council prior to action on the rezoning application.
      A.   Preliminary Conference. After the PDD rezoning application and
Preliminary Sketch Plan have been submitted there shall be an informal
preliminary conference between the applicant and the Zoning Administrator, the
City planning staff or planning consultants, the Mayor, and any others judged
necessary by the Mayor. The purpose of this conference shall be to establish a
mutual understanding of the proposal between the City and the applicant, to
resolve any initial problems and expedite the Council’s decision on the
application.
      B.   Preliminary Approval. The PDD rezoning application shall be
scheduled for Commission preliminary conference. Commission’s review shall be
based upon the Preliminary Sketch Plan and such other information that is
presented. The Commission shall make a preliminary recommendation to approve,
approve conditionally, or reject said application with such preliminary
recommendation being forwarded to the Council for preliminary approval or
rejection.
      C.   Final Approval. The PDD rezoning application and Final Development
Plan, which is based upon the approved Preliminary Sketch Plan, may be
submitted to the Commission and Council after receiving preliminary approval.
The application and Final Development Plan shall be recommended for approval or
rejection by the Commission with such recommendation presented to the Council.
If the Council approves the application and Final Development Plan the land
included within the plan shall be rezoned, by ordinance, to the PDD District
and the plan shall be recorded in the County Recorder’s office within 60 days
of such approval. Three copies of the Final Development Plan shall be filed in
the Clerk’s office before any zoning permit shall be issued or before any
public improvement in said PDD Development shall be built or accepted by the
City.
   3.   Preliminary Sketch Plan. This plan shall show the following elements:
building locations and sizes, designated land uses, areas, open space, public
lands, streets, utility locations and easements, parking areas, visual
screening, surface drainage features, lot layout for any proposed subdivision
of lands for conveyance to others, and any other physical features required by
the Commission after initial review. Additional information which shall
accompany this plan includes: estimated development number housing units and
type of housing, and whether or not there will be a homeowner’s association or
similar group of property owners to be responsible for ownership, maintenance,
etc. of common lands. Two copies of all maps, photographs, charts, and other
required information shall be submitted to the Clerk.
   4.   Except for changes and modifications approved in the manner set forth
in Subsection 12 of this section, the PDD applicant shall develop the property
included within the PDD in accordance with the terms of the Final Development
Plan and any conditions attached thereto by the Council. Any substantial
variation from any part of the recorded Final Development Plan shall void any
related zoning permit and shall disqualify any such development or part thereof
from receiving a Certificate of Compliance.
   5.   The Final Development Plan shall be binding on the PDD applicant’s
successors in interest with respect to any of the real estate included in the
PDD.
   6.   There shall be no minimum yard or height requirements in a PDD District
except that minimum yards, as specified in the R-4 District, shall be provided
around the boundaries of the PDD District.
   7.   Uses along the project boundary lines that are less restrictive than R-
4 District permitted uses shall not be in conflict with those allowed in
adjoining or opposite property. To this end the Council may require, in the
absence of any appropriate physical barrier, that uses of least intensity or a
buffer of open space or screening be arranged along the borders of the project.
   8.   In their review of the plan, the Commission and Council may consider
any deed restrictions or covenants entered into or contracted for by the
developer concerning the use of common land or permanent open space. “Common
land” shall refer to land dedicated to public use and to land retained in
private ownership but intended for the use of the residents of the development
unit or the general public.
   9.   No permit for any permitted commercial building shall be issued until
at least 25 percent of the PDD District in question is developed for
residential uses.
   10.   Land Use and Density Standards:
      A.   No more than 15 percent of the total area of a PDD District may be
used for commercial uses.
      B.   No more than 10 percent of the total area of a PDD may be used for
manufacturing uses.

family areas in a PDD shall not be greater than is allowed for in the R-
3 District.
      D.   Overall density requirements in any designated multiple-family area
of a PDD District shall not be greater than allowed in the R-4 District.
      E.   Density requirements shall be computed on the basis of the total
area of residential uses as designated on the Final Development Plan using
private streets and drives, common open space, park areas, recreation areas,
off-street parking areas, as well as building site areas.
   11.   Size of PDD District: The minimum size of a PDD District shall be five
acres.
   12.   Changes and Modifications. No change or modification of the plan of
any PDD District as to land use, density, public facilities, or size shall be
permitted except by the procedure provided for amendments to this chapter.
Other changes or modifications, such as location of buildings, parking lots,
and common areas, except streets, may be made upon application to and approval
of the Commission.
   13.   Exceptions. A PDD zoning approval shall be valid for a period not to
exceed two years before development is commenced within the district.
Application may be made by the applicant originally granted the PDD zoning for
an extension not to exceed one additional year. Application shall not be made
for more than one such extension. If no development is begun at the end of
three years from the zoning approval the lands shall revert to the previous
zoning districts.
165.25   AVIATION PROTECTION.
   1.   Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this section is to impose certain
special restrictions on land use within the City, in addition to all other
restrictions imposed under this chapter, in order to insure the safe operation
of airborne aircraft, particularly in areas adjacent to the Waukon Municipal
Airport. It is intended that such restrictions shall be coordinated with like
restrictions existing under the County Zoning Ordinance.
   2.   Nuisance Declared. The creation, establishment, or maintenance of an
airport hazard is hereby declared to be a public nuisance injurious to the
community served by the airport and:
      A.   That it is necessary in the interest of the public health, safety,
and welfare that airport hazards be prevented or abated; and
      B.   That this should be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by
proper exercise of the police power, including the use of all nuisance
abatement procedures provided in this Code of Ordinances; and
      C.   That the prevention of the creation or establishment of airport
hazards, and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, or marking and
lighting of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which the City may
raise and expend public funds, as an incident to the operation of airports, to
acquire land or property interests therein.
   3.   Definitions. The following terms are defined for purposes of this
section, unless the context otherwise requires:
      A.   “Airport” means the Waukon Municipal Airport.
      B.   “Airport elevation” means the highest point of an airport’s usable
landing area measured in feet above mean sea level, which elevation is
established to be 1,280 feet.
      C.   “Airport hazard” means any structure or tree or use of land which
would exceed the Federal Obstruction Standards as contained in 14 Code of
Federal Regulations, Sections 77.21, 77.23, and 77.25, as revised March 4,
1972, and which obstruct the airspace required for the flight of aircraft and
landing or takeoff at an airport or is otherwise hazardous to such landing or
taking off of aircraft.
      D.   “Airport primary surface” means a surface longitudinally centered on
a runway. When the runway has a specially prepared hard surface, the primary
surface of a runway will be that width prescribed in Part 77 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations (FAR) for the most precise approach existing or planned

requirements shall apply to each permitted use:
      A.   All lights or illumination used in conjunction with street, parking,
signs, or use of land and structures shall be arranged and operated in such a
manner that it is not misleading or dangerous to aircraft operating from the
Waukon Municipal Airport or in the vicinity thereof.

Circular 70-7460-ID and amendments. Additionally, any structure constructed
after the effective date of this chapter and exceeding 949 feet above ground
level shall install on that structure high intensity white obstruction lights
in accordance with Chapter 6 of FAA Advisory Circular 7460-ID and amendments.

may be necessary to indicate to pilots the presence of an airspace hazard.
   7.   Permits And Variances.
      A.   The Zoning Administrator shall not issue a zoning permit for a

erection, construction, alteration, enlargement, extension, reconstruction, or
moving of any building, structure, or any portion thereof, including the
excavation of a basement for a structure, without first having applied in
writing to the Zoning Administrator for a zoning permit and until a zoning
permit has been issued for such purpose. A zoning permit is not required for
any minor construction or alteration having a cost or value of less than
$500.00 or for the remodeling of any structure not involving enlargement or
structural alteration.
   2.   Applications. An application for zoning permit shall be made to the
Zoning Administrator on forms provided by the City and shall be accompanied by
a detailed set of plans, in duplicate, showing the size of the proposed
building or structure, its location on the lot, the materials of which it is to
be constructed, the details and type of construction to be used, and utility
servicing. If any portion of the lot is subject to a public street or highway
right-of-way, the portion of the lot subject to such right-of-way shall be
identified. Any known public or private water or sewer mains or service lines
located on the lot shall also be shown. The application shall also set forth
the legal description and address of the lot and describe the use to be made of
the structure. Upon issuance of a permit, one set of said plans shall be
retained by the Zoning Administrator as a permanent record and one set shall be
returned to the applicant. The Zoning Administrator may, in his or her own
discretion, permit the substitution of a detailed written statement covering
the essential information required in place of a plan; provided, however, that
the applicant shall in all cases furnish duplicate copies of a sketch of the
lot showing the lot lines, any street or highway right-of-way lines and the
location of the proposed structure in relationship to such lines. The Zoning
Administrator shall also have discretion, in cases of uncertainty, to require
the boundaries of a lot to be surveyed and marked by a licensed land surveyor
as a condition for the issuance of a zoning permit if necessary to determine
compliance with this chapter.
   3.   Applicants. The applicant for a zoning permit for a structure shall in
all cases be the owner of the lot unless the structure to be built or located
on the lot will be owned by someone other than the owner of the lot, in which
case the owner of the structure shall be the applicant.
   4.   Other Permits. If a particular structure or use would be lawful under
this chapter only as a conditional use or a special exception use, no zoning
permit shall be issued by the Zoning Administrator until the necessary
conditional use or special exception use approval has been granted as provided
in this chapter and a conditional use permit or a special exception use permit
issued.
   5.   Forms. Blank forms shall be provided by the Zoning Administrator for
the use of those applying for permits as provided by this chapter. Any permits
issued by the Zoning Administrator shall be on standard forms for such purpose
and shall be furnished by the City.
   6.   Inspection. The lot and the location of the proposed structure thereon
shall be staked out on the ground by the applicant or their agent and inspected
by the Zoning Administrator before a zoning permit is issued.
   7.   Time; Rejections. Except as may be otherwise provided in this chapter,
the Zoning Administrator shall issue a zoning permit or deny a zoning permit
application within 10 days after receipt of an application, provided that the
required information is contained in the application and the other conditions
set forth in this section have been satisfied by the applicant. The Zoning
Administrator shall deny any application which is not filed in conformity with
this section, or which proposes a structure or use which would be contrary to
the regulations applicable to the zoning district in which the lot is located.
Any denial of a zoning permit application shall be given in writing with the
reasons for such denial stated thereon. Any denial notice shall also inform the
applicant of the right of appeal to the Board of Adjustment.
   8.   Issuance. A zoning permit shall be issued by the Zoning Administrator
when the application and the investigation thereof indicates compliance by the
applicant with all of the provisions of this chapter and all other applicable
laws of the City and State.
   9.   Expiration. Each zoning permit shall expire one year after its date of
issuance and no person shall commence or proceed with the construction or other
act for which the zoning permit was issued after the expiration date.
Application may be made for a new zoning permit upon expiration of the original
permit. However, if construction of a structure is started and not
substantially completed and is then abandoned for a period of two years or
more, the property shall be returned to its condition prior to the commencement
of construction.
   10.   Records. A careful record of all permit applications, plans, and
permits issued shall be maintained by the Zoning Administrator.
   11.   Basement Dwellings. A zoning permit for a basement dwelling may be
issued with the provision that the main structure of the dwelling be completed
within a period of 24 months from the issuance of the permit.
   12.   Fees and Bond.
      A.   Except as provided by Paragraph D below, the applicant shall file
with the zoning permit application an administration and inspection fee, to be
deposited in the City’s General Fund, based upon the cost of the structure or
improvement determined as follows:
 
Total Valuation Permit Fee
$0.00 to $5,000 $10.00
$5,001 or more  $10.00, plus $1.00 for each $1,000.00 of cost, or fraction
                thereof, in excess of $5,000.00
 
      B.   In addition to the zoning permit fee, every application for a zoning
permit involving improvements which will require excavation upon public land,
including streets, alleys, or sidewalks, shall be accompanied by a cash bond as
provided in Section
135.09(4) of this Code of Ordinances.
      C.   If a zoning permit application is denied, the permit fee and the
bond referred to above shall be returned to the applicant by the Zoning
Administrator at the time the applicant is notified of the denial of the
application.
      D.   No permit fees shall be required from any local, State, or federal
governmental agency. In the case of new construction by nonprofit entities, the
Council shall have the right to waive or reduce the permit fees.
   13.   Proposed Use Changes. If the owner or occupant of a lot desires to
commence a new or different use on the lot or of any structure on the lot, an
application may be made to the Zoning Administrator for a zoning permit which
specifically authorizes the proposed new or different use. In such cases the
application need not include any structural plans or sketches but shall include
the legal description and address of the lot, and a description of the proposed
new or different use. The application shall be made by the owner or prospective
owner of the new or different use. No fee shall be required for this type of
zoning permit. The procedure described in this subsection is not mandatory but
is made available to help eliminate uncertainty and disputes in situations
where use changes are contemplated but a zoning permit is not required under
Subsection 1 of this section because no new or altered structures are proposed.
   14.   Certificate of Compliance.
      A.   No structure, lot or other premises shall be occupied or used for
which a zoning permit, conditional use permit or special exception use permit
has been issued after one year from the date of issuance of the permit unless a
Certificate of Compliance shall have been issued by the Zoning Administrator.
Such certificate shall show that the structure or premises or part thereof and
the use thereof are in compliance with the relevant provisions of this chapter
and in compliance with all permits issued therefor. Such certificate shall be
deemed applied for when application is made for any permit. Under such rules
and regulations as may be established by the Council by resolution, the Zoning
Administrator may issue a temporary Certificate of Compliance valid for up to
one additional year within which time the applicant or owner shall cause the
structure or part thereof or use thereof to come into complete compliance with
the requirements of this chapter and of the permit.
      B.   Upon written request from the owner or tenant, the Zoning
Administrator shall also issue a Certificate of Compliance for any existing
structure, premises or use certifying, after inspection, the extent and kind of
use made of the structure or premises and whether or not such structure or use
conforms to the provisions of this chapter, including provisions relating to
nonconforming structures and uses existing on the effective date of this
chapter.
      C.   No additional fee shall be required for the issuance of a
Certificate of Compliance required under the provisions of Paragraph A of this
subsection. A fee of $25.00 shall be required for Certificates of Compliance
issued under Paragraph B of this subsection.
   15.   Permit Moratoriums. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
chapter, whenever there is pending before the Council or the Planning and
Zoning Commission a proposal to amend this zoning ordinance or the official
zoning map, the Council may, by resolution, declare a moratorium on the
issuance of zoning permits authorizing structures or uses that may be
prohibited or otherwise affected if the pending amendment proposal is
ultimately enacted. Any such moratorium resolution shall, to the extent
reasonably possible, specify the types of structures, uses and/or districts
subject to the moratorium. A moratorium resolution shall be effective for the
period stated in the resolution, but not more than 90 days, and shall not be
extended or renewed. During any moratorium period the Zoning Administrator
shall not issue any zoning permits in violation of the moratorium resolution.

            b.   If the structure has been substantially damaged and is being
restored, before the damage occurred.
The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure
to correct existing violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety
code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
The term also does not include any alteration of a historic structure, provided
the alteration will not preclude the structure’s designation as a historic
structure.

   2.   Statutory Authority, Findings of Fact, and Purpose.
      A.   Statutory Authority. The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in
Chapter 414, Code of Iowa, as amended, delegated the power to cities to enact
zoning regulations to secure safety from flood and to promote health and the
general welfare.
      B.   Findings of Fact.
         (1)   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community.
         (2)   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are
caused by:
            a.   The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
flood damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being
inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flooding; and
            b.   The cumulative effect of obstructions on the floodplain
causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
         (3)   This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing
flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the
Department of Natural Resources.
      C.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect
and preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the City and its residents
and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort, and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Subsection 2(B)(1) with provisions designed to:
         (1)   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood
flows so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
         (2)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
or property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood
heights or velocities.
         (3)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public
facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time
of initial construction or substantial improvement.
         (4)   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited
for intended purposes because of flood hazard.
         (5)   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
   3.   General Provisions.
      A.   Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter shall
apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City which are located within
the boundaries of the Floodplain (Overlay) District as established in Section
165.34(5).
      B.   Establishment of Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) for Allamakee County and Incorporated Areas, City of Waukon,

as part of the Flood Insurance Study for Allamakee County are hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be the Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The Allamakee
County Flood Insurance Study is hereby adopted by reference and is made a part
of this chapter for the purpose of administering floodplain management
regulations.
      C.   Rules for Interpretation of Floodplain (Overlay) District. The
boundaries of the Floodplain (Overlay) District areas shall be determined by
scaling distances on the official Flood Insurance Rate Map. When an
interpretation is needed as to the exact location of a boundary, the
Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The Board of Appeals
shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any
requirement, decision, or determination made by the Administrator in the
enforcement or administration of this chapter.
      D.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used, and no
structure shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered,
without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
      E.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this
chapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions,
the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
      F.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall
be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a
limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
      G.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated Floodplain (Overlay) District areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create
liability on the part of the City, or any officer or employee thereof, for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
      H.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this

issue permits for variances except as directed by the Board of Appeals.
         (4)   Construction and Use to Be as Provided in Application and Plans.
Floodplain Development Permits based on the basis of approved plans and
applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in
such approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement, or
construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. The applicant shall be
required to submit certification by a professional engineer or land surveyor,
as appropriate, registered in the State, that the finished fill, structure
floor elevations, floodproofing, or other flood protection measures were
accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to the
use or occupancy of any structure.
   5.   Establishment of Floodplain (Overlay) District. The floodplain areas
within the jurisdiction of this chapter are hereby divided into the following
districts:
      A.   Floodplain (Overlay) District – those areas identified as Zone A on
the Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The boundaries shall be as shown on the
Official Floodplain Zoning Map. Within these districts, all uses not allowed as
permitted uses are prohibited unless a variance to the terms of this chapter is
granted after due consideration by the Board of Appeals.
   6.   Standards for Floodplain (Overlay) District.
      A.   Permitted Uses.
         (1)   All development within the Floodplain District shall be
permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance (or
underlying zoning district) and provided they meet applicable performance
standards of the Floodplain District.
         (2)   Any development which involves placement of structures, factory-
built homes, fill or other obstructions, storage of materials or equipment,
excavation, or alteration of a watercourse shall be reviewed by the Department
of Natural Resources to determine:
            a.   Whether the land involved is either wholly or partly within
the floodway or floodway fringe; and
            b.   The base flood elevation.
The applicant shall be responsible for providing the Department of Natural
Resources with sufficient technical information to make the determination.
         (3)   Review by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources is not
required for the proposed construction of new or replacement bridges or
culverts where:
            a.   The bridge or culvert is located on a stream that drains less
than two square miles, and
            b.   The bridge or culvert is not associated with a channel
modification that constitutes a channel change as specified in 567-71.2(2),
Iowa Administrative Code.
      B.   Performance Standards. All development must be consistent with the
need to minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance
standards. Where base flood elevations and floodway data have not been provided
in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be
contacted to compute such data. The applicant will be responsible for providing
the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to
make such determination. All development shall:
         (1)   Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement.
         (2)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
         (3)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are
resistant to flood damage.
      C.   Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved
residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation. Construction
shall be upon compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one
foot above the base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18
feet beyond the limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of
elevating (such as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed   where
existing topography, street grades, or other factors preclude elevating by
fill. In such cases, the methods used must be adequate to support the structure
as well as withstand the various forces and hazards associated with flooding.
All new residential structures located in areas that would become isolated due
to flooding of surrounding ground shall be provided with a means of access that
will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this
criterion shall not apply where the Administrator determines there is
sufficient flood warning time for the protection of life and property. When
estimating flood warning time, consideration shall be given to the criteria
listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa Administrative Code.
      D.   Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level. When
floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State
shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to withstand the
flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact, uplift forces, and other factors
associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the base flood
elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water. A record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in
relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
      E.   All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
         (1)   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
            a.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
            b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one-foot
above grade.
            c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic entry and exit
of floodwaters.
Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, and
low damage potential storage.
         (2)   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
         (3)   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed
with electric meter, electrical service panel box, hot water heater, heating,
air conditioning, ventilation equipment (including ductwork), and other similar
machinery and equipment elevated (or, in the case of nonresidential structures,
optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation.
         (4)   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed
with plumbing, gas lines, water meters, gas meters, and other similar service
utilities either elevated (or in the case of nonresidential structures,
optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation or designed to be watertight and withstand inundation to such a
level.
      F.   Factory-Built Homes.
         (1)   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes,
including those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions,
shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
structure is a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation.
         (2)   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes,
including those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions,
shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Anchorage
systems may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties
to ground anchors as required by the State Building Code.
      G.   Utility and Sanitary Systems.
         (1)   On-site wastewater disposal and water supply systems shall be
located or designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the
system during flooding.
         (2)   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system
as well as the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment
facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood
protection equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood elevation.
         (3)   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water
supply treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with
a level of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood
elevation.
         (4)   Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
      H.   Storage of Equipment and Materials. Storage of materials and
equipment that are flammable, explosive, or injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base
flood elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated
or:
         (1)   Not be subject to major flood damage and be anchored to prevent
movement due to flood waters; or
         (2)   Be readily removable from the area within the time available
after flood warning.
      I.   Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as
levees, flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the base
flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for
adequate interior drainage. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources
shall approve structural flood control works.
      J.   Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must
be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources must
approve such alterations or relocations.
      K.   Subdivisions. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and
subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the base flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50 lots
(whichever is less) shall include base flood elevation data for those areas
located within the Floodplain (Overlay) District.
      L.   Accessory Structures to Residential Uses.
         (1)   Detached garages, sheds, and similar structures that are
incidental to a residential use are exempt from the base flood elevation
requirements where the following criteria are satisfied:
            a.   The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential. Its size shall not exceed 600 square feet in size. Those portions of
the structure located less than one foot above the base flood elevation must be
constructed of flood-resistant materials.
            b.   The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage
potential purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure
shall not be used for human habitation.
            c.   The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building
site so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
            d.   The structure shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement which may result in damage to other structures.
            e.   The structure’s service facilities such as electrical and
heating equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above
the base flood elevation.
            f.   The structure’s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of Subsection 6(E)(1).
         (2)   Exemption from the base flood elevation requirements for such a
structure may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of
the structure and its contents.
      M.   Recreational Vehicles.
         (1)   Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of
Subsection 6(F) regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built homes when
the following criteria are satisfied.
            a.   The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less
than 180 consecutive days, and
            b.   The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
         (2)   Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than
180 consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements
of Subsection 6(F) regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built homes.
      N.   Pipeline Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be
buried in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to
prevent rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
      O.   Maximum Damage Potential Development. All new or substantially
improved maximum damage potential development shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated a minimum of one foot above the elevation of the
500-year flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be
floodproofed to such a level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional
engineer registered in the State shall certify that the floodproofing methods
used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact,
uplift forces, and other factors associated with the two-tenths percent annual
chance flood; and that the structure, below the two-tenths percent annual
chance flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator. Where a
two-tenths percent chance flood elevation data has not been provided in the
Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be
contacted to compute such data. The applicant will be responsible for providing
the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to
make such determinations.
   7.   Appointment and Duties of Board of Appeals.
      A.   Appointment and Duties of Board of Appeals. A Board of Appeals is
hereby established which shall hear and decide:
         (1)   Appeals; and
         (2)   Requests for variances to the provisions of this chapter, and
shall take any other action which is required of the Board.
      B.   Appeals. Where it is alleged that there is any error in any order,
requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in
the enforcement of this chapter, the aggrieved party may appeal such action.
The notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board of Appeals and with the
official from whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason
for the appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to
the Board of Appeals all the documents constituting the record upon which the
action appealed from was taken.
      C.   Variance. The Board of Appeals may authorize upon request in
specific cases such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be
contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary
hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.
         (1)   Variances shall only be granted upon:
            a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
            b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
            c.   A determination that the granting of the variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local codes or ordinances.
         (2)   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         (3)   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for structures than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that:
            a.   The issuance of a variance will result in increased premium
rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of
insurance coverage; and
            b.   Such construction increases risks to life and property.
         (4)   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of
the Department of Natural Resources.
      D.   Hearings and Decisions of the Board of Appeals.
         (1)   Hearings. Upon the filing with the Board of an appeal or a
request for a variance, the Board shall hold a public hearing. The Board shall
fix a reasonable time for the hearing and give public notice thereof, as well
as due notice to parties in interest. At the hearing, any party may appear in
person or by agent or attorney and present written or oral evidence. The Board
may require the appellant or applicant to provide such information as is
reasonably deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance or
evaluation of a professional engineer or other expert person or agency,
including the Department of Natural Resources.
         (2)   Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal or
variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an appeal, the Board may, so
long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter,
reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in
writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision.
In granting a variance, the Board shall consider such factors as contained in
this section and all other relevant sections of this chapter and may prescribe
such conditions as contained in Subsection 7(D)(2)(b).
            a.   Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board Shall Be Based.
In passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
            i.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights
or velocities caused by encroachments.
            ii.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
            iii.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the
ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary
conditions.
            iv.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            v.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the City.
            vi.   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
            vii.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to
flooding for the proposed use.
            viii.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing
development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
            ix.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for the area.
            x.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            xi.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.
            xii.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer,
gas, electrical, and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
            xiii.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of
this chapter.
            b.   Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the
factors listed above, the Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such
conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
            i.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
            ii.   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
            iii.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed
restrictions.
            iv.   Requirements for construction of channel modifications,
dikes, levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this chapter.
            v.   Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the
flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration,
rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated
with the regulatory flood. The Board shall require that the applicant submit a
plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
      E.   Appeals to the Court. Any person or persons, jointly or severally,
aggrieved by any decision of the Board may present to a court of record a
petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole
or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be
presented to the court within 30 days after the filing of the decision in the
office of the Board.
   8.   Nonconforming Uses.
      A.   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful
before the passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but
which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be
continued subject to the following conditions:
         (1)   If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any
future use of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
         (2)   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not
be entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
         (3)   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless
it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
State or local health, sanitary, building, or safety codes or regulations, or
the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
designation.
      B.   Except as provided in Subsection 8(A)(2), any use which has been
permitted as a variance shall be considered a conforming use.
   5.   Penalties for Violation. Violations of the provisions of this chapter
or failure to comply with any of the requirements (including violations of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variances)
shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails
to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined
not more than $500.00. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a
separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City from taking
such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy violation.
   6.   Amendments. The regulations and standards set forth in this chapter may
from time to time be amended, supplemented, changed, or repealed. No amendment,
supplement, change, or modification shall be undertaken without prior approval
of the Department of Natural Resources.

170.01   TITLE.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited and referred to as the
“Subdivision Ordinance” of the City of Waukon, Iowa.
170.02   PURPOSE AND INTENT.
The purpose of this chapter is to encourage orderly development of the City
community and to provide for the regulation and control of the extension of
public improvements, public services, and utilities, the improvement of land,
and the design of subdivisions, consistent with the Comprehensive Plan of the
City. To this end, this chapter establishes minimum standards for the design,
development, and improvement of new subdivisions and procedures for review and
approval of subdivision plans. This chapter is intended to provide for a
balance between the land use rights of individual landowners and the economic,
social, and environmental concerns of the public with respect to the use and
development of land in and near the City. This chapter is intended to impose a
subdivision plat requirement in many situations where State law does not or may
not impose such a requirement.
170.03   AUTHORITY.
These regulations are adopted pursuant to the authorization contained in
Chapter 354 of the Code of Iowa, as amended, and this chapter shall be applied
and interpreted consistently with the provisions of Chapter 354 of the Code of
Iowa, except where this chapter imposes more stringent requirements.
170.04   TERRITORIAL APPLICATION.
This chapter shall apply to subdivisions of and subdivision plats prepared for
any land located within the corporate limits of the City and, in addition, any
land located outside the corporate limits of the City, but within two miles
thereof, which is included within the following description:
The Southwest Quarter of Section 16, all of Section 17, all of Section 18, all
of Section 19, all of Section 20, the West Half of Section 21, the West Half of
Section 28, all of Section 29, all of Section 30, the West Half of Section 33,
all of Section 32, and all of Section 31, all in Township 98 North, Range 5
West of the 5th P.M.; the West Half of Section 4, all of Section 5, all of
Section 6, all of Section 7, and all of Section 8, all in Township 97 North,
Range 5 West of the 5th P.M.; the Northeast Quarter of Section 12 and all of
Section 1 in Township 97 North, Range 6 West of the 5th P.M.; and the Southeast

Section 25, the East Half of Section 35 and all of Section 36, all in Township
98 North, Range 6 West of the 5th P.M.; all of the above being in Allamakee
County, Iowa.
Subdivision regulation with respect to land located outside of the corporate
limits of the City as described above is hereby established under authority of
Section 354.9 of the Code of Iowa. The City reserves the right, by subsequent
ordinance, to expand its extraterritorial jurisdiction over subdivisions to the
maximum extent permitted by law.

      A.   “Street” or “road” means a right-of-way other than an alley
dedicated or otherwise legally established to be accepted for public use,
usually affording the principal means of access to abutting property. A street
may be designated as a street, highway, thoroughfare, parkway, avenue, road,
lane, drive, place, or other appropriate designation.
      B.   “Street, arterial” means an existing or proposed street which is or
would be planned to carry through-traffic on a continuous route through the
City, and is identified as such on the City’s street plan map in the
Comprehensive Plan.
      C.   “Street, collector” means a street intended to carry vehicular
traffic from local or minor streets to arterial streets or traffic generators.
      D.   “Street, local” means a street used primarily for access to abutting
property.
      E.   “Subdivider” means the proprietor of a tract or parcel of land who
divides or proposes to divide such tract or parcel in such a manner as to cause
or create a subdivision.
      F.   “Subdivision” means a tract or parcel of land divided or proposed to
be divided, either by repeated or simultaneous divisions, so as to cause there
to be three or more parcels within a single tract. The existence of a
subdivision shall be determined without regard to any of the following:
         (1)   Whether the divisions are carried out by the same or successive
owners of the tract or parcel,
         (2)   Whether any parcels resulting from the division are described by
metes and bounds, and
         (3)   Whether any plats of survey have been or are proposed to be
recorded for any of the parcels.
The existence of a subdivision shall be determined with reference to the
smallest tract of which the land divided or to be divided is a part, taking
into account any parcels created from the same tract by previous divisions but
disregarding any tract previously created from part of the same tract. If the
land to be divided constitutes a previously undivided tract, such tract shall
be deemed the “smallest tract” for purposes of the preceding sentence. If
contiguous tracts or parcels are subdivided simultaneously, all the land
involved may be treated as a single subdivision. A “minor subdivision” is a
subdivision resulting from (a) the simultaneous or repeated division of a tract
into three parcels or, (b) the repeated division of a tract into three or four
parcels within a five-year period. A “major subdivision” is a subdivision which
is not a “minor subdivision.” Unless otherwise stated or the context clearly
indicates otherwise, references to a “subdivision” in Section
170.15 shall mean a minor subdivision, references to a “subdivision” in
Sections
170.12,
170.13, and
170.14 shall mean a major subdivision, and references to a “subdivision” in any
other sections of this chapter shall mean both minor and major subdivisions.
      G.   “Subdivision plat” means the graphical representation of a
subdivision of land or all of that part of a subdivision of land owned by the
subdivider, prepared by a registered land surveyor, having a number or letter
designation for each lot within the plat and a succinct name or title that is
unique for Allamakee County, Iowa. Both “preliminary plats” and “final plats”
are subdivision plats. A subdivision plat shall cover only land owned by the
subdivider unless adjoining land owners are jointly subdividing their
properties.
      H.   “Surveyor” means a registered land surveyor who engages in the
practice of land surveying pursuant to Chapter 542B of the Code of Iowa.
   20.   Words beginning with “T.”
      A.   “Tract” means an aliquot part of a section or a lot within an
official plat. For purposes of determining the existence of a subdivision, a
tract located within a larger tract shall not be considered a part or division
of the larger tract.
   21.   Words beginning with “U.”
   22.   Words beginning with “V.”
   23.   Words beginning with “W.”
   24.   Words beginning with “X.”

170.06   SUBDIVISION PLAT REQUIREMENT.
Except as provided in this section, a subdivision plat shall be made and
recorded when a subdivision is caused or created. Unless required by State law,
a subdivision plat is not required when land is divided by any of the
following:
   1.   A conveyance to a governmental entity or agency for public improvement
purposes.
   2.   Any conveyance by a governmental entity or agency.
   3.   A plat of survey of land owned by a governmental entity or agency.
   4.   A boundary adjustment conveyance. For purposes of this section, a
“boundary adjustment conveyance” means a transfer of ownership by the owner of
a tract or parcel to the owner of an adjoining tract or parcel of land located
along the common boundary between their respective properties, provided that
the total quantity of land thus transferred by present or former owners of
either tract or parcel does not exceed 1,500 square feet within any five-year
period; and, provided further, that no tract or parcel is by such transfer
reduced in size in violation of the provisions of Section
165.07(5) of the zoning ordinance.
170.07   COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT.
The subdivision of land located within the territory to which this chapter
applies shall be governed by this chapter and every subdivider of land shall
comply with the requirements of this chapter. However, the provisions of this
chapter shall apply to auditor’s plats which are also subdivision plats only to
the extent consistent with the provisions of Chapter 354 of the Code of Iowa.
In addition to other remedies or penalties prescribed by law, the provisions of
this chapter shall be enforced as follows:
   1.   Recording Prohibited. No subdivision plat or any other document causing
or creating a subdivision of land shall be recorded in the office of the
Allamakee County Recorder, nor shall any such plat or subdivision have any
validity in the absence of compliance with the provisions of this chapter,
including approval or waiver of review by resolution of the Council as
prescribed herein.
   2.   Public Improvements. If a subdivision plat or other document causing or
creating a subdivision of land is recorded in violation of this chapter, no
streets or other public use areas within the subdivided land shall be
recognized by the City or deemed accepted by the Council for public use, nor
shall any City funds be expended for public improvements, maintenance, or other
services within the subdivided land; nor shall any public funds be expended for
such purposes with respect to subdivision plats approved in accordance with
this chapter until all public improvements required as a condition of such
approval have been installed, inspected, and accepted by the Council unless
otherwise provided in an agreement entered into pursuant to Section
170.24(1)(D) of this chapter.
   3.   Municipal Infraction. It is a municipal infraction for any proprietor
to violate any provision of this chapter.
   4.   Action to Annul Plat. If a subdivision plat is filed and recorded in
violation of this chapter, the Council, after filing written notice with the
proprietors who have joined in the acknowledgment of the plat or their
successors in interest, may institute a suit in equity in district court for
annulment of the plat pursuant to Section 354.20 of the Code of Iowa.
170.08   AMENDMENTS.
The subdivision regulations contained in this chapter may be amended from, time
to time, by the Council. Such amendments as may be proposed shall first be
submitted to the Commission for study and recommendation. The Commission shall
report its recommendation to the Council within 30 days of receipt of the
proposal. Prior to action on the proposed amendment, the Council shall give
notice of the proposed amendment and hold a public hearing thereon. Any
amendment to this chapter altering its territorial application shall be
recorded with the County Recorder.
170.09   VARIANCES AND WAIVER OF REVIEW.
   1.   Limited Variance. Where the strict application of standards or
requirements established by this chapter would clearly cause substantial
hardship or impose unreasonable restrictions on the development of a tract of
land because of natural or physical conditions or limitations not created by
the owner or developer, the Commission may recommend, and the Council may
grant, such variances from the standards or requirements imposed by this
chapter as may be necessary to permit the reasonable development of the land
while preserving the intent of these subdivision regulations. However, unless
the right to review is waived as provided in Subsection 2 of this section, the
plat attachment requirements specified in Paragraphs A, B, C, D, and H of
Section
170.17(2) are not subject to variance.
   2.   Waiver of Right to Review. In appropriate cases where, because of its
minimal scope, a proposed subdivision will have no appreciable impact on
community development or the provision of public improvements or services, the
Commission or the plat review agent may recommend, and the Council may grant a
complete waiver of the right to review a subdivision plat. A waiver of the
right to review shall constitute the grant of a variance of all standards and
requirements imposed by this chapter except the final plat attachments
specified in Paragraphs A, B, C, D, and H of Section
170.17(2) which shall not be subject to waiver if the plat includes any areas
or improvements to be dedicated to the public.
   3.   Exceptions. In addition to the exceptions set forth in Subsections 1
and 2 of this section, the provisions of Section
170.11 relating to fees and the provisions of Sections
170.12 and
170.15 relating to the filing of preliminary applications and plat copies shall
not be subject to variance or waiver.
170.10   REVIEW BEFORE RECORDING.
No plat of survey, conveyance, or other instrument which, if recorded, would
cause any division of any tract or parcel shall be recorded in the office of
the County Recorder until it has been reviewed by the plat review agent of the
City and the plat review agent has certified in writing that such instrument
will not cause or create a subdivision for which a subdivision plat is
required. The following procedures shall apply:
   1.   Submission to Plat Review Agent. The proprietor of the land affected by
the instrument may submit the instrument to the plat review agent before
delivery of the instrument to the County Recorder. If the instrument is
delivered to the County Recorder without a certification by the plat review
agent affixed thereto, the County Recorder shall, by not later than the next
business day, deliver the instrument to the plat review agent.
   2.   Determination by Plat Review Agent. The plat review agent shall, by the
end of the second business day following receipt of the instrument, review the
instrument and any relevant public records and determine whether or not the
instrument would cause or create a subdivision for which a subdivision plat is
required.
   3.   Written Decision. The decision of the plat review agent shall be in
writing. If a subdivision plat is not required, the plat review agent shall so
certify, either on the face of the instrument or by attaching a certification
to the instrument, and shall promptly deliver the instrument to the County
Recorder. If a subdivision plat is required, written notification shall be
delivered to the proprietor with the instrument.
   4.   No Fee. No fee shall be charged or collected for the determination by
the plat review agent under this section.
   5.   Appeal. If the plat review agent determines that a subdivision plat is
required, the proprietor may appeal the decision to the Council which shall
either affirm or overrule the plat review agent’s decision.
This section shall not apply to subdivision plats presented for recording
together with the resolution of the Council approving or waiving the right to
review the subdivision plat as provided in this chapter.
170.11   FEES.
A subdivision plat approval application fee, which shall not be refundable,
shall be paid by the proprietor upon submission of any preliminary plat. The
amount of the fees for major and minor subdivisions shall be determined by
resolution of the Council. No action shall be taken by any City official
regarding a subdivision approval application, nor shall an application or plat
be considered filed, until the applicable fee is paid.
170.12   PRELIMINARY PLATTING PROCEDURE.
Every proprietor seeking Council approval for a proposed subdivision plat shall
file a preliminary plat in accordance with this section and other sections of
this chapter applicable to preliminary plats. Preliminary platting procedure is
as follows:
   1.   Pre-application Coordination. Prior to the filing of a preliminary
plat, the subdivider or agent of the subdivider shall consult with the City’s
designated plat review agent for the purpose of receiving general information
about any City plans, zoning regulations, or other factors so as to avoid
unnecessary difficulty and time delays for the subdivider and facilitate the
plat review. No formal plat or filing fee is required for this step. For simple
plats a telephone contact may be all that is necessary. Copies of this chapter
shall be furnished upon request to any potential subdivider and other
interested persons.
   2.   Preliminary Plat Filed. The proprietor of any tract or parcel of land
to be subdivided shall cause a preliminary plat to be prepared in conformity
with the requirements of Section
170.16 of this chapter and shall file 13 copies of the plat with the Clerk. The
proprietor, or his or her agent, shall also complete and file an application
for preliminary subdivision plat approval, on a form supplied by the Clerk, and
pay the subdivision plat approval application fee. The Clerk shall immediately
transmit three copies of the preliminary plat and application to the Commission
and one copy of the plat and application to each of the following: the City
plat review agent, the City Engineer, the heads of the City Water and Sewer,
Street, Fire, Police, and Parks and Recreation Departments, and each electric,
gas, and telephone utility company serving the City.
   3.   Review.
      A.   The Clerk’s letter of transmittal to the utility companies shall
request their review of the plat regarding utility locations and easements and
the submission of their findings and recommendations to the Commission within
15 days of receipt.
      B.   The City plat review agent shall examine the plat to determine its
compliance with the requirements of this chapter, the City’s Comprehensive Plan
and other applicable regulations, and its conformity with sound subdivision
practices, and shall, within 15 days of receipt of the plat, submit his or her
findings and recommendations to the Commission.
      C.   The City Engineer shall also review the plat and submit any comments
he or she may have to the Commission within 15 days of receipt of the plat.
   4.   Action by Commission. The Commission, as soon as possible after receipt
of the report of the plat review agent, but not more than 30 days thereafter,
shall review the preliminary plat, consider the report and recommendations of
the plat review agent, negotiate with the subdivider on changes deemed
advisable and the kind and extent of improvements to be made by the subdivider,
and shall make a determination upon the preliminary plat as originally
submitted or as modified by the subdivider. If the Commission does not act
within 30 days from receipt of the plat review agent’s report, the preliminary
plat shall be deemed to be approved without conditions; provided, however, the
subdivider may agree in writing to an extension of the time for action by the
Commission not to exceed an additional 60 days. The determination made by the
Commission shall be in writing and shall state whether the preliminary plat is
approved, conditionally approved, or disapproved. In the alternative, the
Commission may recommend waiver of the right to review as provided in Paragraph
D, below.
      A.   Approval. Approval, without conditions, of a preliminary plat by the
Commission shall be deemed the equivalent of approval by the Commission of a
final plat. Any such unconditional approval of a preliminary plat by the
Commission shall also set forth any recommendations with respect to variance of
the requirements of this chapter in connection with such plat. However, the
final plat attachments required under Paragraphs A, B, C, D, and H of Section
170.17(2) are not subject to variance and the Commission shall not grant
unconditional approval of a preliminary plat absent compliance with such
requirements.
      B.   Disapproval. If a preliminary plat is disapproved, the Commission
shall set forth in writing its reasons for disapproval. If a preliminary plat
is disapproved, the subdivider may file a new preliminary plat in the same
manner as the original preliminary plat or may, within six months of such
disapproval by the Commission, file an application for final plat approval with
the Clerk as provided in Section
170.13.
      C.   Conditional Approval. If the Commission approves the preliminary
plat subject to conditions, all conditions shall be set forth in writing. A
decision by the Commission to conditionally approve a preliminary plat shall be
reviewed by the Council within 30 days. Upon such review by the Council of the
conditions imposed, the decision of the Commission shall be affirmed or
modified by motion. If the conditions are modified, the Council shall specify
the changes. If all conditions are eliminated by the Council upon its review,
the preliminary plat shall be deemed to be approved without conditions, the
same as if such action had been taken by the Commission as provided in
Paragraph A of this subsection. Conditional approval of a preliminary plat
shall constitute an authorization to proceed with the preparation of a final
plat which satisfies the conditions imposed. If the subdivider elects to seek
final approval by the Council of the plat without compliance with the
conditions imposed, an application for final plat approval shall be filed with
the Clerk within six months as provided in Section
170.13.
      D.   Waiver of Review. Where the conditions described in Section
170.09(2) are found to exist, the Commission may, in lieu of approval or
disapproval of the preliminary plat, recommend that the right to review the
plat be waived by the Council. Where such a recommendation is made by the
Commission, the subdivider shall file an application for final plat approval
with the Clerk within six months as provided in Section
170.13.
Action by the Commission to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove a
preliminary plat, or to recommend waiver of the right to review, shall be set
forth in a resolution which shall contain, where applicable, the reasons for
disapproval of the preliminary plat, all conditions imposed and any variances
from the requirements of this chapter recommended by the Commission. Copies of
such resolution, together with a copy of the Council’s motion modifying any
conditional approval, if applicable, shall be attached to three copies of the
preliminary plat. One copy of the plat and resolution shall be returned to the
subdivider and the other copies retained by the Commission.
170.13   FINAL PLATTING PROCEDURE AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL.
A subdivider desiring final plat approval by the Council shall file with the
Clerk, on a form provided by the Clerk, an application for final plat approval.
However, no such application shall be accepted or shall be deemed filed unless
the subdivider has first complied with the preliminary platting procedure as
set forth in Section
170.12. The application shall be accompanied by seven copies of the final plat
and all required attachments. Upon filing of the application for final plat
approval, the following regulations and procedures shall apply:
   1.   Time Limits. An application for final plat approval must be filed with
the Clerk within the following time limits after action by the Commission on
the preliminary plat:
      A.   If conditionally approved by the Commission and subdivider complies
with conditions, 18 months.
      B.   If conditionally approved and subdivider elects to seek final
approval without compliance with conditions, six months.
      C.   If approved without conditions, six months.
      D.   If disapproved and subdivider elects to seek final approval without
Commission approval, six months.
      E.   If waiver of right to review recommended by Commission, six months.
If the subdivider fails to file the application for final plat approval within
the applicable time limit, the action taken by the Commission, on the
preliminary plat shall be deemed null and void unless an extension of time has
been applied for and granted by the Commission. If the action of the Commission
is nullified in this manner, the subdivider’s application for final plat
approval shall be returned without further action and the subdivider shall be
obligated to again comply with the requirements of Section
170.12.
   2.   Action Without Commission Approval. If the preliminary plat was
disapproved by the Commission or if the subdivider has elected, following
conditional approval, to seek final plat approval without compliance with the
conditions, the Clerk shall refer the application and final plat directly to
the Council for action pursuant to Subsection 6 of this section, together with
a copy of the Commission resolution setting forth the action previously taken
by the Commission.
   3.   Prior Commission Approval or Waiver. If the preliminary plat has
previously been approved without conditions by the Commission or if the
Commission recommended waiver of the right to review, the Clerk shall refer the
application and final plat directly to the Council for action pursuant to
Subsection 6 of this section, together with a copy of the Commission resolution
setting forth the action previously taken by the Commission.
   4.   Prior Conditional Approval. If the preliminary plat has previously
received the conditional approval of the Commission, and the subdivider has not
elected to seek Council approval without compliance with the conditions
imposed, the Clerk shall transmit five copies of the final plat and all
required attachments to the Commission for its final recommendation.
   5.   Action by Commission. The Commission shall, upon receiving the final
plat, as soon as practicable but not more than 30 days after the filing of the
application for final plat approval, consider the final plat and make a
determination by resolution whether to recommend approval or disapproval of the
final plat by the Council. The Commission shall not recommend approval if all
conditions previously imposed have not been satisfied. A recommendation of
approval shall constitute a recommendation that the Council grant a variance
for any requirements of this chapter not previously complied with. A copy of
the Commission’s resolution setting forth its recommendation shall be promptly
submitted to the Council.
   6.   Action by Council. Upon receipt of the resolution of the Commission as
provided in the preceding subsection, but not later than 60 days after the
filing of the application for final plat approval, the Council shall, by
resolution, approve the final plat, disapprove the final plat, or waive the
right of the Council to review the final plat.
      A.   In the event a plat is disapproved by the Council, the resolution
disapproving the plat shall state how the plat is objectionable. The resolution
disapproving a plat may set forth the conditions upon which final approval
would be given which may, without limitation, include the installation of
designated public improvements or the filing of a satisfactory performance bond
guaranteeing subsequent installation of any public improvements.
      B.   In the event the plat is found to be acceptable, the Council shall
approve the same. Such approval shall constitute a variance as to any
requirements of this chapter with which there has not been compliance. However,
unless the right to review the plat is waived as provided in Section
170.09(2), the plat attachment requirements specified in Paragraphs A, B, C, D,
and H of Section
170.17(2) are not subject to variance.
      C.   The Council may waive the right to review the plat in accordance
with the provisions of Section
170.09.
      D.   If the Council approves the final plat or waives its right to review
it, the Council’s resolution shall contain a general approval and acceptance of
all land within the plat that is dedicated for public use. If the Council
concludes that any land dedicated for street purposes shall not presently be
open for public access for safety reasons, the resolution shall so state.
      E.   In all cases, a certified copy of the Council’s resolution shall be
furnished to the subdivider.
   7.   Reconsideration by Council. If the Council disapproves a plat, the
subdivider may, within one year from such disapproval, request reconsideration
by the Council without the necessity of compliance with Section
170.12 of this chapter.
   8.   Recording of Plat. It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to
cause the recording of any plat which has been approved by the Council, or as
to which the right of review has been waived, together with the resolution of
the Council, with the County Recorder. Satisfactory evidence of the recording
of the plat and resolution shall be filed with the Clerk and the plat shall not
be recognized as effective by the City until such proof of recording is
received.
   9.   Assistance of Plat Review Agent. The Commission and the Council shall,
in considering any final plat, request the comments of the City plat review
agent concerning such final plat.
170.14   PLATS OUTSIDE CORPORATE LIMITS.
The procedure for approval of preliminary and final plats of land outside of
the corporate limits of the City but within the territorial application of this
chapter shall be the same as set out in Sections
170.12 and
170.13, except that nine copies of the preliminary plat shall be filed with the
Clerk and the Clerk shall, in addition, refer one copy to the County Engineer
and one copy to the County Planning and Zoning Commission and request that
their recommendations, if any, be submitted to the Commission. In such cases,
the Commission shall makes its determination regarding the preliminary plat
within 45 days after receipt of the report of the City’s plat review agent, but
shall not act prior to receiving the recommendations of the County Planning and
Zoning Commission unless such recommendations are not received by the
Commission within 15 days of referral.
170.15   MINOR SUBDIVISION PROCEDURES.
Minor subdivisions shall, except as otherwise provided in this section, be
exempt from the plat review and approval procedure set forth in Sections
170.12,
170.13, and
170.14 of this chapter, but the following procedures and requirements shall
apply to minor subdivision plats:
   1.   Pre-application Coordination. Prior to filing a plat and approval
application the proprietor, or his or her agent, shall consult with the City’s
designated plat review agent for the purpose of receiving general information
about any relevant City plans, zoning regulations, requirements of this
chapter, and other factors so as to avoid unnecessary difficulty and delays and
facilitate the plat review. No formal plat or filing fee is required for this
step. For simple plats a telephone contact may be sufficient. Copies of this
chapter shall be furnished upon request to any potential subdivider and other
interested persons.
   2.   Plat Preparation. The proprietor of the tract or parcel of land to be
subdivided shall cause a single plat to be prepared which complies with the
requirements of both Section
170.16 and Section
170.17 of this chapter, including required attachments.
   3.   Application, Plat Copies and Fee. The proprietor, or his or her, agent
shall complete and file with the Clerk an application for preliminary
subdivision plat approval on a form supplied by the Clerk. Nine copies of the
proposed plat shall be filed with the application and the application fee shall
also be paid. No application or plat shall be deemed filed until there is full
compliance with this subsection.
   4.   Plat Review and Referral by Agent. The Clerk shall promptly refer the
plat and application to the City’s designated plat review agent who shall
review the plat to determine conformation with the City’s Comprehensive Plan,
as amended, street and utility plans, zoning patterns and standards, addressing
block plan, other development factors and the applicable provisions of this
chapter. The review agent’s review of the plat shall be completed within 10
days of the filing of the plat and application and payment of the application
fee. The review agent shall set forth his or her recommendations concerning the
plat in writing and a copy shall be delivered to the plat proprietor or agent.
Except as provided in Subsection 5 of this section, the plat review agent shall
at the same time refer the plat and application and the review agent’s
recommendations to the Council for action at the next Council meeting pursuant
to Subsection 6 of this section.
   5.   Commission Consideration. The plat review agent shall have discretion
to refer the plat and application and the agent’s recommendations to the
Commission instead of to the Council. Referral to the Commission may be made
whenever, in the judgment of the plat review agent, the plat or its attachments
disclose apparent or potential conflict or nonconformity with the City’s
Comprehensive Plan, street and utility plans, zoning patterns or standards,
addressing block plan, other development factors or the requirements of this
chapter, or otherwise involve or suggest significant implications for City
development requiring more extensive review or discussion, or negotiation with
the subdivider. In the event of a referral to the Commission under this
subsection, all of the procedures and requirements relating to major
subdivisions set forth in Section
170.12(4) and Section
170.13 shall become applicable, except that the filing of a final plat and an
application for final plat approval shall not be required if the Commission
approves the plat without conditions or recommends waiver of the right to
review the plat.
   6.   Council Action. If the subdivision plat, application, and the
recommendations of the plat review agent are referred to the Council by the
agent pursuant to Subsection 4 of this section, the plat shall be considered
and acted upon by the Council at the first regular Council meeting following
the referral. The Council shall, by resolution, approve the plat, disapprove
the plat, or waive the right to review the plat.
      A.   If the Council approves the plat or waives the right to review it,
the Council’s resolution shall contain an approval and acceptance of all land
within the plat that is dedicated for public use. If the Council concludes that
any land dedicated for street purposes shall not presently be open for public
access for safety reasons, the resolution shall so state.
      B.   The approval of a plat by the Council shall constitute a variance as
to any requirements of this chapter with which there has not been compliance.
However, the Council shall not approve a plat absent compliance with the plat
attachment requirements set forth in Paragraphs A, B, C, D, and H of Section
170.17(2).
      C.   The waiver of the right to review by the Council shall also
constitute a variance as to any requirements of this chapter with which there
has not been compliance. However, if the plat contains areas or improvements to
be dedicated to the public the right to review shall not be waived absent
compliance with the plat attachment requirements set forth in Paragraphs A, B,
C, D and H of Section
170.17(2).
      D.   If a plat is disapproved by the Council, the resolution shall state
how the plat is objectionable and may set forth the conditions upon which
approval would be given which may, without limitation, include the installation
of designated public improvements or the filing of a satisfactory performance
bond guaranteeing subsequent installation.
   7.   Reconsideration. A subdivision plat which has been disapproved by the
Council may be resubmitted directly to the Council for reconsideration within
one year from the date of disapproval without the necessity of a new
application and fee. The Council may delay action on the resubmitted plat in
order to secure the recommendations of the plat review agent but shall, by
resolution, approve, disapprove, or waive the right to review such plat.
   8.   Certified Copy. In all cases, a certified copy of each Council
resolution concerning a plat shall be furnished to the subdivider.
   9.   Recordation. Plats shall be recorded by the subdivider as provided in
Section
170.13(8).
   10.   Applicable Requirements. All design standards and other requirements
set forth in Sections
170.18 through
170.24 of this chapter shall be applicable to minor subdivisions. The scale of
the plat shall be as determined by the surveyor, subject to State law
requirements.
170.16   PRELIMINARY PLAT REQUIREMENTS.
The preliminary plat and its attachments shall contain the following
information:
   1.   Location Map. A location map showing:
      A.   The subdivision name.
      B.   An outline of the area to be subdivided.
      C.   The existing streets and public or private utilities, if any, on
adjoining property.
      D.   North point and scale.
      E.   Adjacent land use.

      B.   New plats shall make provisions for continuation and extension of
arterial and collector streets and roads, and the extension of local streets
where judged necessary by the Commission or the Council.
      C.   Alleys shall be provided where judged necessary by the Commission or
the Council.
      D.   Where parkways or special types of streets are proposed, the
Commission or the Council may apply special standards for the design of such
parkways or streets.
      E.   Proposed streets that are extensions of or in alignment with
existing streets shall bear the name of the existing streets.
      F.   Half streets shall be prohibited except where essential to the
reasonable development of the subdivision and adjoining tract, and where the
Commission or the Council finds it reasonable to require dedication of the
other half when the adjoining tract is subdivided. Wherever a half street is
adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be
platted within such tract.
   2.   Right-of-way. Minimum rights-of-way shall be provided as follows:
      A.   Arterial Streets - 66 feet minimum. Greater width may be required in
accordance with City, County or State plans.

all streets shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned
streets, to topographic conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in
their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by
such streets.
      B.   The arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either provide for
the continuation from appropriate projection of existing principal streets in
surrounding areas or conform to a plat for the neighborhood approved by the
Commission or the Council to meet a particular situation where topographical or
other conditions make continuance or conformance to existing streets
impracticable.
   5.   Future Streets and Planned Streets.
      A.   Where the plat submitted covers only a part of a larger tract of
land owed by the same proprietor, a sketch of the prospective future street
system for the adjacent land shall be furnished, and the street system of the
part submitted shall be considered in conjunction with the projected street
system of the part not submitted.
      B.   Where the lots to be created by the subdivision are larger than
ordinary building lots, the subdivision shall be so designed as to allow for
the opening of major streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent minor
streets.
      C.   Plats containing unplatted strips or private streets controlling
access to public ways will not receive approval.
   6.   Minor Streets. Minor streets shall be so planned as to discourage
through traffic.
   7.   Frontage Streets.
      A.   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
arterial street, the Commission or the Council may require marginal access
streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a non-access
reservation along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys,
or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of
residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
      B.   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a stream corridor, or
utility or highway right-of-way, the Commission or the Council may require a
street approximately parallel to and on each side of such corridor or right-of-
way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land,
such as for park purposes in residential districts, or for commercial or
industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances shall also be
determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future
grade separations.
   8.   Street Geometrics.
      A.   Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be
avoided.
      B.   A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse
curves on arterial and collector streets.
      C.   Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed 600 feet in length.
      D.   Proposed streets shall be adjusted to the contour of the land where
possible so as to produce usable lots and streets of reasonable gradient.
      E.   No dead-end streets or alleys, other than cul-de-sacs, will be
permitted except at subdivision boundaries.
      F.   Arterial and collector streets in a subdivision shall extend through
the boundaries thereof.
      G.   Intersection of more than two streets at a point shall not be
permitted.
      H.   When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one
point by more than 10 degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius
adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than 200 feet for minor and
collector streets, and of such greater radii as the Commission or the Council
shall determine for special cases.
   9.   Intersections.
      A.   Insofar as in practical, acute angles between streets at their
intersection are to be avoided.
      B.   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible
at right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at less than 60
degrees.
      C.   Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a
radius of 20 feet, or of a greater radius where the Commission or the Council
may deem it necessary. The Commission or the Council may permit comparable
cutoffs or chords in place of rounded corners.
   10.   Street Names. Streets that are in alignment with other already
existing streets shall bear the name of the existing streets. The proposed
names of new streets shall not duplicate or sound similar to existing street
names. Street names shall be subject to the approval of the Council.
   11.   Street Grades.
      A.   Street grades, wherever feasible, shall not exceed five percent,
with due allowance for reasonable vertical curves.
      B.   No street grade shall be less than one-half of one percent.
   12.   Alleys.
      A.   Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts,
except that the Council may waive this requirement where other definite and
assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading,
unloading, and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed.
      B.   Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable,
shall be provided with adequate turn-around facilities at the dead-end, as
determined by the Commission or the Council.
170.19   DESIGN STANDARDS FOR BLOCKS.
No block may be more than 1,000 feet or less than 440 feet in length between
the center lines of intersecting streets, except that these limits may be
waived by the Council where extraordinary conditions unquestionably justify a
departure. Block layout and length shall conform to the extent practicable to
the Waukon Addressing Plan Map on file in the Clerk’s office.
170.20   DESIGN STANDARDS FOR LOTS. . Lot design standards shall be as follows:
   1.   The lot size, width, depth, shape, and orientation shall be appropriate
for the location and terrain of the subdivision and for the type of development
and use contemplated.
   2.   Minimum lot dimensions and sizes shall conform to the requirements of
the zoning ordinance applicable to the zoning district in which the subdivision
is or will be located, subject to the following:
      A.   Residential lots, where not served by public sewer, shall not be
less than 120 feet wide nor less than one acre in area.
      B.   Depth and width of lots reserved or platted for commercial and
industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service and
parking facilities required by the type of use and development contemplated.
   3.   The subdivision shall be designed to provide each lot with satisfactory
access, by means of a public street, to an existing or planned public street.
   4.   Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except where
essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic
arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. A
planting screen easement of at least 10 feet, across which there shall be no
right of access, shall be provided along the line of lots abutting such a
traffic artery or other disadvantageous use.
   5.   All lots shall abut on a public street. Corner lots which abut on an
arterial or collector street shall have minimum radius of 20 feet at the
intersection.
   6.   Side lines of lots shall approximate right angles to straight street
lines and radial angles to curved street lines except where a variation will
provide better lot layout.
170.21   DESIGN STANDARDS FOR SIDEWALKS.
The design standards for sidewalks in subdivisions are those set forth in
Chapter 136 of this Code of Ordinances.
170.22   DESIGN STANDARDS FOR EASEMENTS.

   1.   Lot Line Easements. Easements for general utility purposes not less
than 10 feet in width shall be provided along the rear lot line of each lot and
along such other lot lines as may be required for public and private utilities,
or for drainage purposes. If for any reason the property adjoining a lot
subject to an easement required under this subsection is not subject to a
similar easement, the easements required by this subsection shall be not less
than 20 feet in width.
   2.   Major Utilities and Drainage Easements. Easements of greater than 20
feet in width may be required for trunk lines, pressure lines, open drainage
courses and retention ponds or high voltage lines, and shall be provided as
determined by the utility or the Council.
   3.   Utility Easements Generally. Unless otherwise clearly indicated in the
plat, all designated utility easements shall convey to the City, its successors
and assigns, the perpetual right within the designated easement area to
construct, reconstruct, install, operate, maintain, and remove sanitary sewers,
storm sewers, water mains, and electric, telephone, gas, and cable television
lines consisting of above-or-below ground pipes, conduits, cables, poles,
wires, anchors, and necessary appurtenances, including the right to trim or
remove vegetation within such easement area where necessary to secure a
clearance of not less than four feet from wires or poles, together with the
right to extend to any telephone, gas, telegraph, cable television, electric,
or other private utility company, the right to use, separately or jointly with
the City, the areas included in the easement for the purposes above enumerated.
   4.   Natural Drainage Easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a water
course, drainage way, channel or stream, there shall be provided and dedicated
to the City a storm water easement or drainage right-of-way conforming
substantially with the lines of such water course, together with such
additional width as may be necessary for purposes of access, construction,
widening, deepening, sloping, improving, maintaining or protecting the stream
or drainage course, and for stormwater retention. The subdivider shall provide
for adequate drainage of the area of the proposed subdivision in a manner
acceptable to the City and consistent with natural drainage patterns and City
drainage plans, policies, and ordinances. All plats shall show the nature of
and the boundary lines of any areas or facilities planned or required for the
retention of water runoff from the property being platted.
170.23   PLAT MARKERS AND SURVEY MONUMENTS.
Markers shall be placed at all block corners, angle points, points of curves in
streets, and all such intermediate points as shall be required by the City. The
markers shall be of such material, size, and length as may be approved by the
City.
170.24   IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.
   1.   Completion of Improvements. All required improvements shall be
installed and constructed in accordance with the specifications established by
the Council by ordinance or otherwise and under the supervision of the Council
and its agents and to its satisfaction. The specific location, capacity, and
timing for the construction and placement of required improvements shall be
determined by the Commission in the preliminary platting process unless
subsequently modified by the Council. The subdivider shall install and
construct all improvements required by this chapter prior to final approval of
the subdivision plat by the Council unless one of the following applies:
      A.   The Council waives its right to review the plat.
      B.   A variance from the requirements of this section is granted by the
Council in granting final approval for the plat.
      C.   Prior to final action by the Council on the subdivision plat or
prior to any reconsideration thereof following disapproval, the subdivider has,
with the approval of the Council, secured a performance bond with corporate
surety guaranteeing completion of all required improvements within one year,
and such bond has been approved by the City Attorney and filed with the Clerk.
      D.   Prior to final action by the Council on the plat, or prior to any
reconsideration thereof by the Council following disapproval, the City and the
subdivider have entered into an agreement which, in the opinion of the Council,
provides adequate assurance that all required improvements will be constructed
within a reasonable time and establishes a funding mechanism for the cost of
such improvements. Such an agreement may include provisions for the
establishment of an escrow fund whereby some portion of the proceeds from
future lot sales may be reserved and used for construction costs, and/or for
the use of special assessments, and such other terms as to which the parties
may agree. However, such an agreement shall not permit the delay of any
required water and sewer utility improvements which may be delayed until after
final plat approval only pursuant to Paragraph C of this subsection relating to
performance bonds. This paragraph does not create any duty on the part of the
City to enter into an agreement of the type authorized herein.
   2.   Street Grades. All streets and alleys within the platted area which are
dedicated for public use shall be brought to the grade approved by the
Commission after receiving the report and recommendations of the City Engineer.

included within the subdivision; provided, however, that variances may be
approved pursuant to Section
170.09 of this chapter for those areas where it is not practical or necessary
to place sidewalks.
   6.   Water Mains and Service Lines. Where a public water main is reasonably
accessible, the subdivider shall connect with such water main and provide a
water connection for each lot within the subdivision, with a service line
installed to the property line of each lot, in accordance with the standards
and procedures specified in
Chapter 90 of this Code of Ordinances.
   7.   Sanitary Sewer Mains and Building Drains. Where a public sanitary sewer
main is reasonably accessible, the subdivider shall connect with such main and

recreation purposes, but such reservation shall not exceed 10 percent of the
gross area of the subdivision. Such park and recreation land shall be located
so as to be coordinated with other lands which are or may be available for
inclusion as a part of a single neighborhood park. No parcel of land reserved
for such purpose shall be less than 15,000 square feet in area. The dedication
of such land to the public for such purposes may be required, with or without
compensation by the City, or such land may be reserved and an option granted to
the City to acquire the same within three years from the date of recording of
the plat.
   9.   Storm Sewer and Land Drainage. Existing storm sewer mains shall be
extended into the new subdivision areas where drainage conditions make it
feasible to do so. Where storm sewer mains do not exist on adjacent property,
or it is not feasible to extend the same into the new subdivision, the runoff
from the new subdivision shall be accommodated by whatever other means may be
necessary and practical, including open water ways, retention ponds or other
devices. The development of the subdivision shall be accompanied by the
necessary site grading and stormwater disposal so as not to create on-site
ponding or nuisance problems, nor the creation of drainage or flooding problems
on adjacent land. The nature, location, and specifications for storm sewer
mains and other drainage improvements shall be determined on a case-by-case
basis following review and recommendations by the City Engineer.
   10.   Streetlights. The location and number of street light installations
shall be determined on a case-by-case basis, after review and recommendations
by the electric utility. Street light poles and fixtures shall be provided by
the subdivider if different from the standard installation by the utility
company. Street light wiring shall be placed underground for new residential
subdivisions unless determined impractical or unfeasible by the electric
utility.
170.25   AUDITOR’S PLATS.
   1.   An auditor’s plat, prepared pursuant to Chapter 354 of the Code of
Iowa, and filed with the Clerk pursuant to Chapter 354 of the Code of Iowa,
shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter except for this section.
   2.   If the auditor’s plat conforms to the requirements of Chapter 355 of
the Code of Iowa, the Council shall, within 60 days of the date of filing,
approve the plat by resolution and certify the resolution to be recorded with
the plat.
   3.   The resolution approving the auditor’s plat shall state whether the
lots within the auditor’s plat meet the standards and conditions established by
this chapter for subdivision lots.
   4.   The approval of an auditor’s plat by the Council shall not impose any
liability upon the City to accept dedication of any public use areas within the
land included in the plat nor shall such approval impose any liability on the
City to install or maintain any public improvements or utilities within the
platted area; provided, however, that the Council may, at its option, in the
approving resolution, accept the dedication of any areas designated for public
use.
   5.   Approval of an auditor’s plat by the Council shall not constitute a
waiver of the requirements of this chapter.
170.26   PLAT REVIEW AGENT.
The Zoning Administrator shall serve as the plat review agent. In such
capacity, this officer shall perform all duties assigned to the plat review
agent in this chapter and shall, in general, administer and enforce the
