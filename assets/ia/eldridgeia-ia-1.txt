      (3)   The city shall conduct a public proceeding to determine whether or
not the rates or proposed rate increase are reasonable. The city may delegate

   There is hereby granted to MidAmerican Energy Company, an Iowa corporation,
hereinafter called “company”, and to its successors and assigns, the right and
non-exclusive franchise to acquire, construct, reconstruct, replace, erect,
maintain and operate in the City of Eldridge, Iowa, hereinafter called the
“city”, a system for the transmission and distribution of natural gas along,
under, over and upon the streets, avenues, rights-of-way, alleys, public places
or public grounds (excluding parks) to serve customers within the city, and to
furnish and sell natural gas to the city and its inhabitants. The City Council
reserves to itself the right to extend this franchise to parks at the request
of the company. The company is granted the right to exercise of powers of
eminent domain. This franchise shall be effective for a 20-year period from and
after the effective date of the ordinance incorporated herein this chapter.
(Ord. 2021-04, passed 4-19-2021)
§ 2.00 RIGHTS.
   The company shall have the right to lay, re-lay, operate, repair, construct,
reconstruct, replace and extend natural gas pipes, mains, conduit, fixtures,
valves, support brackets, line markers and other accessories as well as to
excavate for the distribution of natural gas in and through the city; provided
the same shall be placed in accord with this franchise and the city code and
regulations of the city, regarding the placement of structures, facilities,
accessories or other objects in the right-of-way by utilities and other users
of the right-of-way, including ordinances which assign corridors or other
placements to users of the right-of-way and requirements which may be adopted
regarding separations of structures, facilities, accessories or other objects.
(Ord. 2021-04, passed 4-19-2021)
§ 3.00 RELOCATING FOR PURPOSES OF CONSTRUCTION.
   The company shall, excluding facilities located in private easements
(whether titled in company exclusively or in company and other entities), in
accordance with state law, including company’s tariff on file with and made
effective by the State Utilities Board as may subsequently be amended
(“tariff”), at its cost and expense, locate and relocate its existing pipes,
mains, conduits and facilities in, on, over or under any public street, avenue,
right-of-way or alley in the city in such a manner as the city may reasonably
require for the purposes of facilitating the construction, reconstruction,
maintenance or repair of the street, avenue, right-of-way or alley. If the city
has a reasonable alternative route for the street, avenue, right-of-way or
alley or an alternative construction method, which would not cause the
relocation of the company installations or would minimize the cost or expense
of relocation of company installations, the city and company shall work
together to consider said alternative route, or construction method. The city
shall, in the extension or modification of streets and roads, make provisions
for the placement of company service lines and facilities on city-owned rights-
of-way without charge to company. In planning for the extension or modification
of streets, the city shall, to the extent practicable, design such changes to
limit the need for the relocation of company facilities. The city shall be
responsible for surveying and staking the right-of-way for city projects that
require the company to relocate company facilities. If requested, the city
shall provide, at no cost to the company, copies of the relocation plan and
profile and cross section drawings. If tree removals must be completed by the
city as part of the city’s project and are necessary whether or not utility
facilities must be relocated, the city, at its own cost, shall be responsible
for said removals. If the timing of tree removals does not coincide with
company’s facilities relocation schedule and the company must remove trees that
are included in the city’s portion of the project, the city shall either remove
the trees or reimburse the company for the expenses incurred to remove the
trees. If project funds from a source other than the city are available to pay
for the relocation of utility facilities, the city shall attempt to secure said
funds and provide them to the company to compensate the company for the costs
of relocation.
(Ord. 2021-04, passed 4-19-2021)
§ 4.00 EXCAVATIONS.
   In making excavations in any streets, avenues, alleys, rights-of-way and
public places for the installation, maintenance or repair of gas pipes, mains,
conduit, fixtures, accessories or other appliances, the company shall not
unreasonably obstruct the use of the streets. The company in making such
excavations shall, if required by ordinance, obtain a city permit therefor and
shall not unnecessarily obstruct the use of streets, avenues or alleys; shall
provide the Public Works Director with 24 hours’ notice prior to the actual
commencement of the work; and shall comply with all provisions and requirements
of the city in its regulation of the use of city right-of-way in performing
such work. In emergencies which require immediate excavation, the company may
proceed with the work without first applying for or obtaining the permit;
provided, however, that the company shall apply for and obtain the excavation
permit as soon as possible after commencing such emergency work. To the extent
not inconsistent with this chapter, the company shall comply with all
provisions and requirements of the city in its regulation of the use of city
right-of-way in performing such work, including all city ordinances regarding
paving cuts, placement of facilities and restoration of pavement and other
public infrastructure, the company shall replace the surface, restoring the
condition as existed prior to the company’s excavation, but shall not be
required to improve or modify the public right-of-way. The company shall
complete all repairs in a timely and prompt manner. Company agrees any
replacement of road surface shall conform to current city ordinances regarding
its depth and composition.

facilities and their replacements on, below, above or beneath the vacated
property.

public ground where the company has facilities in the vicinity, the city shall

has control that is located in city right-of-way, including documents, maps and
other information in paper or electronic or other forms (“information”). The
company and city recognize the information may, in whole or part, be considered
a confidential record under state or federal law or both. Therefore, the city
shall not release any information without prior consent of the company and
shall return the information to company upon request. The city recognizes that
company claims the information may constitute a trade secret or is otherwise
protected from public disclosure by state or federal law on other grounds and
agrees to retain the information in its non-public files. Furthermore, the city
agrees that no documents, maps or information provided to the city by the
company shall be made available to the public or other entities if such
documents or information are exempt from disclosure under the provisions of the

from disclosure the city shall promptly notify the company. The company shall
have the right to assume, upon request of the city, the defense of said action.

§ 1.00 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   COMMISSARY. A licensed food facility regulated by a governmental entity
where food is stored, prepared, portioned, packaged or any combination thereof,
and where such food is intended for consumption at another location or place
from a mobile food unit or pushcart.
   FOOD ESTABLISHMENT. An operation that stores, prepares, packages, serves,
vends or otherwise provides food for human consumption. For the purposes of
this chapter, FOOD ESTABLISHMENT does not include an establishment that offers
only pre-packaged foods that are non-potentially hazardous; a produce stand
which sells only whole, uncut fresh fruits and vegetables; an establishment
operating in a farmers market if potentially hazardous food is not sold or
distributed; a residence in which food that is non-potentially hazardous is
sold for consumption off-premises to a consumer customer provided the food is
labeled so as to identify its preparer; a private home that receives catered or
home-delivered food; child care facilities or food establishments in hospitals
or health care facilities which are subject to regulation by state agencies;
supply vehicles and vending machines.
   MOBILE FOOD UNIT. Motorized, a self-propelled food establishment or a
trailer or vehicle towed by a motorized vehicle, that is readily movable, and
which typically operates at a remote location and returns to base of operation
or commissary at the end of its daily business. MOBILE FOOD UNITS are
considered Class IV mobile food units by the State Department of Inspections
and Appeals.
   POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS FOOD. Has the same meaning as provided in Iowa Code
Chapter 137F.
   PUSHCART. A non-motorized food establishment limited to serving non-
potentially hazardous packaged foods with limited assembly or commercial or
commissary prepared foods that are reheated on the PUSHCART, such as
frankfurters. PUSHCARTS may be towed by a vehicle but are generally capable of
being moved by human-power. PUSHCARTS are considered Class III mobile food
units by the State Department of Inspections and Appeals.
(Ord. 2023-01, passed 1-9-2023)
§ 2.00 LICENSE REQUIRED.
   No person shall sell or offer for sale or otherwise engage in a business as
a mobile food unit or pushcart within the city without having first obtained a
license to operate as such. A mobile food unit license is a special license and
is required in addition to any other required city business license or state
license or permit the person may hold or be required to hold. A separate mobile
food unit license is required for each mobile food vehicle or pushcart from
which business is conducted in the city. Mobile food unit licenses are not
transferable or assignable. The license fee required shall be established by
the City Council by resolution.
(Ord. 2023-01, passed 1-9-2023)
§ 3.00 LICENSE APPLICATION.
   An application form available from the city offices must be filled out and
submitted to the city offices for processing. The completed application must be
submitted together with proof of liability insurance, including commercial
general liability insurance coverage and automotive liability insurance
coverage. Commercial general liability insurance shall include coverage for
bodily injury, death and property damage with limits of liability of not less
than $1,000,000 per occurrence and aggregate combined single limit. Automobile
liability insurance coverage shall include coverage for bodily injury, death
and property damage with limits of liability of not less than $1,000,000 per
occurrence, combined single limit. Certificates of insurance shall provide that
the policy or policies have been endorsed to provide 30 days’ advance notice of
cancellation and 45 days’ advance notice of non-renewal and ten days’ advance
notice of cancellation for non-payment of premium and that these notices shall
be provided to the city offices by email, facsimile or mail. Cancellation of
required insurance automatically revokes and terminates the mobile food unit
license to operate in the city unless other insurance policies are provided in
a timely manner to the city. If the mobile food unit sells food or beverages
other than pre-packaged items that do not require hot or cold handling
procedures, the application shall also contain a copy of the mobile food unit’s
license issued by the State Department of Inspections and Appeals; a copy of
the food establishment license issued by the State Department of Inspections
and Appeals for any commissary kitchen or other premises where food is
prepared; copies of the food protection manager certifications; the name and
address of the facility at which any waste fat, waste oil or waste grease
generated by the mobile food unit operation is disposed of; and a copy of the
certificate of annual compliance issued by the Fire Marshal.

the Director of Public Works or the Chief of Police. Signs so placed shall be
submitted to the City Council for its approval at the next scheduled regular
meeting. The Chief of Police and the Director of Public Works each shall keep a

§ 10.00 THEFT.
   It shall be the violation of this code for any person to commit theft of

§ 10.02.   Misappropriates property which the person has in trust, or property
of another which the person has in the person’s possession or control, whether
such possession or control is lawful or unlawful, by using or disposing of it
in a manner which is inconsistent with or a denial of the trust or of the
owner’s rights in such property, or conceals found property, or appropriates
such property to the person’s own use, when the owner of such property is known
to the person. Failure by a bailee or lessee of personal property to return the
property within 72 hours after a time specified in a written agreement of lease
or bailment shall be evidence of misappropriation (see
Title B, Chapter 2, § 1.3 or Iowa Code § 714.1);
§ 10.03.   Obtains the labor or services of another, or a transfer of
possession, control or ownership of the property of another, or the beneficial
use of property of another, by deception. Where compensation for goods and
services is ordinarily paid immediately upon the obtaining of such goods or the
rendering of such services, the refusal to pay or leaving the premises without
payment or offer to pay or without having obtained from the owner or operator
the right to pay subsequent to leaving the premises gives rise to an inference
that the goods or services were obtained by deception (see
Title B, Chapter 2, § 1.3 or Iowa Code § 714.1);
§ 10.04.   Exercises control over stolen property, knowing such property to
have been stolen, or having reasonable cause to believe that such property has
been stolen, unless the person’s purpose is to promptly restore it to the owner
or to deliver it to an appropriate public officer. The fact that the person is
found in possession of property which has been stolen from two or more persons
on separate occasions, or that the person is a dealer or other person familiar
with the value of such property and has acquired it for a consideration which
is far below its reasonable value, shall be evidence from which the court or
jury may infer that the person knew or believed that the property had been
stolen (see
Title B, Chapter 2, § 1.3 or Iowa Code § 714.1);
§ 10.05.   Takes, destroys, conceals or disposes of property in which someone
else has a security interest, with intent to defraud the secured party (see

draft or written order of any bank, credit union, person or corporation, and
obtains property or service in exchange therefor, if the person knows such
check, share draft, draft or written order will not be paid when presented.
Whenever the drawee of such instrument has refused payment because of
insufficient funds, and the maker has not paid the holder of the instrument the
amount due thereon within ten days of the maker’s receipt of notice from the
holder that payment has been refused by the drawee, the court or jury may infer
from such facts that the maker knew that the instrument would not be paid on
presentation. Notice of refusal of payment shall be by certified mail, or by
personal service in the manner prescribed for serving original notices.
Whenever the drawee of such instrument has refused payment because the maker
has no account with the drawee, the court or jury may infer from such fact that
the maker knew that the instrument would not be paid on presentation (see
Title B, Chapter 2, § 1.3 or Iowa Code § 714.1);
§ 11.00 FRAUDULENT PRACTICE.
   It shall be the violation of the code for any person to commit fraudulent

knowledge that the goods are presented by such instrument do not exist (see
Title B, Chapter 2, § 1.6 or Iowa Code § 714.8);
§ 11.02.   Knowingly attaches or alters any label to any goods offered or kept

other payment (see

number, or any owners’ identification mark, from any property not the person’s
own (see
Title B, Chapter 2, § 1.6 or Iowa Code § 714.8);
§ 11.06.   For the purpose of soliciting assistance, contributions or other
things of value, falsely represents oneself to be a veteran of the armed forces

as a municipal infraction violation or simple misdemeanor. An owner whose
license has been revoked shall inform the humane society, in writing, upon the
animal’s removal from the (city/county), the name, address and telephone number
of the animal’s new owner; the location where the animal will be kept; and the
name and description of the animal. In addition, the owner shall notify the new
owner in writing of any details concerning any and all complaints concerning
the animal, and any terms, conditions or restrictions imposed by the humane
society as to the animal. The owner shall provide the humane society with a
copy of the notification provided to the new owner as well as an acknowledgment
by the new owner of the receipt thereof.
   (M)   Upon revocation of a person’s privilege to license and keep dogs or
cats, no part of the licensee fee shall be refunded.
   (N)   During the period of revocation, any dog or cat which the person owns,
keeps, harbors or maintains at his or her residence may be immediately
confiscated upon its discovery and disposed of by the humane society absent
clear and convincing proof that the animal or animals belong to a person
visiting the resident.
   (O)   The humane society or animal control officer shall provide the owner
or custodian of the animal or animals, as shown on the records at the humane
society, so confiscated with notice of the confiscation. If the animal or
animals are unlicensed or no record exists as to the owner or custodian of an
animal, notice of confiscation shall be directed to the address of the
residence.
   (P)   Any person whose privilege to license and keep animals has been
revoked, but who owns, keeps, harbors or maintains a dog or cat during the
period of the revocation shall have an additional period of up to one year
added to the original period of revocation for each violation of the
revocation.
   (Q)   The notice of initial revocation, any notice of the extension of the
revocation period and any notice of confiscation of any animal may be appealed
to the Animal Hearing Commission pursuant to the procedures set forth in §
19.00 of this chapter. Any notice sent pursuant to this section shall contain a
brief explanation of the violation, the sanction imposed and appeal rights of
the person accused. If the accused can demonstrate by clear and convincing
evidence that he or she has played no role in the care, supervision, possession
or control of the animal, the animal shall be returned.
   (R)   When permanent ownership of an animal is transferred, the new owner
shall, within 14 days from the date ownership is assumed, obtain a license if

presentation by the applicant of a certificate of insurance issuance by an
insurance company licensed to do business in this state which provides personal
liability insurance coverage for the death or injury of any person, or damage
to property of others, and for acts of negligence of the owner or owner’s
agents in the keeping of said dangerous or vicious animal. The minimum amount
of coverage shall be $50,000 for an animal declared dangerous and $100,000 for
an animal declared vicious. The certificate of insurance shall also require
notice to the city, in conformity with general city standards for certificates
of insurance, if the underlying policy of insurance is cancelled for any
reason. In lieu of such a certificate, a copy of a current homeowner’s policy
designating these requirements shall be sufficient proof of insurance for
purposes of this section. If said certificate is not immediately available, a
binder that indicates the proper coverage may be accepted for up to 30 days
subsequent to the determination that an animal is dangerous or vicious;
however, if after 30 days a certificate of insurance or a policy has not been
submitted, the animal shall be deemed unlicensed and be disposed of at the
discretion of animal control officers. The prescribed insurance coverage,
whether it be certificate, policy or binder, must be obtained within ten days
of the declaration of the animal as dangerous or vicious, with retention of the
animal by animal control officers until compliance with this section is
assured.

shall not apply if said bite or scratch occurred while the animal was being
treated, confined or housed within a veterinary hospital or clinic and that
facility knows such animal is currently inoculated for rabies and has the
certification to prove such inoculation. In such cases, reporting of the bite
or scratch shall be discretionary with the veterinary hospital or clinic.
   (B)   Any animal that has been involved in biting a person or other animal
must be quarantined for ten days from the date of the bite. Such confinement
may be at the premises of the owner if deemed appropriate and sufficient
safeguards are provided to the discretion of the animal control officer and/or
the County Health Department. If an animal is not quarantined at the owner’s
premises, it shall be confined at the animal shelter or at a licensed

of the enactment of this chapter, may be continued upon property located within
the city; provided livestock was maintained thereon prior to the enactment of

following situations applies:
         (a)   When the animal is restrained either upon the premises of the

12.00 of this chapter shall apply;
         (b)   When the animal is confined or restrained upon the premises of
the owner or custodian within a secured building, or within a secured pen,
enclosure or similar structure which has secured sides, bottom and top such
that the animal cannot escape, or within fencing or similar means secured such
that the animal cannot escape and which is fastened by an adequate locking

the animal from coming into contact with the other animals unless the animal is
used in a planned breeding situation. An animal is deemed to be in heat when it
is in an estrogous state or ovulating. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to prohibit exercising the animal provided the animal is restrained
on a leash or similar restraint not more than six feet in length and is under
the control of a person competent to restrain and control the animal or from
transporting such animal within a motor vehicle.
   (D)   (1)   Any dog, cat or other animal which is found in violation of this

specified in §
16.00 of this chapter the humane society may dispose of an unredeemed animal.
If an animal control officer is unable to apprehend an animal or impoundment is
not feasible, the animal control officer shall provide the owner or custodian
of the animal with a notice of violation under the procedures contained in §
18.00 of this chapter.

Eldridge”, and the year the tag was issued for. Lost or stolen tags shall be
immediately reported to the city or its agent and shall be replaced by the city
or its agent at the cost provided for other tags as stated in this chapter.
   (H)   Any working service dog service or handler that sells or otherwise
transfers ownership of any working service dog shall, not less than ten days
after the transfer, file a report with the city or its agent containing the
name and address of the person to whom such dog was transferred, a description
and identification tag number of the dog and any other information the city or
its agent deems necessary.
   (I)   Any person whose working service dog is lost or stolen or whose dog
has died shall, within 24 hours of the loss or theft, or within ten days of the
death, file a report with the city or its agent containing a description and
identification tag number of the dog, and any other information the city or its
agent deems necessary.
   (J)   A working service dog, properly registered as required by this
section, in the custody and control of a licensed working service dog service
or handler, shall not be declared to be a dangerous or vicious dog; provided
that at the time of attack said dog was under the direct supervision of a
working service dog service or licensed handler.
§ 14.00 DAMAGE TO PROPERTY.
   No person shall allow or permit his or her animal to damage, injure or
destroy any shrubbery, plants, flowers, grass, fence or anything whatsoever
upon public or private property without prior permission from the property
owner or authorized person.
§ 15.00 BARKING DOGS REGULATIONS.
   It shall be unlawful to keep or harbor any dog which, by frequent, regular,
habitual or continued barking, yelping or howling, shall cause serious
annoyance to the surrounding neighborhood. Such action is a violation of this
chapter and is also hereby declared a public nuisance. The animal control
officer or a city police officer shall have the authority to use all reasonable
means to abate such nuisance, including, but not limited to, requiring that the
owner or custodian make bona fide efforts to quiet the dog and impoundment of
the dog if the owner or custodian is absent from the premises. If the dog is
impounded, the officer shall attempt to locate and notify the absent owner or
custodian by any reasonable means as soon as possible.
§ 16.00 IMPOUNDMENT.
   (A)   Animal shelter. The city may establish and maintain a municipal animal
shelter or the city may contract with any non-profit incorporated society or
association which shall provide and maintain an animal shelter for the
enforcement of this chapter. It shall be the duty of the persons authorized by
the city to operate such animal shelter to supervise and control such facility;
to cause the shelter to be kept in a sanitary condition and free from offensive
odors; to provide for adequate food, water and shelter; to provide for the
collection of animals; to handle the destruction or disposition of animals not
redeemed; and to assist in the enforcement and operation of this chapter. The
provisions of this chapter shall be enforceable by any animal control officer
and by members of the City Police Department.
   (B)   Impoundment procedure. Unrestrained animals found running at large,
nuisance animals, neglected animals, abandoned animals and cats or dogs running
at large without license tags or rabies vaccination tags shall be taken and
impounded in the animal shelter and there confined in a humane manner.
   (C)   Notice. Upon impounding a licensed animal, the owner or custodian of
the animal shall be given a written notice of the impoundment by the
impoundment authority within two days and the owner shall then have five days
to redeem the animal not counting the day of impoundment. If an impounded
animal is unlicensed or not displaying a license pursuant to §
3.00 of this chapter, the impoundment authority shall have no obligation to
search for or provide notice to the owner or custodian.
   (D)   Redemption and boarding fees.
      (1)   A person redeeming an impounded dog or cat shall pay the required
redemption fee, as stated in §
7.00 of this chapter, for a first, second or third offense and the required
boarding fees, as provided for by this section. In addition, before an
unlawfully unlicensed animal may be redeemed, the person redeeming the animal
must obtain a license as stated in this chapter. In addition, a person
redeeming an animal shall pay any additional fees required under the provisions
of this chapter, including any monies expended for the provision of medical
treatment provided to the animal.
      (2)   The boarding fees for other animals shall be as follows:
         (a)   For each dog, cat, ferret or similar animal, a fee of $6.50 per
day for the animal’s care, food, water and shelter;
         (b)   For each domestic fowl, chicken, goose, duck or waterfowl, a fee
of $10 per day for the animal’s care, food, water and shelter;
         (c)   For each horse, mule, jack, cow, bull, steer, ox, swine, sheep,
goat or similar animals, a fee of $30 per day for the animal’s care, food,
water and shelter; and
         (d)   For any animal not specified herein, a fee of $25, plus actual
expenses incurred for the animal’s care, food, water and shelter.
   (E)   Euthanasia. No animal need be kept for the period of notification or
impoundment if a licensed veterinarian or an animal control officer certifies
that the animal is so diseased or injured that it is unduly suffering or cannot
survive. In such cases, the animal may be subjected to humane euthanasia.
   (F)   Unclaimed animals. Animals not reclaimed or redeemed within the time
limitations provided by this chapter shall become the property of the city or
animal shelter and shall be placed for adoption in a suitable home or subjected
to humane euthanasia. No unclaimed dog or cat shall be released for adoption to
a suitable home without being sterilized, or without a written agreement from
the adopter, secured by a cash deposit, guaranteeing that such animal will be
sterilized.
   (G)   Refusal. The refusal to redeem or reclaim any impounded animal shall
not relieve the owner of the duty to pay the impoundment fees, boarding fees,
veterinarian expenses or any other costs incurred in the care of the animal. An
owner or custodian who refuses to pay such expenses shall be in violation of
this chapter and subject to citation for the same.
   (H)   Liability. Neither the city nor the animal shelter, nor their agents
and officers, enforcing the provisions of this chapter shall be liable for any
accident or subsequent disease that may occur in connection with the
impoundment of any animal pursuant to this chapter.
§ 17.00 ENFORCING PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Enforcement. Humane society employees, animal control officers and
city police officers are authorized to issue municipal infraction citations or
notices of violations for violations of the provisions of this chapter. If
provided for by a section of this chapter, a city police officer may enforce a
violation of a section as a simple misdemeanor.
   (B)   Interference with enforcement. It is unlawful for any person to
interfere with, hinder, willfully prevent or attempt to prevent any police
officer, animal control officer or person authorized to enforce this chapter by
the City Administrator in the enforcement of this chapter.
   (C)   Inspection procedures. Whenever it becomes necessary to make an
inspection to enforce any of the provisions of or to perform any duty imposed
by this chapter or other applicable law, or whenever the animal control officer
or other authorized person has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in
any building or upon any premises any violation of the provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law, the officer is authorized to enter such
property at any reasonable time and to inspect the same and perform any duty
imposed upon the officer by this chapter or other applicable law. If the
property is occupied, the officer shall first present proper credentials to the
occupant and request entry, explaining the reasons entry is sought. If the
property is unoccupied, the officer shall first make a reasonable effort to
locate the owner or other person in control of the property and request entry
explaining the reason therefore. If entry is refused, or the owner or person in
control of the property cannot be located after due diligence, the officer
shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure lawful entry and
inspect the property.
   (D)   Immediate inspection. Notwithstanding §
21.00(B) of this chapter, if the animal control officer or police officer has
reasonable cause to believe that the keeping or the maintenance of any animal
is so hazardous, unsafe or dangerous as to require immediate inspection to
safeguard the animal or the public health or safety, the officer shall have the
right to immediately enter and inspect such property, and may use any
reasonable means required to effect such entry and make such investigation,
whether the property is occupied or unoccupied. If occupied, the officer shall
first present proper identification and demand entry explaining the reasons
therefor and the purpose of the inspection.
§ 18.00 NOTICE OF VIOLATION, CONFISCATION, REVOCATION.
   (A)   An animal control officer, police officer or the legal department may
send a notice of violation to an animal’s owner or keeper. A notice of
violation initiates administrative sanction procedures for violations of this
chapter, revocation of a person’s privilege to license or keep animals,
extension of the period of revocation, confiscation of an animal or a
declaration that a dog is declared dangerous or vicious. A notice of violation
under this section shall be sent upon the request of a victim of a vicious dog
attack, as defined in §
1.00(B) of this chapter.
   (B)   The notice of violation shall briefly state the type of notice it is,
the facts prompting the notice, the administrative sanction imposed, the notice
recipient’s appeal rights and the date by which the recipient must request a
hearing, not less than five days after the date of the notice, or waive his or
her right to a hearing.
   (C)   The notice of violation shall be either hand-delivered by the animal
control officer or police officer or be sent by certified mail.
   (D)   The notice recipient may appeal a notice of violation by requesting a
hearing in writing before the Animal Hearing Commission and paying an
administrative fee of $20. If the recipient of the notice does not appeal, the
notice of violation sanctions imposed are final. If an appeal is properly
requested, then an informal appeal hearing shall be held before the Animal
Hearing Commission as soon as practicable. At the informal hearing, both the
city and the notice recipient or the recipient’s legal counsel may present
evidence and cross-examine witnesses. The Animal Hearing Commission may also
ask questions of witnesses. The Animal Hearing Commission shall render a
written decision within 30 days after the conclusion of the hearing.
§ 19.00 NUISANCES.
   (A)   Any animal which is not confined or kept under restraint as required
by this chapter, and any wild, exotic, dangerous or vicious animal kept or
maintained within the city in violation of this chapter, any animal, which
barks so frequently, regularly or habitually that it causes serious annoyance
to the surrounding neighborhood, is hereby declared a public nuisance.
   (B)   Whenever an animal control officer or police officer determines that a
nuisance exists, the officer may cause a written notice ordering the abatement
of the nuisance to be served upon the owner or custodian. The notice to abate
shall contain a description of what constitutes the nuisance, the location of
the nuisance, a statement of the act or acts necessary to abate the nuisance, a
definite time within which the nuisance shall be abated which time shall be
reasonable under the circumstances and a statement that the city will abate the
nuisance if the nuisance is not abated in the manner and within the time stated
and no request for a hearing is made within the time stated. Notice to abate
shall be served personally upon the owner or custodian by serving the owner or
custodian or any person residing at the residence who is at least 18 years old,
or by serving the owner or custodian by certified mail return receipt
requested. If service is by certified mail, service shall be deemed given when
mailed.
   (C)   (1)   Any person ordered to abate a nuisance may request a hearing on
the order to abate by delivering a written request for a hearing to the animal
control officer who ordered the abatement. Such a request must be delivered
prior to the time specified in the notice to abate or it will be conclusively
presumed that a nuisance exists and it must be abated as ordered. Any hearing
so requested shall be held within 30 days of the date the written appeal is
delivered to the animal control officer and shall be held by the Animal Hearing
Commission.
      (2)   At the conclusion of the hearing, the Animal Hearing Commission
shall render a decision as to:
         (a)   Whether a nuisance exists;
         (b)   If so, what steps the person must take to abate the same; and
         (c)   The time frame for the abatement.
   (D)   If a person ordered to abate a nuisance neglects or fails to abate the
nuisance as directed, the city may abate the nuisance. If an animal is
impounded, the owner or custodian of the animal shall be notified of the
impoundment, as provided in §
16.00 of this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the
impoundment authority shall keep an impounded animal until such time as the
animal control officer who ordered the abatement notifies the impoundment
authority that the owner or custodian has complied with the order to abate or
has abated the nuisance in some other acceptable manner, in which case, the
animal may be released to the owner or custodian upon payment of all the costs,
fees and other expenses incurred in the care of the animal have been paid. If
the impoundment authority is not notified of the owner’s or custodian’s
compliance within three days after the impoundment, in the case of a previously
abated nuisance animal, or from the time specified in a formal order of
abatement, the impounded animal may be disposed of in the discretion of the
humane society.
§ 20.00 ANIMAL HEARING COMMISSION.
   (A)   There shall be established an Animal Hearing Commission to conduct
hearings formerly conducted by the Deputy City Clerk. The Commission shall

of whom shall be appointed by the Public Safety Committee of the City Council.
Each member shall be a city resident or owner of a business interest in the
city, be at least 21 years of age and shall serve without compensation.
      (1)   The Commission shall further consist of:
         (a)   A dog owner;
         (b)   A non-dog owner;
         (c)   A board certified veterinarian who works with dogs, a
veterinarian technician or a veterinarian’s assistant or a veterinarian
technician’s assistant;
         (d)   A member of a recognized breeder’s association demonstrating a
tangible means of qualification in one or more of the areas listed below; and

member serving three years. This is to avoid having all members being appointed
simultaneously and to keep the appointments staggered. All Commission members
shall be familiar with the city’s animal ordinance and swear to uphold the same
by signature. At least three members shall be present at each hearing conducted
by the Commission. Any member may be recused if the member perceives a conflict
of interest or personal connection involved in any hearing. The Commission
shall provide a written report of its activities and hearings quarterly to the
Mayor and City Council.
§ 21.00 PENALTIES.
   (A)   A violation of any provision of this chapter shall constitute a
municipal infraction and may be cited and punished accordingly.

misdemeanor offense and may be cited and punished accordingly, in lieu of the
issuance of a municipal infraction citation, at the officer’s discretion.
   (C)   In addition to a municipal infraction citation or simple misdemeanor
citation for violations under this chapter, a notice of violation for the same
incident may be issued to invoke the procedures pursuant to §
18.00 of this chapter.
   (D)   The following scheduled fines are established for municipal
infractions:

third or subsequent offense: $750.
   (E)   If no scheduled fine is provided for a violation, then the fine
imposed shall not exceed $500 for a first offense and $750 for a second or
subsequent offense.

§ 1.00 DISASTER SERVICES ORGANIZATION.
   There is hereby created a disaster services organization for carrying out
the responsibility of the municipality in times of disaster and a city multi-
hazard emergency operations plan as outlined in the following sections. The
Mayor shall be the executive director of the disaster services organization and
shall be responsible for the direction of all operations for the protection of
the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. Said organization
shall function in accordance with the city disaster plan which shall be
coordinated with the plan adopted by the county and the state, in accordance
with state law.
§ 2.00 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
§ 2.01.   CITY DISASTER PLAN. A plan developed to describe city emergency
operations, and emphasize the responsibilities of the city government forces,
or other emergency response organizations and individuals.
§ 2.02.   DISASTER. Human-made catastrophes and natural occurrences, such as
fire, flood, earthquake, tornado and windstorm which threaten the public peace,
health and safety of the people or which damage and destroy public or private
property. The term includes enemy attack, sabotage or other hostile action from
within or without the state, including, but not limited to, domestic or foreign
terrorism.
§ 2.03.   DISASTER SERVICES. Preparations for, operations during and recovery
from natural or human-made disaster. These actions are broad in scope and
include, but are not limited to, disaster plans, mitigation, warning, emergency
operations, training, exercising, research, rehabilitation and recovery.
§ 3.00 AUTHORITY.
   The Mayor may delegate such portions of the details of the operation as will
best serve the carrying out of the city disaster plan. The Mayor shall
designate the order of his or her succession, subject to approval by the
Council, to serve in his or her place in the event he or she is unable to act
due to absence or disability.
§ 4.00 LIABILITY.
   Insofar as permitted by state law, the municipality, when acting in
consonance with the city disaster plan, shall not be liable for failure to
provide protection or to prevent damages to persons or property, the purpose of
such plan being to improve conditions arising from the disaster by organized
effort. The municipality shall carry such insurance on voluntary disaster
workers as deemed advisable by the City Council upon recommendation of the City
Attorney.
§ 5.00 PENALTY.
   Any person who shall violate the orders of the Mayor, or of duly constituted
officers, when carrying out a disaster plan during a disaster, shall, upon
conviction, be subject to imprisonment not exceeding 30 days, or a fine not to
exceed $500.
§ 6.00 BASIC PLAN.
§ 6.01 AUTHORITIES.
   The Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2251
through 2297). Emergency Management, Iowa Code Chapter 29C, 1995, which
provides the authority for disaster services and emergency planning matters
within the state, including county and local disaster services.
§ 6.02 REFERENCES.
   Pub. Law No. 81-920 and 93-288; Iowa Code, 1995; Federal Civil Defense
Guide; Iowa Emergency Plan and Civil Preparedness Guides.
§ 6.03 SALUTATION.
   (A)   The city has capabilities which, if effectively used in the event of
any emergency, would maximize the preservation of life and property. These
capabilities include the fallout, tornado and windstorm protection offered by
larger structures and home basements, as well as the human-power, equipment and
skills of the city forces; the medical, health and allied professions; and
other non-government professions and groups. Finally, they include knowledge of
survival actions possessed by the population.
   (B)   The objective of the city’s emergency operations plan is to ensure
effective use of these capabilities should a disaster affect any area of the
city. Increased readiness actions taken by city government in anticipation of
nuclear attack, natural disaster or civil disturbance situations could further
increase these capabilities.
§ 6.04 ASSUMPTIONS.
   Tornadoes, floods, blizzards and other forms of natural disaster can affect
the city. The calculated initiation of nuclear war by any current power is
considered unlikely. Nevertheless, general war could occur through accident,
miscalculation and irrational act, or the unplanned escalation of a limited
war, as well as by a deliberate act. (See county-wide nuclear attack
contingency plan.) Major accidents such as train wrecks, plane crashes,
explosions or accidental releases of hazardous substances are possible
occurrences within the city. Civil disturbances and other public disorders are
considered unlikely, but could occur in the city. Outside assistance from
adjacent and higher levels of government, the military and non-government
organizations may be available under localized emergency conditions. However,
during de-spread disasters affecting large areas of the state or nation,
outside aid could be severely limited or unavailable for long periods of time.
In either case, the immediate, lifesaving aid must come from the jurisdiction
most affected.
§ 6.05 MISSION.
   The emergency mission of local government is to protect life and property,
ensure the continuity of government, sustain survivors, repair essential
facilities and utilities, provide support to all areas and political
subdivisions in the county and support and assist areas outside the city when
possible.
§ 6.06 ORGANIZATION.
   Existing government is the basis for emergency operations. The organization
of city government is represented in Chart A incorporated in § 7.00.
§ 6.07 CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS.
   In time of major disaster, the Mayor may take command of the police and
govern the city by proclamation (Iowa Code § 372.14(2)). In that case, he or
she shall be responsible for providing overall direction and control, and shall
receive assistance in this effort from all departments and personnel. The
County Disaster Services Coordinator shall serve in a staff capacity to the
Mayor. He or she shall also serve in a liaison role with respect to the
procurement of county, state and federal level resources.
§ 6.08 OPERATIONS POLICIES.
   It is recognized that protection of life and property during an emergency is
the primary responsibility of government at all levels. Existing agencies of
government will perform emergency activities relating to those they perform
under non-emergency conditions. Within city limits, city officials will be
responsible for the direction and control of emergency operations, and will
utilize the regular, auxiliary or volunteer resources of city government. They
will also be responsible for coordinating with others to provide for those
emergency operations not within the capabilities of city government forces.
Within county boundaries, but exclusive of incorporated cities, county
officials will be responsible for directions and control of emergency
operations, and will utilize the regular, auxiliary or volunteer resources of
county government forces. In an emergency affecting more than one political
jurisdiction, officials of all jurisdictions involved will coordinate their
services to the maximum extent possible. The disaster services organization
will provide coordination between levels of government and will provide the
unique disaster services skills and activities not available in existing
organizations. The disaster services organization will also provide resource
coordination between government agencies and the private sector. Each agency,
department or service of government shall provide for the maintenance of
records during an emergency. These records should include work-hours, equipment
hours, supplies and material consumed, injuries to personnel and damage to
public facilities and equipment.
§ 6.09 OPERATIONS AND ASSIGNMENTS.
   (A)   Chart B lists the functions which must be performed or coordinated
during an emergency situation. Responsibilities have been assigned by a code
letter “P”, “S” or “C”. “P” designates primary operational responsibility,
which means the official or agency is in charge of and responsible to make
provision for that function. “S” designates support responsibility, which means
the agency so assigned will, if possible, support and assist the official or
agency designated primarily responsible. “C” designates coordination
responsibility and is assigned when several agencies have support capability
but no one official or agency has obvious primary responsibility. This will be
especially true when non-government agencies are involved. As a general rule,
county officials will be primarily responsible for carrying out emergency
functions outside city limits and city officials will have the corresponding
responsibility within their city limits. Exceptions are organizations such as
fire departments, schools and medical facilities whose geographical boundaries
do not coincide with corporate limits. Persons or agency assigned code letter
“P” are responsible for development of operational procedures for that
function. Also, they are responsible for keeping that functional information
up-to-date or for its revision.
   (B)   If any function does not have a person or agency assigned primary
responsibility, the assignment of the letter “C” means those persons or
agencies shall form a committee for preparation of the information of that
function. Also, the Committee is responsible for keeping the functional
information up-to-date or for its revision.
§ 6.10 LINES OF SUCCESSION.
   The following lines of succession have been established: Mayor, Mayor Pro-
Tem and City Administrator.
§ 6.11 SUPPORT BY MILITARY.
   Support by military units may be made available through the state at the
request of the County Sheriff or the Mayor to the Governor. Requests should be
coordinated through the County Municipal Civil Defense and Disaster Services
Director/Coordinator. In a civil disturbance situation, the Department of
Public Safety can expedite the transmission of the request to the Governor.
Military assistance will complement and not be a substitute for city and/or
local participation in emergency operations. Military forces, if made
available, will remain under military command at all times, but will support
and assist city and/or local forces, and may receive task assignments,
objectives, priorities and other directions necessary to accomplish missions in
the city.
§ 6.12 FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES.
   Available support from federal and state agencies is normally offered
automatically. Information and assistance in securing federal and state support
may be obtained through the (State) Office of Disaster Services. Federal
agencies have been assigned emergency preparedness functions by Executive
Orders. (See Civil Preparedness Guide CPG 101, which is available in the
County/Municipal Disaster Services Coordinator’s office.) State agencies and
local government emergency responsibilities and support functions are described
in the state’s emergency plan. This plan is available in the county/municipal
disaster service coordinator’s office and the sheriff’s office. A state
“disaster analysis team” may be sent to the affected area for the purpose of
determining support required from state and federal agencies. The State
Department of Public Safety has developed a mobile communications van which can
be moved to the scene of an emergency to provide a communication link with the
state government. The County Hazardous Materials Management Response Team may
be called as required, and used if available.
§ 6.13 MUTUAL AID AGREEMENTS.
   Verbal agreements exist between local fire departments and between law
enforcement agencies to provide all possible assistance when called upon by
other agencies in the county or by adjoining counties. A written mutual aid
agreement should be on file with the Secretary of State between the county and
all municipalities of the county.
§ 6.14 STATE DISASTER CONTINGENCY FUND.
   Every effort shall be made to recover from any disaster with city resources.
All departments of city government shall maintain detailed accounts of disaster
expenses. If it is necessary, an application for a disaster loan shall be filed
with the State Office of Disaster Services. Action shall be initiated to
implement annual emergency levy, as authorized by Iowa Code §§ 24.6 and
384.110, in order to expedite repayment of loan, if approved.
§ 6.15 TEMPORARY HOUSING.
   Emergency Welfare Coordinator compiles data on temporary housing need which
cannot be met locally and forward to the State Office of Disaster Services
through the County Municipal Civil Defense and Disaster Services Director/
Coordinator.
§ 6.16 CRISIS COUNSELING.
   Emergency Health Coordinator develops system to conduct an outreach program
to screen for affected individuals in coordination with local mental health
centers and clinics; provides crisis counseling services in the disaster area
and within the Federal Disaster Assistance Center (DAC), if it is established;
and provides the State Mental Health Authority (IMHA) with information
describing the counseling needs of the citizenry and the requirement for
additional assistance.
§ 6.17 DISASTER ASSISTANCE CENTER.
   The County/Municipal Civil Defense and Disaster Services Director/
Coordinator shall coordinate office of disaster services requests for space
needed to house a disaster assistance center and provide local logistical
support to the DAC to meet local needs and provide coordination of local
assistance activities.

Recovery for Disaster Areas”.
§ 6.19 TESTING AND EXERCISING.
   This plan and its supporting documents (annexes and SOPs) are to be
exercised or tested, evaluated and, if necessary, revised and updated at least
annually. This is necessary to keep the plan from becoming outdated beyond
usability, to continually refine the plan and to keep those responsible for
implementing the plan familiar with its contents.
§ 6.20 WARNING.
   It shall be the responsibility of the following individuals to provide
warning on the imminent approach of any situation that would create danger to
the people of the city. The warning signal will be a steady tone of the civil
defense siren and the city’s fire siren. The warning may also include mobile
sirens. Officials responsible for the warning are: Eldridge Police Department

§ 1.00 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public interest, welfare,
health and safety within the City of Eldridge by prohibiting the consumption of
alcoholic beverages by persons under the age of 21 at premises located in the
city. The Eldridge City Council finds that the occurrence of social gatherings
at premises where alcoholic beverages are served to or consumed by persons
under the age of 21 is harmful to such persons themselves and a threat to
public welfare, health, and safety. The City Council further finds that persons
under the age of 21 often obtain alcoholic beverages at such gatherings and
that persons who are in control of such premises know or have reason to know of
such service and/or consumption and will be more likely to ensure that
alcoholic beverages are not served or consumed by persons under the age of 21
at these gatherings. Based on these findings, the City Council has deemed it
necessary to enact the following regulations in Eldridge.

“slug”, as defined herein;
      (9)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the wastewater treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters; and
      (10)   Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other water or
wastes in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, form suspended
solids which interfere with the collection system or create a condition
deleterious to structures and treatment processes.
§ 6.07 CITY ACTIONS REGARDING DISCHARGES.
   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to
the public sewers which waters contain the substances, possess the
characteristics or exceed the limits enumerated in §
6.06 of this chapter and which, in the judgment of the Public Works Director
and the City Building Official, may have a deleterious effect upon the
wastewater facilities, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which
otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the city
may:
   (A)   Reject the wastes after being notified by the City Building Official
that such wastes are in violation of this chapter;
   (B)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the
public sewers;
   (C)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge;

Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution”, promulgated by the
United States Environmental Protection Agency, Title 40, Chapter I, Part 403,
as published in the Federal Register, Vol. 46, No. 18, Wednesday, January 28,
1981, and amended on April 7, 1993, as the city pretreatment regulation.

Protection Agency.
      (2)   Where regulations have not been set by those agencies, the Director
of Public Works shall establish pretreatment requirements to obtain the
following objectives:
         (a)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants which will interfere
with the treatment plant operation or contaminate the resulting sludge;
         (b)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants which will pass
through the system, inadequately treated, into the receiving waters or the
atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system; and
         (c)   To improve opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and
sludge from the system.
   (C)    Any costs for pretreatment flow measuring or monitoring facilities or
analytical systems or tests to meet the pretreatment regulations shall be the
responsibility of the customer.
   (D)   Any cost to the city, including increased operation or maintenance
expenditures or fines levied by the state or federal agencies, which result
from the discharge from any utility customer, shall be assessed to that
customer. In the event more than one utility customer is responsible, the cost
shall be prorated among those responsible based upon percent of total pounds of
pollutants.
   (E)   No utility customer may expand his or her process or operation if that
expansion results in a discharge or results in a discharge which exceeds any
limitation established for their discharges or results in the discharge of some
other substance which will violate any provision of the pretreatment
regulations unless their plans for expansion are approved by the Director of
Public Works at least six months prior to the planned expansion.

water metered by a specific meter is used in such a way that it does not
normally enter the sanitary sewer system.
§ 5.00 SERVICE DISCONTINUED.
   Normal procedure shall be that sewer rentals continue during periods when a
building or apartment are vacant. In the event of an extended vacancy, sewer
rentals may be discontinued; but, in that event, a new connection charge shall
be made when the building or apartment is again occupied. Such a disconnection
shall be made only with the approval of the City Administrator.
§ 6.00 SCHOOLS.
   Sewer rates for school buildings and offices shall be the same as for
commercial/industrial users.
§ 7.00 CONNECTION CHARGES.

at the time a permit is obtained for the plumbing connection.
 
Residential $200 per bedroom
Commercial  $70 per 1,000 square feet
Industrial  $100 per 1,000 square feet
Commercial and industrial charges are determined by the intended use at the
time of new service, not zoning.

type wastes. Such special treatment and all expense of monitoring and testing
such sewage shall be borne by the customer.
§ 10.00 STORM WATER DISPOSAL.
   No property owner or occupancy of any property which is connected to the
city’s sanitary sewer system shall knowingly allow storm water to enter the
sanitary sewer system by means of any part of the sewers or drains which are a

§ 1.00 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to beautify and preserve the appearance of
the city, by requiring street trees to be uniformly located and maintained. The
primary responsibility for maintaining street trees is placed upon the abutting
property owner or his or her agent, but the Street Superintendent shall
personally supervise any cutting or trimming of said trees.
§ 2.00 ARBORICULTURAL SPECIFICATIONS AND STANDARDS OF PRACTICE.
§ 2.01 PLANTING SIZE.
   All trees planted on the streets shall be of sufficient size to warrant
satisfactory results and stand the abuse common to street trees.
§ 2.02 PLANTING GRADE.
   Unless otherwise allowed for substantial reasons, all standard sized trees
shall have comparatively straight trunks, well-developed leaders and top and
root characteristics of the species or variety showing evidence of proper
nursery pruning. All trees must be free of insects, disease, mechanical
injuries and other objectionable features at the time of planting. To
compensate for any serious loss of roots, the top of the tree should be reduced
by thinning or cutting back as determined by the growth characteristics of the
tree species. The leader shall not be cut off in such trimming.
§ 2.03 PLACEMENT.
   Trees shall not be planted on the parking if it is less than nine feet in
width, or contains less than 81 square feet of exposed soil surface. Trees
shall not be planted closer than 20 feet to street intersections (property
lines extended) and ten feet to driveways. If it is at all possible, trees
should be planted inside the property lines and not between the sidewalk and
the curb.
§ 2.04 METHOD OF SUPPORT.
   Trees may be guyed or supported in an upright position according to accepted
arboricultural practices. The guys or supports shall be fastened in such a way
that they will not girdle or cause serious injury to the trees or endanger
public safety.
§ 2.05 SPACING.
   All trees hereafter planted in any street shall be planted midway between
the outer line of the sidewalk and curb. In the event a curb line is not
established, trees shall be planted not less than four feet inside the private
property line side of the sidewalk.
§ 2.06 TRIMMING AND PRUNING.
   All cuts are to be made sufficiently close to the parent stem so that
healing can readily start under normal conditions. All dead and diseased wood
shall be removed. All limbs one inch in diameter or more must be precut to
prevent splitting. All branches in danger of injuring the tree in falling shall
be lowered by ropes. A crossed or rubbing branch shall be removed where
practicable, but removal shall not leave large holes in the general outline of
the tree. Crossed or rubbing branches may be cabled apart. All cuts, old or
new, one inch in diameter or more, shall be painted with an approved tree wound
dressing. On old wounds, care shall be taken to paint exposed wood only. Where
there is a known danger of transmitting disease by tools, said tools shall be
disinfected with alcohol before use on another tree. Improperly healed scars,
where callous growth is not established, are to be traced and painted, unless
the Street Superintendent designates other treatment. No topping or dehorning
of trees shall be permitted except by special written permission of the Street
Superintendent. Trees becoming stag-headed may have the dead portions removed
back to sound green wood, with a proper 45 degree cut only. Elm wood trimmed,
pruned or removed shall not be used for any purpose, but shall be disposed of
immediately by burning or burying.
§ 3.00 REMOVAL OF TREES.
   The Street Superintendent shall remove, on the order of the Council, any
tree on the streets of this municipality which interferes with the making of
improvements or with travel thereon. If the abutting property owner refuses to
remove trees which have become diseased, or which constitute a danger to the
public, or which have been declared a nuisance, he or she shall be subject to
the penalties set out in §
8.00 of this chapter.
§ 4.00 DUTY TO TRIM TREES.
   The owner or agent of the abutting property shall keep the trees on, or
overhanging, the street trimmed so that all branches will be at least 13 feet
above the surface of the street and nine feet above the sidewalk.
§ 5.00 TRIMMING OF TREES UNDER SUPERVISION OF STREET SUPERINTENDENT.
   Except as allowed in §
4.00 of this chapter, no person may trim or cut any tree in a street or public
place unless the work is done under the personal supervision of the Street
Superintendent.
§ 6.00 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
§ 6.01.   PARKING. Includes that part of the street or avenue or highway in the
city not covered by sidewalk and lying between the lot line and the curb lines;

or highways.
§ 6.06.   STREET TREE. Includes any tree planted between the property lines of

§ 7.00 TREES INTERFERING WITH UTILITIES.
   When it is determined by the Street Superintendent that the planting of any
trees in a certain area of the city would, in fact, interfere with the
operation of any utilities within the city, this will be sufficient reason not
to issue a permit for the planting of said trees. This provision applies both
to easements presently in existence and any future easements dedicated for such
purposes.
§ 8.00 NOTICE TO REMOVE TREES.
   If the Street Superintendent of the city, upon examination and inspection in
person or by some qualified person acting for him or her, shall determine, with
reasonable certainty, that violation of this chapter exists, he or she shall
immediately serve, or cause to be served, upon the owner, occupant or person in
charge of such property a written notice to remove, trim or prune the offending
tree or trees, including that such must be done within ten days of service of
said notice; and if such owner, occupant or person in charge of said property
failed to comply with said notice within ten days of receipt thereof, the
Council, upon notice and hearing, may cause the same to be removed, trimmed or
pruned and the cost thereof assessed against the property.

   (A)   Excavation and backfill shall include all excavation, backfilling and
compacting; disposal of surplus material; furnishing additional backfill
material; restoration of all disturbed surface; and all other work incidental
to the construction of trenches, including any additional excavation which may
be required for manholes or other structures forming a part of the pipe line.
   (B)   The contractor shall excavate all materials encountered to the depth
indicated or specified. All excavated material suitable for backfill shall be
deposited in an orderly manner, a sufficient distance (two foot minimum) back
from the edge of the excavation to avoid roll-backs, slides or cave-ins.
Material not suitable for backfill shall be removed to a disposal area provided
by the contractor.
   (C)   All work shall be scheduled to keep streets, sidewalks and utilities
in usable condition and to avoid owner inconvenience insofar as practicable
during construction. All obstructions (i.e., underground and above ground
utilities, bollards, signs, mailboxes and the like) removed to accommodate
construction equipment or to facilitate excavations shall be restored at no
additional cost to the owner. Care shall be exercised in operating equipment
beneath or adjacent to trees, plantings and shrubbery to prevent damage.
   (D)   Unless specifically set forth as a bid item, excavation, bedding and
backfilling for trenches and appurtenances shall be incidental to the
construction.
   (E)   Reference to maximum density shall mean a soil density not less than
the stated percent of optimum density for soil as determined by the latest
revision of ASTM Specifications D-698, “Standard Proctor Density”.
§ 1.02 EXCAVATION CLASSIFICATION.
   (A)   Earth excavation shall include clay, silt, sand, gravel, hardpan,
disintegrated shale and rock debris, junk, brick, loose stones and boulders and
all materials not classified as rock or rubble as herein specified.
   (B)   Rock excavation shall include solid deposits so firmly cemented
together that their removal requires continuous use of pneumatic tools or
blasting. The use of blasting methods shall be used only with written
permission of the city.
   (C)   Rubble excavation shall include buried concrete foundations, beams,
walls and other materials that require continuous use of pneumatic tools or
blasting. The use of blasting methods shall be used only with written
permission of the city.

specification, shall be made at the unit price per cubic yard for rock
excavation, if set forth as a bid item.
§ 1.03 EXCAVATION FOR STRUCTURES AND APPURTENANCES.
   (A)   Excavation for manholes and other appurtenances shall be as required
to firm undisturbed soil. If the excavation is carried below the bottom of the
foundation as shown on the plans, the contractor shall replace the over-
excavation with concrete or stabilizing material as directed by the engineer.
   (B)   When unstable material is encountered which will not provide suitable
foundation, fill with concrete or stabilizing material specified hereinafter,
as directed.
§ 1.04 TRENCH EXCAVATION.
   (A)   The width of the trench shall be six inches minimum on each side of
the pipe bell for a distance at least two feet above the top of the pipe. The
sides of the trench shall be kept as nearly vertical as practicable within the
limits of excavating codes.
   (B)   Trench bottom shall be carefully excavated to the specified, and level
trench bottom to provide uniform bearing and support for full length of pipe;
provide bell holes at each pipe joint; and allow access completely around
circumference of pipe for proper joining operations. Trench bottom shall
conform to best construction practice as recommended by pipe manufacturer.
   (C)   Trench bottoms carried below required grade shall be backfilled to
proper elevations with IDOT gradation three gravel or crushed stone as
specified for pipe bedding, compacted to 95% standard proctor density.
   (D)   When unstable material is encountered which may not provide a suitable
foundation for the pipe, the engineer shall be notified immediately so that he
or she may investigate the questionable material to determine its suitability
for pipe foundation. If the material is considered unsuitable for foundations,
the engineer will specify and authorize remedial measures in writing.
   (E)   If the removal of unsuitable material is authorized, it shall be
replaced with trench stabilizing material. A minimum of four inches of pipe
bedding cushion shall be provided on top of the stabilizing material to prevent
point loading.
   (F)   Over-excavation of unsuitable material and replacement with suitable
bedding material within payment lines shall be measured by the engineer and
paid for by the cubic yard.
   (G)   Any excavation under or around utilities, where overhead clearance
prevents the use of a machine, or under trees and shrubs where shown on the
plans, shall be excavated by hand.
§ 1.05 ROCK EXCAVATION.
   (A)   Rock excavation, where necessary, shall be kept well in advance of the
pipe laying. When rock is encountered, it shall be stripped of earth and the
engineer notified, in order that the same may be cross-sectioned, measurements
made and recorded. Provide minimum clearance of four inches below and on each
side of pipe.
   (B)   Written approval must be obtained from the city before explosives may
be used. If explosives are permitted, detailed plans must be submitted

approved by the engineer, the contractor shall backfill with material removed
for the excavation except where sand backfill is specified. No debris, frozen
earth, large clods, stones or other unsuitable material shall be allowed as
backfill material. The contractor shall simultaneously backfill on all sides of
the structure and compact the material in nine inch lifts to a density not less
than that specified for the adjacent trench (95% minimum). Backfill shall be
terminated at finish grade as shown on the plans and prepared for surface
restoration as specified for adjacent trenches. The contractor shall dispose of
all excess material as directed by the engineer in an approved disposal area.
§ 1.15 TRENCH BACKFILL.
   (A)   All sewer trenches shall be backfilled immediately after the engineer
has inspected and approved the work of laying pipe but in no case shall more
than 400 feet of sewer trench be open ahead of the backfilling.
   (B)   (1)   Backfill at the sides of the pipe and to a point 12 inches over
the top of the pipe shall be carefully placed and compacted in not more than
six inch layers. Backfill shall be compacted to 95% standard proctor density.
Backfilling at the sides of the pipe shall be carried on simultaneously on both
sides in such a manner as to prevent displacement of the pipe. Backfill
material around the pipe shall not contain large clods or other foreign matter.
No frozen material, debris or organic matter shall be placed within two inches

engineer is unsuitable.
         (b)   Compaction. In any excavation directly under and within a 1:
1 slope of existing or proposed streets, alleys, drives or sidewalk surfaces,
sand or lime screenings material shall be compacted in nine inch lifts to 95%
of standard proctor density until two and one-half feet below the bottom of
pavement, at which point select native material shall be compacted in nine inch
lifts to 95% of standard proctor density. In lieu of sand or lime screening
backfill, select native material may be compacted in nine inch lifts to 95% of
standard proctor density. Backfill materials in excavations in all other areas
within the street right-of-way and easement areas shall be compacted in nine
inch lifts to 95% of standard proctor density.
         (c)   Backfilling in freezing weather. Backfilling shall not be done
in freezing weather except by permission of the engineer. Backfill shall not

tightly plugged. Pneumatic plugs, having a sealing length equal to or greater
than the diameter of the pipe to be tested, shall be placed in both ends of the
test section and inflated to 25 psi. Air shall be slowly added to the test
section until the air pressure within the test section reaches a point 4.0 psi
greater than the average back pressure due to the ground water table. This
shall be accomplished by adding 0.43 psig to the initial pressures for each
foot the groundwater table is above the center line of the pipe. Do not exceed
ten psi total pressure in the line. All plugs shall be checked for leakage and
the air shall be allowed to stabilize at least two minutes before the actual
test begins. After the stabilization period, the pressure within the test
section shall be decreased to 3.50 psig above the average groundwater back-
pressure, and the time in seconds measured for the pressure to drop 1.0 psig to
2.5 psig above the average groundwater back-pressure.
   (E)   If the measured time is equal to or greater than the test time given
in Table I below, the line shall be deemed free from significant defects and
acceptable. If the measured time is less than the required ASTM duration, the
source or sources of leakage shall be located and corrected. If, after all
apparent sources of air leakage are corrected, and there is still difficulty in
meeting the minimum specification time, an infiltration or exfiltration test
shall be conducted to determine the acceptability of the line.

density. If the natural moisture of the fill material is in excess of the
specified moisture range, each layer will be disced and dried until the
moisture content falls within the specified moisture range. If the natural
moisture content of the fill material falls below the specified moisture range,
additional moisture must be added to bring it to the specified range.
§ 4.03 PREPARATION OF SUBGRADE.
   (A)   The surface of the subgrade when excavated, rolled and compacted shall
conform to the designed profile and cross sections so that it is not higher
than the designed elevations and at no point lower than 0.05 feet below design
elevations.
   (B)   The subgrade shall be so constructed as to have uniform stability for
a width at least equal to that of the proposed pavement, plus one foot on each
side, or full width between previously placed curb and gutter sections.
   (C)   Stones over four inches in size shall be removed from the loosened
portion of the subgrade and disposed of as directed by the engineer.
   (D)   Depressions that develop during rolling shall be filled with suitable
material, and rolling shall continue until the subgrade is uniformly firm,
properly shaped and substantially true to grade and cross-section.
   (E)   Material, other than sand, which will not compact readily under the
roller shall be removed and replaced with material which will compact readily,
and that portion of the subgrade shall be rolled again.
   (F)   Rolling of the subgrade shall extend for at least 12 inches outside
each edge of the proposed bottom of the pavement. Piles or ridges of earth or
material that seriously interferes with the operation of finishing the pavement
shall be removed from the shoulders.
   (G)   During the process of constructing the subgrade, the soil shall be
maintained in a condition, sufficiently moist as to facilitate compaction and
produce a firm, compact surface. Such sprinkling or wetting of the finished
subgrade will be required, as may be necessary to ensure a reasonable moisture
content.
   (H)   Perform proof rolling with a truck loaded to the maximum single legal
axle gross weight of 20,000 pounds or the maximum tandem axle gross weight of
34,000 pounds. Operate trucks at less than ten mph. Make multiple passes for
every lane. The subgrade will be considered to be unstable if, under the
operation of the loaded truck, the surface shows yielding (soil wave in front
of the loaded tires) or rutting of more than two inches, measured from the top
to the bottom of the rut at the outside edges. The expense of such load testing
shall be the contractor’s expense.
   (I)   (1)   Unstable subgrade conditions shall be noted by the engineer and
repaired to the extent required by the engineer.
      (2)   Such repairs shall be made as follows.

of this excavation consists of earthen material that will not compact to the
proper density, the earthen materials shall be stabilized via cement or fly ash
stabilization, replacement of unstabilized earth with IDOT gradation 13 or
other stabilizing method approved by the engineer.
         (c)   The engineer may decide, in lieu of the above, to specify
strengthening of the pavement structure in unstable areas; this work to be paid
for as an extra work item.
         (d)   When the bottom of the excavation is suitably stable to support
layers of compacted earth, the excavation will be filled with suitable backfill
materials and compacted in no more than six inch lifts to 95% optimum density
as shown by the Standard Proctor Test. Backfill materials may be either IDOT
gradation 30 crushed stone or suitable earth backfill approved by the engineer.
         (e)   The source of earth backfill shall be approved by the engineer
prior to the use of the material.
         (f)   After the subgrade has been repaired, it shall be shaped to
final cross-section and elevation. Visual checks shall then be made by the
engineer to determine any soft or spongy spots. Any such areas so detected
shall again be repaired, provided they are within the top six inches of the
subgrade.
         (g)   The subgrade shall be kept shaped and drained at all times to
prevent the development of soft or spongy areas. In no case shall any
improvement be placed on muddy subgrade or one that has not been checked and
approved. Delays resulting in the contractor’s failure to adequately protect
the subgrade shall be recorded. Subgrade repairs resulting from the
contractor’s negligence shall be the contractor’s expense.
         (h)   Accurate records on subgrade repairs, signed by the inspector,
shall be kept. The inspector’s signature upon such daily records shall be the
Inspector’s approval of daily effort expended, quantities of material compacted
and quality of workmanship. These records shall be used as a basis of payment.

of the strip is approximately one-half inch below the top of the finished
pavement at all points. They shall be inserted continuously from the back of
the integral curb or of the pavement on one side to the back of the integral
curb or the pavement on the other side. Said strips shall be held securely to
grade and alignment so that there is no appreciable movement of the same from
the original position after placing and finishing of the concrete. Tamping,
striking, floating and finishing shall be carried continuously across the
joint. At the proper time after finishing, the concrete above the top of the
joint filler shall be removed so as to expose the joint filler and the edges of
the concrete shall be finished with a tool of one-half inch radius. The space
between the top of the expansion joint and the top of the pavement shall be
filled with hot expansion joint filler has herein specified.

§ 1 FINDINGS.
§ 1.1 MS4 PERMIT.
   The United States EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(“NPDES”) permit program (“program”), administered by the State Department of
Natural Resources (“IDNR”), requires that cities meeting certain demographic
and environmental impact criteria obtain from the IDNR an NPDES permit for the
discharge of storm water from a municipal separate storm sewer system (“MS4”)
(“MS4 permit”). The City of Eldridge (“city”) is subject to the program and is
required to obtain, and has obtained, an MS4 permit; the city’s MS4 permit is
on file at the office of the City Clerk and is available for public inspection
during regular office hours.
§ 1.2 APPLICATION.
   The program requires certain individuals engaged in construction activities
(applicant or applicants) to submit an application to the IDNR for a state
NPDES general permit #2. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, every
applicant bears final and complete responsibility for compliance with a state
NPDES general permit #2 and a city construction site erosion and sediment
control (“COSESCO”) permit and any other requirement of state or federal law or
administrative rule.
§ 1.3 OBJECTIVES OF PERMIT.
   As a condition of the city’s MS4 permit, the city is obliged to undertake
primary responsibility for administration and enforcement of the program by
adopting a COSESCO ordinance designed to achieve the following objectives:
   § 1.3.1. Any person, firm, sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation,
state agency or political subdivision (“applicant”) required by law or
administrative rule to apply to the IDNR for a state NPDES general permit #2
shall also be required to obtain from the city a construction site erosion and
sediment control permit (“city COSESCO permit”) in addition to and not in lieu
of the state NPDES general permit #2; and
   § 1.3.2. The city shall have primary responsibility for inspection,
monitoring and enforcement procedures to promote applicants’ compliance with
state NPDES general permits #2 and city COSESCO permits.
§ 1.4 FUNDING.
   No state or federal funds have been made available to assist the city in
administering and enforcing the program. Accordingly, the city shall fund its
application, inspection, monitoring and enforcement responsibilities entirely
by fees imposed on the owners of properties which are made subject to the
program by virtue of state and federal law, and/or other sources of funding
established by a separate ordinance.
§ 1.5 TERMS.
   Terms used in this chapter shall have the meanings specified in the program.
§ 2 APPLICATION PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING AND MAINTAINING A CITY CONSTRUCTION
SITE EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL (COSESCO) PERMIT.
§ 2.1 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   All persons required by law or administrative rule to obtain a state NPDES
general permit #2 from the IDNR are required to obtain a city COSESCO permit.
§ 2.2 PERMIT APPLICATION FORMS.
   Applications for city COSESCO permits shall be made on forms approved by the
city which may be obtained from the office of the Community Development
Department (Assistant City Administrator).
§ 2.3 PAYMENT OF FEES.
   An applicant for a city COSESCO permit shall pay fees as follows:
   § 2.3.1. An application fee at the time of application in the amount of $50;
   § 2.3.2. For each inspection required by this chapter, the applicant shall
pay an inspection fee in the amount of $50; and
   § 2.3.3. Failure of the applicant to pay an inspection fee within 30 days of
billing shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
§ 2.4 MATERIALS REQUIRED FOR PERMIT.
   An applicant in possession of a state NPDES general permit #2 issued by the
IDNR shall immediately submit to the city full copies of the materials
described below as a basis for the city to determine whether to issue a city
COSESCO permit:
   § 2.4.1. Applicant’s plans, specifications and supporting materials
previously submitted to the IDNR in support of applicant’s application for the
state NPDES general permit #2;
   § 2.4.2. Applicant’s authorizations issued pursuant to applicant’s state
NPDES general permit #2;
   § 2.4.3. A storm water pollution prevention plan (“SWPPP”) prepared in
accordance with this chapter;
   § 2.4.4. Evidence or plan showing topsoil preservation during development
activities. Individuals engaged in land disturbing activities shall minimize
soil compaction and preserve topsoil that exists on site. During mass grading
operations, topsoil shall be stripped, stockpiled and remain within the area
covered by the applicable General Permit No. 2 authorization. Excess topsoil
may be removed from the site only upon written approval of the City Engineer
where the individual can show that the additional topsoil is not needed to meet
the city's storm water requirements; and
   § 2.4.5. Evidence or plan to provide compost in an amount equivalent to that
needed to cover all areas to be seeded, sodded or otherwise have vegetation
established to a depth of one and one-half inches and shall be bladed, disced,
tilled or otherwise mixed with soil to a depth of four inches, or shall provide
another mechanism for ground treatment that is approved by the Building
Official and City Engineer. For use in this section, sod may account for a
maximum of one inch of ground treatment.

§ 7.01 REVIEW BY ENGINEER, ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER, DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC WORKS AND
COUNTY ZONING ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   Immediately upon the filing of eight copies of the preliminary plat,
the Administrative Officer shall retain four copies for his or her file (on one
copy is to be indicated the Board and/or Council action on the plat) and shall
distribute the remaining copies of the plat as follows: one copy to the
Engineer, one copy to the Director, one copy to the Board and, where a proposed
plat is outside the city limits but within the area of subdivision
jurisdiction, one copy to the County Zoning Administrator.
   (B)   Review by the Soil Conservation Service may be sought where erosion or
sedimentation control considerations are evident. The Engineer, Administrative
Officer, Director and, where concerned, the County Zoning Administrator, shall
have the opportunity to review the plat and application materials to assure the
proposed subdivision complies with applicable regulations and requirements and
report upon such to the Board. The Administrative Officer shall determine if
the proposed subdivision complies with
Title D, Chapter 2. The Administrative Officer shall also report upon
conditions of the site or adjacent properties which, while not evident in the
application materials, may affect development upon the site.
§ 7.02 REVIEW BY BOARD.
   The Board shall review the preliminary plat and application materials to
assure compliance with the comprehensive plan. Particular note shall be made
that any planned public facilities of the community falling in the area of the
subdivision being reviewed are accommodated in the proposed plat; they also
shall review the reports of the Administrative Officer, Engineer and Director
with regard to the proposed subdivision. Within 30 days of the subdivider’s
filing for preliminary approval, the Board shall make known to the Council and
Clerk that the preliminary plat has been approved; approved subject to
modification; or disapproved; if disapproved, the Board shall submit to the
subdivider, with a copy to the Clerk, a statement setting forth reasons for
disapproval, indicating particularly the aspects in which the proposed plat
fails to conform to chapter requirements. Failure of the Board to act within 30
days of filing the plat with the Administrative Officer shall be deemed
approval of the plat, unless, however, an extension of time is mutually agreed
upon by the subdivider and Board. The Board shall maintain one copy of the
preliminary plat in its files with its action noted upon it.
§ 7.03 REQUIRE A NEIGHBORHOOD PLAN.
   Where a tract of land proposed for subdivision is part of a larger, logical
subdivision unit in relation to the city as a whole, the Board may, before
approval, require the developer to prepare a plat for the entire area or
neighborhood, such plan to be used by the Board as an aid in judging the
proposed plat. The Engineer may be commissioned to aid in the preparation of
this plan and furnish such surveys and data as may be necessary.

frontage on a public street. No lot shall have a frontage width of less than 40
feet.
§ 22.06 REVERSE FRONTAGE NOT NORMALLY ALLOWED.
   Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except where
essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic
arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
The Board may require a planting screen easement of at least ten feet across
which there shall be no access.
§ 22.07 LAND REMNANTS.
   If remnants of land exist after subdividing with no apparent future use,

feet inside the property line with the objective of the receiving of
renumeration for access to any improved street will not be allowed.
§ 22.09 ACRE SUBDIVISION.
   Whenever the area is divided into lots containing one to three acres,
inclusive, and there are indications that such lots will eventually be re-
subdivided into small building lots, consideration shall be given to the street
and lot arrangement of the original subdivision so that additional minor
streets can be opened which will permit a logical arrangement of smaller lots.
Easements provided for the future opening and extension of such streets may, at
the discretion of the Council, be made a requirement of the plat.
§ 23.00 GENERAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR EASEMENTS.
§ 23.01 NECESSARY UTILITY EASEMENTS TO BE PROVIDED.
   Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be
provided for utilities and shall be at least ten feet wide on each side of all
rear lot lines, side lot lines and front lot lines where necessary. The
location of the proposed easements shall be concurred to by the utility
companies for which they are intended in writing. A copy of the concurrence
shall be provided to the Community Development Director prior to approval of
the plat by the City Council. It shall be the developer’s responsibility to
obtain the necessary concurrence.
§ 23.02 SERVICE EASEMENTS.
   A blanket easement shall be provided to allow individual utility service
lines to be extended from utility trunk lines; provided that the individual
service line traverses only that parcel on which the structure to be served is

way, conforming substantially with the lines of such watercourse, and
additional width or construction as deemed necessary by the Board.
§ 23.04 FREE ACCESS OF AUTHORITIES TO EASEMENTS.
   No tree, shrub or structure shall be placed or erected in any easement for
utility or drainage purposes preventing the proper authorities free access to
and use of such easements at any time.
§ 24.00 STREET CLASSIFICATION AND CONTROL OF ACCESS TO ADJOINING PROPERTY.
   (A)   Access control shall be granted to the city for all frontages on
streets classified as major arterials or minor arterials as shown in the future
street plan of the comprehensive plan. Right-of-way widths shall be provided as
specified in the future street plan.
   (B)   Direct access to major and minor arterial streets may be allowed only
when it is clearly demonstrated that such access will not have a significant
negative impact on the present and forecast traffic flow of the arterial
street. For large developments or for uses which will generate a heavy traffic
volume, a traffic engineering study may be required to be submitted by the
developer in order to determine the full impact of the proposed access point
prior to approval of such access point. The use of frontage roads, joint-access
driveways, deceleration lanes or other traffic control devices or designs may
be required to assure minimum impact on traffic flows.
§ 25.00 MINIMUM IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED - GENERAL INFORMATION.

   Whenever any subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel
or stream, the subdivider shall, at his or her own expense, make adequate
provision for straightening or widening the channel so that it will properly
carry the surface water, and shall also provide and dedicate to the city an
easement along each side of the stream, which easement shall be for the purpose
of widening, improving or protecting the stream. The width of such easement
shall not be less than 20 feet, and the total width of the easement shall be
adequate to provide for any necessary channel relocations and straightenings.

subdivisions at higher standards. The subdivider is encouraged at any time to
surpass these regulations.
   (B)   Variance, general. The Council hereby reserves authority to vary the
strict application of the provisions herein contained, but such variances shall
be exercised only upon written recommendation of the Board and only after a
written findings of fact is made by the Board that:
      (1)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of the regulations was adhered to;
      (2)   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire
for financial gain;
      (3)   The conditions creating the need of a variance are unique and are
not applicable generally to other property and have not been created by any
person having an interest in the property; and
      (4)   The granting of the variations will not be detrimental to public
safety, health or welfare, or injurious to other property or improvements in
the area in which the property is located.
   (C)   Variances, large scale development. The standards and requirements of
these regulations may be modified by the Council in case of a plan or program
for a complete community or neighborhood unit. Such modification shall not be
made until after written recommendation of the Board, which recommendation may
be given when, in the judgment of the Board, the specific plan or program
presented provides adequate public space and improvements for the circulation,
recreation, light, air and service needs of the tract when fully developed and
populated, and which also provides such covenants or other legal provisions as
will assure conformity to and achievement of the plan.
§ 32.03 AMENDMENTS.
   Amendments to this subdivision chapter shall be made by the Council as
provided by statute; provided, however, that no amendment shall be adopted

deemed to be approved by the Board.
§ 32.04 BUILDING PERMIT.
   No building permit shall be issued by any governing official for the
construction of any structure within a subdivision approved for platting or
replanting until required utility facilities have been installed and made ready
to service the property, and roadways providing access to the subject lot or
lots have been reconstructed or are in the process of constructions.
§ 32.05 PENALTIES.
   Any violation of the provisions of this chapter by any person, firm or
corporation shall be considered a municipal infraction, as provided in Title A,
Chapter 2, §§
3.01 and
3.02. Each day a violation is permitted to continue shall constitute a separate
offense.
§ 32.06 CONFLICT WITH PRIVATE DEEDS AND COVENANTS.
   In case of any conflict between this chapter or part thereof, and the whole
or part of any existing or future private covenants or deeds, the most
restrictive shall apply. However, it shall not be the responsibility of the

lines shall be construed to lie midway between the main tracks of such railroad

of the piece of parcel, lot or lots, block or blocks or portions thereof,
according to the registered or recorded plat of such land; and
      (2)   A plat, in duplicate, drawn to a scale in such form as may, from

§ 15.06 STANDARDS FOR VARIANCES.
   (A)   The Board shall not vary the regulations of this chapter, as
authorized in this section, unless there is evidence presented to it in each
specific case that:
      (1)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience
if the strict letter of the regulations were to be carried out;
      (2)   The conditions upon which a petition for a variation is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable,
generally, to other property within the same zoning classification;
      (3)   The purpose of the variance is not based exclusively upon a desire
to make money out of the property;
      (4)   The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by this chapter and
has not been created by any persons presently having an interest in the
property;
      (5)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in
which the property is located;
      (6)   The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light
and air to adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion of the
public streets, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety or
substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood; and
      (7)   The purpose of the variance shall not be to establish a use
otherwise excluded from the particular district in which it is requested.
   (B)   The Board may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the
premises benefitted by a variance as may be necessary to comply with the
standards established in this section.
§ 15.07 AUTHORIZED VARIANCES.
   Variances from the regulations of this chapter shall be granted by the Board
only in accordance with the standards established in §
15.06 of this chapter and may be granted only in the following instances and in
no others:
   (A)   To permit any yard or setback line of less dimension than required by
the applicable regulations;
   (B)   To permit any building or structure to exceed the height limitations
imposed by the applicable regulations;
   (C)   To permit the use of a lot or lots for a use otherwise prohibited

event shall the respective area and width of the lot or lots be less than 70%
of the required area and width;
   (D)   To permit the same off-street parking facility to qualify as required
facilities for two or more uses provided that substantial use of such facility
by each use does not take place at approximately the same hours of the same
days of the week;
   (E)   To reduce the parking and loading requirements in any of the districts
whenever the character or use of a building is such as to make unnecessary the
full provision of parking or loading facilities, or where such regulations
would impose an unreasonable hardship upon the use of the lot, as contrasted
with merely being granted for a convenience;
   (F)   To permit the alteration or enlargement of an existing building or use
located on premises in a district which prohibits that use of land or building,
or the height and area of buildings existing at the time of the adopting of
this chapter where such alteration or enlargement is a necessary incident to
the use of the structure existing at the time of the adoption, amendment or
change of this chapter; and
   (G)   To permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming building which has
been damaged by explosion, fire, act of God or the public enemy to the extent
of more than 65% of its market value, as determined by the Board, where the
Board finds some compelling public necessity requiring a continuance of the
nonconforming use.
§ 15.08 FINDING OF FACT.
   All decisions by the Board on requests for variances must be supplemented
with a written finding of fact stating the conformity or nonconformity, as the
case may be, of its decision with the standards set forth in this section.

   The concurring vote of three members of the Board shall be necessary to
grant a variance. No decision of the Board granting a variance shall be valid

building permit is obtained within such period and the erection or alteration
of a building is started or the use is commenced within such a period.
§ 15.10 EFFECT OF DENIAL OF VARIANCE.

Board may, by rule, require.

acts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his or her opinion, cause

time and place as shall be established by the Board.

§ 17.00 USES ON REVIEW AND OTHER POWERS OF THE BOARD.
§ 17.01 USES ON REVIEW.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   The development and administration of this chapter is based upon
the division of the city into zoning districts, within which districts the use
of land and buildings and structures in relation to the land are substantially
uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are certain uses which, because
of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any
particular district or districts, without consideration in each case, of the
impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the
particular use at the particular locations.
      (2)   Such uses on review fall into two categories:
         (a)   Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public
interest; and
         (b)   Uses entirely private in character but of such an unusual nature
that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their
impact upon neighboring property or public facilities.
   (B)   Initiation of use on review. Any person having a freehold interest in
land, a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession or a contractual
interest which may become a freehold interest or an exclusive possessory
interest, either of which is specifically enforceable, may file an application
to use such land for one or more of the uses on review provided for in this
chapter in the zoning district in which the land is located.
   (C)   Application for use on review. An application for a use on review
shall be filed with the Zoning Enforcement Officer on a form as he or she shall
prescribe. The application shall be accompanied by such plans and/or date
prescribed by the Board and shall include a statement in writing by the
applicant and adequate evidence showing that the proposed use will, on review,
conform to the standards set forth in division (F) below hereinafter. Such
application shall be forwarded from the Zoning Enforcement Officer to the Board
with a request for a public hearing and report relative thereto.
   (D)   Hearing an application. Upon receipt in proper form of the application
and statement referred to in division (C) above, the Board shall hold at least
one public hearing on the proposed use on review. The hearing shall be
conducted and a record of such proceedings shall be preserved in such manner as
the Board shall, by rule, prescribe from time to time.
   (E)   Notice of hearing. Notice of time and place of such hearing shall be
published not less than four days preceding said hearing and at least once in
one or more newspapers of general circulation in the city. Supplemental or
additional notices may be published or distributed as the Board may, by rule,
prescribe from time to time.
   (F)   Standards. No use on review shall be granted by the Board, unless such
Board shall find:
      (1)   That the establishment, maintenance or operation of the use on
review will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety,
morals, comfort or general welfare;
      (2)   That the use on review will not be injurious to the use and
enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already
permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the
neighborhood;
      (3)   That the establishment of the use on review will not impede the
normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for
permitted uses in the district;
      (4)   That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary
facilities have been or are being provided;
      (5)   That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide
ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public
streets; and
      (6)   That the use on review shall, in all other respects, conform to the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such
regulations may, in each instance, be modified by the Board.
   (G)   Conditions and guarantees. Prior to the granting of any use on review,
the Board shall stipulate such conditions and restrictions upon the
establishment, location, construction, maintenance and operation of the use on
review as is deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest and to
secure compliance with the standards and requirements specified in division (F)
above. In all cases in which uses on review are granted, the Board shall
require such evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary as proof that the
conditions stipulated in connection therewith are being and will be complied
with.
   (H)   Effect of denial of a use on review. No application for a use on
review that has been denied wholly or in part by the Board shall be resubmitted
for a period of one year from the date of said order of denial, except on the
grounds of new evidence or proof of change of conditions found to be valid by
the Zoning Enforcement Officer.
   (I)   Revocation of a use on review. In any case where a use on review has
not been established within one year after the date of granting thereof, then,
without further action by the Board, the use on review or authorization shall
be null and void.
(Ord. 2025-21, passed 9-8-2025)
§ 17.02 OTHER POWERS OF THE BOARD.
   The Board is hereby vested with the following additional authority and
jurisdiction.
   (A)   Interpretation of district map. Where the applications of the rules of
interpretation of district boundaries contained in §
8.00 of this chapter leaves a reasonable doubt to the boundary between the two
districts, the Board, after notice to the owners of the property and after
public hearing, shall interpret the map in such a way as to carry out the
intent and purposes of this chapter.
   (B)   Temporary uses and permits. The Board may issue a permit for the
temporary use of a building or premises in any district for a purpose or use
that does not conform to the regulations prescribed by this chapter; provided
that such use be of a true temporary nature and does not involve the erection
of substantial buildings. Such permit shall be granted in the form of a
temporary and revocable permit for not more than a 12-month period, subject to
such conditions as will safeguard the public health, safety, convenience and
general welfare.
   (C)   Certain industries in “I-1” Districts. In determining whether certain
uses shall be located in a “I-1” or “I-2” District, the Board shall give due
regard to the nature and condition of all adjacent uses and structures, and the
consistency therewith of the proposed use and development. Before authorizing a
use for a location in an “I-1” District, the Board shall determine whether the
proposed use would be hazardous, harmful, noxious, offensive or a nuisance to
the surrounding neighborhood by reason of noise, smoke, odor, vibration, dust
and dirt, cinders, noxious gases, glare and heat, fire and safety hazards,
sewage wastes and pollution, transportation and traffic, aesthetic and
psychological effects.
   (D)   Rear yard setback relief.
      (1)   To hear and decide applications in specific cases such relief from
the terms of this section with respect to rear yard setbacks that will not be
contrary to the public interest, where literal enforcement of the requirements
result in practical limitations for the use of the property and where granting
of the special exception will not significantly alter the essential character
of the surrounding neighborhood.
      (2)   For purposes of this division (D) only:
         (a)   Application. Application for rear yard setback reduction shall
not be accepted unless the following conditions are met:
               1.   The reduction of the rear yard shall not allow for a rear
yard of less than 25 feet;
               2.   The structure being considered shall be a single-family,
detached dwelling in an R-1 Single-Family Residential District. Attached
dwellings, duplexes, multi-family, attached carriage houses or townhouse type
structures shall not be considered;
               3.   Application shall not be submitted to the city within two
years of the date of the current certificate of occupancy as determined by the
Building Official;
               4.   The area occupied by the primary structure shall count
towards the percentage of required yard occupied in §
33.02 of this chapter;
               5.   A house location survey by a state licensed land surveyor
must be provided and the rear property pins shall be exposed or re-established;
               6.   Petitioner shall be signatory to an affidavit that all
restrictive covenants have been reviewed and are being complied with;
               7.   The encroachment shall not be allowed into the area of any
easement for any purpose;
               8.   No part of the primary residence shall be used as a church,
child care center, home occupation, bed and breakfast, rental for a period
where the contract is less than 30 days or other use where a hearing is
required. Approval of this rear yard reduction shall cause denial of any
subsequent application for any use under this section;
               9.   The height of the encroachment shall not exceed the highest
point of the coping of a flat roof, the deck line of a mansard roof or to the
mean height level between eaves and ridges on gable, hip or gambrel roofs as
determined by the Building Official; and
               10.   The width of the encroachment shall not exceed 50% of the
width of the primary structure including attached garage.
         (b)   Standards. Standards include the following.
               1.   Approval of rear yard setback relief under this division
(D)(2)(b) shall be by supermajority.
               2.   In order to approve, the Board must find that the following
standards are met:
                  a.   The exception is reasonably necessary due to practical
difficulties;
                  b.   It will not impair an adequate supply of light and air
to adjacent properties;
                  c.   It will not unreasonably increase congestion in public
streets;
                  d.   It will not increase the danger of fire or endanger the
public safety;
                  e.   It will not unreasonably diminish or impair established
property values within the surrounding area;
                  f.   The exception is in harmony with the essential character
of the neighborhood of the land in question.
                  g.   It will not impair the public health, safety, comfort,

by the Zoning Enforcement Officer, shall provide each applicant requesting a
change to the official zoning map with at least two rezoning notification signs
containing the time, date and place of the Commission meeting. Said signs shall
be clearly posted by the applicant on the property for which the request has
been made. On large parcels, additional signs may be required to be posted. At
least one sign must be placed so that it may be seen from the street, and in
the case of through lots and/or corner lots, a sign shall be posted on both
street frontages. When a property is in the interior of a block or tract of
land, additional signs may be required to be posted adjacent to and facing the

in an amount established from time to time by resolution of City Council.
   (B)   Posting of notifications signs. Notification signs shall be posted at
least ten days before the Commission meeting date noted on the sign. It shall
be the applicant’s responsibility to see that said signs remain posted during
the entire ten-day period. If the signs are not posted in accordance with the
preceding requirements, the Commission may delay action on the application,
except that if the applicant satisfies the Commission that the signs were
initially posted at least ten days prior to the Commission meeting and that the
applicant made diligent efforts to keep the signs posted during the entire
period, and that only circumstances beyond the applicant’s control prevented a
continuous posting, then the Commission may act on the application.

must be removed within 72 hours after the meeting date listed on the sign.

amendment, unless it finds that the adoption of such amendment is in the public
interest and is not solely for the interest of the applicant. The Commission
may recommend the adoption of an amendment changing the zoning classification
of the property in question to any higher classification than that requested by
the applicant. For the purpose of this division (B)(5), the “SA” District shall
be considered the highest classification and the “I-2” District shall be
considered the lowest classification.

bedrooms or combination. The total density may range between one dwelling unit
and 15% over what the rezoned tract could have had under ideal conditions if
developed under the underlying zoning classification.
§ 23.11 SPECIAL PROVISIONS.
   All special provisions in the base zone are required in the overlay planned
residence zone, unless specifically changed or noted by the Commission and City
Council on the development plan.
§ 23.12 DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
   In order to obtain a building permit in a planned residence district, the
developer must prepare a development plan or plans as the Commission and City
Council may approve. The Commission and the City Council may approve
generalized concepts for the entire tract and require a more detailed
development plan as phases of the project are submitted in accordance with the
development schedule. The development plan may be submitted with preliminary or
final plats which may be needed, or may be submitted separately if the
requirements of
Title D, Chapter 1 have been met. The development plan shall be submitted and
approved by the commission and the City Council in the same manner as final
plats as specified in Title D, Chapter 1, §§
11.00 through
15.00. The development shall contain those items listed in §
30.00 of this chapter which the Commission or City Council may deem necessary.
The development plan shall be filed with an appropriate application form and
fee of $50. The developer will also reimburse the city for any review made by
the City Engineer. The Commission shall record in its minutes where the
development plan makes appropriate use of the flexibility possible in this
zone.
§ 23.13 TIME LIMIT.
   The development plan shall be filed with the city within a submittal period
of one year after the approval of the planned residential zoning. The one-year
period of submittal may be extended up to one additional year by City Council
resolution. If the development plan is not filed within the submittal period,
the zoning of the tract shall automatically revert to the prior zoning district
effective at the end of the submittal, or upon denial or withdrawal of the
development plan, if after the end of the submittal period. Planned residence
zoning can be re-established by a new zoning procedure as stated in §§
18.01 through
18.07 of this chapter.
§ 23.14 SCHEDULE.
   In addition to the information in §
30.00 of this chapter, the development plan shall include a development
schedule indicating the stages and dates of actual development. If the
development becomes more than 270 days behind the approved schedule, the City
Council may, by resolution, remove the planned residence zoning and replace it
with the prior zoning district for all or part of the zoning district, or the
City Council may amend the development schedule by resolution as it may deem
appropriate.
§ 23.15 ALTERNATIVES.
   The developer may submit the development plan with the rezoning application
and use the one-year period to obtain approval of the development schedule. The
developer may also submit with the application a preliminary development plan,
which, if approved, shall subsequently bind the Commission and City Council to
approval of a development plan to the extent of the items contained in the
preliminary plan. Where the developer has extra density, it should be expected
that some aspect of the development shall work to the city’s benefit so as to
offset in some manner the extra cost incurred by the city in servicing the
extra people in the area.
§ 23.16 COMPLETED PROJECT.
   (A)   Upon completion of development, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall
notify the City Council. The City Council shall, upon its consideration and
agreement, pass a final resolution determining that the development is
complete.
   (B)   Any questions as to permitted development occurring after passage of
the final resolution shall be applied for to the Board of Adjustment in
accordance with normal Board procedures. The Board shall decide if the proposal
is in compliance with the intent and spirit and continued practical usefulness
of the plans and requirements of the planned residential district and may
approve amendments as it may deem necessary.

structures used primarily to provide office space. Some residential-type
structures, for both permanent and transient occupancy and including

§ 30.00 “PUD” PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
§ 30.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of the Planned Unit Development “PUD” District is to
promote to the extent possible:
      (1)   A maximum choice in the types of environment available to the
public by allowing a development that would not be possible under the strict
application of the other sections of this chapter;
      (2)   Permanent preservation of common open space and recreation areas
and facilities;
      (3)   A pattern of development to preserve natural vegetation,
topographic and geologic features;
      (4)   A creative approach to the use of land and related physical
facilities that results in better development, design and the construction of
aesthetic amenities;
      (5)   An efficient use of the land resulting in more economic networks of
utilities, streets and other facilities; and
      (6)   A land use which promotes the public health, safety, comfort,
morals and welfare.
   (B)   The “PUD” District is intended to provide for a development
incorporating a single type or a variety of related uses which are planned and
developed as a unit but departs from the normal standards and requirements of
other sections of this chapter.
   (C)   The “PUD” may provide amenities not otherwise required by law and may
establish facilities and open space greater than the minimums required by law.
Such development may consist of conventionally subdivided lots or provide for
development by a land use and zoning plan which establishes the location and
extent of the features of the “PUD” in keeping with the purpose of the plan.
   (D)   The foregoing purposes and principles shall not be interpreted to
permit the reduction of standards set forth in this section.
§ 30.02 PROCEDURE.

preparation of the preliminary “PUD” plan. The applications shall be
accompanied by a filing fee in an amount set by the Council, payable to the
city.
         (b)   To reduce the number of steps involved in the approval of a
planned unit development, a preliminary “PUD” plan meeting the requirements of
division (B)(2) below and §

reasons for the recommendation, and said recommendation shall set forth how the
proposal would be in the public interest, including, but not limited to,
findings of facts on the following:
            1.   In what respects the proposed plan is consistent with the
stated purpose of the planned unit development requirements;
            2.   The extent to which the proposed plan meets the requirements
and standards of the Planned Unit Development District;
            3.   The extent to which the proposed plan departs from the zoning
and subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the subject property,
including, but not limited to, the density, dimension, area, bulk and use and
the reasons why such departures are deemed to be in the public interest;
            4.   The physical design of the proposed plan and the manner in
which said design makes adequate provision for public services, provides

constitute approval of the final plan. Rather, it shall be deemed an expression
of approval to the layout submitted on the preliminary plan as a guide to the
preparation of the final plan which will be submitted for approval of the city
and subsequent recording upon the fulfillment of the requirements of these
regulations and conditions of the preliminary plan approval, if any. The final
plan shall be approved as the final land use and zoning plan if it conforms
substantially with the preliminary land use and zoning plan.
            2.   The final plan may be considered as a preliminary and final
plan and may be submitted for preliminary and final approval, if all of the
land is to be developed at one time and if all requirements hereof are met.
      (3)   Approval of final plan.
         (a)   The final “PUD” plan shall be submitted to the Zoning
Enforcement Officer who shall refer same to the Commission. The final “PUD”
plan shall conform to the preliminary “PUD” plan as approved or subject to
minor changes, and may be submitted in stages with each stage reflecting the
approved preliminary plan; provided, however, that such stage conforms to all
requirements of these regulations.
         (b)   The required procedure for approval of a final plan shall be the
following.
            1.   A final “PUD” plan and other supporting data required for
approval shall be in accordance with the provisions of §
30.03 of this chapter. Final plans must be submitted for approval in accordance
with agreed-to scheduling, but not later than five years from the approval of
the preliminary plan by the Council. The Council may grant an extension in time
or the developer may resubmit an application; in the event that same is not
done, the Council shall initiate such zoning changes as it deems necessary to
preserve the public interest. If construction falls more than two years behind
the schedule filed with the final plan, the plan becomes subject to revocation.
The Zoning Enforcement Officer and the City Inspector shall monitor all pending
“PUD” projects and inform the Council of those six months or more behind
schedule.
            2.   The final plan and supporting data shall be submitted to the
Zoning Enforcement Officer for certification that the final plan is in
conformity with these regulations and in agreement with the approved
preliminary plan.
            3.   After review of the final plan, the Commission shall submit
the planned unit development plan to the Council with a recommendation for
approval, disapproval or approval with minor modifications as reviewed at the
public hearing. Any changes or modifications which arise subsequent to the
public hearing shall be specifically noted and referred to the Council who
shall determine whether the change constitutes a major or minor change and
whether another public hearing is required.
            4.   The Council shall, within 60 days, approve, disapprove or
extend the time period for another 60 days in taking action on the final plan.
            5.   All conditions, documents and plans required by the Council
must be delineated on the plan or agreed to in writing prior to council
approval.
      (4)   Recording the final “PUD” plan. The construction of any public
improvement in the “PUD” shall be initiated only after recording of the final
“PUD” plan with the County Recorder. Building permits are to be issued only
after the final “PUD” plan has been recorded with the County Recorder, and
shall be issued in full conformance with this chapter. The use of all parcels
in the “PUD” must be recorded on the plat along with the statement: “See the
City Code of Eldridge, Iowa § 30.00 “PUD” District”. The recording of the final
plan shall inform all who deal with the “PUD” of the restrictions placed upon
the land and will act as a zoning control device.
      (5)   Changes in the “PUD”. The “PUD” shall be developed according to the
approved and recorded final plan, except where authorized changes or amendments
are permitted. The recorded plan and supporting data together with all recorded
amendments shall be binding on the applicants, their successors, grantees and
assigns, and shall limit and control the use of premises and location of
structures in the “PUD” project as set forth therein.
         (a)   Major changes. A change in the approved preliminary “PUD” plan
or final “PUD” plan which alters the concept or intent of the planned unit
development, including a change in usage, the configuration, increase in floor
area or the height of buildings, an increase in intensity, a reduction of
proposed open space, a change in road locations or standards, a change in the
final governing agreement, provisions or covenants or other major changes,
shall be approved only by submission of a new preliminary “PUD” plan in
accordance with the procedures as previously set forth for the approval of
preliminary and final “PUD” plans. All approved major changes in the final
“PUD” plan shall be recorded with the County Recorder as amendments to the
final “PUD” plan.
         (b)   Minor changes. The Zoning Enforcement Officer may approve minor
changes in the planned unit development which do not change the concept of
intent of the development, without going through the “preliminary approval”

      (2)   For land, structures or uses actually used, occupied or operated on
the effective date of this chapter, there shall be provided such off-street
parking space as was required for such land, structures or uses by any previous
chapter. If such land, structures or uses are enlarged, expanded or changed
through the addition of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity,
additional employment or other unit of measurement specified herein, there
shall be provided, for that increment of expansion only, at least the amount of
off-street parking space that would be required hereunder if the increment were
a separate land, structure of use established or placed into operation after
the effective date of this chapter.
      (3)   For all uses established or placed into operation after the
effective date of this chapter, there shall be constructed, provided, preserved
and maintained the amount of off-street parking space hereinafter set forth.
      (4)   Whenever the intensity of use of any structure or premises shall be
increased through the addition of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating
capacity, additional employment or other unit of measurement, such additional
parking as required herein to provide for the expanded use shall be provided.
      (5)   Whenever the existing use of a building, structure or land area is
changed to a new use, parking facilities shall be provided as required by the
new use. However, if the use existed prior to the effective date of this
chapter, parking is required only in the amount that the new use would exceed
the requirements for the existing use if the latter were subject to the parking
provisions of this chapter.
      (6)   Parking in existence on the effective date of this chapter or that
was provided voluntarily after such effective date shall not hereafter be
reduced below, or if already less than, shall not further be reduced below, the
requirements of this chapter for a new use.
      (7)   All off-street parking space, whether or not required by this
chapter and when provided in accordance with the provisions of this chapter or
in accordance with the provisions of any former chapter, shall be used,
maintained and operated as hereinafter required.
      (8)   Parking for all types of uses may be provided either in garages or
open parking areas conforming with the provisions of this chapter.
      (9)   Where sufficient existing “public parking facilities” are located
so as to provide or supplement part or all of the required parking space, the
Board may reduce the number of spaces required for a particular use or group of
uses.
      (10)   Parking may be with or without charge.
§ 35.03 LOCATION.
   Off-street parking space shall be located on the same zoning lot as the use
for which provided, except as otherwise specifically provided.
   (A)   Special location plan.
      (1)   Off-street parking. Pursuant to the procedure hereinafter set forth
in §
35.04 of this chapter, either part or all of the required off-street parking
space may be located off the lot of the use for which the space is provided.
The following limitations shall apply to the “special location plan”.
      (2)   Separation from use. Off-street parking shall be located as
hereinafter specified; where a distance is specified, such distance shall be
the walking distance measured from the nearest point of the parking facility to
the nearest point of the building that such facility is required to serve. In
all Commercial Districts, parking facilities shall be located within 300 feet
of the building they are required to serve. In all Industrial Districts,
parking facilities shall be located within 600 feet of the building they are
required to serve.
   (B)   Application. All applications for approval of a “special location
plan” hereunder shall be filed with the Board by the owners of the entire land
area to be included within the “special location plan”, the owner or owners of
all structures then existing on said land area and all encumbrances of said
land area; shall contain sufficient evidence to establish to the satisfaction
of the Board that the applicants are the owners and encumbrances of the
designated land and structures; shall contain such information and
representation required by this chapter or deemed necessary; and shall include
plans showing the following details: the location of the uses or structures for
which off-street parking space is required and the location at which the off-
street parking space is to be provided.
   (C)   Parking lot setbacks. In the “SA”, “R-1”, “R-2” and “R-3” Districts,
for single-family and duplex structures, no vehicle shall be parked in any
front yard except upon a regularly constructed driveway. Parking lots for all
other uses shall be setback the distance indicated in the chart below. Parking
lots may be allowed in the front yard in an “SA”, “R-1”, “R-2” or R-3” District
if authorized by the Board of Adjustment and provided that the district does
not require that the front yard be landscaped and devoted to no other use, and
further provided that the parking is in accordance with all other chapter
provisions. In Commercial and Industrial Districts, parking lots shall be
setback as indicated in the chart below for each yard:
District Front Side Rear
District Front   Side    Rear
SA       30 feet 10 feet 30 feet
R-1      30 feet 8 feet  30 feet
R-2      25 feet 5 feet  30 feet
R-3      25 feet 5 feet  15 feet
C-1      20 feet 5 feet  5 feet
C-2      0 feet  5 feet  5 feet
C-3      15 feet 5 feet  5 feet
C-4      15 feet 5 feet  15 feet
C/I      10 feet 5 feet  10 feet
I-1      25 feet 5 feet  10 feet
I-2      25 feet 5 feet  10 feet
 
   (D)   Landscaping requirements. One tree for each seven parking spaces
provided on site shall be planted and maintained in the front yard or within
the parking lot. All trees shall be at least six feet tall at the time of
planting. For all vehicle use areas greater then 4,000 square feet, an area
equivalent to a minimum of 6% of the total vehicular use area shall be
landscaped. The required landscaping shall be located in the interior of the
vehicular use area. The interior landscaping may be provided in the corners of
the parking area, islands and strip plantings. All vehicular use areas must
terminate at least five feet from any exterior building wall. An exception may
be made where it is necessary to cross the non-vehicular use area to gain
access to the building and for drive up facilities, such as banks and
restaurants.
   (E)   Parkway. No parking shall be permitted between the property line and
the curb line or edge of the pavement or roadway in the event no curb exists.
   (F)   Combined space. Off-street parking space shall be provided for each
use. However, two or more uses located on the same zoning lot may jointly
provide for one combined parking facility.
      (1)   Where off-street parking space is combined and used jointly by two
or more uses having different standards for determining amount of off-street
parking space required, the parking space shall be adequate in area to provide
the sum total of off-street parking space requirements of all such uses.
      (2)   Where off-street parking space is combined and used jointly by two
or more uses having the same standard for determining the amount of off-street
parking space required, all such uses, for the purposes of this subsection,
shall be considered a single unit and the gross floor area of all such uses in
all structures on the same lot or the number of employees of all such uses in
all structures on the same lot as fixed by the applicable standard, shall be
taken as a single total for the purpose of determining the amount of off-street
parking space required.
   (G)   Sharing of space. Two or more uses may share the same off-street
parking space if the schedules of operation of all such uses are such that none
of the uses sharing the space requires the off-street parking space at the same
time as any other use sharing the space. Each such use that is sharing space
shall be considered as having provided such shared space individually.
   (H)   Design, development and maintenance. Every parcel of land hereafter
used as a public or private parking area, including a commercial parking lot
and also an automobile or trailer sales lot, shall be designed, developed and
maintained in accordance with the following requirements:
      (1)   Shall not be used for the sale, repair, dismantling or servicing of
any vehicles, equipment, materials or supplies, except when parking is a
permitted principal or special use;
      (2)   Shall be provided with an all-weather surfacing maintained, at all
times, in such a manner as to prevent the release of dust and to be free of
dust, trash and debris;
      (3)   Shall be pitch and drained so as to prevent the flow of water from
such areas onto adjoining property or onto streets or alleys that have no
drainage facilities;
      (4)   All weather surfacing shall be equivalent to a minimum of two
inches of asphaltic concrete placed over a suitable rolled stone base;
      (5)   Within the “I-1” and “I-2” Zoning Districts, or “P/M” with a use on
review, only those parking areas and driveways located between the building
line and the street right-of-way shall be required to be surfaced with an all-
weather surfacing. All other parking areas and driveways located behind the
building line may be a rock surface that is treated and maintained with oil,
calcium chloride, seal coat or other equivalent type material, which creates a
dust free surface and is kept free of weeds and other vegetation;
      (6)   The driveway approach from the edge of the street to the right-of-
way line shall be constructed of PCC concrete with a five-foot wide sidewalk
delineated through the approach. The Zoning Administrator or City Engineer, or
their designee, prior to construction, shall approve the proposed approach
width, location, radii and overall design.
      (7)   Storage areas located in the “I-1” and “I-2” Zoning Districts, or
“P/M” with a use on review, for the storage of materials and equipment used or
produced in the conduct of the business and for which access to the area is
restricted to employees of the company only, may be a rock surface that is
treated and maintained with oil, calcium chloride, sealcoat or other equivalent
type material, which creates a dust free surface and is kept free of weeds and
other vegetation. Any driveway necessary to access the storage area must meet
the all-weather surfacing requirements of parking areas; and
      (8)   (a)   All parking areas shall been designed and laid out according
to the parking table below included in these regulations. All required parking
spaces shall be delineated by durable painted stripes. If a one-way parking
layout is used, then directional arrows or signs shall be provided at parking
lot entry points. Entrance driveways shall be a minimum of 12 feet wide for a
one-way drive and 24 feet for a driveway having two-way traffic.
         (b)   For residential zoned properties the width of the driveway shall
not exceed 30 feet, measured at the street side of the sidewalk, and 36 feet at
the curb line. For commercial zoned properties, the width of the driveway shall
not exceed 36 feet measured at the street side of the sidewalk (or where the
sidewalk would normally be located if no sidewalk exists) and 42 feet at the
curb line. For industrial zoned properties, the maximum width shall be 45 feet
measured at the sidewalk or property line with a maximum radius on the driveway
of 25 feet.
         (c)   In all cases noted above, if a detailed engineering analysis can
show that alternative widths can be justified in order to avoid having vehicle
turning movements into opposing lanes, the City Engineer and Zoning
Administrator will consider alternative widths.

§ 37.00 SIGNS.
§ 37.01 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   This section is intended to control and regulate the development of signs
within the city. There is a significant relationship between the manner in
which signs are displayed; the public health, safety and welfare; and the
value, compatibility and economic stability of adjoining property, its land use
and the city. The reasonable display of signs is necessary as a service to the
people in the conduct of competitive commercial and industrial activity and to
promote freedom of expression. The regulations in this section establish
standards for the display of signs in direct relationship to the above stated
purposes and directives.
§ 37.02 PERMITS REQUIRED.
   (A)   When the regulations of this section require a permit, said permit
shall be obtained from the building inspector.
   (B)   Where sections of the city code as applied to structures, particularly
the uniform sign ordinance as adopted by the city, is applicable; said permits
must also be approved by the City Building Inspector.
§ 37.03 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All signs must comply with the following conditions.
   (A)   No sign shall be placed so as to obstruct vision at street
intersections and driveway intersections for oncoming vehicles.
   (B)   When a permit is required on any particular sign, said sign shall
display the name of the owner and erector.
   (C)   No sign shall block any required accessway or window.
   (D)   No sign shall be attached to a tree or utility pole.
   (E)   All signs not authorized by this section are prohibited.
   (F)   No signs other than public service and safety signs shall be permitted
on public property, unless authorized by the governmental agency having control
thereof.
§ 37.04 REMOVAL AND CONFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   It is the intent of this section to recognize that the eventual
elimination, as expeditiously as it is reasonable, of existing signs that are
not in conformity with the provisions of this section is as much a subject of
the health, safety and welfare of the public as is the prohibition of new signs
that would violate the provisions of this section. It is also the intent of
this section that any elimination of nonconforming signs shall be affected so
as to avoid any unreasonable invasion of established private property rights.
The Building Inspector or Zoning Officer shall cause removal of a sign or sign
structure if the property owner fails to comply with the standards of this
section within ten days after being issued a written notification from the
Building Inspector or Zoning Officer. Any expense incurred by the city in
removing or repairing the sign or sign structure shall be paid by the owner of
the property to which the sign is attached. Yard signs, as defined in this
chapter, found in violation of this chapter can be removed and disposed of by
the Zoning Officer, or his or her designee, without notice.
   (B)   (1)   Obsolete signs.
         (a)   Any nonconforming off-premises sign which does not advertise a
bona fide business, product or organization or becomes obsolete because the
business or organization has relocated shall be removed by the owner within 120
days of the termination or relocation of the business, product or organization
being advertised. Removal of obsolete signs shall include the supporting
structure, exclusive of any building, if all signs on the structure are
obsolete.
         (b)   Any nonconforming off-premises sign which is severely damaged
and requires over 65% of the cost of replacement for repair shall be removed
within 120 days after the date of the damage. Removal of damaged signs shall
include the supporting structure, exclusive of any building, if all signs on
the structure are nonconforming.
      (2)   Removal of signs. Any obsolete sign which does not advertise a bone
fide business conducted, or a product sold, shall be taken down and removed by
the owner, agent or person having the beneficial use of the structure upon
which such sign may be found within ten days after written notification from
the Zoning Administrator. Upon failure to comply with such notice within the
time specified in such order, the building inspector may cause removal of such
sign, and any expense incident thereto shall be paid by the owner of the
property to which such a sign is attached.
      (3)   Unsafe and unlawful signs. If the building inspector shall find
that any sign is unsafe or insecure, or is a menace to the public, or has been
constructed or erected or is being maintained in violation of the provisions of
this section, he or she shall give written notice to the person to whom the
sign certificate has been issued. If he or she fails to remove or alter the
sign so as to comply with the standards herein set forth within ten days after
such notice, such sign may be removed or altered to comply by the building
inspector at the expense of the sign certificate issue or owner of the property
upon which it is located. The building inspector shall refuse to issue a sign
certificate to any such party or owner who refuses to pay costs so assessed.
The building inspector may cause any sign that is an immediate peril to persons
or property to be removed summarily and without notice.
      (4)   Alterations. No display sign or outdoor advertising device shall be
altered, rebuilt, enlarged, extended or relocated except in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter. The repainting, changing of parts and preventive
maintenance of signs shall not be deemed to be alterations.
      (5)   Maintenance. The owner of any sign requiring a permit shall be
required to maintain an exterior which is properly painted, galvanized or
otherwise treated to prevent rust and deterioration of all parts and supports.

solar energy system. A community solar system/solar garden is a principal use.
   SOLAR RESOURCE. A view of the sun from a specific point on a lot or building
that is not obscured by any vegetation, building, or object for a minimum of
four hours between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. Standard Time on all
days of the year.
(Ord. 2025-04, passed 2-3-2025)
§ 44.03 PERMITTED ACCESSORY USE.
   Solar energy systems shall be allowed as an accessory use in all zoning
districts where structures of any sort are allowed, subject to certain
requirements as set forth below.
   (A)   Height. Solar energy systems must meet the following height
requirements for accessory use:
      (1)   Building or roof-mounted solar energy systems shall not exceed the
maximum allowed height of a structure in any zoning district.
      (2)   Ground or pole-mounted solar energy systems shall not exceed 12
feet in height when oriented at maximum tilt.
   (B)   Set-back. Solar energy systems must meet the accessory structure
setback requirements for the zoning district and primary land use associated
with the lot on which the system is located and shall only be in rear yards.
      (1)   Roof or building-mount solar energy systems. In addition to the
building setback, the collector surface and mounting devices for roof-mounted
solar energy systems shall not extend beyond the exterior perimeter of the
building on which the system is mounted or built, unless the collector and
mounting system has been explicitly engineered to safely extend beyond the
edge, and setback standards are not violated. Exterior piping for solar hot
water systems shall be allowed to extend beyond the perimeter of the building
on a back yard exposure. Solar collectors mounted on the sides of buildings and
serving as awnings are considered to be building-integrated systems and are
regulated as awnings.
      (2)   Ground-mount solar energy systems. Ground-mounted solar energy
systems may not extend into the side yard or rear setback when oriented at
minimum design tilt.
   (C)   Location and visibility.
      (1)   Building-integrated and wall-mount solar energy systems. Building-
integrated and wall-mount solar energy systems shall be allowed regardless of
whether the system is visible from the public right-of-way, provided the
building component in which the system is integrated or mounted meets all
required setback, land use, and performance standards for the district in which
the building is located. The color of the solar collectors is not required to
be consistent with other building materials.
      (2)   Roof-mount solar energy systems. Roof-mount solar energy systems
shall not be restricted for aesthetic reasons if the system is not visible from
the closest edge of any public right-of-way other than an alley. Roof-mounted
systems that are visible from the nearest edge of the street frontage right-of-
way shall not have the highest finished pitch steeper than the roof pitch on
which the system is mounted and shall be no higher than 12 inches above the
roof. The color of the solar collectors is not required to be consistent with
other roofing materials.
      (3)   Ground-mount solar energy systems. Except as indicated in other
parts of this chapter, ground-mount solar energy systems shall be treated as an
accessory structure and shall be subject to the requirements of an accessory
structure. A ground-mount solar energy system shall not be located in the front
yard or side yard of a lot. The city may require screening where it determines
there is a clear community interest in maintaining a viewshed.
      (4)   Reflectors. No solar energy system using an external reflector to
enhance solar production shall be installed within the city limits.
      (5)   Solar energy systems shall have non-reflective and neutral color
with no advertising or logos on system panels or supporting structure other
than a small identification of the manufacturer.
   (D)   Coverage. Roof or building-mount solar energy systems shall provide
roof access paths shall be provided as required in the International Fire Code
or the International Residential Code as they apply to the structure. Ground-
mount systems shall be exempt from impervious surface calculations if the soil
under the collector is maintained in vegetation and is not compacted.
Foundations, gravel, and compacted soils are considered impervious.
   (E)   Historic buildings. Solar energy systems on historically designated
buildings shall be installed only as allowed by the U.S. Department of
Interior.
   (F)   Site plan approvals and permits.
      (1)   Building permit and plan approval required. All solar energy
systems require a building permit from the city and shall provide a site plan
for review.
      (2)   Site plans shall be accompanied by a scale horizontal and vertical
(elevation) drawing. The drawings must show the location of the system on the
building or on the property for a ground-mounted system, including property
lines, and the property setbacks. In addition, they shall indicate the height
of the installation at maximum tilt and the ground footprint at minimum tilt,
along with a description of the ground cover to be used under the system.
      (3)   Site plans that meet the design requirements of this chapter shall
be granted administrative approval by the Zoning Officer and shall not require
Planning and Zoning Commission review. Administrative approval does not
indicate compliance with the Building Code or Electric Code.
   (G)   Approved solar components. Electric solar energy system components
must have a UL or equivalent listing and solar hot water systems must have an
SRCC rating.
   (H)   Compliance with Building Code. All solar energy systems shall be
consistent with the State Building Code, and solar thermal systems shall comply
with HVAC-related requirements of the Energy Code.
   (I)   Compliance with State Electric Code. All photovoltaic systems shall
comply with the State Electric Code.

comply with applicable State Plumbing Code requirements.
   (K)   Utility notification. All solar energy systems that connect with an
electric circuit serviced by the local electric utility (grid-tied systems)
shall comply with the interconnection requirements of the electric utility.
Systems not so connected (off-grid systems) are exempt from this requirement.
(Ord. 2025-04, passed 2-3-2025)
§ 44.04 PRINCIPAL USES.
   (A)   Solar garden. The city permits the development of community solar
gardens, subject to the following standards and requirements:
      (1)   Rooftop solar gardens. Subject to the requirements of this chapter,
rooftop solar gardens are a permitted use in all districts.
      (2)   Ground-mount solar gardens. Ground-mount community solar energy
systems must be less than two acres in total size and are a permitted use in
all districts. The city may require screening where it determines there is a
clear community interest in maintaining a viewshed.
      (3)   Interconnection. An interconnection agreement must be in place with
the local electric utility before work commences on installation of a solar
garden.
      (4)   Dimensional standards. All structures must comply with set-back,
height, and coverage limitations for the district in which the system is
located.
      (5)   Site security. A solar garden located wholly or partly within the
city limits must be surrounded by a fence that meets National Electric Code
(NEC) guidelines. The city encourages the project operator or owner to invest
in fencing that facilitates movement of pollinators. All gates must always be
locked unless personnel are on site. All components must be located at least
four feet from the fence.
      (6)   Other standards. Ground-mount systems must comply with all required
standards for structures in the district in which the system is located.
      (7)   Ground cover. The city encourages (but does not require) owners of
groundmount solar gardens to plant the land underneath the solar collectors in
pollinator friendly wildflowers. Such plantings must be maintained in such a
way that they do not go to weeds or become predominately grass but afford
passers-by a predominantly flower view during blooming season. Such plantings
shall be considered flower beds and shall be exempt from the mowing
requirements of Title B, Chapter 9. If wildflowers are not planted, the land
underneath the collectors must be neatly maintained in compliance with Title B,
Chapter 9 of the Code of Ordinances.
      (8)   Building permit and site plan review. Development of a solar garden
inside the city limits requires the issuance of a building permit and site plan
review. Principal use solar arrays must be designed by an Iowa licensed design
professional.
      (9)   Decommissioning. The city requires that, as part of the
construction permit application, a decommissioning plan shall be submitted to
ensure that the facilities are properly removed after their useful life.
Decommissioning of the solar garden must occur in the event it (or a majority
part of it) is not in use for 12 consecutive months. The plan shall include
provisions for removal of all structures and foundations, restoration of the
soil and vegetation, and a plan ensuring financial resources will be available
to fully decommission the site. Disposal of the solar panels, racks, and
foundations must meet state requirements applicable at the time of
decommissioning. The city shall require the posting of a bond, letter of
credit, or the establishment of an escrow account to ensure proper
decommissioning.
   (B)   Solar farm. The city permits the development of solar farms, subject
to the following standards and requirements:
      (1)   Development. A solar farm may be developed only on land zoned I-
1 Light Industrial Districts at the time of the development.
      (2)   Building permit. Development of a solar farm inside the city limits
requires the issuance of a building permit.
      (3)   Stormwater and NPDES. If the city has stormwater management,
erosion, or sediment control provisions, or NPDES permit requirements at the
time of the development, solar farms shall be subject to those requirements.
      (4)   Ground cover and buffer areas. Ground around and under solar arrays
and in project buffer areas shall be planted and maintained in perennial
vegetated ground cover, and meet the following standards:
         (a)   Topsoil shall not be removed during development unless it is
part of a remediation effort.
         (b)   Soils shall be planted and maintained in perennial vegetation to
prevent erosion, manage run off, and build soil. Seeds may include a mix of
grasses and wildflowers, but shall be predominantly wildflowers, ideally native
to the region that will result in a short stature prairie with a diversity of
forbs or flowering plants that bloom throughout the growing season. Blooming
shrubs may be used in buffer areas as appropriate for visual screening. Seed
mixes and maintenance practices should be consistent with recommendations made
by qualified natural resource professionals such as those from the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources, Scott County Soil and Water Conservation
Service, or the Natural Resource Conservation Service. Plant material must not
have been treated with systemic insecticides, particularly neonicotinoids. Such
plantings must be maintained in such a way that they do not go to weeds or
become predominantly grass but afford passers-by a predominantly flower view
during blooming season. Such plantings shall be considered flower beds and
shall be exempt from the mowing requirements of Title B, Chapter 9. If
wildflowers are not planted, the land underneath the collectors must be neatly
maintained in compliance with Title B, Chapter 9.
         (c)   The city may require screening where it determines there is a
clear community interest in maintaining a viewshed.
      (5)   Foundations. A qualified engineer shall certify that the foundation
and design of the solar panels’ racking, and support is within accepted
professional standards, given local soil and climate conditions.
      (6)   Other standards and codes. All solar farms shall be in compliance
with all applicable local, state, and federal regulatory codes, including the
State Building Code, as amended; and the National Electric Code, as amended.
      (7)   Power and communication lines. Power and communication lines
running between banks of solar panels and to nearby electric substations or
interconnections with buildings shall be buried underground. Exemptions may be
granted by the city in instances where shallow bedrock, water courses, or other
elements of the natural landscape interfere with the ability to bury lines, or
distance makes undergrounding infeasible, at the discretion of the city’s
consulting engineer.
      (8)   Site security. A solar farm located wholly or partly within the
city limits must be surrounded by a fence that meets National Electric Code
(NEC) guidelines. The city encourages the project operator or owner to invest
in fencing that facilitates movement of pollinators. All gates must always be
locked unless personnel are on site. All components must be located at least
four feet from the fence.
      (9)   Building permit. Development of a solar farm inside the city limits
requires the issuance of a building permit.
      (10)   Site plan required. A detailed site plan for both existing and
proposed conditions must be submitted, showing location of all solar arrays,
other structures, property lines, rights-of-way, easements, zoning districts,
service roads, floodplains, wetlands and other protected natural resources,
topography, electric equipment, and all other characteristics requested by the
city. The site plan shall be reviewed by city staff and the City Engineer and
approved by resolution by City Council.
      (11)   Aviation protection. For solar farms located within 500 feet of an
airport or within approach zones of an airport, the applicant must complete and
provide the results of the Solar Glare Hazard Analysis Tool (SGHAT) for the
Airport Traffic Control Tower cab and final approach paths, consistent with the
Interim Policy, FAA Review of Solar Energy Projects on Federally Obligated
Airports, or most recent version adopted by the FAA.
      (12)   Agricultural protection. Solar farms must comply with site
assessment or soil identification standards that are intended to protect
agricultural soils.
      (13)   Decommissioning. A decommissioning plan shall be required to
ensure that facilities are properly removed after their useful life.
Decommissioning of the installation must occur if a majority of the solar
panels are not in use for 12 consecutive months. The plan shall include
provisions for removal of all structures and foundations, restoration of soil
and vegetation, and a plan ensuring financial resources will be available to
fully decommission the site. Disposal of the solar panels, racks, and
foundations must meet state requirements applicable at the time of
decommissioning. The city shall require the posting of a bond, letter of
credit, or the establishment of an escrow account to ensure proper
decommissioning.
      (14)   Once a solar farm enters commercial operation the City Council may
require the applicant/owner, or current owner of the facility, to make annual
contributions to the city as set forth in a contract provided by the city. This
contribution would be based upon the maximum rated AC production capacity
multiplied by the rate of $2,500 per MW per year. This rate can be adjusted by
resolution by the City Council. Payment would be due by March 31 each year for
the production the previous calendar year and will be pro-rated for the number
of days in operation during the previous calendar year. For clarity, if the
solar farm produces power for 100 days in a 365-day calendar year, the annual
contribution will be 100/365 times $2,500 dollars per MW.

damage occurred. Volunteer labor and donated materials shall be included in the
estimated cost of repair. SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE also means flood-related damages
sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for
which the cost of repairs at the time of such flood event, on the average,
equals or exceeds 25% of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred. Volunteer labor and donated materials shall be included in the
estimated cost of repair.
§ 1.34.   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any improvement to a structure which
satisfies either of the following criteria:
      (1)   (a)   Any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the
cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure
either:
            1.   Before the “start of construction” of the improvement; or
            2.   If the structure has been “substantially damaged” and is being
restored, before the damage occurred.
         (b)   The term does not, however, include any project for improvement
of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health,
sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local
code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe
living conditions. The term also does not include any alteration of an
“historic structure”; provided the alteration will not preclude the structure’s
designation as an “historic structure”.
      (2)   Any addition which increases the original floor area of a building
by 25% or more. All additions constructed after the effective date of the first
floodplain management regulations adopted by the community shall be added to
any proposed addition in determining whether the total increase in original
floor space would exceed 25%.
§ 1.35.   VARIANCE. A grant of relief by a community from the terms of the

(Ord. 2021-03, passed 3-15-2021)
§ 2.00 STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
§ 2.01 POWER TO ENACT REGULATIONS.
   The legislature of the state has, in Iowa Code Chapter 414, as amended,
delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure safety from
flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
(Ord. 2021-03, passed 3-15-2021)
§ 2.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all
of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of the
community.
   (B)   These flood losses, hazards and related adverse effects are caused by:
      (1)   The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood
damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately

that constitutes a channel change as specified in I.A.C. § 567-71.2(2).
(Ord. 2021-03, passed 3-15-2021)
§ 6.02 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (A)   All development must be consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage and meet the following applicable performance standards. Where base
flood elevations and floodway data have not been provided in the flood
insurance study, the State Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted
to compute such data. The applicant will be responsible for providing the
Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make
such determination.
   (B)   (1)   Development requirements. All development shall:
         (a)   Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement;
         (b)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage; and
         (c)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are
resistant to flood damage.
      (2)   Residential structures.
         (a)   All new or substantially improved residential structures shall
have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum of one foot above
the base flood elevation. Construction shall be upon compacted fill which
shall, at all points, be no lower than 1.0 feet above the base flood elevation
and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the limits of any
structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such as piers
subject to favorable consideration by the Board of Adjustment) may be allowed
where existing topography, street grades or other factors preclude elevating by
fill. In such cases, the methods used must be adequate to support the structure
as well as withstand the various forces and hazards associated with flooding.
         (b)   All new residential structures located in areas that would
become isolated due to flooding of surrounding ground shall be provided with a
means of access that will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the base
flood. However, this criterion shall not apply where the Administrator
determines there is sufficient flood warning time for the protection of life
and property. When estimating flood warning time, consideration shall be given
to the criteria listed in I.A.C. § 567-75.2(3).
      (3)   Non-residential structures. All new or substantially improved non-
residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level. When
floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the state
shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to withstand the
flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and other factors
associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the base flood
elevation, is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water. A record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in
relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
      (4)   All new and substantially improved structures.
         (a)   1.   Fully enclosed areas below the “lowest floor” (not
including basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of flood waters. Designs for meeting this requirement
must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or
exceed the following minimum criteria.
               a.   A minimum of two openings, with positioning on at least two
walls on opposite sides of the foundation subject to approval by the Zoning
Enforcement Officer, having a total net area of not less than one square inch
for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.)
               b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
               c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
flood waters.
            2.   Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles,
building access and low damage potential storage. Where the distance between
the floor and ceiling of the fully enclosed area below the “lowest floor” is
five feet or more, the applicant shall be required to sign and record with the
County Recorder a non-conversion agreement that ensures the lower enclosed area
remains compliant with the criteria outlined in this division (B)(4).
         (b)   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
         (c)   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed
with electric meter, electrical service panel box, hot water heater, heating,
air conditioning, ventilation equipment (including ductwork) and other similar
machinery and equipment elevated (or in the case of non-residential structures,
optionally floodproofed) to a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation.
         (d)   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed
with plumbing, gas lines, water/gas meters and other similar service utilities
either elevated (or in the case of non-residential structures, optionally
floodproofed) to a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation or
designed to be watertight and withstand inundation to such a level.
      (5)   Factory-built homes.
         (a)   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes,
including those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions,
shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
structure is a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation.
         (b)   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes,
including those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions,
shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Anchorage
systems may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties
to ground anchors as required by the State Building Code.
      (6)   Utility and sanitary systems.
         (a)   On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located
or designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
         (b)   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system
as well as the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment
facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood
protection equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood elevation.
         (c)   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water
supply treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with
a level of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood
elevation.
         (d)   Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
      (7)   Storage of explosives. Storage of materials and equipment that are
flammable, explosive or injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited
unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation. Other
material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or:
         (a)   Not be subject to major flood damage and be anchored to prevent
movement due to flood waters; or
         (b)   Be readily removable from the area within the time available
after flood warning.
      (8)   Flood control structures. Flood control structural works such as
levees, flood walls and the like shall provide, at a minimum, protection from
the base flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall
provide for adequate interior drainage. In addition, the Department of Natural
Resources shall approve structural flood control works.
      (9)   Watercourse alterations or relocations. Watercourse alterations or
relocations must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the
altered or relocated portion. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources
must approve such alterations or relocations.
      (10)   Subdivisions. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and
subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the base flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50 lots
(whichever is less) shall include base flood elevation data for those areas
located within the Floodplain (Overlay) District.
      (11)   Accessory structures to residential uses. Detached garages, sheds
and similar structures that are incidental to a residential use shall comply
with the elevation requirements as outlined in §
6.02(B)(3) of this chapter.
      (12)   Recreational vehicles.
         (a)   Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of §
6.02(B)(5) of this chapter regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built
homes when the following criteria are satisfied.
            1.   The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less
than 180 consecutive days.
            2.   The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
         (b)   Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than
180 consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements
of §
6.02(B)(5) of this chapter regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built
homes.
      (13)   Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be buried in
the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture
due to channel degradation and meandering.
      (14)   Maximum damage potential development. All new or substantially
improved maximum damage potential development shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated a minimum of one foot above the elevation of the
500-year flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be
floodproofed to such a level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional
engineer registered in the state shall certify that the floodproofing methods
used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact
and uplift forces and other factors associated with the 0.2% annual chance
flood; and that the structure, below the 0.2% annual chance flood elevation, is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water. A
record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in relation to
North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are floodproofed
shall be maintained by the Administrator. Where 0.2% chance flood elevation
data has not been provided in the flood insurance study, the State Department
of Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The applicant
will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with
sufficient technical information to make such determinations.

§ 1.00 PURPOSE.
   (A)   (1)   This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authority conferred by
Iowa Code Chapter 329, as the same may be amended from time to time. It is
hereby found that an obstruction has the potential for endangering the lives
and property of users of the Davenport Municipal Airport, and property or
occupants of land in its vicinity; that an obstruction may affect existing and
future instrument approach minimums of the Davenport Municipal Airport; and
that an obstruction may reduce the size of areas available for the landing,
takeoff and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the
utility of Davenport Municipal Airport and the public investment therein.
      (2)   Accordingly, it is declared:
         (a)   That the creation or establishment of an obstruction has the
potential of being a public nuisance and may injure the region served by the
Davenport Municipal Airport;
         (b)   That it is necessary in the interest of the public health,
public safety and general welfare that the creation or establishment of
obstructions that are a hazard to air navigation be prevented; and
         (c)   That the prevention of these obstructions should be
accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police
power without compensation.
   (B)   It is further declared that the prevention of the creation or
establishment of hazards to air navigation, the elimination, removal,
alteration or mitigation of hazards to air navigation or the marking and
lighting of obstructions are public purposes for which a political subdivision
may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or interest in land.
§ 2.00 SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Airport Height Zoning
Ordinance of Eldridge, Iowa”.
§ 3.00 CONFLICTING REGULATIONS.
   As established by Iowa Code Chapter 329, entitled “Airport Zoning”, as the
same may be amended from time to time, in the event of any conflict between
this chapter and any other regulation applicable to the same area, whether the
conflict be with respect to the height of structures or trees, the use of land
or any other matter, the more stringent limitation or requirement shall govern
and prevail.

limitations for structures and trees.
§ 5.02 MAP.
   The boundaries of the airport hazard area and its zones are shown on the
Davenport Municipal Airport Height Zoning Map which is made a part of this
chapter. The map and all the notations, references and other information shown
thereon are a part of this chapter and have the same force and effect as if the
map and all the notations, references and other information shown thereon were
all fully set forth or described in this chapter. The map shall be on file with
City Clerk.
§ 5.03 ZONES DEFINED.
   (A)   Horizontal zone. The land lying under a horizontal surface. The
horizontal surface is 147 feet above the established airport elevation and the
perimeter is constructed by swinging arcs of 10,000 feet radii from the center
of each end of the primary surface of Runways 15, 33, 3 and 21 and connecting
the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. No structure or tree shall
exceed 147 feet above the established airport elevation in the horizontal zone,
as depicted on the Davenport Municipal Airport Height Zoning Map.
   (B)   Conical zone. The land lying under a conical surface. The conical
surface extends outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface
at a slope of 20 to one for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. No structure
or tree in the conical zone shall penetrate the conical surface, as depicted on
the Davenport Municipal Airport Height Zoning Map.
   (C)   Approach zone. The land lying under an approach surface. The approach
surface is longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline and
extends outward and upward from each end of the primary surface.
      (1)   The inner edge of the approach surface is:
         (a)   Five hundred feet wide for Runways 3 and 21; and
         (b)   One thousand feet wide for Runways 15 and 33.

         (a)   Ten thousand feet at a slope of 34:1 for Runways 3, 21 and 33;
and
         (b)   Ten thousand feet at a slope of 50:1 and then 40,000 feet at a
slope of 40:1 for Runway 15. No structure or tree in the approach zone shall
penetrate the approach surface to any runway, as depicted on the Davenport
Municipal Airport Height Zoning Map.
   (D)   Transitional zone. The land lying under the transitional surface. The
transitional surface extends outward and upward at right angles to the runway
centerline and the runway centerline extended, at a slope of 7:1 from the sides
of the primary surface and from the sides of the approach surfaces. The
transitional surface begins at the side of and at the same elevation as the
approach surfaces and extends upward and outward to the conical surface at a
slope of 7:1; or, if outside the conical surface, it extends upward and outward
a distance of 5,000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach
surface and at right angles to the runway centerline. No structure or tree in
the transitional zone shall penetrate the transitional surface, as depicted on
the Davenport Municipal Airport Height Zoning Map.
§ 5.04 STRUCTURES IN MORE THAN ONE ZONE.
   An existing or proposed structure or tree located in more than one of the
zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height
limitation.
§ 5.05 EXCEPTED HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.
   Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting the
construction or maintenance of any structure or growth of any tree to a height
up to 35 feet above the surface of the land.

or the City Electric and Water Utility Board from building, owning and
operating a municipal water tower not to exceed a height of 200 feet above
ground level.
§ 6.00 NONCONFORMING USES.
§ 6.01 ALTERATION OF EXISTING STRUCTURES NOT REQUIRED.
   This chapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or
other change or alteration of any existing structure or tree, or to interfere
with any existing use not conforming on the effective date of this chapter,
except that no nonconforming use shall be allowed to become a greater airport
hazard than it was on the effective date of this chapter.
§ 6.02 CONSTRUCTION OR ALTERATION.
   Nothing contained in this chapter shall require any change in the
construction or alteration of any structure, the construction or alteration of
which was authorized by a permit dated prior to the effective date of this
chapter and is diligently prosecuted.

which would be inconsistent with this chapter shall be granted unless a
variance has been obtained.
§ 7.02 TREES.
   A permit shall not be required for trees. The lack of requirement for a
permit for any trees shall not be construed as permitting or intending to
permit the tree to eventually grow to a height inconsistent with this chapter.
The owner of such a tree shall trim it as often as necessary in order to keep
the tree from being in violation of this chapter and the trimming shall be done
at the owner’s expense.
§ 8.00 ENFORCEMENT.
   It shall be the duty of the City Zoning Administrator to administer and
enforce this chapter and to cooperate with the officials of neighboring
municipalities in the review of any application for a variance submitted to the
Airport Zoning Board of Adjustment. Applications for permits required by this
chapter shall be promptly considered and granted or denied by a written
decision.
§ 9.00 VARIANCES.

or to permit the growth of any tree, or otherwise use the property in violation
of this chapter, and having been aggrieved or affected by any written decision
of the City Zoning Administrator, may apply to the Airport Zoning Board of
Adjustment for a variance in accordance with Iowa Code Chapter 329, as the same
may be amended from time to time. Applying for a variance shall be done by
filing a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The notice of appeal
shall be filed with the City Zoning Administrator within 30 calendar days after
receipt of the written decision. Upon receipt of a notice of appeal, the City
Zoning Administrator shall immediately transmit to the Chairperson of the
Airport Zoning Board of Adjustment all the papers constituting the record upon
which the action appealed from was taken. The Chairperson shall then set a
meeting date for the Airport Zoning Board of Adjustment. The meeting date shall
be within 45 calendar days of the date of the notice of appeal. Determinations
from the Federal Aviation Administration and the Davenport Airport Manager, as
to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and
the safe, efficient use of air space should be obtained. If such determinations
are not available for the Airport Zoning Board of Adjustment meeting, the
discussion of the appeal may be extended to a later date when the
determinations are available or a decision may be made without those
determinations.
   (B)   Any such variance granted may be subject to reasonable conditions,
including, but not limited to, the right of the City of Davenport to install,
operate and maintain at City of Davenport’s expense such markers and lights
thereon as may be necessary to indicate to the operators of aircraft the
presence of a hazard.

10.00   Appeal
§ 1.00 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of these regulations is to diminish threats to public health,
safety and welfare caused by runoff of excessive storm water from new
development and redevelopment. This excessive storm water could result in the
flooding of damageable properties. The cause of increase in storm water runoff
quantity is the development and improvement of land and as such this chapter
regulates these activities to reduce adverse impacts.
§ 2.00 APPLICABILITY.
   No building permit shall be issued for the construction, reconstruction or
structural alteration of a building, and/or its parking area nor shall a
certificate of occupancy be granted for a use nor shall a preliminary plat,
final plat or site plan be approved without conformity with the provisions of
the storm water detention regulations.
§ 3.00 STORM WATER DETENTION CRITERIA.
   (A)   All storm water storage areas must be designed to contain and safely
pass storm water runoff. When platting, the land extending to the centerline of
any adjacent right-of-way shall be considered part of the development for
purposes of determining the runoff rate. Adequate spillway provisions shall be
provided to transport peak runoff from a 100-year storm assuming the outlet to
be plugged. All storm water facilities shall be designed in accordance with the
design standards established by the city.
   (B)   All areas within the city shall comply with these regulations.
      (1)   The required volume of storm water detention shall be that
necessary to handle the runoff of a 100-year rainfall, for the critical
duration from the drainage area tributary to the storm water storage area based
on full development of said tributary area, less the volume discharged during
the same duration at the approved release rate.
      (2)   For sites less than 20 acres, the required detention storage (RDS)
will be that found to be the most critical resulting from the inflow from the
run-off of a fully developed tributary area from a 100-year storm and the
outflow of the five-year storm on a predevelopment basis with the same area.
This can be expressed by the following equation:
 
      Inflow rate from          Release rate from 5-   Duration of the critical
RDS = critical 100-year storm - year storm           X 100-year
      (cfs)                                            storm (sec)
 
      (3)   For sites greater than 20 acres, the method of sizing of the
detention storage volume must be approved by the City Engineer.
   (C)   Detention storage may be provided as a dry bottom or wet bottom
storage area.
      (1)   Dry bottom storm water storage areas may be designed to serve a
secondary purpose for recreation, open space parking or other types of uses
that will not be adversely affected by intermittent flooding.
         (a)   A method of carrying the low flow through these areas shall be
provided in addition to a system of drains to prevent soggy areas.
         (b)   Outlet control structures shall be designed as simply as
possible and shall require little or no attention for proper operation. Each
storm water storage area shall be provided with a method of emergency overflow
in the event that a storm in excess of the 100-year frequency storm occurs.
This emergency overflow facility shall be designed to function without
attention and shall become part of the excess storm water passageway. Hydraulic
calculations shall be submitted to the City Engineer to substantiate all design
features.
         (c)   Both outlet control structures and emergency overflow facilities
shall be designed and constructed to fully protect the public health, safety
and welfare. Storm water runoff velocities shall be kept at a minimum and
turbulent conditions at an outlet control structure will not be permitted
without complete protection for the public safety. The use of fences shall be
kept to a minimum and used only as a last resort when no other method of
protection is feasible.
         (d)   Paved surfaces that are to serve as storm water storage shall be
designed with permanent-type control outlets. Emergency overflow areas shall be
provided. The maximum storm water ponding depth in any paved area shall not
exceed six inches.
      (2)   (a)   Wet bottom storm water storage areas shall be designed with
all of the items required for dry bottom storm water storage areas, except that
the provisions of division (C)(1)(a) above shall not be required.
         (b)   However, the following additional conditions shall be complied
with:
            1.   Water surface areas shall not exceed one-fifteenth of the
tributary drainage area.
            2.   Facilities shall be provided to lower the pond elevation by
gravity flow for cleaning purposes and shoreline maintenance. Shoreline
protection shall be provided to prevent erosion from wave action.
            3.   Minimum normal water depth shall be four feet. If fish are to
be maintained, some portion of the pond area should be a minimum of nine feet
deep.
            4.   Control structures for storm water release shall be designed
to operate with only a minor increase in the water surface level when the
design storage capacity has been exceeded. Hydraulic calculations shall be
submitted to the City Engineer to substantiate all design features.
   (D)   The city may, in lieu of the detention requirements detailed in the
ordinance, accept infiltration practices designed in accordance with the Iowa
Storm Water Management Manual. Engineering calculation demonstrating
infiltration rates shall be included with the application.
(Ord. 2025-13, passed 6-2-2025)

submittal of plans for such a system or the purchase of property on which such
system is located shall be deemed as acceptance of responsibility for normal
and capital maintenance of the system.
   (C)   The developer shall dedicate an easement to the city reserving the
land for use as a storm water detention facility providing the city with the
right to inspect the facility, and the necessary easements for ingress and

         (b)   At five year intervals, the basin shall be inspected by a
professional engineer registered in the state, using a checklist developed by
the city. A report of this inspection shall be submitted to the Director of
Public Works within 60 days of the inspection. An annual report is not required
the year when the five-year report is due.
         (c)   Detention basin owners shall notify subsequent owners of his,
her or their maintenance responsibilities and transfer basin maintenance
records to the party with active maintenance responsibility.
      (2)   At any time, the Director of Public Works, or his or her designee,
may provide inspection of the detention facilities as deemed appropriate. If
the Director finds any maintenance work is necessary, the Director shall serve
a written order to the owner of the facilities, specifying therein the work
necessary to be done and providing for a reasonable time for its completion.
Any property owner to whom an order is directed shall have the right, within
three days from service of the order, to appeal to the City Administrator who
shall review the order within five working days and file his or her decision.
If the City Administrator fails to respond within five working days, it shall
be assumed that the appeal is denied. Unless the order is revoked or modified,
it shall remain in full force and be obeyed by the owner as directed within the
time established by the Director’s written order or at the time as modified by
the City Administrator’s decision. When an owner to whom an order has been
issued fails to comply within the time specified, the Director shall remedy the
condition, or contract with others for such purpose, and charge all costs,
including administration, to whom the order is directed. If the cost of
remedying a condition is not paid within 30 days after the mailing of a
statement from the Director of Public Works, the cost shall be assessed against
the property for collection in the same manner as a property tax. In the event
the association, or property owner, fails or is unable to pay the costs
associated with detention facility maintenance, or an association does not
exist or the owner cannot be located, these costs shall be assessed equally
against all property owners in the subdivision(s) the detention facility
serves.

§ 10.00 APPEAL.
   (A)   The City Council may, in the resolution approving the preliminary plat
of any subdivision and upon appeal of the developer, or the recommendation of
the City Engineer, waive or change the requirements of this chapter for a
particular development whenever the developer demonstrates either:
      (1)   That, due to the location of the property, strict compliance would
provide no discernible benefit for reduction of flooding on any plat adjacent
or downstream property;
      (2)   That, due to the nature of the property, strict compliance would
create unusual hardship out of proportion to any foreseeable benefit and that
the requested change or reduction in requirements will not increase the risk of
flooding of any building or the buildable portion of any lot on any adjacent or
downstream property; or
      (3)   That the developer, in lieu of a detention facility, provide storm
water management sufficient to achieve the purpose of this chapter by keeping
storm water runoff from the property in accordance with §
3.00 of this chapter.
   (B)   Developers of new or expanding commercial, industrial and multi-family
developments shall make appeals as per the provisions of the site plan review
regulations in city code.

§ 1 FINDINGS.
§ 1.1 PERMIT PROGRAM.
   (A)   The United States EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (“NPDES”) permit program (“program”) administered by the State
Department of Natural Resources (“IDNR”) requires that cities meeting certain
demographic and environmental impact criteria obtain from the IDNR an NPDES
permit for the discharge of storm water from a municipal separate storm sewer
system (“MS4”) (“MS4 permit”).
   (B)   The City of Eldridge (“city”) is subject to the program and is
required to obtain, and has obtained, an MS4 permit; the city’s MS4 permit is
on file at the office of the City Clerk and is available for public inspection
during regular office hours.
§ 1.2 ADOPTING AN ORDINANCE.
   As a condition of the city’s MS4 permit, the city is obliged to adopt and
enforce an illicit discharge to storm sewer system ordinance.
§ 1.3 FUNDING.
   No state or federal funds have been made available to assist the city in
administering and enforcing the program. Accordingly, the city shall fund its
operations under this chapter entirely by charges imposed on the owners of
properties which are made subject to the program by virtue of state and federal
law, and/or other sources of funding established by a separate ordinance.
§ 1.4 TERMS DEFINED.
   Terms used in this chapter shall have the meanings specified in the program.
§ 2 ILLICIT DISCHARGES PROHIBITED.
§ 2.1 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   PROPERTY. Includes, but is not limited to, real estate, fixtures, facilities
and premises of any kind located upon, under or above the real estate.
   RESPONSIBLE PARTY. One or more persons that control or are in possession of
or own property. RESPONSIBLE PARTIES shall be jointly and severally responsible
for compliance with this chapter and jointly and severally liable for any
illicit discharge from the property controlled, possessed or owned.
§ 2.2 OBLIGATION.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to relieve a responsible party
subject to an IDNR-issued industrial discharge permit or any other federal,
state or city permit, statute, ordinance or rule from any obligation imposed by
such permit, statute, ordinance or rule if any such obligation is greater than
any obligation imposed by this chapter.
§ 2.3 ILLICIT DISCHARGE.
   Any discharge into the city’s storm sewer system prohibited by the city’s
MS4 permit, the terms of which are hereby incorporated by reference, shall be
deemed an “illicit discharge” in violation of this chapter.
§ 2.4 SEDIMENT POLLUTION.
   Sediment pollution originating from excessive erosion rates on a
construction site not otherwise subject to the city’s COSESCO ordinance or
sediment pollution entering a municipal storm sewer that causes a water quality
violation as determined by the DNR shall be deemed an illicit discharge in
violation of this chapter.
§ 3 ILLICIT CONNECTIONS PROHIBITED.
§ 3.1 ILLICIT CONNECTION DEFINED.
   For purposes of this chapter, an ILLICIT CONNECTION to the city’s storm
sewer system is any physical connection or other topographical or other
condition, natural or artificial, which is not specifically authorized by
ordinance or written rule of the city, which causes or facilitates, directly or
indirectly, an illicit discharge.
§ 3.2 VIOLATIONS.
   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of any illicit
connection shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
§ 3.3 PAST ILLICIT CONNECTIONS.

property owned or controlled by them, to prevent all illicit discharges and to
report to the Enforcement Officer illicit discharges which the responsible
party knows or should have known to have occurred.
   (B)   Failure to comply with any provision of this chapter is a violation of
this chapter.
   § 5.3.1. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any
responsible party has information of any known or suspected illicit discharge,
the responsible party shall immediately take all necessary steps to ensure the
discovery, containment and cleanup of such discharge at the responsible party’s
sole cost.
   § 5.3.2. If the illicit discharge consists of hazardous materials, the
responsible party shall also immediately notify emergency response agencies of
the occurrence via emergency dispatch services.
   § 5.3.3. If the illicit discharge emanates from a commercial or industrial
establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an
on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its
recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.
   § 5.3.4. A report of an illicit discharge shall be made in person or by
phone or facsimile or email to the Enforcement Officer immediately but in any
event within 24 hours of the illicit discharge; notifications in person or by

   Any person or entity shall also report to the city any illicit discharge or
circumstances which such person or entity reasonably believes pose a risk of an
illicit discharge.
§ 5.5 RESPONSE TO REPORTS.
   (A)   Upon receiving a report pursuant to the previous sections, or
otherwise coming into possession of information indicating an actual or
imminent illicit discharge, the Enforcement Officer shall conduct an inspection
of the site as soon as reasonably possible and thereafter shall provide to the
responsible party, and any third-party reporter, a written report of the
conditions which may cause or which have already caused an illicit discharge.
   (B)   The responsible party shall immediately commence corrective action or
remediation and shall complete such corrective action or remediation within 24
hours.
§ 5.6 INSPECTION.
   (A)   The Enforcement Officer shall be permitted to enter and inspect
property subject to regulation under this section as often as is necessary to
determine compliance with this section. If a responsible party has security
measures that require identification and clearance before entry to its property
or premises, the responsible party shall make the necessary arrangements to
allow access by the Enforcement Officer.
   (B)   By way of specification but not limitation:
   § 5.6.1. A responsible party shall allow the Enforcement Officer ready
access to all parts of the property for purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records related to a suspected, actual or imminent
illicit discharge and for the performance of any additional duties as defined
by state and federal law;
   § 5.6.2. The Enforcement Officer shall have the right to set up on any
property such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the Enforcement
Officer to conduct monitoring and/or sampling related to a suspected, actual or
imminent illicit discharge;
   § 5.6.3. The Enforcement Officer shall have the right to require any
responsible party at responsible party’s sole expense to install monitoring
equipment and deliver monitoring data or reports to the Enforcement Officer as
the Enforcement Officer directs. The sampling and monitoring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the
responsible party at responsible party’s sole expense. All devices shall be
calibrated to ensure their accuracy;
   § 5.6.4. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
property to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
responsible party at the written or oral order of the Enforcement Officer and
shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
responsible party;
   § 5.6.5. An unreasonable delay in allowing the Enforcement Officer access to
a property is a violation of this chapter; and
   § 5.6.6. If the Enforcement Officer has been refused access to any part of
the property from an illicit connection and/or illicit discharge to a municipal
storm sewer is occurring, suspected or imminent, and is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and
welfare of the community, then the Enforcement Officer may seek issuance of a
search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
§ 5.7 ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.
   If it is determined that an illicit discharge is imminent or has occurred,
the actual administrative costs incurred by the city in the enforcement of this
chapter shall be recovered from the responsible party. The Enforcement Officer
shall submit an invoice to the responsible party reflecting the actual costs
and wages and expenses incurred by the city for the enforcement activities
undertaken. Failure to pay charges invoiced under this chapter within 30 days
of billing shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
§ 6 SUSPENSION OF ACCESS TO THE CITY’S STORM SEWER SYSTEM.
§ 6.1 EMERGENCY SUSPENSION.
   The Enforcement Officer may, without prior notice, suspend storm sewer
system access to a property when such emergency suspension is necessary to stop
an ongoing or imminent illicit discharge. If the responsible party fails to
immediately comply with an emergency suspension order, the Enforcement Officer
shall take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize the illicit
discharge. All costs of such action shall be recovered from the responsible
party for the property identified as the source of the illicit discharge.
§ 6.2 NON-EMERGENCY SUSPENSION.
   If the Enforcement Officer detects or is informed of circumstances which
could cause an illicit discharge but such illicit discharge is not ongoing or
imminent, and if the suspension of storm sewer system access would reasonably
be expected to prevent or reduce the potential illicit discharge, the
Enforcement Officer shall notify the responsible party of the proposed
suspension of storm sewer system access and the time and date of such
suspension. Notice to one responsible party for the property shall be
sufficient notice to all. Remediation of the circumstances shall avoid a
violation of this chapter provided that no illicit discharge occurs. In the
alternative, the responsible party may request a meeting with the Enforcement
Officer for the purpose of presenting information which the responsible party
believes will show that remediation is unnecessary, and if the Enforcement
Officer finds such information is satisfactory, the Enforcement Officer may
rescind or modify the notice of suspension. If the Enforcement Officer finds
such information unsatisfactory, the Enforcement Officer shall issue a final
written order of suspension, including the date and time of suspension and such
order may be appealed as provided hereinafter. Any physical action to reinstate
storm sewer system access to property subject to such order prior to obtaining
a court order of relief shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. An order
of suspension shall not preclude charging the responsible party with a
municipal infraction as provided hereinafter or taking any other enforcement
action permitted by statute or ordinance.
§ 7 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property below the elevation of the 100-year flood free of trash, debris,
grass clippings or other organic wastes and other obstacles that would pollute,
contaminate or significantly alter the quality of water flowing through the
watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately
owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures
will not become a hazard to the use, function or physical integrity of the
watercourse.
§ 8 ENFORCEMENT.
§ 8.1 CIVIL ENFORCEMENT ACTION.
   Violation of any provision of this chapter may be enforced by civil action,
including an action for injunctive relief. In any civil enforcement action,
administrative or judicial, the city shall be entitled to recover its
attorneys’ fees and costs from a person who is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to have violated this chapter.
§ 8.2 MUNICIPAL INFRACTION.
   Violation of any provision of this chapter may also be enforced as a
municipal infraction within the meaning of Iowa Code § 364.22, pursuant to the
city’s municipal infraction ordinance.
§ 8.3 ADVICE AND CONSENT OF THE CITY ATTORNEY.
   Enforcement pursuant to this section shall be undertaken by the Enforcement
Officer upon the advice and consent of the City Attorney.

Officer by ordinary mail, and shall give public notice, in accordance with Iowa
Code Chapter 21, of the date, time and place for the regular or special meeting
of the City Council at which the hearing on the appeal shall occur. The hearing
shall be scheduled for a date not less than four nor more than 20 days after
the filing of the appeal. The rules of evidence and procedure, and the standard
of proof to be applied, shall be the same as provided by Iowa Code Chapter 17A.
The applicant may be represented by counsel at the applicant’s expense. The
Enforcement Officer may be represented by the City Attorney or by an attorney
