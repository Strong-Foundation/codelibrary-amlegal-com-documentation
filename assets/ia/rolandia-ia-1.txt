deny, or revoke any matter shall be considered in light of the facts and
circumstances then existing and as may be reasonably foreseeable, and due
consideration shall be given to the impact upon the public health, safety and
welfare, and the decision shall be that of a reasonably prudent person under
similar circumstances in the exercise of the police power.

hearing thereon. Thereafter, at least thirty days after such hearing the City
Council, by ordinance, may give its prior approval of a tax exemption for new
construction if the new construction is in conformance with City zoning. Such
prior approval shall not entitle the owner to exemption from taxation until the
new construction has been completed and found to be qualified real estate.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 427B.4)
8.08   EXEMPTION REPEALED.

46.02 Cigarettes and Tobacco      46.05 Minors in Billiard Rooms
46.03 Contributing to Delinquency
 
46.01   CURFEW.
The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote the
public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and specifically
to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults responsible for
minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors committed after
the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences and criminal
activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.
1.   Definitions. For use in this section, the following terms are defined:
   A.   “Emergency errand” means, but is not limited to, an errand relating to
a fire, a natural disaster, an automobile accident or any other situation
requiring immediate action to prevent serious illness, bodily injury or loss of
life.
   B.   “Knowingly” means knowledge which a responsible adult should reasonably
be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that responsible
adult’s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful or careless
adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult responsibility
through an objective test. It is therefore no defense that an adult responsible
for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or
whereabouts of the minor.
   C.   “Minor” means any unemancipated person under the age of eighteen (18)
years.
   D.   “Nonsecured custody” means custody in an unlocked multipurpose area,
such as a lobby, office or interrogation room which is not designed, set aside
or used as a secure detention area, and the person arrested is not physically
secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically
accompanied by a peace officer or a person employed by the facility where the
person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to providing
nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate juvenile
facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the person’s parents or
other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but not for
longer than six (6) hours without the oral or written order of a judge or
magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
   E.   “Public place” includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys and sidewalks dedicated to public use; and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises whether publicly or privately owned which
are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited
commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is
permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has
access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is
considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.
   F.   “Responsible adult” means a parent, guardian or other adult
specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have
custody or control of a minor.
2.   Time Limits. It is unlawful for any minor to be or remain upon any of the
alleys, streets or public places or places of business and amusement in the
City between the hours of eleven o’clock (11:00) p.m. and five o’clock (5:00)
a.m. of the following day on days commencing on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday and between the hours of twelve o’clock (12:00) midnight
and five o’clock (5:00) a.m. on Friday and Saturday.
3.   Exceptions. The following are exceptions to the curfew:
   A.   The minor is accompanied by a responsible adult.
   B.   The minor is on the sidewalk or property where the minor resides or on
either side of the place where the minor resides and the adult responsible for
the minor has given permission for the minor to be there.
   C.   The minor is present at or is traveling between home and one of the
following:
      (1)   Minor’s place of employment in a business, trade or occupation in
which the minor is permitted by law to be engaged or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of work;
      (2)   Minor’s place of religious activity or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of the religious activity;
      (3)   Governmental or political activity or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of the activity;
      (4)   School activity or, if traveling, within one hour after the end or
before the beginning of the activity;
      (5)   Assembly such as a march, protest, demonstration, sit-in or meeting
of an association for the advancement of economic, political, religious or
cultural matters, or for any other activity protected by the First Amendment of
the U.S. Constitution guarantees of free exercise of religion, freedom of
speech, freedom of assembly or, if traveling, within one hour after the end or
before the beginning of the activity.
   D.   The minor is on an emergency errand for a responsible adult;
   E.   The minor is engaged in interstate travel through the City beginning,
ending or passing through the City when such travel is by direct route.
4.   Responsibility of Adults. It is unlawful for any responsible adult
knowingly to permit or to allow a minor to be in any public place in the City
within the time periods prohibited by this section unless the minor’s presence
falls within one of the above exceptions.
5.   Enforcement Procedures.
   A.   Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in the
absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driver’s license,
a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance, use his
or her best judgment in determining age.
   B.   Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody. Grounds for arrest are that
the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the person’s
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any non-secured setting. The law enforcement
officer shall not place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor
unless the minor physically resists or threatens physical violence when being
taken into custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew
violation.
   C.   Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into custody,
the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the minor as
soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible for the
minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at such
time as the court may direct.
   D.   Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minor’s parent, guardian or other person
legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the
law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative
of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person
who is known to the child.
6.   Penalties.
   A.   Responsible Adult’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation
by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall, by certified mail, send to the
adult responsible for the minor, written notice of the violation with a warning
that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew
ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with applicable
penalties.
   B.   Responsible Adult’s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as defined
in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows the minor
to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a municipal
infraction.
   C.   Minor’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a minor,
the law enforcement officer may give the minor a written warning, which states
that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew
ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with applicable
penalties, or, at the law enforcement officer’s discretion, may issue the minor
a citation for a first violation.
   D.   Minor’s Second Violation. For the minor’s second and subsequent
violations of any of the provisions of this section, the minor is guilty of a
municipal infraction.
46.02   CIGARETTES AND TOBACCO.
It is unlawful for any person under eighteen (18) years of age to smoke, use,
possess, purchase or attempt to purchase any tobacco, tobacco products or
cigarettes. Possession of cigarettes or tobacco products by a person under
eighteen years of age shall not constitute a violation of this section if said
person possesses the cigarettes or tobacco products as part of the person’s
employment and said person is employed by a person who holds a valid permit
under Chapter 453A of the Code of Iowa and lawfully offers for sale or sells
cigarettes or tobacco products.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 453A.2)

It is unlawful for any per-son to encourage any child under eighteen (18) years

the nuisance or condition exceeds one hundred dollars ($100.00), the City may

Notes
  † EDITOR’S NOTE: A suggested form of notice for the abatement of nuisances is
  included in the Appendix of this Code of Ordinances. Caution is urged in the use
  of this administrative abatement procedure, particularly where cost of abatement
3 is more than minimal or where there is doubt as to whether or not a nuisance does
  in fact exist. If compliance is not secured following notice and hearings, we
  recommend you review the situation with your attorney before proceeding with
  abatement and assessment of costs. Your attorney may recommend proceedings in
  court under Chapter 657 of the Code of Iowa rather than this procedure.
50.07   MUNICIPAL INFRACTION ABATEMENT PROCEDURE.
In lieu of the abatement procedures set forth in Section
50.06, the requirements of this chapter may be enforced under the procedures
applicable to municipal infractions as set forth in

custody any abandoned vehicle on private property. The police authority may
employ its own personnel, equipment, and facilities or hire a private entity,

to exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property within the
time provided shall be deemed a waiver by the owner, lienholders and claimants
of all right, title, claim and interest in the vehicle or personal property and
that failure to reclaim the vehicle or personal property is deemed consent to
the sale of the vehicle at a public auction or disposal of the vehicle to a
demolisher and to disposal of the personal property by sale or destruction. If
the abandoned vehicle was taken into custody by a private entity without a
police authority’s initiative, the notice shall state that the private entity

vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice
under Section
80.03. The published notice may contain multiple listings of abandoned vehicles
and personal property but shall be published within the same time requirements
and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed notice in Section
80.03.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3b])
80.05   FEES FOR IMPOUNDMENT.
The owner, lienholder, or claimant shall pay twenty dollars ($20.00) if claimed
within five (5) days of impounding, plus two dollars ($2.00) for each
additional day within the reclaiming period plus towing charges, if stored by
the City, or towing and storage fees, if stored in a public garage, whereupon

vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without notification
procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more wheels or
other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable. The police
authority shall give the applicant a certificate of authority. The applicant

surrender the certificate of authority in lieu of the certificate of title.

of auction, cost of towing, preserving, storing, and notification required, in
accordance with State law. Any balance shall be held for the owner of the motor

2.   Refunding Deposit. Homeowner customers having established twelve (12)
months of consecutive billing shall be eligible for a reimbursement of their
deposit if during the 12-month period the customer has not been sent a
delinquency notice. The deposit will be refunded or credited to the customer’s
account without interest. However, if the customer has been sent a delinquency
notice during the 12-month period, the Clerk's office will hold the deposit for
another 12 months from the date of the delinquency, and the above procedure
will again be used. If the deposit has been refunded and the customer's service
is terminated for nonpayment, the deposit will again be required. Rental
customers deposits will be applied to the last bill and any remaining will be
mailed to forwarding address.

services as a result of moving out of the premises, the Clerk may draw on the
deposit for the amount of arrears. Any remainder shall be returned to the last-
known address of the customer or to the customer in person. Where the customer
pays all amounts due at the time of moving out of the City, the full amount of
the deposit shall be paid to the customer in person or by mail. Where the
customer fails to pay after a turnoff, the Clerk may draw on the deposit for
the amount of arrears, and the balance of the deposit held to apply on the
succeeding deposit required at the same or other premises, and water shall not
be turned on until the deposit is sufficient.
4.   Insufficient Deposit. If a deposit is not adequate to pay all arrears at
time of customer's moving from the premises, the balance shall be rebilled and
the bill sent to the last-known address of the customer. Where such rebilling
is not paid within thirty (30) days after the mailing of the rebilling, the
Clerk shall turn the billing over to the Collection Agency for collection.
Where the customer applies for services at a new premises, the past due amount
shall be paid and an adequate deposit made before water may be turned on.
92.10   TEMPORARY VACANCY.
A property owner may request water service be temporarily discontinued and shut
off at the curb valve when the property is expected to be vacant for an
extended period of time. There shall be a five dollar ($5.00) fee collected for
shutting the water off at the curb valve and a five dollar ($5.00) fee for
restoring service. During a period when service is temporarily discontinued as
provided herein there shall be no minimum service charge. The City will not
drain pipes or pull meters for temporary vacancies.
92.11 PROPERTY OWNER’S RESPONSIBILITY.  
Property owners are required to notify City Hall of all “Change in Use” of
their rental units. This must be done to ensure the rates are properly
computed, especially in rental units where there is not a separate water meter
for the rental unit. In the event the property owner fails to notify City Hall
of the “Change in Use” of the rental unit and the change is discovered by the
City, all charges will be retroactively enforced and billed to the property
owner.

All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a twenty-four (24) hour composite of all
outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken. Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses
are obtained from twenty-four (24) hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s
are determined from periodic grab samples).

private project, or as the result of the initial request of a commercial or
private developer or other non-public entity, the Company shall receive payment
for the cost of such relocation as a precondition to relocating its existing
facilities or equipment. The City shall consider reasonable alternatives in
designing its public works projects so as not arbitrarily to cause the Company
unreasonable additional expense in exercising its authority under this section.
The City shall also provide a reasonable alternative location for the Company’s
facilities. The City shall give the Company reasonable advance written notice
to vacate a public right-of-way. Vacating a public right-of-way shall not

or to defend, indemnify and hold Company harmless if such disputes arise from
claims of inaccurate billing by the Company.

annexation, or changes in the limits of said City, the City Clerk shall provide
written notification to an officer of Company of such annexation or change in

6.   The sum of such additional charges for the franchise fee and any
additional charges related to this section shall be shown separately on the

114.01   PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide regulatory provisions of cable
television systems in the City.
114.02   DEFINITIONS.
The following words and phrases, when used herein, shall, for the purposes of
this chapter, have the meanings ascribed to them in this section:
1.   “Company” means Complete Communication Services (CCS), an Iowa corporation
maintaining its offices in Stratford, Iowa, the grantee of rights under the
regulatory ordinance codified in this chapter. Any other firm granted a cable
television franchise in the City would also be governed by this chapter.
2.   “Federal Communications Commission” or “FCC” means the Federal agency by
that name as constituted by the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.
3.   “System” means the lines, fixtures, equipment, attachments and
appurtenances thereto which are used in the construction, operation and
maintenance of the community antenna television system authorized by this
chapter.
114.03   GRANTING OF FRANCHISE.
The regulatory ordinance codified herein which grants to the company the
nonexclusive right to construct, operate and maintain a cable television system
in the City was passed and adopted by the Council after a full, open and public
proceeding. The proceeding was held after public notice was given and afforded
all interested parties the opportunity to comment upon the legal, character,
financial, technical and other qualifications of the company. Having received
at said proceeding all comments regarding the qualifications of the company,
the City found that the company possesses the necessary legal, technical,
character, financial and other qualifications and that the company’s
construction arrangements are adequate and feasible. Therefore, the City grants
to the company a nonexclusive franchise, right and privilege to construct,
erect, operate, modify and maintain in, upon, among, across, above and over and
under the highways, streets, alleys, sidewalks, public ways and public places
now laid out or dedicated and all extensions thereof, and additions thereto in
the City, poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and other
television conductors and fixtures necessary for the maintenance and operation
in the City of a cable television system for the purpose of distributing
television and radio signals, and other electronic impulses in order to furnish
television and radio programs, and various communications and other electronic
services to the public. The right so granted includes the right to use and
occupy said streets, alleys, public ways and public places and all manner of
easements for the purposes set forth in this chapter.
114.04   COMPLIANCE REQUIRED GENERALLY.
The company shall, at all times during the life of the regulatory ordinance
codified in this chapter, be subject to all lawful exercise of the police power
by the City and to such reasonable regulations as the City shall hereafter by
resolution or ordinance provide. The construction, operation and maintenance of
the system by the company shall be in full compliance with such portions of the
National Electrical Safety Code as may be applicable and as the same may be
amended and revised from time to time, and in full compliance with all other
applicable rules and regulations now in effect or hereafter adopted by the
Federal Communications Commission, the City or any other agency of the State or
the United States, which may hereafter acquire jurisdiction of the operations
of the company authorized in this chapter. The company will provide a minimum
of 5 satellite signals with an additional 4 off-air channels.
114.05   NATIONAL ELECTRIC SAFETY CODE.
All facilities and equipment of the company shall be constructed and maintained
in accordance with the requirements of the National Electrical Safety Code, and
such applicable ordinances and regulations set forth by the City and/or any
local, State or Federal agencies.
114.06   FCC REGULATIONS.
The company shall, at all times, comply with the rules and regulations
governing CATV operations promulgated by the FCC, specifically those set out in
Section 76.31 of the FCC Rules and Regulations. This shall include adherence by
the company to FCC rules regarding technical and engineering specifications
involved in the construction of the CATV system and signal carriage therein.
114.07   MODIFICATION OF FCC RULES.
Consistent with the requirements of Rule 76.31 (a)(6) of the FCC, any
modification of Rule 76.31 resulting from amendment thereto by the FCC shall be
incorporated in this chapter by specific amendment thereto by lawful action of
the Council within one year from the effective date of the FCC’s amendment or
at the time of renewal of the ordinance codified in this chapter, whichever
occurs first.
114.08   TRANSFER.
The company shall not sell or transfer its system to another, or transfer any
rights under this chapter to another without written notice and approval by the
City; provided, that such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld if the
vendee, assignee or lessee has filed with the appropriate official of the City
an instrument duly executed, reciting the fact of such sale, assignment or
lease, accepting the terms of this chapter and agreeing to perform all
conditions thereof.
114.09   COMPANY RULES AND REGULATIONS.
The company shall have the authority to promulgate such rules, regulations,
terms and conditions governing the conduct of its business as shall be
reasonably necessary to enable the company to exercise its rights and perform
its obligations under this chapter and to assure uninterrupted service to each
and all of its customers; provided, however, that such rules, regulations,
terms and conditions shall not be in conflict with the provisions hereof or of
federal and State law.
114.10   FRANCHISE TERM.
The franchise granted under this chapter shall terminate fifteen (15) years
from the date of grant, subject to renewal for period of reasonable duration on
the same terms and conditions as contained in this chapter, or on such
different or additional terms and conditions as may be lawfully specified by
the Council and as are consistent with the requirements of Rule 76.31 of the
FCC.
This franchise shall not be exclusive and shall neither restrict the Council in
the exercise of its regulatory power, nor prevent it from granting any other
cable television system franchise.
114.11   FRANCHISE RENEWAL.
No renewal of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall be effective except
pursuant to a public proceeding affording due process. The company shall be a
party to any such proceedings and any other proceedings in which its rights,
privileges or interests would be affected and shall be fully entitled to such
due process rights as may be available under applicable laws, ordinances, rules
and regulations.
114.12   SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION, MAINTENANCE AND PROCEDURES.
1.   In furtherance of the company’s execution of contracts with public utility
companies or any other owner or lessee of any poles located within or without
the City to whatever extent such contract or contracts may be expedient and of
advantage to the company for use of poles and posts necessary for proper
installation of the system, the company may obtain right-of-way permits from
appropriate State, County and Federal officials necessary to cross highways or
roads under their respective jurisdictions, to supply main trunk lines from the
company’s receiving antennas, obtain permission from the Federal Aviation
Authority to erect and maintain antennas suitable to the needs of the system
and its subscribers and obtain whatever other permits a City, County, State or
Federal agency may require. The company shall construct its cable system using
material of good and durable quality and all work involved in the construction,
installation, maintenance and repair of the cable system shall be performed in
a safe, thorough and reliable manner. Any municipal property damaged or
destroyed shall be promptly repaired or replaced by the company and restored to
serviceable condition.
2.   The company’s system, poles, wires and appurtenances shall be located,
erected and maintained so that none of its facilities shall endanger or
interfere with the lives of persons or interfere with any improvements the City
may deem proper to make or unnecessarily hinder or obstruct the free use of the
streets, alleys, bridges, easements or public property.
3.   In the event that the City annexes further territory as authorized by the
law, the company shall extend energized trunk cable to the remaining portions
of the City so annexed within an acceptable time thereafter, unless additional
time is granted by the Council upon request of the company for good cause
shown. Extension of service shall not be one of the requirements as set forth
in this section.
4.   All transmission and distribution structures, lines and equipment erected
by the company within the City shall be so located as to cause minimum
interference with the proper use of streets, alleys and other public ways and
places, and to cause minimum interference with the rights of reasonable
convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the said streets, alleys or
other public ways and places. In the event the electrical and phone lines are
buried to the subscriber’s residence, the company shall be required to bury the
cable also.
5.   In case of any disturbance of pavement, sidewalk, driveway, grass or other
surfacing, the company shall, at its own cost and expense and in a manner
approved by the City, replace and restore all paving, sidewalk, driveway,
grass, shrubs, trees, fences or surface of any street or alley or other public
or private property in as good condition as before said work was commenced.
6.   In the event that at any time during the period of the franchise the City
lawfully elects to alter or change the grade of any street, alley or other
public way, the company, upon reasonable notice by the City, shall remove,
relay or relocate its poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and
other fixtures at its own expense.
7.   The company shall not place poles or other fixtures where the same will
interfere with any gas, electric or telephone fixtures, water hydrants or mains
and all such poles or other fixtures placed in any street shall be placed at
the outer edge of the sidewalk and inside the curb line, and those placed in
alleys shall be placed close to the line of the lot abutting on said alley, and
then in such manner as not to interfere with the usual travel on said streets,
alleys and public ways.
8.   The company shall, on the request of any person holding a building moving
permit issued by the City temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the
moving of buildings. The expense of such temporary removal, raising or lowering
of wires shall be paid by the person requesting the same and the company shall
have the authority to require such payment in advance. The company shall be
given no less than forty-eight (48) hours advance notice to arrange for such
temporary wire changes.
9.   The company shall have the authority to trim trees upon and overhanging
streets, alleys, sidewalks and public places of the City so as to prevent the
branches of such trees from coming in contact with the wires and cables. All
tree trimming is to be done under the direction of the City and at the expense
of the company.
10.   The company shall provide, upon request and without charge, service to
any municipal buildings owned and operated by the City and to any public or
parochial elementary or secondary school. This shall mean only an energized
cable to such building. The cost of any internal wiring shall be borne by the
institution.
114.13   LINE EXTENSIONS.
It shall be the obligation of the company to serve all residents of the City
except to the extent that density of homes, adverse terrain or other factors
render providing service impracticable, technically infeasible or economically
noncompensatory. For purposes of determining compliance with the provisions of
this section, the company shall extend service to new subscribers at the normal
installation charge and monthly rate for customers of that classification where
there is an average of fifty-five (55) homes per each linear mile of new cable
construction. In the event that the requirements of this section are not met,
extensions of service shall be required only on a basis which is reasonable and
compensatory.
114.14   PURCHASE OF SYSTEM BY CITY.
If the City determines not to reissue the franchise for reasons other than a
material breach of the franchise or reasons unrelated to the performance of the
franchise holder or upon receipt of an application for assignment of the
franchise, or upon change of de facto control, the company shall first offer
the cable television system for sale to the City at a fair and just market
value, which value shall include the fair market value of the system as a going
concern including the franchise itself and the rights and privileges granted by
the City. When a franchise is revoked pursuant to this section or expires and
is not renewed because of a material breach of the franchise, the company shall
first offer the cable television system for sale to the City at a fair and just
market value, which value shall not include any value for the franchise itself
or for any of the rights and privileges granted by the City. In the event the
determination of fair market value cannot be negotiated or determined, said
value shall be determined by an impartial arbitration procedure pursuant to
State law, wherein the company and the City shall each choose an arbitrator and
the arbitrators chosen shall choose the third and the valuation determined by
said arbitrators shall be considered the fair market value at which the system
will be offered to the City. The determination of the value of the system shall
be decreased by the amount of any damages sustained by the City in connection
with revocation or expiration, including without limitation, payment made by
the City to another person or entity to operate the cable television system for
a temporary period after revocation. The cost of the arbitration procedures
shall be shared equally by the City and the company. The City shall have ninety
(90) days to exercise the right of first refusal to purchase the network, said
ninety (90) days commencing on the day the fair market value of the system is
determined either through negotiation or the arbitration procedure. If the City
does not exercise its option to purchase, and the system is not sold to another
operator who has obtained a franchise from the City in a reasonable period of
time, the company, upon request by the City, shall promptly remove all its
plant, structures, and equipment; provided, however, that in the event the City
determines not to exercise its right of first refusal, it shall not
unreasonably refuse to renew or grant a cable television franchise during a
reasonable interim period. While transfer of the system and franchise are being
negotiated, arranged or ordered, the company may be required to continue
service to the public unless for reasons beyond the control of the company said
operation will be economically unfeasible to the company.
114.15   CITY RIGHTS.
1.   City Rules. The right is reserved by the City to adopt, in addition to the
provisions contained in this chapter and existing applicable ordinances, such
additional regulations as it shall find necessary in the exercise of its police
power; provided, that such regulations, by ordinance or otherwise, shall be
reasonable and not in conflict with the rights granted in this chapter, and
shall not be in conflict with the applicable laws of the State or the United
States.
2.   Use of System by City. The City shall have the right, during the life of
the franchise, of maintaining upon the poles or in the underground conduits of
the company within the City limits wire and fixtures necessary for a traffic
control system and/or a police and fire alarm system. Such wires and fixtures
shall be installed and maintained at the sole expense of the City and shall at
all times comply with all reasonable rules and regulations of the company so
that there may be a minimum danger of contact or conflict between the wires and
fixtures of the company and the wires and fixtures used by the City.
3.   Emergency or Disaster. In the case of any emergency or disaster, the
company shall, upon request of the City, make available its facilities to the
City for emergency use during the emergency or disaster period.
4.   Liability. The City shall not be liable for any damage occurring to the
property of the company caused by employees of the City in the performance of
their duties, except for damage caused to the company’s facilities by the
negligence of the City’s employees. The City shall not be liable for the
interruption of service by actions of City employees in the performance of
their duties, nor shall the City be liable for the failure of the company to be
able to perform normal services due to acts of God or other factors beyond the
control of the City.
5.   No Property Right. Nothing in this chapter shall grant to the company any
right of property in the City-owned property, nor shall the City be compelled
to maintain any of its property any longer than or in any fashion other than in
the City’s judgment, its own business or needs may require.
6.   Construction Approval by City. Except for individual service drops, the
company shall not erect any pole, install any underground lines or conduits,
run any line, make any attachment, nor shall any construction of any kind be
commenced without the prior approval of the director of engineering or
appropriate department of the City, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, and the City shall have and maintain the right to inspect the
construction, operation and maintenance of the system by the company to insure
the proper performance of the terms of this chapter.
7.   Correction of Defects. In the event the company should violate any of the
terms of this chapter, or any of the rules and regulations as may be from time
to time lawfully adopted, the City shall immediately give to the company thirty
(30) days written notice to correct such violation and in the event the company
does not make such correction within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such

the permit before covering said work or at completion shall result in
revocation of the permit and void any associated approvals granted by the City.
This failure shall also equate to working without a permit in violation of the
City Code and no future permits shall be issued to any person or company who
has outstanding violations of this code or any other laws or ordinances of the
City. Failure to contact the City for any inspection or follow-up prior to
expiration of a permit shall be deemed a violation of this code section.
Failure to contact the City for any inspection or follow-up prior to expiration
of a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy shall also be deemed a violation of
this code section. Allowing occupancy of a structure, for which a person or
company holds a building permit, prior to or without a valid Certificate of

outstanding violations of this code or any other laws or ordinances of the
City.”

Published data is utilized by the Administrative Official in an effort to
maintain consistency and fairness for permit fee calculations. It is not
intended to reflect actual taxable value.
   The method for determining the value of the additional listed residential

151.03   AUTHORITY OF CITY GENERALLY.
The City shall have jurisdiction over all trees and other planting on the
streets, highways, alleys, right-of-ways and City grounds within the City in
order to provide orderly tree trimming and removal, to protect the health of
all trees from disease and to require trees and planting to be maintained in a
manner not dangerous to public safety.
151.04   TRIMMING OR REMOVAL.
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed so as to give or recognize any
property or vested rights in and to any trees heretofore or hereafter planted
on any street right-of-way in the City; the City expressly reserves and asserts
its rights at any time to trim or remove or cause to be trimmed or removed any
tree now or hereafter planted on any street right-of-way whenever the Street
Superintendent deems such trimming or removal advisable for the purpose of
street improvements, or to eliminate hazardous situations or for the needs of
travel of traffic without compensation to the abutting property owners.
151.05   SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY OF STREET SUPERINTENDENT.
The Street Superintendent shall be responsible for the enforcement of
provisions of this chapter and the supervision of all work by City employees or
contractors in the trimming, removal, maintenance, or planting of trees and
other plantings on the streets, highways, alleys, right-of-ways, and other City
property. No person shall interfere or cause any person to interfere with any
work being done under the provisions of this chapter by any employee of the
City or by any person doing work for the City.
151.06   PLANTING RESTRICTIONS.
No tree shall be planted in any street right-of-way except in accordance with
the following: No person shall plant a tree within the street right-of-way
without first obtaining a permit therefor, which shall show the type of tree to
be planted and the placement of the tree. The application form for such permit
is available at City Hall. The application for a permit shall not be considered
by the Street Superintendent unless and until the applicant has staked the
exact location for the proposed street tree and has obtained permission to dig
in such exact location from all concerned utilities. The approval of the permit
shall be at the discretion of the Street Superintendent, taking into account
the provisions of this chapter and the best interests of the community. The
permit shall expire 30 days from date of issue. The tree planting must comply
with the City Arboricultural Specifications and Standards of Practice. There
will be no fee for this permit.
151.07   ARBORICULTURAL SPECIFICATIONS AND STANDARDS OF PRACTICE.
1.   Establishment. There is hereby established an Arboricultural
Specifications and Standards of Practice document of and for the City. This
document includes but is not limited to: (i) species of street trees allowed
and banned; (ii) the spacing between street trees and distances from fixed
objects; (iii) proximity of street trees to utility lines; and (iv) topping.
2.   Authority. The performance standards and specifications contained within
the City Arboricultural Specifications and Standards of Practice shall be
considered a part of this chapter and made subject to all its provisions.
151.08   TREES ON PUBLIC PROPERTY.
1.   Permits. No person except the City or a person hired by the City shall
plant or remove any tree on any street right-of-way without first filing an
application and obtaining a permit from the City. The person receiving the
permit shall abide by the Arboricultural Specifications and Standards of
Practice as adopted by the City. The City shall have the authority to require
any permit holder to show adequate insurance coverage to cover potential
damages that occur during the execution of the work. In the case of the
property owner doing the work, proof of homeowner personal liability insurance
may be required. If the property owner has hired another person or contractor
to do the work, the contractor shall provide the City with a certificate of
insurance. The certificates shall show the following minimum required limits of
coverage of Commercial General Liability Insurance with limits of not less than
$500,000 per occurrence and Worker’s Compensation Insurance coverage at
statutory limits on any and all employees. A public utility shall also be
required to obtain a permit to trim or remove any tree on any street or other
public place. The work shall be limited to the actual necessities of the
service of the company in the area specified on the permit. This work shall be
done in accordance with the Arboricultural Specifications and Standards of
Practice as established for the City. The City may assign an inspector to
supervise the provisions of the permit. The cost of the service shall be
charged to the public utility. In the event severe weather has caused a tree to
damage utility lines, the utility company or the City (or authorized agent) may
trim or remove trees necessary to repair the damaged utility lines without
first obtaining a permit. A permit should be obtained before any additional
trimming not required for repair of the utility line is done.
2.   Planting.
   A.   Tree Species. The City Council shall develop and maintain a list of
desirable trees for planting in the street right-of-way as part of the City’s
Arboricultural Specifications and Standards of Practice. The City Council shall
also establish and maintain a list of trees not suitable for planting.
   B.   Spacing. In order to promote the healthy and vigorous growth of street
trees, their spacing shall be in accordance with the City’s Arboricultural
Specifications and Standards of Practice.
   C.   Utilities. In order to minimize obstructions and conflicts, the
placement of street trees under, over, adjacent to or near utility lines shall
be limited as specified in the City’s Arboricultural Specifications and
Standards of Practice.
   D.   Distance from Curb and Sidewalk. In order to promote the healthy and
vigorous growth of street trees, certain distances as specified in the City’s
Arboricultural Specifications and Standards of Practice from curbs, sidewalks,
driveways, and intersections shall be maintained.
   E.   Excavation and Construction. In order to promote and ensure the healthy
and vigorous growth of street trees, any excavation, filling or construction
occurring within an area specified in the City’s Arboricultural Specifications
and Standards of Practice of a street tree is prohibited unless a permit is
obtained from the City.
   F.   Storage. The depositing, placement, storage or maintenance of any
stone, brick, sand, concrete or other material within the drip line of a tree
which may impede the free passage of water, air or fertilizer to the roots of
any street tree is prohibited without obtaining a permit.
3.   Maintenance. Due to the existence of City street trees, the resulting
tree-lined streets provide both aesthetic and monetary value to the property
owner; therefore, the primary care and maintenance of street trees shall be the
responsibility of the adjacent homeowner. Persons shall maintain trees and
plants in the street right-of-way on which their property abuts at the same
standard of care imposed on persons growing trees and plants on private
property. It shall be the duty of any person growing a tree or other plant on
any street right-of-way abutting a street or public place:
   A.   To keep all street trees and plantings extending over any street or
alley trimmed up to a height of not less than fifteen (15) feet except that a
height of not less than eight (8) feet shall be permitted over the sidewalk
area, and also to keep said space clear of debris. If the abutting property
owner fails to trim the trees, the City may serve notice on the abutting
property owner requiring that such action be taken within five (5) days. If
such action is not taken within that time, the City may perform the required
action and assess the costs against the abutting property for collection in the
same manner as a property tax.
   B.   Not to plant any tree or other plant which would cause a public danger
or a nuisance.
   C.   To treat in an accepted manner or remove any tree or plant diseased or
insect-ridden as to constitute a hazard to other trees or plants or to
constitute a nuisance to the health, welfare and safety of the community.
4.   Removal. If, in the opinion of the City, removal of a street tree becomes
necessary, the adjacent property shall be notified as specified in the City’s
Arboricultural Specifications and Standards of Practice. In the event the
adjacent property requests the removal of a street tree or shrub the City does
not consider the removal necessary, the property owner may appeal the Street
Superintendent’s decision to the City Council as outlined in Section
151.11 of this chapter.
5.   Traffic Control. In the event the planting, maintenance, or removal of any
tree requires equipment or material to be located on or fall onto the street,
the permit holder shall provide for traffic control. All traffic control shall
conform to the requirements and specifications of the current edition of the
Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices. In all cases, the disruption of
smooth traffic flow shall be kept to a minimum. Additional warning devices or
precautionary measures may be necessary to control pedestrian traffic.
6.   Protection. No person shall:
   A.   Damage, cut, carve, nail, bolt or set fire to any street tree;
   B.   Attach any rope, chain or wire cable to any street tree;
   C.   Attach advertising posters or any other contrivance to any street tree;
or
   D.   Allow any harmful gaseous, liquid, chemical or solid substance to come
in contact with any street tree.
7.   Tree Topping. It is unlawful as a normal practice for any person or City
department to top any street tree, park tree or other tree on any street right-
of-way. Trees severely damaged by storms or other causes or certain trees under
utility wires or other obstructions where other pruning practices are
impractical may be exempted from this section at the determination of the
Street Superintendent.
151.09   TREES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.
1.   Maintenance. The property owner is responsible for the maintenance and
care of any tree located on any street right-of-way. Certain regulations apply
to trees whose branches, limbs, roots or other parts extend into or over the
street right-of-way. The property owner is responsible for ensuring private
trees are trimmed to sufficient height to allow free passage of pedestrians and
vehicular travel and so they will not obstruct or shade streetlights, traffic
lights, signs or any traffic control devices or the view of any street
intersection. Detailed information is contained in the City’s Arboricultural
Specifications and Standards of Practice. Whenever the City is notified or
becomes aware of a diseased or dead tree or broken or dead branch or limb in
any private tree which is in imminent danger of falling and thereby injuring
any individual or causing property damage to adjacent property, the Street
Superintendent may declare the tree, branch or limb a hazard and a nuisance and
order the property owner to remove the hazard within in 14 days. Notification
shall be made by certified mail. If the property owner fails to remove the
hazard, the Street Superintendent may cause the hazard to be removed. For
purposes of removing the hazard, City crews or City agents shall be allowed on
private property. Attempts should be made to notify the property owner before
entering onto private property.
2.   Traffic Control. In the event the planting, maintenance, or removal of any
private tree requires equipment or material to be located on or fall onto the
street or street right-of-way, the homeowner or the homeowner’s agent shall
provide for traffic control. All traffic control shall conform to the
requirements and specifications of the current edition of the Manual of Uniform
Traffic Control Devices. In all cases the disruption of smooth traffic flow
shall be kept to a minimum. Additional warning devices or precautionary
measures may be necessary to control pedestrian traffic.
151.10   DISPOSITION OF WOOD PRODUCTS.
Upon recommendation by the Street Superintendent and approval by the City
Council, the City Clerk shall be given the authority to entertain bids for the
sale of wood byproducts to be disposed of by the City. Such byproducts may
include saw-logs, veneer-logs, firewood and wood chips.
151.11   ENFORCEMENT.
1.   Appeals. A person may appeal the issuance or denial of a permit authorized
by this chapter or an order of the Street Superintendent providing for the non-
emergency removal of a tree or shrub pursuant to the following procedure:
Within 10 days of receiving the decision from the Street Superintendent, a
person may appeal the decision of the Street Superintendent to the City Council
by filing a written notice of appeal with the City Clerk. The notice of appeal
shall state the nature of the objection and request a hearing. The hearing
shall be held before the City Council within 20 days after the notice of appeal
was filed with the City Clerk. The City Council shall, within 10 days after
hearing the appeal, issue a decision. The decision of the City Council shall
constitute a final decision.
2.   Interference. No person shall hinder, prevent, delay, or otherwise
interfere with the City or any assistants in the execution or enforcement of
this chapter.
3.   Penalties. Any person violating or failing to comply with the provisions
of this chapter shall be considered in violation, and provisions for the City
to abate the nuisance shall be made as specified in
Chapter 50 of this Code of Ordinances.

152.02 Penalty
152.01 MOWING OF PROPERTIES.
Any property within the City, whether vacated or non-vacated, is required to be
mowed any time the vegetation reaches a height of more than eight (8) inches.
(Ord. 85 – Jun. 13 Supp.)
152.02   PENALTY.
Any property which is not mowed by the above height may be mowed by the City or
its agents, and a charge of $75.00 per hour (with a minimum of one hour, and
any additional time over the first hour billed in half-hour increments), for
such mowing, plus a surcharge of $100.00, will be charged to the property
owner. Any property owner who fails to mow his or her property, thus allowing
the same to be mowed by the City, and who does not provide payment for the
mowing as required, will be assessed by the City for such costs, which will be
collected in the same manner as general property taxes.
(Ord. 92 – Feb. 16 Supp.)
152.03   METHOD OF SERVICE AND BILLING.
Annual publication of this chapter will serve as notice to property owners. Any

160.02   STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
1.   The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 414, Code of Iowa, as
amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure
safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
2.   Findings of Fact.
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Roland are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of
the community.
   B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by:
(i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
   C.   This ordinance relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the City of Roland and its
residents and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and
comfort and convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses
described in Section
160.02(2)(A) of this ordinance with provisions designed to:
   A.   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows so
that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
   B.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
   C.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
   D.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
   E.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03   GENERAL PROVISIONS.

shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full
compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this ordinance.
5.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this ordinance
to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this ordinance shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency
only.
6.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this ordinance shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
7.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
ordinance are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This ordinance
does not imply that areas outside the designated Floodplain (Overlay) District
areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance shall not
create liability on the part of the City of Roland or any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or
any administrative decision lawfully made there under.
8.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
ordinance is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent

permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance (or
underlying zoning district) and provided they meet applicable performance
standards of the Floodway District.
2.   Performance Standards. All Floodway District uses allowed as a permitted
use shall meet the following standards.
   A.   No development shall be permitted in the Floodway District that would
result in any increase in the base flood elevation. Consideration of the
effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption
that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly situated
lands.
   B.   All development within the Floodway District shall:
      (1)   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
      (2)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
      (3)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
   C.   No development shall affect the capacity or conveyance of the channel
or floodway of any tributary to the main stream, drainage ditch or any other
drainage facility or system.
   D.   Structures, buildings, recreational vehicles, and sanitary and utility
systems, if permitted, shall meet the applicable performance standards of the
Floodway Fringe District and shall be constructed or aligned to present the
minimum possible resistance to flood flows.
   E.   Structures, if permitted, shall have a low flood damage potential and

modifications) must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within
the altered or relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations
must be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
   H.   Any fill allowed in the floodway must be shown to have some beneficial
purpose and shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary.
   I.   Pipeline river or stream crossings shall be buried in the streambed and
banks or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due to channel
degradation and meandering or due to the action of flood flows.
160.07   FLOODWAY FRINGE (OVERLAY) DISTRICT (FF).
1.   Permitted Uses. All development within the Floodway Fringe District shall
be permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance
(or underlying zoning district) and provided they meet applicable performance
standards of the Floodway Fringe District.
2.   Performance Standards. All development must be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance standards.
Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no development may increase the Base
Flood Elevation more than one (1) foot. The applicant will be responsible for
providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical
information to make such determination.
   A.   All development shall:
      (1)   Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse
or lateral movement.

compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than 1.0 ft. above the
base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed where existing topography,
street grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the
methods used must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the
various forces and hazards associated with flooding.
All new residential structures located in areas that would become isolated due
to flooding of surrounding ground shall be provided with a means of access that
will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this
criterion shall not apply where the Administrator determines there is
sufficient flood warning time for the protection of life and property. When
estimating flood warning time, consideration shall be given to the criteria
listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa Administrative Code.

When floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State
of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and
other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the
base flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
   D.   All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
      (1)   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
         a.   A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
         b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade.
         c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
      Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access
and low damage potential storage.
      (2)   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
      (3)   New and substantially improved structures must be constructed with
electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment and
other service facilities elevated or floodproofed to a minimum of one (1) foot
above the base flood elevation.

those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the structure
is a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation.
      (2)   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Anchorage systems
may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to
ground anchors as required by the State Building Code.
   F.   Utility and Sanitary Systems.
      (1)   On-site wastewater disposal and water supply systems shall be
located or designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the
system during flooding.
      (2)   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system as well
as the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment facilities
(other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood protection
equal to or greater than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation.
      (3)   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water
supply treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with
a level of protection equal to or greater than one (1) foot above the base

constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
   G.   Storage of materials and equipment that are flammable, explosive, or
injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited unless elevated a
minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Other material and
equipment must either be similarly elevated or (i) not be subject to major
flood damage and be anchored to prevent movement due to flood waters or (ii) be
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
   H.   Flood control structural works such as levees, flood walls, etc. shall
provide, at a minimum, protection from the base flood with a minimum of 3 ft.
of design freeboard and shall provide for adequate interior drainage. In
addition, the Department of Natural Resources shall approve structural flood
control works.

Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all lots with
a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the base
flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five (5) acres or fifty (50)
lots (whichever is less) shall include base flood elevation data for those
areas located within the Floodplain Fringe (Overlay) District.
   K.   Accessory Structures to Residential Uses.
      (1)   Detached garages, sheds, and similar structures that are incidental
to a residential use are exempt from the base flood elevation requirements
where the following criteria are satisfied.
         a.   The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential. Its size shall not exceed 600 sq. ft. in size. Those portions of the
structure located less than 1 foot above the base flood elevation must be
constructed of flood-resistant materials.
         b.   The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage potential
purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure shall not
be used for human habitation.
         c.   The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building
site so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
         d.   The structure shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement which may result in damage to other structures.
         e.   The structure’s service facilities such as electrical and heating
equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above the base
flood elevation.
         f.   The structure’s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of Section
160.07(2)(D)(1) of this ordinance.
      (2)   Exemption from the base flood elevation requirements for such a
structure may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of
the structure and its contents.
   L.   Recreational Vehicles.
      (1)   Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of Section
160.07(2)(E) of this ordinance regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-
built homes when the following criteria are satisfied:
         a.   The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less
than 180 consecutive days, and,
         b.   The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
      (2)   Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than
180 consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements
of Section
160.07(2)(E) of this ordinance regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-
built homes.
   M.   Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be buried in the streambed
and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due to
channel degradation and meandering.
   N.   Maximum Damage Potential Development. All new or substantially improved
maximum damage potential development shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the elevation of the 500-
year flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be
floodproofed to such a level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional
engineer registered in the State of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing
methods used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities,
impact and uplift forces and other factors associated with the 0.2% annual
chance flood; and that the structure, below the 0.2% annual chance flood
elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water. A record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in
relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator. Where 0.2% chance flood
elevation data has not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The
applicant will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources
with sufficient technical information to make such determinations.
160.08   GENERAL FLOODPLAIN (OVERLAY) DISTRICT (GF).
1.   Permitted Uses.
   A.   All development within the General Floodplain District shall be
permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance (or
underlying zoning district) and provided they meet the applicable performance
standards of the General Floodplain District.
   B.   Any development which involves placement of structures, factory-built
homes, fill or other obstructions, storage of materials or equipment,
excavation or alteration of a watercourse shall be reviewed by the Department
of Natural Resources to determine (i) whether the land involved is either
wholly or partly within the floodway or floodway fringe and (ii) the base flood
elevation. The applicant shall be responsible for providing the Department of
Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make the
determination.
   C.   Review by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources is not required for
the proposed construction of new or replacement bridges or culverts where:
      (1)   The bridge or culvert is located on a stream that drains less than
two (2) square miles, and

fringe as determined by the Department of Natural Resources shall meet the
applicable provisions and standards of the Floodway Fringe (Overlay) District
(Section
160.077).
160.09   APPOINTMENT AND DUTIES OF BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
1.   Appointment and Duties of Board of Adjustment. A Board of Adjustment is
hereby established which shall hear and decide (i) appeals and (ii) requests
for variances to the provisions of this ordinance, and shall take any other
action which is required of the Board.
2.   Appeals. Where it is alleged there is any error in any order, requirement,
decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the
enforcement of this ordinance, the aggrieved party may appeal such action. The
notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board of Adjustment and with the
official from whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason
for the appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to
the Board of Adjustment all the documents constituting the record upon which
the action appealed from was taken.
3.   Variance. The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in specific
cases such variances from the terms of this ordinance that will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance will result in unnecessary
hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards:
   A.   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
   B.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
   C.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   D.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection
for structures than what is ordinarily required by this ordinance, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and
(ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
   E.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
4.   Hearings and Decisions of the Board of Adjustment.
   A.   Hearings. Upon the filing with the Board of Adjustment of an appeal or
a request for a variance, the Board shall hold a public hearing. The Board
shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing and give public notice thereof, as
well as due notice to parties in interest. At the hearing, any party may appear
in person or by agent or attorney and present written or oral evidence. The
Board may require the appellant or applicant to provide such information as is
reasonably deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or
evaluation of a professional engineer or other expert person or agency,
including the Department of Natural Resources.
   B.   Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal or
variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an appeal, the Board may, so
long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance,
reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in
writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision.
In granting a variance, the Board shall consider such factors as contained in
this section and all other relevant sections of this ordinance and may
prescribe such conditions as contained in Section
160.09(4)(B)(2).
      (1)   Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board of Adjustment Shall Be
Based. In passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this ordinance and:
         a.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
         b.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
         c.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability
of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
         d.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         e.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the City.
         f.   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
         g.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
         h.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development
and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
         i.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for the area.
         j.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         k.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.
         l.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer,
gas, electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and bridges.
         m.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
ordinance.
      (2)   Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this
ordinance. Such conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
         a.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
         b.   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
         c.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed
restrictions.
         d.   Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this ordinance.
         e.   Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the
flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration,
rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated
with the regulatory flood. The Board of Adjustment shall require that the
applicant submit a plan or document certified by a registered professional
engineer that the floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory
flood protection elevation and associated flood factors for the particular
area.
5.   Appeals to the Court. Any person or persons, jointly or severally,
aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Adjustment may present to a court of
record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal,
in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition
shall be presented to the court within thirty days after the filing of the
decision in the office of the Board.
160.10   NONCONFORMING USES.
1.   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before
the passage or amendment of this ordinance, but which is not in conformity with
the provisions of this ordinance, may be continued subject to the following
conditions:
   A.   If such use is discontinued for six (6) consecutive months, any future
use of the building premises shall conform to this ordinance.
   B.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
   C.   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than fifty
(50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred,
unless it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance.
This limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with
existing State or local health, sanitary, building or safety codes or
regulations or the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National
Register of Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude
its continued designation.
2.   Except as provided in Section
160.10(1)(B), any use which has been permitted as a variance shall be
considered a conforming use.
160.11   PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
Violations of the provisions of this ordinance or failure to comply with any of
the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with grants of variances) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any
person who violates this ordinance or fails to comply with any of its
requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $500.00 (five
hundred dollars) or imprisoned for not more than 30 (thirty) days. Each day
such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein
contained prevent the City of Roland from taking such other lawful action as is
necessary to prevent or remedy violation.

1.   Intent. Planned Unit Development is intended to encourage a more
innovative approach to the development of land by permitting flexibility in
design, placement of buildings and the use of open spaces, while at the same
time retaining substantially the same population density and area coverage
permitted in the district in which the project is located.
2.   District is Overlay. The designation of a parcel or tract of land as a
Planned Unit Development shall be considered a rezoning, by the application of
the provisions of this Section
165.19 to said tract or parcel of land as an overlay zone. Provided, said tract
or parcel shall continue to be considered to be within the zoning district as
at the time of application for designation as a Planned Unit Development with
the additional designation PUD.
3.   Effect of Overlay. All provisions of this chapter shall continue to apply
to a parcel or tract of land designated PUD as if such rezoning had not
occurred, except as expressly modified by this Section.
4.   Uses Permitted. In a Planned Unit Development, only the following uses are
permitted:
   A.   In a residential Planned Unit Development:
      (1)   One-, two- and multiple-family dwellings.
      (2)   Other uses as permitted in Section
165.15.
      (3)   Neighborhood retail uses and those uses permitted in the C-
1 Commercial District may be specifically and selectively authorized as to type
and size only when integrated by design as an accessory element of the project.
   B.   In a Planned Unit Development designed primarily for other than
residential uses as permitted above, the uses shall be limited to those
permitted in the zoning district in which the use is to be located.
In a residential Planned Unit Development, the zoning of areas for commercial
uses shall not become effective until one-half of the total number of dwelling
units planned is completed.
5.   Common Area Required. In a residential Planned Unit Development there
shall be a minimum of ten percent of the total area of the planned area
development dedicated or reserved as suitable common open space land. Common
open space lands shall be clearly designated on the plan as to character of use
and development but shall not include:
   A.   Areas reserved for the exclusive use or benefit of an individual tenant
or owner, or
   B.   Dedicated streets, alleys, and other public right-of-ways, or
   C.   Vehicular drives, parking, loading and storage areas.
6.   Signs. Signs shall be permitted subject to the limitations of the basic
zoning district within which the sign is to be located.
7.   Layout and Design Requirements. The regulations, requirements and
standards of the zoning district in which the Planned Unit Development is to be
located shall apply to the layout and design of the total project, as a whole.
Where necessary to insure compatibility of buildings and uses with each other
and with off-site properties, the Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend
and the Council may specify modification of such regulations, requirements and
standards. The layout and design shall be subject to the following limitations
and exceptions:
   A.   Yards. The yard requirements for the district in which the Planned Unit
Development is located shall apply to all exterior boundary lines of the site,
except as otherwise provided on the approved development plan.
   B.   Rear and Side Yard Setback. For buildings and structures exceeding
fifteen feet in height, there shall be maintained a distance from side and rear
boundaries of the tract or parcel equal to the required yard.
   C.   Number of Dwelling Units. The number of dwelling units permitted shall
be determined by dividing the net development area of the site by the minimum
lot area per dwelling unit required in the district in which the project will
be located. Net development area shall be that area remaining after subtracting
those portions of the site set aside for nonresidential uses, such as schools,
parks and commercial.
   D.   Off-Street Parking. The total required off-street parking facilities
shall not be less than the sum of the required parking facilities for the
various uses computed separately in accordance with Section
165.27.
   E.   Height Limitations. Within a PUD, building height limitations may be
waived by the Council.
8.   Application for Rezoning to PUD.
An application to establish a Planned Unit Development project shall be filed
by the owner or owners having title to all of the property in the area proposed
for the planned area development on a form prescribed by the Zoning
Administrator.
9.   Site Plan Required. The application shall be accompanied by a site plan
and such other information which in the judgment of the Zoning Administrator is
necessary to fully determine the intent of the applicant.
10.   Contents of the Site Plan. The required site plan shall be drawn at a
scale of not less than 1² = 100¢ and shall, as a minimum, show:
   A.   The boundary of the PUD.
   B.   The type of structures proposed, number, height and size of dwelling
units, floor area of office or industrial building, buffers, landscaping,
parking area, walls, anticipated expansion and other information deemed
necessary to illustrate compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   C.   The general location of streets, utilities, and structures adjacent to
and within 200 feet of the boundary of the proposed PUD.
11.   Statement of Intent. An explanatory statement of the general purpose of
the project shall accompany the application. The statement shall supplement the
map with narrative information. The adoption of the text of the statement
specifying the particular nonresidential uses shall constitute a limitation to
those specific uses.
12.   Preliminary Plan. The approval of a planned unit development shall be by
the Council upon recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission subject
to procedures required for amendment contained in Section
165.27. A preliminary development plan shall be submitted to the Commission for
its review and recommendation. The Commission shall then advise the Council
that such plans do or do not comply with the provisions of this chapter.
Preliminary approval by the Council shall be binding as to the general intent
and apportionment of land and improvements, but shall not be construed to
render inflexible the ultimate design, specific uses or final plan of the
project.
13.   Final Development Plan. The applicant shall, within one year after the
date of the preliminary plan approval by the Council, submit a final
development plan for any part or all of the preliminary plan identifying the
location and extent of uses and improvement as authorized in the approved
preliminary plan and complying with any stipulations of the Council.
14.   Effect on Platting. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as
relieving the owner of the obligation to prepare plats in accordance with
Chapter 354, Code of Iowa. However, the preliminary development plan may be
considered a preliminary plat and the final development plan may be considered
a final plat, provided said plans contain the plat information required by
Chapter 354, Code of Iowa.
15.   Site Size. A Planned Unit Development project in a residential district
shall contain an area of not less than two acres, in other areas not less than
three acres.

of its fair market value as determined by the Board of Adjustment, such
building shall only be reconstructed in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.

170.01   SHORT TITLE.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as “The City of Roland, Iowa,

170.03   POLICY.
It is hereby declared to be the policy of the City to consider the subdivision
of land and the subsequent development of the subdivided land as subject to the
control of the City to provide for the orderly, efficient and economical
development of the City. And further:
1.   Character of Land. Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that
it can be used safely for building purposes without danger to health or peril

subdivision regulations shall supplement and facilitate the enforcement of
provisions and standards, ordinances or regulations of the City.
170.04   APPLICATION AND JURISDICTION.
In accordance with the provisions of Chapter 354 of the Code of Iowa, these
regulations are adopted by the City of Roland, Iowa, governing the subdivisions
of all lands within the corporate limits of the City and governing subdivisions
of all lands within two (2) miles of the corporate limits of the City of
Roland. The standards and conditions applied by the City for review and
approval of a subdivision outside the corporate limits shall be the same
standards and conditions used for review and approval of subdivisions within
the City limits. The City Council may, by resolution, waive its right to review
a subdivision outside the corporate limits or waive the requirements of any of
its standards or conditions for approval of subdivisions, and certify the
resolution which shall be recorded with the plat.

1.   Relationship to Other Public Provisions. These regulations are not
intended to interfere with, or abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rules or
regulation, statute, or other provision of law. Where any provision of these
regulations imposes a restriction different from those imposed by any other
provision of these regulations or any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or
other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose
higher standards shall control.
2.   Relationship to Private Provisions. These regulations are not intended to
abrogate any easement, covenant or any other private agreement or restriction,
provided that where the provisions of these regulations are more restrictive or
impose higher standards or regulations than such easement, covenant, or other
private agreement or restriction, the requirements of these regulations shall
govern.
170.06   ACTION UNDER PRIOR PROVISIONS.
These regulations do not abate any action now pending under, or by virtue of,
prior existing subdivision regulations. Nor do they discontinue, abate, modify,
or alter any penalty accrued or about to accrue, or affect the liability of any
person, or waive any right of the City under any section or provision existing
at the time of adoption of these regulations. Nor do they vacate or annul any
rights obtained by any person, by lawful action of the City except as expressed

kind and extent of such improvements to be made.
170.14   ACTION BY THE COMMISSION.
The commission shall, as soon as possible, but not more than thirty (30) days
thereafter, pass upon the preliminary plat as originally submitted or modified.
If the Commission does not act within thirty (30) days, the preliminary plat
shall be deemed to be approved; provided, however, that the subdivider may
agree to an extension of the time period not to exceed an additional sixty (60)
days. It shall then set forth its recommendations in writing, whether of
approval, modification or disapproval.
1.   Reasons for Changes or Disapproval. In the event that substantial changes

Commission for further review and the Clerk shall notify the subdivider of such
action. If approved, the Clerk shall sign five (5) copies of the preliminary
plat with the notation of the date the preliminary plat received the Council’s
tentative approval. One copy shall be returned to the Commission and three (3)
copies shall be returned to the subdivider. The “Tentative Approval” by the
Council shall not constitute final acceptance of the addition or subdivision by
the City but an authorization to proceed with preparation of the final plat.
170.16   EFFECTIVE PERIOD OF TENTATIVE APPROVAL.
The tentative approval of a preliminary plat shall be effective for a period of
one year at the end of which time final approval must have been obtained. Any
plat not receiving final approval within this period of time shall be void, and
the subdivider shall be required to resubmit anew plat for tentative approval
subject to all new zoning restrictions and subdivision regulations.
170.17   COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Before the Council will approve the final plat, all of the foregoing

Council. Before passage of said resolution of acceptance, the City Engineer
shall report that said improvements meet all City specifications and ordinances
or other City requirements and the agreements between the subdivider and the
City.
170.18   PERFORMANCE BOND.
The completion requirement for improvements may be waived in whole or in part
if the subdivider will post a performance bond with the Council guaranteeing
that improvements not completed will be constructed within a period of one (1)
year from final acceptance of the plat; but final acceptance of the plat will
not constitute final acceptance by the City of any improvements to be
constructed, Improvements will be accepted only after their construction has
been completed. Such performance bond shall be satisfactory to the City
Attorney as to form, sufficiency, and manner of execution. Upon recommendation
of the Commission, the Council may extend the completion date set forth in the
bond for a maximum period of one additional year.
170.19   FINAL PLAT.
The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as approved,
and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that portion of the
approved preliminary plat which he proposes to record and develop at the time,
provided, however, that such portion conforms to all requirements of these
regulations.

the area shown on the final plat, but the subdivider or owner shall cause such
plat to be recorded in the office of the County recorder and shall file
satisfactory evidence of such recording in the office of the Clerk before the
City shall recognize the plat as being in full force and effect.
170.25   RESUBDIVISION OF LAND.
The following requirements shall govern the resubdividing of land.
1.   Procedure for Resubdividing. For any change in a map of an approved or
recorded subdivision plat, if such change affects any street layout shown on
such map, or area reserved for public use indicated on the map, or any lot
line, or if it affects any map or plan legally established period to the

approved by the same procedure, rules, and regulations as for a subdivision.
2.   Acreage Lots. Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision
plat shows one or more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are
indications that such lots will eventually be resubdivided into smaller
building sites, the Commission and Council may require that such parcel of land
allow for future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent
streets. Easements providing for the future opening and extension of such
streets may be made a requirement of the plat.
170.26   COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Before the final plat is approved by the Council, all applicants shall be
required to complete, in accordance with the Council’s decision and to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer, all the street, sanitary, and other
improvements as required in these regulations, specified in the preliminary
plat, and as approved by the Council, and to dedicate same to the City, free
and clear of all liens and encumbrances on the property and public improvements
thus dedicated.
170.27   PERFORMANCE BOND.
The Council in its discretion may waive the requirements that the applicant
complete and dedicate all public improvements prior to approving the final
plat, and that, as an alternative, the applicant post a bond at the time of
application for final plat approval in an amount estimated by the Council as
sufficient to secure to the City the satisfactory construction, installation,
and dedication of the incompleted portion of required improvements. In
addition:
1.   Approved by City Attorney. Such performance bond shall comply with all
statutory requirements and shall be satisfactory to the City Attorney as to
form, sufficiency, and manner of execution as set forth in these regulations.
2.   Completion Period. The period within which required improvements must be
completed shall be specified by the Council in the resolution approving the
final plat shall be incorporated in the bond, and shall not exceed one year
from date of final approval.
3.   Extension of Completion Period. The performance bond shall be approved by
the Council as to the amount and surety and conditions satisfactory to the
Council. The Commission may, upon proof of difficulty, recommend to the Council
extension of the completion date set forth in such bond for a maximum period of
one additional year. The Council may at any time during the period of such bond
accept a substitution of principal or sureties on the bond.
4.   Temporary Improvements. The applicant shall build and pay for all costs of
temporary improvements required by the Council and shall maintain same for the
period specified by the Council. Prior to construction of any temporary
facility or improvement, the developer shall file with the City a separate
suitable bond for temporary facilities, which bond shall insure that the
temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained and removed.
5.   Failure to Complete Improvement. For subdivisions for which no performance
bond has been posted, if the improvements are not completed within the period
specified by the Council in the resolution approving the plat, the approval
shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases where a performance bond has
been posted and required improvements have not been installed within the terms
of such performance bond, the City may declare the bond to be in default and
require that all the improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the
building development at the time the bond is declared to be in default.
170.28   INSPECTION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
The Council shall provide for inspection of required improvements during
construction and insure their satisfactory completion. The applicant shall pay
to the City an inspection fee equal to the actual cost of inspection. These
fees shall be due and payable upon demand of the City and no building permits
or certificates of occupancy shall be issued until all fees are paid. The
subdivider shall furnish the Council with a construction schedule prior to the
commencement of any and all construction, and notify the City not less than
twenty-four (24) hours in advance of readiness for required inspections.
170.29   RELEASE OR REDUCTION OF PERFORMANCE BOND.
The performance bond may not be released or reduced except as follows:
1.   Certificate of Satisfactory Completion. The Council will not accept
dedication of required improvements, nor release nor reduce a performance bond,
until the City Engineer has submitted a certificate stating that all required
improvements have been satisfactorily completed and until the applicant’s
engineer has certified to the City through submission of detailed “as built”
plans of the subdivision indicating location, dimensions, materials, and other
information required by the City, that all public improvements are in
accordance with construction plans for the subdivision.
2.   Reduction of Performance Bond. A performance bond may be reduced upon
actual dedication of public improvements and then only to the ratio that the
public improvement dedicated bears to the total public improvements for the
plat.
170.30   MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Improvements shall be maintained and a maintenance bond provided as follows:
1.   Maintenance of Improvements Before Acceptance. The applicant shall be
required to maintain all improvements on the individual subdivided lots and
provide for snow removal on streets and sidewalks, if required, until
acceptance of said improvements by the Council. If there are any certificates
of occupancy on a street not dedicated to the City, the City may on twelve (12)
hours notice plow the street or effect emergency repairs and charge same to
applicant.
2.   Maintenance Bond. The applicant shall be required to file a maintenance
bond with the governing body, prior to dedication, in an amount considered
adequate by the Council and in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney, in
order to assure the satisfactory condition of the required improvements for a
period of two (2) years after the date of their acceptance by the governing
body and dedication of same to the local government.
170.31   DEFERRAL OR WAIVER OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
Required improvements may be deferred or waived as follows:
1.   Waiver of Required Improvements. The Council may defer or waive at the
time of final approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any
or all such improvements as in its judgment are not requisite in the interests
of the public health, safety, and general welfare, or which are inappropriate
because of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities.
2.   Deferral of Required Improvements. Whenever it is deemed necessary by the
Council to defer the construction of any improvement required herein because of
incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate or lack of connecting
facilities, or for other reasons, the applicant shall pay his share of the
costs of the future improvements to the City prior to the approval of the final
plat, or the applicant may post a bond insuring completion of said improvements
upon demand of the City.

No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the extent of street
improvement is adequate for vehicular access by the prospective occupant and by
police and fire equipment.
170.33   IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.
The subdivider shall install and construct all improvements required by these
regulations in accordance with the specifications and under the supervision of
the Council and to its satisfaction.
170.34   DESIGN STANDARDS ARE MINIMUM.
The standards and details of design herein contained are intended only as
minimum requirements so that the general arrangement and layout of a
subdivision may be adjusted to a wide variety of circumstances. However, in the
design and development of the subdivision, the subdivider shall use standards
consistent with the site conditions so as to assure an economical, pleasant and
durable neighborhood.

of these regulations.
170.36   SUBDIVISION NAME.
The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate, or too closely
approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision in the area covered
by these regulations. The Council, after consultation with the Commission,
shall have the final authority to designate the name of the subdivision which
shall be determined at preliminary plat approval.
170.37   MONUMENTATION.
Monuments shall be in conformance with the following requirements:
1.   Establishment of Permanent Control Monuments. Prior to the offering of the
plat of any subdivision for record, the surveyor shall confirm the prior
establishment of permanent control monuments at each controlling corner on the
boundaries of the parcel or tract of land being subdivided. If no permanent
control monuments exist, the surveyor shall establish at least two (2)
permanent control monuments for each block created, or if the area subdivided
into lots is less than a block in size, at least two (2) permanent control
monuments shall be established for the subdivision. Permanent control monuments

required by these regulations shall be established before a specified future
date.
4.   Additional Monuments Required. Additional monuments shall be constructed
and embedded according to the provisions for permanent control monuments
prescribed in subsection 1 of this section, and shall be set all of the

   C.   At every point of curve, tangency, reversed curve, or compounded curve
on every right-of-way line established.
5.   Placement of Monument. When the placement of a monument required by this
chapter at the prescribed location is impractical, it is permissible to
establish a reference monument in close proximity to the prescribed location.
If the reference monument is established prior to the recording of the plat and
its location properly shown on the plat, the reference monument shall have the
same status as other monuments of record. Where any point requiring
monumentation has been previously monumented, the existence of the monument
shall be confirmed by the surveyor. The existing monument shall be considered a
monument of record when properly shown and described on the recorded plat.
170.38   CHARACTER OF THE LAND.
Land which the City finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or development due
to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth
formations or topography, utility easements, or other features which will
reasonably be harmful to the safety, health, and general welfare of the present
or future inhabitants of the subdivision or its surrounding areas or both,
shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are formulated by
the subdivider and approved by the Council, upon recommendation of the
Commission, to solve the problems created by the unsuitable land conditions.
Such land shall be set aside for uses as shall not involve such a danger.

The lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation shall be appropriate for the
location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use
contemplated.
1.   Lot Size. Minimum lot dimensions and sizes shall conform to the
requirements of the zoning regulations where applicable, but in no case shall a
lot contain less than 7,000 square feet of area or be less than 70 feet wide
measured at the building line.
   A.   Residential lots where not served by public sewer shall be of
sufficient size, as determined by the City and subject to any applicable State
or County rules or regulations, to accommodate the type of private sewage
disposal system proposed by the developer.

industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service and
parking facilities required by the type of use and development contemplated.
   C.   Corner lots for residential use shall have an extra 25 feet of width to
permit appropriate building setback from and orientation to both streets.
2.   Street Access. Each lot shall be provided with satisfactory access to a
public street.
3.   Double Frontage and Reverse Frontage Lots. Double frontage and reverse
frontage lots shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of
residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific
disadvantages of topography and orientation. A planting screen easement of at
least ten (10) feet, and across which there shall be no right of access, shall
be provided along the line of lots abutting such a traffic artery or other
disadvantageous use.
4.   Side Lot Lines. Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles to
straight street lines or radial to curved street lines.
5.   Lot Drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage
away from all buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with
the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so
as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent
lots.
6.   Building Lines. Building lines conforming with zoning standards shall be
shown on all lots within the platted area. Where the subdivided area is not
under zoning control, the Council may require building lines in accordance with
the needs of each subdivision.
170.40   BLOCKS.
Blocks shall conform to the following requirements:
1.   Provision for Lots. Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two
(2) tiers of lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions shall be permitted in
blocks adjacent to arterial streets, railroads, or waterways.
2.   Design Considerations. The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be
determined with due regard to:
   A.   Provision for adequate building sites.
   B.   Zoning requirements where applicable.
   C.   Topography.
   D.   Needs for convenient access, circulation, control, and safety of street
traffic.
3.   Block Lengths. The lengths of blocks shall be appropriate to the type of
development contemplated, but block lengths in residential developments shall
not exceed two thousand (2,000) feet, nor be less than five hundred (500) feet.
Wherever practicable, blocks along arterials and collector streets shall not be
less than one thousand (1,000) feet in length.
4.   Easement Reservation. In blocks over eight hundred (800) feet in length,
the Council may require the reservation of an easement to accommodate
utilities, drainage facilities, or pedestrian traffic.
5.   Pedestrian Crosswalks. Pedestrian crosswalks, not less than ten (10) feet
wide, may be required by the Council through the center of blocks more than
eight hundred (800) feet in length. Pedestrian crosswalks shall not exceed
twelve (12) percent in grade unless steps of an approved design are to be
constructed.
170.41   STREETS, GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
Streets shall conform with the following general requirements:
1.   Frontage on Improved Roads. No subdivision shall be approved unless the
area to be subdivided shall have frontage on and access from an existing
street.
2.   Grading and Improvement Plan. Streets shall be graded and improved and
conform to the City construction standards and specifications and shall be
approved as to design and specifications by the City Engineer, in accordance
with the construction plans required to be submitted.
3.   Topography and Arrangement. Streets shall be in conformance with the
following requirements related to topography and arrangement:
   A.   Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography. All streets
shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as possible of the building sites at,
or above, the grades of the streets. Grades of streets shall conform as closely
as possible to the original topography. A combination of steep grades and
curves shall be avoided. Specific standards are contained in the design
standards of these regulations.
   B.   All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed
system of streets and dedicated right-of-way.
   C.   All arterials shall be properly related to special traffic generators
such as industries, business districts, schools, churches, and shopping
centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and proposed
land uses.
   D.   Municipal service streets shall be laid out to conform as much as
possible to the topography to discourage use by through traffic, to permit
efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of
streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property.
   E.   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract
to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions,
or unless in the opinion of the Council such extension is not necessary or
desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the
existing layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts.
   F.   In business and industrial developments, the streets and other
accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings,
location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and
maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of
movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian.
4.   Access to State or County Jurisdictional Roads. Whenever any part of a
subdivision is designed with access to a road under State or County
jurisdiction, permission for access to such roads shall be obtained from the
appropriate jurisdiction and such access shall be designed according to the
standards of the appropriate jurisdiction.
5.   Access to Arterial Streets. Where a subdivision borders on or contains an
existing or proposed arterial street, the Council may require that lot access
to such streets be limited by one of the following means:
   A.   Lots shall be designed so as to back onto the primary arterial and
front onto a parallel municipal service street; no access shall be provided
from the arterial street, and screening shall be provided in a strip of land
along the rear property line of such lots.
   B.   A series of cul-de-sacs entered from and designed generally at right
angles to such a parallel street, with the rear lines of their terminal lots
backing onto the arterial street.
   C.   A frontage or service road, separated from the primary arterial by a
planting or grass strip and having access thereto at suitable points.
6.   Street Names. Streets that are in alignment with others already existing
shall bear the name of the existing streets. The proposed names of new streets
shall not duplicate or sound similar to existing street names. Street names
shall be subject to the approval of the Council and Commission.
7.   Street Name Signs. Street name signs are to be placed at all intersections
within or abutting the subdivision, the type and location of which to be
approved by the Council. The City shall install all street name signs. The
applicant shall deposit with the City at the time of final subdivision
approval, the estimated cost of installation of each street sign required by
the Council.
8.   Street Lights. Installation of street lights shall be required in
accordance with design and specification standards approved by the Council.
9.   Construction of Streets and Dead-end Streets. Streets and dead-end streets
shall be in conformance with the following requirements:
   A.   Construction of Streets. The arrangement of streets shall provide for
the continuation of principal streets between adjacent properties when such
continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire
protection, and for efficient provision of utilities. If the adjacent property
is undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right-
of-way shall be extended to the property line. A temporary T or L shaped
turnabout shall be provided on all temporary dead-end streets, with the
notation on the subdivision plat that land outside the normal street right-of-
way shall revert to abuttors whenever the street is continued. The Council may
limit the length of temporary dead-end streets in accordance with the design
standards of these regulations.
   B.   Permanent Dead-end Streets. Where a road does not extend to the
boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by the Council
for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall normally not be nearer to
such boundary than one hundred fifty (150) feet. However, the Council may
require the reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage
facilities, pedestrian traffic, or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be
provided at the end of a permanent dead-end street in accordance with City
construction standards and specifications. For greater convenience to traffic
and more effective police and fire protection, permanent dead-end streets
shall, in general, be limited in length in accordance with the design standards
of these regulations.
170.42   STREETS, DESIGN STANDARDS.
The following design standards shall apply to the design of streets:
1.   General. In order to provide for streets of suitable location, width, and
improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access
to police, fire fighting, snow removal, sanitation, and street maintenance
equipment, and to coordinate streets so as to compose a convenient system and
avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties the following design standards
for streets are hereby required:
   A.   A tangent at least one hundred (100) feet long shall be introduced
between reverse curves on municipal arterial and municipal collector streets,
and seventy-five (75) feet on municipal service streets.
   B.   When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point
by more than ten (10) degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius
adequate to ensure a sight distance of not less than one hundred (100) feet for
municipal service and municipal collector streets, and of such greater radii as
the Council shall determine for special cases.
   C.   Minimum Roadway and Right-of-Way Standards:
      (1)   Municipal arterial streets shall have a right-of-way width of not
less than 80 feet and a roadway width of not less than 44 feet.
      (2)   Municipal collector streets shall have a right-of-way width of not
less than 60 feet and a roadway width of not less than 36 feet.
      (3)   Municipal service streets shall have a right-of-way of not less
than 50 feet and a roadway width of not less than 26 feet.
      (4)   Frontage streets shall have a right-of-way width of not less than
40 feet and a roadway width of not less than 26 feet.
      (5)   A cul-de-sac shall only be allowed if it is determined to be a
permanent dead-end street by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the
Council. Approved cul-de-sacs shall meet all the requirements for a municipal
service street and, in addition, shall provide a turnaround with a right-of-way
radius of 50 feet and a roadway radius of 40 feet. No cul-de-sac shall exceed
500 feet in length.
   D.   Street grades, wherever feasible shall not exceed the following:
      (1)   Municipal arterial streets - six (6) percent.
      (2)   Municipal collector streets - eight (8) percent.
      (3)   Municipal service streets - ten (10) percent.
      (4)   Frontage streets - six (6) percent.
   E.   All changes in street grade shall be connected by vertical curves of
minimum length in feet equal to twenty (20) times the algebraic difference in
percents of grade.
   F.   No street grade shall be less than one half (½) of one percent.
2.   Street Surfacing and Improvements. After sewer, water and other utilities
to be located underground within the right-of-way have been installed by the
applicant, the applicant shall construct curbs and gutters and shall surface or
cause to be surfaced roadways to the widths prescribed in these regulations.
Said surface shall be of Portland concrete cement, or asphaltic concrete.
Adequate provisions shall be made for culverts, drains, and bridges. All road
pavement, shoulders, drainage improvements and structures, curbs, turnarounds,
and sidewalks shall conform to all construction standards and specifications
adopted by the City, and shall be incorporated into the construction plans
required to be submitted by the developer for plat approval.
3.   Excess Right-of-way. Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards
designated in these regulations shall be required whenever, due to topography,
additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes. Such slopes
shall not be in excess of three (3) to one.
4.   Railroads and Limited Access Highways. Railroad rights-of-way and limited
access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining
lands shall be treated as follows:
   A.   In residential districts a buffer strip at least twenty-five (25) feet
in depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district
shall be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access
highway. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated
on the plat: “This strip is reserved for screening. The placement of structures
hereon is prohibited.”
   B.   In districts zoned for business, commercial, or industrial uses the
nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad
shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure
suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
   C.   Streets parallel to the railroad when intersecting a street which
crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a
distance of at least one hundred fifty (150) feet from the railroad right-of-
way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum
distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate
approach gradients.
5.   Intersections. The following standards shall apply to the design of
intersections:
   A.   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles. A proposed intersection of two (2) new streets at an angle of
less than seventy-five (75) degrees shall not be acceptable. An oblique street
should be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at
right angles for at least one hundred (100) feet therefrom. Not more than two
(2) streets shall intersect at any one point unless specifically approved by
the Council.
   B.   Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall,
wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite
side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one
hundred fifty (150) feet shall not be permitted, except where the intersected
street has separated dual drives without median breaks at either intersection.
Where streets intersect major streets, their alignment shall be continuous.
Intersection of major streets shall be at least eight hundred (800) feet apart.
   C.   Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two (2) municipal service
streets shall be at least twenty (20) feet; and minimum curb radius at an
intersection involving a municipal collector street shall be at least twenty-
five (25) feet. Abrupt changes in alignment within a block shall have the
corners cut off in accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe
vehicular movement.
   D.   Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever practical.
In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a leveling area
shall be provided having not greater than a two (2) percent rate at a distance
of sixty (60) feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the
intersecting street.
   E.   Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing
vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting
visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation, including
trees, in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent
deemed necessary to provide an adequate sight distance.
   F.   The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall be
three (3) percent or less.
6.   Bridges. Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined by the
Council, shall be constructed at the full expense of the applicant without
reimbursement from the City. The sharing expense for the construction of
bridges not of primary benefit to the applicant as determined by the Council,
will be fixed by special agreement between the Council and the applicant. Said
cost shall be charged to the applicant pro rata as the percentage of his land
developed and so served.
7.   Alleys. The following design standards for alleys shall be required of all
subdividers:
   A.   Alleys shall be prohibited in residential districts.
   B.   Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts, except
that the Council may waive this requirement where other definite and assured
provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading and
parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed.
   C.   Alleys shall have a right-of-way of not less than thirty (30) feet and
a roadway width of not less than twenty (20) feet.
   D.   Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided,
but where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit save
vehicular movement.
   E.   Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable,
shall be provided with adequate turn-around facilities at the dead end, as
determined by the Council.
8.   Street Dedications and Reservations. The following provisions shall apply
to street dedications and reservations:
   A.   Street systems in new subdivisions shall be laid out so as to eliminate
or avoid new perimeter half streets. Where an existing half street is adjacent
to a new subdivision, the other half of the street shall be improved and
dedicated by the subdivider. The Council may authorize a new perimeter street
where the subdivider improves and dedicates the entire required street right-
of-way width within his own subdivision boundaries.
   B.   Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow street or when City
plans or zoning setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening
a road that would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the
applicant shall be required to improve and dedicate at his expense such areas
for widening or realignment of such roads. Such frontage roads and streets
shall be improved and dedicated by the applicant at his own expense to the full
width as required by these subdivision regulations. Land reserved for any
street purposes may not be counted in satisfying yard or area requirements of
the zoning regulations whether the land is to be dedicated to the City in fee
simple or an easement is granted to the City.
170.43   STORM SEWERS AND DRAINAGE.
The following requirements shall apply to the provision of storm sewers and
drainage:
1.   General Requirements. The Commission shall not recommend for approval any
plat of a subdivision which does not make adequate provision for storm or flood
water run-off channels or basins. The storm water drainage system shall be
separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers, where
required, shall be designed by methods as approved by the Council, and a copy
of design computations shall be submitted along with plans. Inlets shall be
provided so that surface water is not carried across or around any
intersection, nor for a distance of more than six hundred (600) feet in the
gutter. When calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a
point, no further allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point, and
basins shall be used to intercept flow at that point. Surface water drainage
patterns shall be shown for each and every lot and block.
2.   Nature of Storm Water Facilities. The applicant may be required by the
Council to carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that
may exist either previously to, or as a result of the subdivision. Such
drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible,
or in perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width, and shall be
constructed in accordance with the construction standards and specifications.
   A.   Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the applicant shall install
storm sewer facilities, or if no outlets are within a reasonable distance,
adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of storm waters, subject to
the specifications of the Council. However, in subdivisions containing lots
less than fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet in area and in business and
industrial districts, underground storm sewer systems shall be constructed
throughout the subdivisions and be conducted to an approved out-fall.
   B.   If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided eventually, as
determined by the Council, the subdivider shall make arrangements for future
storm water disposal by a public storm sewer system at the time the plat
receives final approval. Provision for such connection shall be incorporated by
inclusion in the performance bond required for the subdivision plat.
   C.   A culvert or other drainage facility shall in each case be large enough
to accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether
inside or outside the subdivision. The Council shall determine the necessary
size of the facility, based on the provisions of the construction standards and
specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed development
permitted by applicable zoning regulations.
   D.   The Council shall also study the effect of each subdivision on existing
downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision. City
drainage studies together with such other studies as shall be appropriate shall
serve as a guide to needed improvements. Where it is anticipated that the
additional runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will overload
an existing downstream drainage facility, the Council may withhold approval of
the subdivision until provision has been made for the recovery of the cost for
the improvement of said potential condition in such sum as the Council shall
determine. No subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be
provided to an adequate drainage watercourse or facility.
   E.   The Council may, when it deems it necessary for the health, safety, or
welfare of the present and future population of the area and necessary to the
conservation of water, drainage, and sanitary facilities, prohibit the
subdivision of any portion of the property which lies within the flood plain of
any stream or drainage course.
3.   Subsurface Drainage Facilities. The applicant shall provide adequate
subsurface drainage facilities as approved by the City for the disposal of
subsurface drainage originating from building foundation drains, or other
sources of subsurface drainage from each lot in the subdivision.
4.   Dedication of Drainage Easements. The following shall apply to the
dedication of drainage easements.
   A.   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel, or stream, there shall be provided a storm water easement or drainage
right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse, and of
such width and construction or both as will be adequate for the purpose.
Wherever possible, it is desirable that the drainage be maintained by an open
channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume
of flow.
   B.   Drainage easements:
      (1)   Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within street rights-of-way,
perpetual unobstructed easements at least fifteen (15) feet in width for such
drainage facilities shall be provided across property outside the street lines
and with satisfactory access to the road. Easements shall be indicated on the
plat. Drainage easements shall be carried from the street to a natural
watercourse or to other drainage facilities.
      (2)   When a proposed drainage system will carry water across    private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and
indicated on the plat.
      (3)   The applicant shall dedicate, either in fee or by drainage or
conservation easement of land on both sides of existing watercourses, to a
distance to be determined by the Council.
      (4)   Low-lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or
overflowing during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for
dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their natural state as drainage
ways. Such land or lands subject to periodic flooding shall not be computed in
determining the area requirement of any lot.
170.44   WATER FACILITIES.
Water facilities shall be provided as follows:
1.   General Requirements. The following general requirements shall apply to
the provision of water facilities:
   A.   Where a public water main is accessible the subdivider shall install
adequate water facilities, including fire hydrants, subject to City
specifications. All water mains shall be at least six (6) inches in diameter.
   B.   Water main extensions shall be approved by the City.
   C.   To facilitate the above, the location of all fire hydrants and all
water supply improvements shall be shown on the preliminary plat.
2.   Individual Wells and Central Water Systems. The following requirements
shall apply to the provision of individual wells and central water systems.
   A.   In the discretion of the Council, if a public water system is not
available, individual wells may be used or a central water system provided in
such a manner that an adequate supply of potable water will be available to
every lot in the subdivision. Water samples shall be submitted to the
appropriate County or State agency for testing, and individual wells and
central water systems shall be approved by the appropriate County or State
health authorities. Orders of approval shall be submitted to the Council.
   B.   If the Council requires that a connection to a public water main be
eventually provided as a condition to approval of an individual well or central
water system, the applicant shall make arrangements for future water service at
the time the plat receives final approval. Performance or cash bonds may be
required to insure compliance.
3.   Fire Hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be required for all subdivisions except
those coming under Section
170.44(2). Fire hydrants shall be located no more than one thousand (1,000)
feet apart and within five hundred (500) feet of any structure and shall be
approved by the City.
170.45   SEWERAGE FACILITIES.
Sewerage facilities shall be provided as follows:
1.   General Requirements. The applicant shall install sanitary sewer
facilities in a manner prescribed by the City construction standards and
specifications. City standards shall be the standards of a registered engineer
in the State of Iowa as designated by the City. All plans shall be designed in
accordance with the rules, regulations, and standards of the City and the State
Department of Natural Resources or State Department of Public Health. Plans
shall be approved by the above agencies.
2.   Construction of Sanitary Sewerage Systems. Sanitary sewerage systems shall
be constructed as follows:
   A.   Where a public sanitary sewerage system is reasonably accessible the
applicant shall connect with same and provide sewers accessible to each lot in
the subdivision.
   B.   Where public sanitary sewerage systems are not reasonably accessible
but will become available within a reasonable time, not to exceed fifteen (15)
years, the applicant may choose one of the following alternatives:
      (1)   Install a central sewerage system, operated and maintained by the
benefited property owners. Where plans for future public sanitary sewerage
systems exist, the applicant shall install the sewer lines, laterals, and mains
to be in permanent conformance with such plans and ready for connection to such
public sewer mains.
      (2)   Individual disposal systems, provided the applicant shall install
sanitary sewer lines, laterals, and mains from the street curb to a point in
the subdivision boundary where a future connection with the public sewer mains
hall be made. sewer lines shall be lain from the house to the street line, and
a connection shall be available in the home to connect from the individual
disposal system to the sewer system when the public sewers become available.
Such sewer systems shall be capped until ready for use and shall conform to all
plans for installation of the public sewer system, where such exist, and shall
be ready for connection to such public sewer main.
   C.   Where sanitary sewer systems are not reasonably accessible and will not
become available for period in excess of fifteen (15) years, the applicant
shall install individual disposal systems or central sewerage systems.
3.   Individual Disposal System Requirements. If public sewer facilities are
not available and individual disposal systems are proposed, minimum lot areas
shall conform to the requirements of applicable zoning regulations and these
regulations. Percolation tests and test holes shall be made as directed by the
City and the results submitted to the local board of health.
4.   Water Supply Interconnections. There shall be no physical connection
between a public or private potable water supply system and a sewer which will
permit the passage of any sewage or polluted water into the potable supply.
Sewers shall be kept removed from water supply wells or other water supply
sources and structures.
170.46   SIDEWALKS.
The following requirements shall apply to the provision of sidewalks:
1.   Location of Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be included within the dedicated
nonpavement right-of-way of all streets.
2.   Construction of Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be improved as required in
Section
170.42(2) of this chapter.
170.47   UTILITIES.
The following shall apply to the provision of utilities:
1.   Location. The Council may require that all utility facilities, including,
but not limited to gas, electric power, telephone, and CATV cables, be located
underground throughout the subdivision. All utility facilities existing and
proposed throughout the subdivision shall be shown on the preliminary plat.
Underground service connections to the street property line of each platted lot
shall be installed at the subdivider’s expense. At the discretion of the
Council, the requirement for service connections to each lot may be waived in
the case of adjoining lots to be retained in single ownership and intended to
be developed for the same primary use.
2.   Easements. Easements shall be provided as follows:
   A.   Easements centered on rear lot lines shall be provided for utilities.
Such easements shall be at least ten (10) feet wide. Proper coordination shall
be established between the subdivider and the applicable utility companies for
the establishment of utility easements established in adjoining properties.
   B.   Where topographical or other conditions are such as to make impractical
the inclusion of utilities within the rear lot lines, perpetual unobstructed
easements at least ten (10) feet in width shall be provided along side lot
lines with satisfactory access to the street or rear lot lines. Easements shall
be indicated on the plat.
170.48   PRESERVATION OF NATURAL FEATURES.
Existing features which would add value to residential development or to the
City as a whole, such as trees, watercourses and falls, beaches, historic
spots, and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved in the design of
the subdivision. No trees shall be removed from any subdivision or any change
of grade of the land effected until approval of the preliminary plat has been
granted. All trees on the plat required to be retained shall be preserved, and
all trees where required shall be protected against change of grade.
170.49   NONRESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISION.
The following provisions shall apply to nonresidential subdivisions:
1.   General. If a proposed subdivision includes land that is used for
commercial or industrial purposes, the layout of the subdivision with respect
to such land shall make such provision as the Council may require. A
nonresidential subdivision shall be subject to all the requirements of these
regulations, as well as such additional standards required by the Council, and
shall conform to the proposed land use and standards established in City plans
and regulations.
2.   Standards. In addition to the principles and standards in these
regulations, which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the
applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the street,
parcel, and block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the uses
anticipated and takes into account other uses in the vicinity. The following
principles and standards shall be observed:
   A.   Proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and dimensions to
the types of industrial development anticipated.
   B.   Street rights-of-way and pavement shall be adequate to accommodate the
type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated thereupon.
   C.   Special requirements may be imposed by the City with respect to street,
curb, gutter, and sidewalk design and construction.
   D.   Special requirements may be imposed by the City with respect to the
installation of public utilities, including water, sewer, and storm water
drainage.
   E.   Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas from
potential nuisance from a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision,
including the provision of extra depth in parcels backing up on existing or
potential residential development and provisions for a permanently landscaped
buffer strip when necessary.
   F.   Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic,
shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or
potential residential areas.
170.50   SCHOOL AND PARK RESERVATIONS.
If land to be subdivided contains sites that are designated in City plans or
plans of other public bodies to be used for schools or parks, the developer
shall reserve such site for such use. If sites which have been reserved are not
acquired by the City or other public body within two (2) years of the date of
the preliminary plat approval, then such sites may be subdivided by the
developer. The appropriate public body may release the reserved site sooner by
certifying to the Council that it does not intend to acquire such site within
the two-year period.
170.51   IMPROVEMENTS WITHIN UNINCORPORATED JURISDICTION.  
Improvements in the two-mile unincorporated area under the jurisdiction of
these regulations shall be the same as required herein, provided they are not
less than that required by the applicable County subdivision regulations, and
provided further that all construction plans shall be approved by the County,
and completed public roads shall be accepted by the Board of Supervisors for
public maintenance.
170.52   VARIATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.
The following shall apply to the granting of variations or exceptions:
1.   Hardships. Where the Council finds that extraordinary hardships or
particular difficulties regarding the physical development of land may result
from strict compliance with these regulations, it may make variations or
exceptions to the regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the
public interest secured, provided that such variation or exception shall not
have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations; and
further provided the Council shall not grant variations or exceptions to these
regulations unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to
it in each specific case that:
   A.   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in
the neighborhood in which the property is located.
   B.   The conditions upon which the request for a variation is based are
unique to the property for which the variation is sought, and are not
applicable, generally, to other property.
   C.   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical
conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the
owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict
letter of the regulations were carried out.
   D.   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to
make more money out of the property.
2.   Conditions. In granting variations and exceptions the Council may require
such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives
of the standards or requirements of these regulations.
3.   Procedure for a Variance. A petition for any such variance shall be
submitted in writing by the developer at the time when the preliminary plat is
filed. The petition shall state fully the grounds for the application and all
of the facts relied upon by the petitioner.
170.53   CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.
Any provisions of these regulations may be changed and amended from time to
time by the Council, provided, however, that such changes or amendments shall
not become effective until after a public hearing has been held, public notice
of which shall have been given as required by law. Such proposed amendments
shall first be submitted to the Commission for study and recommendation before
the hearing is held. The Commission shall forward its recommendations to the
Council within thirty (30) days after which the Council shall give notice of
and hold a public hearing on the proposed amendment.
170.54   ENFORCEMENT, VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
No plat or subdivision within the City or within two (2) miles thereof shall be
filed or recorded with the County, nor shall any plat or subdivision have any
validity until it complies with the provision of these regulations, has been
approved by the Council as herein set forth, and further:
1.   Issuance of Building Permits. No more than two (2) building permits for
each separate tract existing at the time of the effective date of these
regulations shall be issued unless the tract has been platted in accordance
with these regulations; except that this provision shall not limit the number
of building permits that may be issued for accessory buildings as defined by
applicable land use regulations such as zoning and restricted residence
regulations or additions or improvements to a main or accessory building
already legally located upon said tract.
2.   Sale or Lease Without Plat. Any person who shall dispose of or offer for
sale or lease any lots in the City or addition to the City, until the plat
thereof has been acknowledged and recorded as provided in these regulations,
shall forfeit and pay fifty dollars ($50.00) for each lot and part of lot sold
or disposed of, leased, or offered for sale.
