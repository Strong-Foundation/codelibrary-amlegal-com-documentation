The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote the

to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults responsible for

reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that
responsible adult’s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful

where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to

parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but
not for longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or
magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
      E.   “Public place” includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys, and sidewalks dedicated to public use and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises, whether publicly or privately owned,
that are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited

license, a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance,

      B.   Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody. Grounds for arrest are
that the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the person’s
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any nonsecured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into
custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.

custody, the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the
minor as soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible
for the minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at
such time as the court may direct.
      D.   Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minor’s parent, guardian or other person
legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the
law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative
of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person
who is known to the child.
   6.   Penalties.
      A.   Responsible Adult’s First Violation. In the case of a first
violation by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall, by certified mail,
send to the adult responsible for the minor, written notice of the violation
with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of
the curfew ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with
applicable penalties.
      B.   Responsible Adult’s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as
defined in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows
the minor to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a
municipal infraction.
      C.   Minor’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a
minor, the law enforcement officer shall give the minor a written warning,
which states that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of
the curfew ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with
applicable penalties, or, at the law enforcement officer’s discretion, may
issue the minor a citation for a first violation.
      D.   Minor’s Second Violation. For the minor’s second and subsequent
violations of any of the provisions of this section, the minor is guilty of a

identities and addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders,
notice by one publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area
where the vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of
notice under Subsection 2 of this section. The published notice may contain
multiple listings of abandoned vehicles, but shall be published within the same
time requirements and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed

1   Deep and shallow wells, as defined in IAC 567-40.2(455B): A deep well is a
well located and constructed in such a manner that there is a continuous layer
of low permeability soil or rock at least five feet thick located at least 25
feet below the normal ground surface and above the aquifer from which water is
to be drawn. A shallow well is a well located and constructed in such a manner
that there is not a continuous layer of low permeability soil or rock (or
equivalent retarding mechanism acceptable to the department) at least five feet
thick, the top of which is located at least 25 feet below the normal ground
surface and above the aquifer from which water is to be drawn.
2   The separation distances are dependent upon two factors: the type of piping
that is in the existing sewer or drain, as noted in the table, and that the
piping was properly installed in accordance with the standards.
3   Solid wastes are those derived from the treatment of water or wastewater.
Certain types of solid wastes from water treatment processes may be land-
applied within the separation distance on an individual, case-by-case basis.
4   Solid waste means garbage, refuse, rubbish, and other similar discarded
solid or semisolid materials, including but not limited to such materials
resulting from industrial, commercial, agricultural, and domestic activities.

   1.   The location and description of the property to be connected with the
sewer system.
   2.   The purpose for which the sewer is to be used.
   3.   Plans, specifications, or other information considered pertinent.
The permit shall require the owner to complete construction and connection of
the building sewer to the public sewer within 60 days after the issuance of the
permit, except that when a property owner makes sufficient showing that due to
conditions beyond the owner’s control or peculiar hardship, such time period is
inequitable or unfair, an extension of time within which to comply with the
provisions herein may be granted. Any sewer connection permit may be revoked at
any time for a violation of these chapters.
96.02   PERMIT FEE AND CONNECTION CHARGE.
Before any permit is issued the person who makes the application shall pay
$50.00 to the Clerk to cover the cost of issuing the permit and supervising,
regulating, and inspecting the work. If new construction, there shall be a
connection charge in the amount of $105.00 paid before issuance of a permit to
reimburse the City for costs borne by the City in making sewer service
available to the property served.
96.03   PLUMBER REQUIRED.
All installations of building sewers and connections to the public sewer shall
be made by a State-licensed plumber.
96.04   EXCAVATIONS.
All trench work, excavation, and backfilling required for the installation of a
building sewer shall be performed in accordance with the provisions of the
State Plumbing Code and the provisions of
Chapter 135 of this Code of Ordinances.
96.05   CONNECTION REQUIREMENTS.
Any connection with a public sanitary sewer must be made under the direct
supervision of the Superintendent and in accordance with the following:
   1.   Old Building Sewers. Old building sewers may be used in connection with
new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test conducted by
the owner and observed by the Superintendent, to meet all requirements of this
chapter.
   2.   Separate Building Sewers. A separate and independent building sewer
shall be provided for every occupied building; except where one building stands
at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or
can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court,
yard, or driveway. In such cases the building sewer from the front building may
be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building
sewer.
   3.   Installation. The installation and connection of the building sewer to
the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the State Plumbing Code
and applicable rules and regulations of the City. All such connections shall be
made gastight and watertight. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and
materials must be approved by the Superintendent before installation.
   4.   Water Lines. When possible, building sewers should be laid at least 10
feet horizontally from a water service. The horizontal separation may be less,
provided the water service line is located at one side and at least 12 inches
above the top of the building sewer.
   5.   Size. Building sewers shall be sized for the peak expected sewage flow
from the building with a minimum building sewer size of four inches.
   6.   Alignment and Grade. All building sewers shall be laid to a straight
line to meet the following:
      A.   Recommended grade at one-fourth inch per foot.
      B.   Minimum grade of one-eighth inch per foot.
      C.   Minimum velocity of 2.50 feet per second with the sewer half full.
      D.   Any deviation in alignment or grade shall be made only with the
written approval of the Superintendent and shall be made only with approved
fittings.
   7.   Depth. Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the
building at an elevation below the basement floor. The depth of cover above the
sewer shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost.
   8.   Sewage Lifts. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low
to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such
drain shall be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the
building sewer.
   9.   Pipe Specifications. Building sewer pipe shall be free from flaws,
splits, or breaks. Materials shall be as specified in the State Plumbing Code
except that the building sewer pipe, from the property line to the public
sewer, shall comply with the current edition of one of the following:
      A.   Clay sewer pipe – A.S.T.M. C-700 (extra strength).
      B.   Extra heavy cast iron soil pipe – A.S.T.M. A-74.
      C.   Ductile iron water pipe – A.W.W.A. C-151.
      D.   P.V.C. – SDR26 – A.S.T.M. D-3034.
   10.   Bearing Walls. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within
three feet of any bearing wall that might thereby be weakened.
   11.   Jointing. Fittings, type of joint and jointing material shall be
compatible with the type of pipe used, subject to the approval of the
Superintendent. Solvent-welded joints are not permitted.
   12.   Unstable Soil. No sewer connection shall be laid so that it is exposed
when crossing any watercourse. Where an old watercourse must of necessity be
crossed or where there is any danger of undermining or settlement, cast iron
soil pipe or vitrified clay sewer pipe thoroughly encased in concrete shall be
required for such crossings. Such encasement shall extend at least six inches
on all sides of the pipe. The cast iron pipe or encased clay pipe shall rest on
firm, solid material at either end.
   13.   Preparation of Basement or Crawl Space. No connection for any
residence, business or other structure with any sanitary sewer shall be made
unless the basement floor is poured, or in the case of a building with a slab
or crawl space, unless the ground floor is installed with the area adjacent to
the foundation of such building cleared of debris and backfilled. The backfill
shall be well compacted and graded so that the drainage is away from the
foundation. Prior to the time the basement floor is poured, or the first floor
is installed in buildings without basements, the sewer shall be plugged and the
plug shall be sealed by the Superintendent. Any accumulation of water in any
excavation or basement during construction and prior to connection to the
sanitary sewer shall be removed by means other than draining into the sanitary
sewer.
96.06   INTERCEPTORS REQUIRED.
Grease, oil, sludge, and sand interceptors shall be provided by gas and service
stations, convenience stores, car washes, garages, and other facilities when,
in the opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper
handling of such wastes that contain grease in excessive amounts or any
flammable waste, sand, or other harmful ingredients. Such interceptors shall
not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. When required,
such interceptors shall be installed in accordance with the following:
   1.   Design and Location. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity
as specified in the State Plumbing Code, to be approved by the Superintendent,
and shall be located so as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection.
   2.   Construction Standards. The interceptors shall be constructed of
impervious material capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in
temperature. They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped
with easily removable covers that shall be gastight and watertight.
   3.   Maintenance. All such interceptors shall be maintained by the owner at
the owner’s expense and shall be kept in continuously efficient operations at
all times.
96.07   SEWER TAP.
Connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the “Y”
branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If no properly
located “Y” branch is available, a saddle “Y” shall be installed at the
location specified by the Superintendent. The public sewer shall be tapped with
a tapping machine and a saddle appropriate to the type of public sewer shall be
glued or attached with a gasket and stainless steel clamps to the sewer. At no
time shall a building sewer be constructed so as to enter a manhole unless
special written permission is received from the Superintendent and in
accordance with the Superintendent’s direction if such connection is approved.
96.08   INSPECTION REQUIRED.
All connections with the sanitary sewer system before being covered shall be
inspected and approved, in writing, by the Superintendent. As soon as all pipe
work from the public sewer to inside the building has been completed, and
before any backfilling is done, the Superintendent shall be notified and the
Superintendent shall inspect and test the work as to workmanship and material;
no sewer pipe laid underground shall be covered or trenches filled until after
the sewer has been so inspected and approved. If the Superintendent refuses to
approve the work, the plumber or owner must proceed immediately to correct the
work.
96.09   PROPERTY OWNER’S RESPONSIBILITY.
All costs and expenses incident to the installation, connection, and
maintenance of the building sewer, from the main to the building served, shall
be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the City from any loss or
damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the
building sewer.
96.10   ABATEMENT OF VIOLATIONS.
Construction or maintenance of building sewer lines, whether located upon the
private property of any owner or in the public right-of-way, which construction
or maintenance is in violation of any of the requirements of this chapter,
shall be corrected, at the owner’s expense, within 30 days after date of
official notice from the Council of such violation. If not made within such
time, the Council shall, in addition to the other penalties herein provided,
have the right to finish and correct the work and assess the cost thereof to
the property owner. Such assessment shall be collected with and in the same
manner as general property taxes.

react with water or wastes in the sewer system to release noxious gases,
develop color of undesirable intensity, form suspended solids in objectionable
concentration, or create any other condition deleterious to structures and
treatment processes.
   13.   Untreatable Wastes. Waters or wastes containing substances that are
not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes
employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage
treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having
jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.
97.05   RESTRICTED DISCHARGES; POWERS OF SUPERINTENDENT.
If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the
public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in Section

flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be
maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at
the owner’s expense.
97.07   CONTROL MANHOLES.
When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner’s
expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
97.08   TESTING OF WASTES.
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from
periodic grab samples.)

simple majority role call vote unless 60 percent of the surrounding property
owners who received notice object to the special permit application, in which
case the Council shall be bound by different voting requirements in that
granting a special permit shall then require an affirmative three-fourths vote

Chapter 50, Nuisance Abatement Procedures, of this Code of Ordinances. The City
shall first provide for the abatement of any violation of this chapter through
the notice of abatement and hearing procedures outlined in

the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by
the community.
   29.   “Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is:
      A.   Built on a single chassis; and
      B.   Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection; and
      C.   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty
truck; and
      D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as a
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   30.   “Routine maintenance of existing buildings and facilities” means
repairs necessary to keep a structure in a safe and habitable condition that do
not trigger a building permit, provided they are not associated with a general
improvement of the structure or repair of a damaged structure. Such repairs
include:
      A.   Normal maintenance of structures such as re-roofing, replacing
roofing tiles, and replacing siding;
      B.   Exterior and interior painting, papering, tiling, carpeting,
cabinets, counter tops, and similar finish work;
      C.   Basement sealing;
      D.   Repairing or replacing damaged or broken window panes;

subject to the base flood. This land is identified on the community’s Flood
Insurance Rate Map as Zone A, A1-30, AE, AH, AO, AR, and A99.
   32.   “Start of construction” includes substantial improvement, and means
the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or
other improvement, was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start
means either the first placement or permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of pile, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a factory-built home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of the building, whether or not that alteration affects
the external dimensions of the structure.
   33.   “Structure” means anything constructed or erected on the ground or
attached to the ground, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories,
sheds, cabins, factory-built homes, storage tanks, grain storage facilities, or
other similar uses.
   34.   “Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage
condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred. Volunteer labor and donated materials shall be
included in the estimated cost of repair.
   35.   “Substantial improvement” means any improvement to a structure which
satisfies either of the following criteria:
      A.   Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost
of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure
either:
         (1)   Before the start of construction of the improvement; or
         (2)   If the structure has been substantially damaged and is being
restored, before the damage occurred.
      The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a
structure to correct existing violations of State or local health, sanitary, or
safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living
conditions. The term also does not include any alteration of a historic
structure, provided the alteration will not preclude the structure’s
designation as a historic structure.
      B.   Any addition which increases the original floor area of a structure
by 25 percent or more. All additions constructed after the effective date of
the first floodplain management regulations adopted by the community shall be
added to any proposed addition in determining whether the total increase in
original floor space would exceed 25 percent.
   36.   “Variance” means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of
the floodplain management regulations.
   37.   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations.
160.02   STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSE.
   1.   Statutory Authority. The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in
Chapter 364 of the Code of Iowa, as amended, delegated the power to cities to
exercise any power and perform any function it deems appropriate to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the City or of its residents,
and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort, and
convenience of its residents.
   2.   Findings of Fact.
      A.   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community.
      B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by:
         (1)   The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood
damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately
elevated or otherwise protected from flooding; and
         (2)   The cumulative effect of obstructions on the floodplain causing
increases in flood heights and velocities.
      C.   This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
   3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort, and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Section
160.02(2)(A) with provisions designed to:
      A.   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows
so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
      B.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
      C.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
      D.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
      E.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   1.   Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter shall
apply to all lands and development which have significant flood hazards. The
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Buchanan County and Incorporated Areas,
City of Brandon, Panels 19019C0384E, 0392E, 0403E, 0425E, dated December 30,
2020, which were prepared as part of the Buchanan County Flood Insurance Study,
shall be used to identify such flood hazard areas and all areas shown thereon
to be within the boundaries of the base flood shall be considered as having
significant flood hazards. The Flood Insurance Study for the Buchanan County is
hereby adopted by reference and is made a part of this chapter for the purpose
of administering floodplain management regulations.
   2.   Rules for Interpretation of Flood Hazard Boundaries. The boundaries of
the Special Flood Hazard Areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the
official Flood Insurance Rate Map. When an interpretation is needed as to the
exact location of a boundary, the Administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation. The Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
made by the Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   3.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no
structure shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered
without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
   4.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
   5.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
   6.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated Special Flood Hazard Areas will be
free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on
the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
   7.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.
160.04   ADMINISTRATION.

issue permits for variances except as directed by the Board of Appeals.
      D.   Construction and Use to Be as Provided in Application and Plans.
Floodplain Development Permits based on the basis of approved plans and
applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in
such approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement, or
construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. The applicant shall be
required to submit certification by a professional engineer or land surveyor,
as appropriate, registered in the State, that the finished fill, structure
floor elevations, floodproofing, or other flood protection measures were
accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to the
use or occupancy of any structure.
160.05   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT STANDARDS.
   1.   General Floodplain Standards. All development must be consistent with
the need to minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance
standards. Where base flood elevations have not been provided in the Flood
Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to
determine; (i) whether the land involved is either wholly or partly within the
floodway or floodway fringe; and (ii) the base flood elevation. The applicant
will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with
sufficient technical information to make such determination. Review by the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources is not required for the proposed construction
of new or replacement bridges or culverts where: (i) the bridge or culvert is
located on a stream that drains less than two square miles; and (ii) the bridge
or culvert is not associated with a channel modification that constitutes a
channel change as specified in 567-71.2(2), Iowa Administrative Code.
      A.   All Development. All development within the Special Flood Hazard
Areas shall:
         (1)   Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement.
         (2)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
         (3)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are
resistant to flood damage.
      B.   Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved
residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation. Construction
shall be upon compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one
foot above the base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18
feet beyond the limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of
elevating (such as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed where existing
topography, street grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such
cases, the methods used must be adequate to support the structure as well as
withstand the various forces and hazards associated with flooding. All new
residential structures located in areas that would become isolated due to
flooding of surrounding ground shall be provided with a means of access that
will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this
criterion shall not apply where the Administrator determines there is
sufficient flood warning time for the protection of life and property. When
estimating flood warning time, consideration shall be given to the criteria
listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa Administrative Code.
      C.   Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level. When
floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State
shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to withstand the
flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces, and other
factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the base
flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
      D.   All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
         (1)   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
            a.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
            b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
            c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
      Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access
and low damage potential storage.
         (2)   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
         (3)   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed
with electric meter, electrical service panel box, hot water heater, heating,
air conditioning, ventilation equipment (including ductwork), and other similar
machinery and equipment elevated (or in the case of nonresidential structures,
optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation.
         (4)   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed
with plumbing, gas lines, water meters, gas meters, and other similar service
utilities, either elevated (or, in the case of nonresidential structures,
optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation or designed to be watertight and withstand inundation to such a
level.
      E.   Factory-Built Homes.
         (1)   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes,
including those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions,
shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
structure is a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation.
         (2)   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes,
including those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions,
shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Anchorage
systems may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties
to ground anchors as required by the State Building Code.
      F.   Utility and Sanitary Systems.
         (1)   On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located
or designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
         (2)   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system
as well as the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment
facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood
protection equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood elevation.
         (3)   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. Water supply
treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a
level of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood
elevation.
         (4)   Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
      G.   Storage of Materials and Equipment. Storage of equipment and
materials that are flammable, explosive, or injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base
flood elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated
or:
         (1)   Not subject to major flood damage and be anchored to prevent
movement due to flood waters; or
         (2)   Readily removable from the area within the time available after
flood warning.
      H.   Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as
levees, flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the base
flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for
adequate interior drainage. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources
shall approve structural flood control works.
      I.   Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must
be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations shall be
approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
      J.   Subdivisions. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and
subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the base flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50 lots
(whichever is less) shall include base flood elevation data for those areas
located within the Special Flood Hazard Area.
      K.   Accessory Structures to Residential Uses.
         (1)   Detached garages, sheds, and similar structures that are
incidental to a residential use are exempt from the base flood elevation
requirements where the following criteria are satisfied.
            a.   The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential. Its size shall not exceed 600 square feet in size. Those portions of
the structure located less than one foot above the base flood elevation must be
constructed of flood-resistant materials.
            b.   The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage
potential purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure
shall not be used for human habitation.
            c.   The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building
site so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
            d.   The structure shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement which may result in damage to other structures.
            e.   The structure’s service facilities such as electrical and
heating equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above
the base flood elevation.
            f.   The structure’s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of Section
160.05(1)(D)(1).
         (2)   Exemption from the base flood elevation requirements for such a
structure may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of
the structure and its contents.
      L.   Recreational Vehicles.
         (1)   Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of
Section
160.05(1)(E) regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built homes when the
following criteria are satisfied.
            a.   The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less
than 180 consecutive days; and
            b.   The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
         (2)   Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than
180 consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy the
requirements of Section 160.05(1)(E) regarding anchoring and elevation of
factory-built homes.
      M.   Pipeline Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be
buried in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to
prevent rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
      N.   Maximum Damage Potential Development. All new or substantially
improved maximum damage potential development shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated a minimum of one foot above the elevation of the
500-year flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be
floodproofed to such a level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional
engineer registered in the State shall certify that the floodproofing methods
used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact,
and uplift forces and other factors associated with the two-tenths percent
annual chance flood; and that the structure, below the two-tenths percent
annual chance flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water. A record of the certification indicating
the specific elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to
which any structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
Where two-tenths percent chance flood elevation data has not been provided in
the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be
contacted to compute such data. The applicant will be responsible for providing
the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to
make such determinations.
160.06   VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   1.   The Board of Appeals may authorize upon request in specific cases such
variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances
granted must meet the following applicable standards.
      A.   Variances shall only be granted upon:
         (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause; and
         (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (3)   A determination that the granting of the variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local codes or ordinances.
      B.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
      C.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      D.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for structures than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that:
         (1)   The issuance of a variance will result in increased premium
rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of
insurance coverage; and
         (2)   Such construction increases risks to life and property.
      E.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
   2.   Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board of Appeals Shall Be Based.
In passing upon applications for variances, the Board of Appeals shall consider
all relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
      A.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
      B.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
      C.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
      D.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      E.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the City.
      F.   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
      G.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
      H.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
      I.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for the area.
      J.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      K.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood water expected at the site.
      L.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
      M.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
chapter.
   3.   Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting
of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such
conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
      A.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
      B.   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
      C.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
      D.   Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the

this chapter shall apply to the division of any lot or parcel of land entered
of record in the office of the County Recorder as a single lot or parcel after
the effective date of this chapter.
   1.   Plats within Two Miles of the City. In accordance with the provisions
of Chapter 354 of the Code of Iowa, as amended, a proprietor or other agent,
shall file a copy of all preliminary and final subdivision plats including
minor plats, for the unincorporated area within two miles of the City. The City

extraterritorial area defined herein. The plat(s) shall be filed with the City
prior to or at the same time as filing with the County. Approval by one
political entity does not automatically constitute approval by the others
unless the political entities have so agreed.
   2.   Subdivision Classification. Any proposed subdivision or resubdivision
shall be classified as a minor subdivision or a major subdivision by the
Building Official. To aid in this, the proprietor shall submit in written or
other appropriate documentation the principle features of access, relationship

Official for review prior to recording. The Building Official shall refer one
copy of each to the City Council, City Engineer, and City Attorney. Each of the
aforementioned offices shall examine the plat as to its compliance with Chapter
155 and regulations of the City, County, and State, and submit their findings
to the Building Official as soon as is reasonably possible.
170.05   SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS.
The standards and details of design herein contained are intended only as the
minimum requirements so that the general arrangement and layout of a
subdivision may be adjusted to a wide variety of circumstances. However, in the
design and development of the plat, the proprietor should use standards
consistent with the site conditions so as to assure an economical, pleasant and
desirable neighborhood, and shall conform with design standards as approved by
the Council.
   1.   Land Suitability. No land shall be subdivided for residential purposes
that is found to be unsuitable for subdividing by reason of flooding, ponding,
poor drainage, adverse soil conditions, adverse geological formations,
unsatisfactory topography, or other features likely to be harmful to the
health, safety, or general welfare unless such suitable conditions are
corrected to the satisfaction of the City.
      A.   If a subdivision is found to be unsuitable for any of the reasons
cited in this section, the Council shall state its reasons in writing and
afford the proprietor an opportunity to present data regarding such
unsuitability. Thereafter, the Council may re-affirm, modify, or withdraw its
determination of unsuitability.
      B.   All lots located within a floodplain shall contain adequate area
above the elevation of flooding for essential and planned installations. All
land in a subdivision that lies in a floodplain shall be:
         (1)   Shown on the individual lots in the preliminary plat; and,
         (2)   Encouraged to remain as open space for use by all proprietors of
lots in the subdivision with an appropriate instrument providing for its care
by such proprietors.
      C.   Subdivisions (including mobile home parks) shall be consistent with
the need to minimize flood damages and shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood damage. Development associated with subdivision
proposals shall meet the applicable performance standards.
   2.   Streets.
      A.   Private Streets. Private streets, not dedicated to and accepted by
the City, proposed after the effective date of this chapter are discouraged. If
existing private streets are utilized they shall be built to public standards,
and they shall be platted as such and be under the control of the subdivision,
homeowners association, or proprietor.
      B.   Continuation of Existing Streets. Proposed streets shall provide for
continuation or completion of any existing streets (constructed or recorded) in
adjoining property, at equal or greater width, but not less than a 66-foot
right-of-way width, and in similar alignment, unless variations are approved by
the Council.
      C.   Circulation. The street pattern shall provide ease of circulation
within the subdivision as well as convenient access to adjoining streets,
thoroughfares, or unsubdivided land as may be required by the Council. In a
case where a street will eventually be extended beyond the plan, but is
temporarily dead-ended, an interim turnaround shall be required.
      D.   Street Intersection. Street intersections shall be as near to right
angles, 90 degrees, as possible. There shall be a minimum of 150 feet between
centerlines of intersecting streets.
      E.   Cul-de-sac. If a cul-de-sac is permitted, such street shall be no
longer than 660 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround
having a street property line diameter of at least 100 feet in the case of
residential subdivisions. The right-of-way width of the street leading to the
turnaround shall be a minimum of 66 feet. The property line at the intersection
of the turnaround and the lead-in portion of the street shall be rounded at the
radius of not less than 30 feet. A paved cul-de-sac with concrete curb and
gutter shall have a minimum paved diameter of 71 feet measured from the back of
the curb to back of curb.
      F.   Street Names. All newly platted streets shall be named in a manner
consistent with the present street name system. A proposed street that is
obviously in alignment with other existing streets, or with a street that may
be logically extended through the various portions shall bear the same name.
New street names shall be subject to the approval of the Council.
      G.   Physical and Cultural Features. In general, streets shall be platted
with appropriate regard for topography, creeks, wooded area, and other natural
features which would lend themselves to attractive treatment.
      H.   Half Streets. Dedication of half streets will be prohibited unless
there exists a dedicated or platted half street or alley adjacent to the tract
to be subdivided, the other half shall be platted if required by the Council.
      I.   Alleys. Alleys may be required in business areas and industrial
districts for adequate access to block interiors and for off-street loading and
parking purposes. Except where justified by unusual conditions, alleys will not
be approved in residential districts. Dead end alleys shall be provided with a
means of turning around at the dead-end thereof.
      J.   Easements.
         (1)   Permanent structures, excluding landscaping and fencing, are not
allowed to be constructed on an easement.
         (2)   Easements for utilities, when necessary, shall be provided along
rear or side lot lines or along alleys. The width of such easement shall be not
less than 10 feet in total width. In the event that there exists an easement in
an adjacent subdivision, the 10-foot requirement may be reduced to five feet to
allow for a minimum of 10-foot total easement.
         (3)   Whenever a subdivision is traversed by a water course, channel,
drainage way, stream, sanitary sewer, or stormwater drainage structure, a
stormwater easement or drainage easement may be required. The width of such
easement shall be adequate for the anticipated drainage but not less than 20
feet and shall be shown on the plat.
         (4)   Any lot that has no frontage upon a public or private street
shall be provided with an easement for access to a public or private street.
The width of such easement shall not be less than 20 feet.
         (5)   Easements to the City for street purposes shall not be allowed.
      K.   Neighborhood Plan. If any overall plan has been approved by the City
for the neighborhood in which the proposed subdivision is located, the street
system of the latter shall conform in general thereto.
      L.   Unsubdivided Portion of Plat. Where the plat to be submitted
includes only part of the tract owned by the proprietor, the Council may
require a sketch of the prospective future system of the unsubmitted part. The
street system of the part submitted shall be correlated with the street system
of the part not submitted.
      M.   Major Thoroughfares. Where a new subdivision, except where justified
by limiting conditions, involves frontage on a heavy traffic way, limited
accessway, freeway, or parkway, the street layout shall provide motor access to
such frontage by one of the following means:
         (1)   Be so arranged as to permit, where necessary, future grade
separations at highway crossings.
         (2)   Border the highway with a parallel street at a sufficient
distance from it to permit deep lots to go back onto the highway; or form a
buffer strip for park, commercial, or industrial use.
      N.   Street Right-of-Way Width. The width of minor or residential street
right-of-way shall not be less that 66 feet.
      O.   Street Alignments. Streets and alleys shall be completed to grades
which have been officially determined or approved by the Council. All streets
shall be graded to within two feet of the right-of-way and adjacent sides
slopes graded to blend with the natural ground level. The maximum grade shall
not exceed seven percent for main and secondary thoroughfares, or eight percent
for minor or local service streets. A minimum centerline radius of 150 feet
shall be required of all streets. All street alignments, both horizontally and
vertically, shall meet design criteria as specified in the current American
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Policy on
Geometric Design of Highways and Streets.
   3.   Blocks.
      A.   No block shall be longer than 660 feet.

Auditor’s plat books as on the effective date of this chapter.
170.09   PLACES.
Where it is desired to subdivide a parcel of land, which because of its size or
location does not permit a normal lot or street area, there may be established
a place. Such a place may be in the form of a court, non-connecting street or
other arrangement, provided, however, that proper access shall be given to all
lots from a dedicated place (street or court). If any dead-end place, court or
cul-de-sac is more than 250 feet in length, it shall terminate in an open

This section is intended to be consistent with Chapter 354 of the Code of Iowa,
as amended, and any changes to the code shall automatically be assumed to be
part of this chapter. The Council shall consider all vacations of plats,
streets, and other public lands. The Council may either approve or disapprove,
in writing, each vacation request.
   1.   Vacation of Plats. The proprietors of lots within an official plat who
wish to vacate any portion of the official plat shall file a petition with the
Council for consideration, and they shall set a time and place for a public
hearing on the petition. Written notice of the public hearing shall be provided
by the petitioner to proprietors and mortgagees within 300 feet of the area to
be vacated. If a portion of the official plat adjoins a river or State-owned
lake, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be served written notice
of the proposed vacation. Notice of the proposed vacation shall be given twice,
with 14 days between notices, stating the date, time, and place of the public
hearing. The official plat or portion of the official plat shall be vacated
upon recording of all the following documents:
      A.   An instrument signed, executed, and acknowledged by all the
proprietors and mortgagees within the area of the official plat to be vacated,
declaring the plat to be vacated. The instrument shall state the existing lot
description for each property along with an accurate description to be used to
describe the land after the lots are vacated.
      B.   A resolution by the Council approving the vacation and providing for
the conveyance of those areas included in the vacation which were previously
set aside for dedicated public use.
      C.   A certificate of the County Auditor that the vacated part of the
plat can be adequately described for assessment and taxation purposes without
reference to the vacated lots.
No part of this section authorizes the closing or obstructing of public
highways. The vacation of a portion of an official plat shall not remove or
otherwise affect a recorded restrictive covenant, protective covenant, building
restriction, or use restriction. Recorded restrictions on the use of property
within an official plat shall be modified or revoked by recording a consent to
the modification or removal, signed and acknowledged by the proprietors and
mortgagees within the official plat.
   2.      Vacation of Streets and Other Public Lands. The City may vacate a
part of an official plat that had been conveyed to the City or dedicated to the
public which is deemed by the Council to be of no benefit to the public. The
Council shall vacate, by resolution, following a public hearing or by ordinance
and the vacating instrument shall be recorded. The City may convey the vacated
property by deed or may convey the property to adjoining proprietors through
the vacation instrument. If the vacating instrument is used to convey property,
then the instrument shall include a list of adjoining proprietors to whom the
vacated property is being conveyed along with the corresponding legal
description of each parcel being conveyed. A recorded vacation instrument that
conforms to this section is equivalent to a deed of conveyance and the
instrument shall be filed and indexed as a conveyance by the County Recorder
and County Auditor. A vacation instrument recorded pursuant to this subsection
shall not operate to annul any part of an official plat except as provided for
in Section
170.11(1).

170.13   VARIATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.
   1.   Waivers Granted by the Council.
      A.   General. Where the Council finds that extraordinary hardship or
practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations
and/or the purposes of these regulations may be served to greater extent by an
alternative proposal, it may approve waivers to these subdivision regulations
so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured,
provided that such waiver shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent
and purpose of these regulations; and further provided the Council shall not
approve waivers unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented
to it in each specific case that:
         (1)   The granting of a waiver will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health, or welfare, or injurious to adjacent properties;
         (2)   The conditions upon which the request for a waiver is based are
unique to the property for which the waiver is sought and are not applicable
generally to other property;
         (3)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguishable from a mere
inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations are carried out.
      B.   Conditions. In approving waivers, the Council may require such
conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the
standards or requirements of these regulations.
      C.   Procedures. A petition for any such waiver shall be submitted in
writing by the subdivider at the time when the preliminary plat is filed for
the consideration of the Council. The petition shall state fully the grounds
for the application and all the facts relied upon by the petitioner.
   2   Waivers Granted by the Building Official. The Building Official may
waive the subdivision process if the real estate in question is too small to be
built upon and the resulting parcels are of sufficient size that the waiver
would not create a non-conforming use or building.
170.14   ENFORCEMENT.
   1.   After the date of adoption of this chapter, no plat or any subdivision
in or within two miles of the City limits, shall be recorded in the County
Recorder’s office or have any validity until it has been approved in the manner
prescribed herein.
   2.   No street hereafter created in the incorporated area of the City shall
become a part of any street system as defined in the Code of Iowa and no
improvements shall be made by the City, nor shall the City incur any expense
for maintenance or repair of roads or other facilities on land that had been
subdivided after the date of adoption of this chapter unless such road or other
facility shall have been first approved and accepted by the Council in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the dedication thereof
accepted as a public road or improvement.
   3.   The City shall not issue building, occupancy, or repair permits for any
structure located on a lot in any subdivision developed after the date of
adoption of this chapter that is located within the City unless the plat of
such subdivision has been first approved in accordance with the provisions
contained herein.
   4.   Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with
any of its requirements shall constitute a municipal infraction. Each day such
violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing contained
herein shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful action as is
necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
