identify, analyze, clean up, treat, disperse, remove, or dispose of a hazardous
substance.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[1])
   2.   “Hazardous condition” means any situation involving the actual,
imminent, or probable spillage, leakage, or release of a hazardous substance
onto the land, into a water of the State, or into the atmosphere which creates
an immediate or potential danger to the public health or safety or to the
environment.

(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[7])
36.03   CLEANUP REQUIRED.
Whenever a hazardous condition is created by the deposit, injection, dumping,
spilling, leaking, or placing of a hazardous substance, so that the hazardous
substance or a constituent of the hazardous substance may enter the environment
or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters, including ground
waters, the responsible person shall cause the condition to be remedied by a
cleanup, as defined in the preceding section, as rapidly as feasible to an
acceptable, safe condition. The costs of cleanup shall be borne by the
responsible person. If the responsible person does not cause the cleanup to
begin in a reasonable time in relation to the hazard and circumstances of the
incident, the City may, by an authorized officer, give reasonable notice, based
on the character of the hazardous condition, said notice setting a deadline for
accomplishing the cleanup and stating that the City will proceed to procure
cleanup services and bill the responsible person for all costs associated with
the cleanup if the cleanup is not accomplished within the deadline. In the
event that it is determined that immediate cleanup is necessary as a result of
the present danger to the public health, safety, and welfare, then no notice
shall be required and the City may proceed to procure the cleanup and bill the
responsible person for all costs associated with the cleanup. If the bill for
those services is not paid within 30 days, the City Attorney shall proceed to
obtain payment by all legal means. If the cost of the cleanup is beyond the
capacity of the City to finance it, the authorized officer shall report to the
Council and immediately seek any State or federal funds available for said
cleanup.

CHAPTER 37
FALSE ALARMS
 
37.01 Purpose    37.03 Penalty
37.02 Definition 37.04 Notification
37.01   PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to assess a civil penalty for false alarms
received by the Police Department or Fire Department which require a police
officer to report to the scene or a response from the Fire Department to the
scene. False alarms are an increasing problem, in part due to errors by the
owners or operators of the system or failure on the part of operators of the
system to shut the alarm down before entering the premises. False alarms expose
the public to danger as well as to additional costs in response by the Police
or Fire Department to those alarms.
37.02   DEFINITION.
For purposes of this chapter the following terms are defined:
   1.   “Alarm end user” means the person, firm, corporation, or entity of any
kind of control of any building, structure, or facility who purchases, leases,
contracts for, or otherwise obtains an alarm system.
   2.   “Alarm system” means a method of detecting and signaling the presence,
entry or attempted entry, or holdup into or on a protected premise. The term
does not mean audible alarms from automobiles.
   3.   “False alarm” means any signal, directly or indirectly, from an alarm
system, eliciting an urgent response by police when a situation requiring an
urgent response does not, in fact, exist. The term does not include an alarm
signal caused by violent conditions of nature or other extraordinary
circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the alarm end user. The
burden of proving that such alarm was not a false alarm shall be on the alarm
end user.
37.03   PENALTY.
The owner or lessor of the alarm system shall forfeit a civil penalty of $50.00
for each false alarm to the police in excess of four such alarms received in a
12-month period of time or a civil penalty in the amount of $350.00 for each
false fire alarm in excess of two such alarms received in a 12-month period of
time; provided, however, no such fee or civil penalty shall be assessed in the
event it can be shown that the false alarm or false fire alarm was caused by a
surge in electricity caused by a power company or that the same was caused by
lightening or other natural causes which activated the alarm. Additionally, if
there is a documented service call by the alarm company immediately after a
false alarm in an attempt to fix or determine the cause of the false alarm, a
penalty will not be assessed.
37.04   NOTIFICATION.
Upon receipt of a third false alarm within a 12-month period, the Police
Department or the Fire Department, or the designee of either department, shall
notify the owner of the alarm as shown by the records of the department that
the owner shall have 30 days within which to forfeit the required amount. Such
amount shall be paid to the Clerk and a receipt shall be given. In the event
that the owner or lessor of the alarm system shall fail to pay the civil
penalty within 30 days, the City shall file a claim with the State District
Court, Magistrate Division, alleging the circumstances and this chapter as the
basis for the civil penalty.

46.02 Cigarettes and Tobacco
46.01   CURFEW.
This section shall be known as the DeWitt, Iowa, Juvenile Curfew.
   1.   Purpose. The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is
necessary to promote the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of
the City and specifically to achieve the following purposes:

   2.   Definitions. For use in this section, the following terms are defined:
      A.   “Knowingly” means knowledge which a responsible adult should
reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that
responsible adult’s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful
or careless adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult

conduct or whereabouts of the minor.

secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically
accompanied a police officer or a person employed by the facility where the
person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to providing
nonsecured custody only or while waiting transfer to an appropriate juvenile
facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the person’s parents, or
other responsible adult, or for other administrative purposes; but not for
longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or
magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
      D.   “Public places” means shopping areas, parking lots, parks,
playgrounds, streets, alleys, sidewalks dedicated to public use; and also
includes such parts of buildings and other premises whether publicly or
privately owned which are used by the general public or to which the general
public is invited commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the
general public is permitted without specific invitation; or to which the
general public has access.
      E.   “Responsible adult” means a parent, guardian, or other adult
specifically authorized to by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have
custody or control of a minor.
      F.   “Unemancipated” means unmarried and still under the custody or
control of a responsible adult.

under the age of 18 years shall be in any public place during the following
times:
      A.   Sunday - Thursday: 11:00 p.m. through 5:00 a.m.

meeting of an association for the advancement of economic, political,
religious, or cultural matters; or for any other activity protected by the
First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution within one hour after the end of the
assembly, association meeting, or other activity protected by the First
Amendment.
         (6)   The minor is on an emergency errand for a responsible adult.
         (7)   The minor’s business, trade, or occupation, in which the minor
is permitted by law to be engaged, requires the presence of the minor in the
public place.
   5.   Responsibility of Adults. It is unlawful for any responsible adult
knowingly to permit or to allow a minor to be in any public place in the City
within the time periods prohibited by this section, unless the minor’s presence
falls within one of the above subsections.
   6.   Enforcement Procedures.
      A.   Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in
the absence of convincing evidence such as birth certificate or a driver’s
license, a police officer on the street shall, in the first instance, use his
or her best judgment in determining age.
      B.   Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody. Grounds for arrest are
that the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating this curfew section; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify the person’s self; or constitutes an immediate threat to the person’s
own safety or the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who arrests a
minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in a shelter
care facility or in any non-secured setting. The officer shall not place bodily
restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor physically resists
or threatens physical violence when being taken into custody. A minor shall not
be placed in detention following a curfew violation.
      C.   Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into
custody, the law enforcement officer shall notify the parent or adult
responsible for the minor as soon as possible. The minor shall then be released
to the parent or adult responsible for the minor, unless instructed to release
the minor to another person by the parent or adult responsible, upon the
promise of such person to produce the child in court at such time as the court
may direct. If a minor is issued a citation to appear for a violation of this
section, a law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the
minor as soon as possible, within 24 hours of the violation.
   7.   Penalties.
      A.   Responsible Adult’s First Violation. In the case of a first
violation by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall, by certified mail,
send to the adult responsible for the minor, written notice of the violation
with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of
the curfew ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with
applicable penalties.
      B.   Responsible Adult’s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as
defined in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows
the minor to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a
simple misdemeanor.
      C.   Minor’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a
minor, the law enforcement officer shall give the minor a written warning,
which states that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of
the curfew ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with
applicable penalties, or, at the law enforcement officer’s discretion, may
issue the minor a citation for a first violation.
      D.   Minor’s Second Violation. For the minor’s second and subsequent
violations of any of the provisions of this section, the minor is guilty of a
simple misdemeanor.

engaging in or watching outdoor activities is detrimental to their health and
can be dangerous to those using such facilities; and
      B.   Adults visiting areas frequented by youth, like parks, are role
models for youth and can have a positive effect on the lifestyle choices they
make;
      C.   This is an opportunity to create and sustain an environment that
supports a non-tobacco and non­nicotine norm through a tobacco-free and
nicotine-free policy, rule enforcement, and adult-peer role modeling during
recreation;
      D.   The tobacco industry advertises at and sponsors events to foster a
connection between tobacco use and community events;
      E.   Tobacco products (extends to all types of tobacco and nicotine
products), once consumed in public spaces, are often discarded on the ground
requiring additional maintenance expenses, diminish the beauty of outdoor
facilities, and pose a risk to toddlers, pets, and wildlife due to ingestion.
   2.   Policy. Use of tobacco products, nicotine products, and electronic
vaporizers is prohibited in the following City parks and outdoor recreational
facilities at all times: the DeWitt Community Center (including front entrance
area), the DeWitt Fitness Center (including parking lot), DeWitt Aquatic Center
(including parking lot), the DeWitt Skate Park, Pool Park, all baseball
softball fields (at Little Trees Park, Westbrook Park and Pool Park), all
soccer fields (at Westbrook Park, Pool Park, and Little Trees Park), all
playgrounds (at Westbrook Park, Paarmann Park, Little Trees Park, and at
Lincoln Park), all bleachers (at Pool Park, Westbrook Park and Little Trees
Park), and the Dog Park. Additionally, the use of tobacco products, nicotine
products, and electronic vaporizers is prohibited at all City parks and outdoor
recreational facilities when there is a public event occurring such as, but not
limited to, athletic events and games, public concerts, public speakers, other
public presentations, Autumnfest, National Night Out, the Skeffington Memorial
Race, the John Bloom Art Festival, Tunes in Town, and other similar events. For
the purpose of this section tobacco includes any smoking, chewing, dipping,
lighting, or any other use of any tobacco product. Nicotine products include,
but are not limited, to look-a-likes where the original would include tobacco
or nicotine, products such as dissolvable, spitless, snus, chewing, electronic
cigarettes, and any other product containing nicotine. Electronic vaporizers
are defined as any device, including, but not limited to, e-cigarettes, e-pens,
e-hookah, e-cigars, and vape pens used to vaporize plant material, liquids,

Notes
  † EDITOR’S NOTE: A suggested form of notice for the abatement of nuisances is
  included in the Appendix of this Code of Ordinances. Caution is urged in the use
  of this administrative abatement procedure, particularly where cost of abatement
1 is more than minimal or where there is doubt as to whether or not a nuisance does
  in fact exist. If compliance is not secured following notice and hearings, we
  recommend you review the situation with your attorney before proceeding with
  abatement and assessment of costs. Your attorney may recommend proceedings in
  court under Chapter 657 of the Code of Iowa rather than this procedure.

custody any abandoned vehicle on private property. The police authority may
employ its own personnel, equipment, and facilities or hire a private entity,

expiration of the 10-day reclaiming period.
   7.   If it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the
identities and addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders,
notice by one publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area
where the vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of
notice under Subsection 2 of this section. The published notice may contain
multiple listings of abandoned vehicles, but shall be published within the same
time requirements and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed
notice in Subsection 2 of this section.

shall be established by such facility. Vehicles that are impounded and held for
evidentiary purposes or held pursuant to the execution of a search warrant will
not be charged impound or storage fees during the time they are being held in
police custody. However, the owner shall be responsible for towing and storage

motor vehicle should be sold for use upon the highways, and shall dispose of
the motor vehicle in accordance with State law.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[4])
80.07   DISPOSAL OF TOTALLY INOPERABLE VEHICLES.
The City or any person upon whose property or in whose possession is found any
abandoned motor vehicle, or any person being the owner of a motor vehicle whose
title certificate is faulty, lost, or destroyed, may dispose of such motor
vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without notification
procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more wheels or
other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable. The police

93.04 Eligibility for Connection
93.05 Application; Fee
 
93.01   DEFINITIONS.
The definitions of
Chapters 90 and
95 apply to this chapter.
93.02   FEE; PURPOSE AND INTENT.
The City has determined the necessity of establishing a policy and a procedure
to be utilized to recover the cost of designing and constructing sanitary sewer
facilities and water main facilities in those instances in which a significant
number of the properties to be benefited by such facilities are not
sufficiently developed to permit the recovery of those costs through the
special assessment process as provided in Chapter 384, Division IV, Title IX of
the Code of Iowa, or the size of the project does not justify the expense
associated with proceeding through the special assessment process. The City
hereby declares its intent to utilize connection fees as provided for in
Chapter 384.38 of the Code of Iowa as an option, as herein provided, to recover
the costs of designing and constructing such sanitary sewer facilities and
water main facilities from property owners who connect to such facilities. It
is the intent of this chapter to set forth the method of recovery of
proportional cost shares from those property owners who connect their
properties to sanitary sewer facilities and water main facilities, so that in
the event that all property, other than street and road right-of-way, which
lies within the benefited district is connected to the major sanitary sewer
facilities and major water main facilities during their expected useful life,
then those properties shall bear, in the aggregate, up to 100 percent of the
cost of designing and constructing such facilities, including legal,
administrative, and interest expenses associated therewith.
93.03   PUBLIC HEARING; NOTICE.  
   1.   In the event the Council determines the necessity of constructing a
sanitary sewer facility or water main facility, and determines that the
utilization of a connection fee is the most efficient and equitable method in
which to recover the City’s costs associated therewith, the Council shall cause
a “Notice of Public Hearing on the Proposed Adoption of an Ordinance to
Establish a Benefited District and a Connection Fee” to be published in a
newspaper of general circulation within the City as hereinafter provided. In
addition to indicating the date, time, and place of the public hearing, the
notice shall:
      A.   Indicate the nature and extent of the sanitary sewer facility or
facilities, or water main facility or facilities under consideration for
construction, as well as the estimated cost or costs for the design and
construction of same;
      B.   Identify by general description the proposed benefited district to
be served by the sanitary sewer facility or facilities, or water main facility
or facilities; and
      C.   Set forth the proposed schedule of connection fees to be paid by
property owners within the benefited district who connect to said facilities,
expressed in dollars per acre of land area served or such other method as the
City shall determine to be equitable for the benefited district.
   2.   The notice shall also state that the proposed connection fee ordinance
is on file, along with a plat of the area to be served, and both are available
for public inspection in the office of the Clerk. The notice shall be published
not more than 45 days and not less than 20 days prior to the scheduled date of
the public hearing as shown by the records of the County Auditor.
      A.   At the public hearing, owners of property within the proposed
benefited district shall be heard and may offer comments or objections as to:
      B.   The necessity for the project;
      C.   The calculation of the area benefited by the proposed major sanitary
sewer facilities or major water main facilities;
      D.   The estimated cost of the proposed facilities; and
      E.   The proposed connection fee.
   3.   Upon concluding the hearing the Council shall rule upon the objections
presented during the hearing and may consider the adoption of the proposed
connection fee ordinance. Upon consideration of the proposed connection fee
ordinance, the Council may:
      A.   Adopt the ordinance as proposed;
      B.   Delete elements or portions of the proposed major sanitary sewer
facilities and major water main facilities from the proposed project and the
properties served thereby from the benefited district proposed, or
      C.   Amend the ordinance to revise the connection fee.
93.04   ELIGIBILITY FOR CONNECTION.
    1.   The connection fee ordinance may provide, at the Council’s discretion,
a determination of the amount each household will pay within the benefited
district at the time of initial connection to the sewer or water service and
may defer portions of the connection fee until development has occurred.
   2.   The connection fee ordinance may also provide, at the Council’s
discretion, that sanitary sewer service or water service can be provided to
recreational and park facilities, and to commercial and industrial parcels and
facilities, in the same manner and under the same procedures set forth in this
chapter for single-family residences within the benefited district.
93.05   APPLICATION; FEE.  
   1.   After adoption, publication, and recording by the Clerk, in each county
where property in the benefited district is located, of a connection fee
ordinance for a benefited district, all owners of those properties within the
benefited district whose properties are eligible for connection, and who
propose to connect such properties directly or indirectly to the major sanitary
sewer facility or water main facility, shall make application to the City for
such connection. The submittal of construction plans to the City for sanitary
sewer improvements and/or water main improvements on property being subdivided
for development shall constitute an application to the City for purposes of
this section. The sewer connection fee or water connection fee shall be due and
payable at the time application is made to the City for connection to the
sanitary sewer facility or water main facility. No connection shall be made to
a sanitary sewer facility or water main facility until such application has
been approved and until the required connection fee has been paid. The sewer
connection fee and/or water connection fee required by this section shall be
paid, or suitable other arrangements have been made, before the City will
approve the final plat of property subject to the connection fee.
   2.   The sewer connection fee or water connection fee shall be in an amount
equal to the maximum acre area of contiguous property, or fraction thereof,
within the benefited district under common ownership which can be lawfully
served through such proposed connection, multiplied by the per acre connection
fee or such other fee basis as determined for the benefited district
established in the connection fee ordinance for that benefited district. The
connection fee ordinance may provide for a graduated connection fee, with
annual interest adjustments, such that property owners who connect in later
years pay interest on the connection fee for their property. The rate of
interest applicable to the connection fee established in each benefited
district shall not exceed the rate of interest applicable to special
assessments pursuant to Chapter 74A and Section 384.60(3), Title IX, of the
Code of Iowa in effect on the date that the connection fee was established for
that district by enactment of a connection fee ordinance.
   3.   The sewer connection fee or water connection fee required by this
section are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other fees for connection
required under the Plumbing Code or other provisions of this Code of
Ordinances.
   4.   The sewer connection fee or water connection fee required by this
section shall be due and payable to the City.
93.06   DISCONNECTION.
In the event any property owner connects their property within a benefited
district to a sanitary sewer facility or water main facility without having
made application therefor, or without having received approval therefor or
without having paid the required connection fee established by a connection fee
ordinance, the City shall be entitled to disconnect such private sewer
connection or private water connection until such time as the property owner
has made and received approval of the application, or has paid the required
connection fee and satisfied all of the requirements of Sections
93.04 and
93.05.
93.07   WEST LAKE STREET WATER CONNECTION FEE.

1   Deep and shallow wells, as defined in IAC 567-40.2(455B):  A deep well is a
well located and constructed in such a manner that there is a continuous layer
of low permeability soil or rock at least five feet thick located at least 25
feet below the normal ground surface and above the aquifer from which water is
to be drawn.  A shallow well is a well located and constructed in such a manner
that there is not a continuous layer of low permeability soil or rock (or
equivalent retarding mechanism acceptable to the department) at least five feet
thick, the top of which is located at least 25 feet below the normal ground
surface and above the aquifer from which water is to be drawn.
2   The separation distances are dependent upon two factors:  the type of
piping that is in the existing sewer or drain, as noted in the table, and that
the piping was properly installed in accordance with the standards.
3   Solid wastes are those derived from the treatment of water or wastewater. 
Certain types of solid wastes from water treatment processes may be land-
applied within the separation distance on an individual, case-by-case basis.
4   Solid waste means garbage, refuse, rubbish, and other similar discarded
solid or semisolid materials, including but not limited to such materials
resulting from industrial, commercial, agricultural, and domestic activities.

conditions beyond the owner’s control or peculiar hardship, such time period is
inequitable or unfair, an extension of time within which to comply with the
provisions herein may be granted. Any sewer connection permit may be revoked at
any time for a violation of these chapters.
96.02   PERMIT FEE AND CONNECTION CHARGE.
   1.   The person who makes the application shall pay a fee as established by
resolution to the Clerk to cover the cost of issuing the permit and
supervising, regulating, and inspecting the work. In addition, there shall be a
connection charge in the amount as established by resolution paid to reimburse
the City for costs borne by the City in making sewer service available to the
property served.
   2.   Silver Creek Interceptor. For lots created as a result of a subdivision
pursuant to the subdivision laws of the City, after July 1, 1993, and abutting
the Silver Creek Interceptor or its extensions, the connecting charge shall be
an amount equal to 50 percent of the costs, at the rate not to exceed $30.00
per lineal foot, or installing an eight inch sanitary sewer line through the
building lot on the same route as the Silver Creek Interceptor. Such frontage
and cost shall be determined by the Director of Public Works and frontage
extended to the center of an intersection for corner lots.
96.03   PLUMBER REQUIRED.
All installations of building sewers and connections to the public sewer shall
be made by a State-licensed plumber.
96.04   EXCAVATIONS.
All trench work, excavation, and backfilling required for the installation of a
building sewer shall be performed in accordance with the provisions of the
State Plumbing Code and the provisions of Chapter 135 of this Code of
Ordinances.
96.05   CONNECTION REQUIREMENTS.
Any connection with a public sanitary sewer or repair or partial or total
replacement of a private sewer lateral that connects to a public sewer must be
made under the direct supervision of the Director of Public Works or Building
Official and in accordance with the following:
   1.   Old Building Sewers. Old building sewers may be used in connection with
new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test conducted by
the owner and observed by the Building Official, to meet all requirements of
this chapter.
   2.   Separate Building Sewers. A separate and independent building sewer
shall be provided for every occupied building; except where one building stands
at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or
can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court,
yard, or driveway. In such cases the building sewer from the front building may
be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building
sewer.
   3.   Installation. All sewer drain pipes connecting with a sewer shall be
watertight and shall have a check valve to prevent backup. The check valve
shall have a clean-out mechanism. That portion of the connection located in the
street, and under the curb line and driveways shall be ductile iron. Schedule
40 PVC may be used in lieu of ductile iron in houses and buildings, including
under concrete flooring in a house or building, and under yards. All sewer
drain pipe connections shall be made with a watertight rubber boot with
stainless steel straps.
   4.   Water Lines. When possible, building sewers should be laid at least 10
feet horizontally from a water service. The horizontal separation may be less,
provided the water service line is located at one side and at least 12 inches
above the top of the building sewer.
   5.   Size. Building sewers shall be sized for the peak expected sewage flow
from the building with a minimum building sewer size of four inches.
   6.   Alignment and Grade. All building sewers shall be laid to a straight
line to meet the following:
      A.   Recommended grade at one-fourth inch per foot.
      B.   Minimum grade of one-eighth inch per foot.
      C.   Minimum velocity of two and one half feet per second with the sewer
half full.
      D.   Deviations: any deviation in alignment or grade shall be made only
with the written approval of the Building Official and shall be made only with
properly curved pipe and fittings.
   7.   Depth. Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the
building at an elevation below the basement floor. The depth of cover above the
sewer shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost.
   8.   Sewage Lifts. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low
to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such
drain shall be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the
building sewer.
   9.   Pipe Specifications. Building sewer pipe shall be free from flaws,
splits, or breaks. Materials shall be as specified in the State Plumbing Code
except that the building sewer pipe, from the property line to the public
sewer, shall comply with the current edition of one of the following:
      A.   Extra heavy cast iron soil pipe – A.S.T.M. A-74.
      B.   Cast and ductile iron water pipe - A.S.T.M. A-377. Ductile pipe is
required under streets for sewer.
      C.   P.V.C. – DWV - A.S.T.M. D-2665.
   10.   Bearing Walls. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within
three feet of any bearing wall that might thereby be weakened.
   11.   Jointing. Fittings, type of joint, and jointing material shall be
commensurate with the type of pipe used, subject to the approval of the
Building Official.
   12.   Unstable Soil. No sewer connection shall be laid so that it is exposed
when crossing any watercourse. Where an old watercourse must of necessity be
crossed or where there is any danger of undermining or settlement, cast iron
soil pipe or vitrified clay sewer pipe thoroughly encased in concrete shall be
required for such crossings. Such encasement shall extend at least six inches
on all sides of the pipe. The cast iron pipe or encased clay pipe shall rest on
firm, solid material at either end.
   13.   Preparation of Basement or Crawl Space. No connection for any
residence, business or other structure with any sanitary sewer shall be made
unless the basement floor is poured, or in the case of a building with a slab
or crawl space, unless the ground floor is installed with the area adjacent to
the foundation of such building cleared of debris and backfilled. The backfill
shall be well compacted and graded so that the drainage is away from the
foundation. Prior to the time the basement floor is poured, or the first floor
is installed in buildings without basements, the sewer shall be plugged and the
plug shall be sealed by the Building Official. Any accumulation of water in any
excavation or basement during construction and prior to connection to the
sanitary sewer shall be removed by means other than draining into the sanitary
sewer.
96.06   INTERCEPTORS REQUIRED.
Grease, oil, sludge, and sand interceptors shall be provided by gas and service
stations, convenience stores, car washes, garages, and other facilities when,
in the opinion of the Building Official, they are necessary for the proper
handling of such wastes that contain grease in excessive amounts or any
flammable waste, sand, or other harmful ingredients. Such interceptors shall
not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. When required,
such interceptors shall be installed in accordance with the following:
   1.   Design and Location. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity
as specified in the State Plumbing Code, to be approved by the Building
Official, and shall be located so as to be readily and easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection.
   2.   Construction Standards. The interceptors shall be constructed of
impervious material capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in
temperature. They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped
with easily removable covers that shall be gastight and watertight.
   3.   Maintenance. All such interceptors shall be maintained by the owner at
the owner’s expense and shall be kept in continuously efficient operations at
all times.
96.07   SEWER TAP.
Connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the “Y”
branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If no properly
located “Y” branch is available, a saddle “Y” shall be installed at the
location specified by the Building Official. The public sewer shall be tapped
with a tapping machine and a saddle appropriate to the type of public sewer
shall be glued or attached with a gasket and stainless steel clamps to the
sewer. At no time shall a building sewer be constructed so as to enter a
manhole unless special written permission is received from the Building
Official and in accordance with the Director of Public Work’s direction if such
connection is approved.
96.08   INSPECTION REQUIRED.
All connections with the sanitary sewer system, including repair or replacement
of private sewer laterals that connect to the public sewer system, before being
covered shall be inspected and approved, in writing, by the Director of Public
Works or Building Official. As soon as all pipe work from the public sewer to
inside the building has been completed, and before any backfilling is done, the
Director of Public Works or Building Official shall be notified and the
Director of Public Works or Building Official shall inspect and test the work
as to workmanship and material; no sewer pipe laid underground shall be covered
or trenches filled until after the sewer has been so inspected and approved. If
the Director of Public Works or Building Official refuses to approve the work,
the plumber or owner must proceed immediately to correct the work.
96.09   PROPERTY OWNER’S RESPONSIBILITY.
All costs and expenses incident to the installation, connection, and
maintenance of the building sewer, from the main to the building served, shall
be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the City from any loss or
damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the
building sewer.
96.10   ABATEMENT OF VIOLATIONS.
Construction or maintenance of building sewer lines, whether located upon the
private property of any owner or in the public right-of-way, which construction
or maintenance is in violation of any of the requirements of this chapter,
shall be corrected, at the owner’s expense, within 30 days after date of
official notice from the Council of such violation. If not made within such
time, the Council shall, in addition to the other penalties herein provided,
have the right to finish and correct the work and assess the cost thereof to
the property owner. Such assessment shall be collected with and in the same
manner as general property taxes.

96.11   TAP ON FEE FOR THE SILVER CREEK SANITARY SEWER PROJECT.
   1.   General Project Description. The Silver Creek Sanitary Sewer is a trunk
sanitary sewer serving the west area for the City within the Silver Creek
Economic Development District which included the construction of one lift
station, 57 manholes and 19,415 lineal feet of sewer pipe ranging in size from
eight inches in diameter to 24 inches in diameter. The Council has determined
that installation of the project would facilitate development of the area
generally located within the westerly portion of the City, because that area
was not expected to develop due to the lack of sanitary sewer within the area.
   2.   Actions Taken by the Council in Approving the Project. The Council, by
motion on February 15, 1993, authorized Beling Consultants to design the sewer.
On July 5th, 1993, the Council held a public hearing on the plans,
specifications, form of contracting, and costs estimates. Following the public
hearing, the Council passed resolution No. 93-43 approving the plans and
specifications of the project authorizing advertisement for bids. The City
awarded the Silver Creek Interceptor Sewer Project to Langman Construction,
Inc. on August 9, 1993, by resolution No. 93-44. The Council authorized the
issuance of General Obligation Bonds as financing to pay the construction costs
of the project.
   3.   Total Project Costs. The total actual cost of the project as certified
by the City Finance Clerk is $2,441,784.96 plus interest of $977,082.50 for a
grand total of $3,418,867.46.
   4.   Total Area Benefited. At present the Silver Creek Sanitary Sewer
Project benefits a total of approximately 2,198 acres, and there is a total of
19,415 lineal footage of sewer.
   5.   Formula for Calculation of Tap On Fee. The cost of an eight-inch sewer
line in the Silver Creek Interceptor Sewer Project is determined to be $30.00
per lineal foot. The benefit allocated to property owners is commensurate with
the cost of an eight-inch sewer line in that a line of such dimension is
considered to be a normal service line and would be the cost that a developer
would occur in the installation of a sewer line such that the involved real
estate may be developed. The tap on fees should therefore be based upon a
$30.00 per lineal foot charge to be paid by the property owner in those
instances where the sewer line is situated in the interior of the property
owner’s tract and $15.00 per lineal foot when the tract of the respective
property owner fronts the sewer line. These fees should be paid by property
owners at the time the sewer line is tapped, or a building permit is granted,
if it includes plans to tap on to the Silver Creek Interceptor sewer. No fee
would be paid other than the normal connection fee for residential or small
commercial users who do not abut the sewer as they will incur expense in the
construction of lines to service their properties and to connect to the sewer.
The tap on fee is in addition to the ordinary connection fee.
   6.   Real Estate Serviced and the Tap On Fee to be Charged Upon Hookup. The
following table lists the connection fee for the described properties. The
calculation is based upon the City Engineer’s determination of the lineal
footage of interior and frontage sewer in each of the indicated tracts. The
legal description of the respective parcels are separately attached and
incorporated herein by reference. The properties are referred to in the
attachments by titleholder and property reference number. The Clerk shall not
be required to publish the legal descriptions of the properties as set out in
the attachments, as each of the affected property owners have been notified by
mail prior to the adoption of the ordinance. All attachments to the ordinance
including the legal descriptions of the properties shall be recorded in the
office of the County Recorder and maintained on file and available for
inspection in the Clerk’s office.

   7.   Payment of Tap On Charge. The total tap on charge or applicable
percentage thereof as determined in accordance with Section 96.11(7)(A)(B) is
due and payable prior to the grant of a building permit, the plans for which
contemplate tapping on to the Silver Creek sewer or a connection to the Silver
Creek sewer. In no case will a building permit be granted which contemplates
connection to the Silver Creek sewer or sewer connection to the Silver Creek
sewer until the owner of any lot or parcel situated in or a part of the tracts
of real estate described in Section 96.11(6) has paid to the Clerk the amount
set forth in Section 96.11(6) determined in accordance with Section 96.11(7)(A)
and (B).
      A.   Residential or Small Commercial Users. If the original owner of the
property as delineated in Section
96.11(6) divides the property into one or more additional lots or parcels for
residential or small commercial uses of three acres or less, and if the plan or
division is approved by the Council, then the owner of the individual lots
shall be allowed to connect to the Silver Creek sewer line upon payment of an
amount equal to $15.00 per lineal foot for lots which abut the sewer line and
$30.00 per lineal foot where the lot is situated in the interior of the lot. In
making this calculation the frontage shall be extended to the intersection for
corner lots. In its discretion the Council may require the payment of a tap on
fee calculated at the above mentioned rate in those instances where the Council
determines that the developer and/or owner are situating the lot or lots a
short distance from the sewer line so as to avoid payment of a tap on fee. In
such a case the City may collect the tap on fee only once for that specific
portion of the sewer line as is being levied against the respective lot or
lots.
      B.   Industrial and Large Commercial Use. In the case of an industrial
use property or commercial use of greater than three acres, the property owner
shall pay to City at the time of the grant of a building permit which
contemplates tapping onto the Silver Creek sewer or at the time of tapping onto
the sewer, whichever first occurs, the sum set out in Section
96.11(6) for the respective parcel. However, if the owner divides the parcel
into two or more lots and if the plan of division is approved by the Council,
then the total tap on fee applicable to the entire tract may be prorated to
each individual lot by calculating a per acre average cost arrived at by
allocating the total tap on fee as provided in Section
96.11(6) by the number of acres in the original tract then applying this per
acre cost to the tract or area to be served by the connection. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, at such time as there shall be five hookups or connections
within the overall original tract then the entire unpaid balance of the amount
of the connection charge as set out in Section
96.11(6) as against such parcel shall be paid in full.
   8.   Agreements with Developers. The City, may, in its discretion, enter
into agreements with developers subdividing property in the benefited area, to
allow equalization of the tap on fees along the lots in the subdivision,
including agreements for the prepayment of tap on fees, the payment of tap on
fees on a per lot basis and development sequencing. Such agreements shall not
in any way alter the requirements regarding building permits.
      A.   Special procedure. The Council has determined it appropriate to
divide parcel number 18 into two tracts so as to equitably address the issue of
the prospective sewerability of Tract B. This will eliminate the prospect that
five tap ons involving real estate situated entirely within Tract A could
trigger payment of the entire tap on fee which would in the absence of division
of the tracts include fees for real estate situated within Tract B which the
property owner asserts as not presently sewerable. In the event a portion of
Tract A consisting of less than three acres would be combined with a portion of
Tract B and such combined tract would be connected to the Silver Creek sewer,
the tap on fee then payable shall be a prorated share of the total tap on fee
allocable to both Tract A and B in proportion to which the number of acres in
Tract A and B bears to the total number of acres the tract to be served by the
connection.
   9.   Maps and Illustrations. There are attached hereto on file in the
Clerk’s office and incorporated herein by this reference the following
documents:
      A.   Map illustrating the general location of the project area in
relation to the City Comprehensive Plan.

97.04   RESTRICTED DISCHARGES.
No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following described
substances, materials, waters, or wastes if it appears likely in the opinion of
the Building Official that such wastes can harm either the sewers, sewage
treatment process, or equipment, have an adverse effect on the receiving stream
or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public property, or constitute a
nuisance. In forming an opinion as to the acceptability of these wastes, the
Building Official will give consideration to such factors as the quantities of
subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of
construction of the sewers, nature of the sewage treatment process, capacity of
the sewage treatment plant, degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage

the limits established by the Building Official for such materials.
   7.   Odor or Taste. Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste
or odor producing substances, in such concentrations exceeding limits that may
be established by the Building Official as necessary, after treatment of the
composite sewage, to meet the requirements of State, federal, or other public
agencies of jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters.
   8.   Radioactive Wastes. Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-
life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the Building Official
in compliance with applicable State or federal regulations.

substance that, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, is capable
of creating a public nuisance or hazard to life or of preventing entry into
sewers for their maintenance and repair.
   12.   Damaging Substances. Any waters, wastes, materials, or substances that
react with water or wastes in the sewer system to release noxious gases,
develop color of undesirable intensity, form suspended solids in objectionable
concentration, or create any other condition deleterious to structures and
treatment processes.
   13.   Untreatable Wastes. Waters or wastes containing substances that are
not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes
employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage
treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having
jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.
97.05   RESTRICTED DISCHARGES; POWERS OF BUILDING OFFICIAL.
If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the
public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in Section
97.04 and which in the judgment of the Building Official may have a deleterious
effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or
which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the
Building Official may:
   1.   Rejection. Reject the wastes by requiring disconnection from the public
sewage system;
   2.   Pretreatment. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for
discharge to the public sewers;
   3.   Controls Imposed. Require control over the quantities and rates of
discharge; and/or
   4.   Special Charges. Require payment to cover the added cost of handling
and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under
the provisions of
Chapter 99.
97.06   SPECIAL FACILITIES.
If the Building Official permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste
flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject
to the review and approval of the Building Official and subject to the
requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws. Where preliminary
treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes,
they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation
by the owner at the owner’s expense.
97.07   CONTROL MANHOLES.
When required by the Building Official, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Building
Official. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner’s expense,
and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible at all
times.
97.08   TESTING OF WASTES.
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from
periodic grab samples.)

user’s use of the treatment works as determined by water/sewer meter(s)
acceptable to the City.
   2.   For residential contributors, monthly user charges will be based on
water used during the current month. For industrial and commercial
contributors, user charges shall be based on water used during the current
month. If a commercial user or industrial contributor has a consumptive use of
water, or in some other manner uses water which is not returned to the
wastewater collection system, the user charge for that contributor may be based
on a wastewater meter or separate water meter installed and maintained at the
contributor’s expense, and in a manner acceptable to the City.

   5.   Any user which discharges any toxic pollutants which cause an increase
in the cost of managing the effluent or the sludge from the City’s treatment
works or any user which discharges any substance which singly or by interaction
with other substances causes identifiable increases in the costs of operation,
maintenance or replacement of the treatment works shall pay for such increased
costs. The charge to each such user shall be as determined by the responsible
plant operating personnel.
   6.   The user charge rates established in this chapter apply to all users of
the City’s treatment works regardless of the users’ location.

99.05   USER CHARGE SYSTEM REVIEW.
   1.   The City will review the user charge system every two years at a
minimum and revise user charge rates as necessary to ensure that the system
generates adequate revenues to pay the costs of operation and maintenance,
including replacement, and that the system continues to provide for the
proportional distribution of operation and maintenance, including replacement,
costs among users and user classes.
   2.   The City will notify each user at least annually, in conjunction with a
regular bill, of the rate being charged for operation and maintenance,
including replacement of the treatment works.
99.06   SPECIAL RATES.
Where, in the judgment of the Council, special conditions exist surrounding use
of the City water to the extent that the application of the service charges,
rentals, or rates specified herein would be inequitable or unfair to either the
City or the customers, the Council may establish a special rate applying to
such customers. Such special rates, when adopted by ordinance by the Council,
shall apply to all customers to the sanitary utilities of the City under like
circumstances. Special rates may include, among other, the following cases:
   1.   Where the nature of the use of the City water is such that the
resulting sewage or industrial waste discharged into the sanitary sewer system
of the City has characteristics making it more or less difficult to treat than
ordinary domestic waste.
   2.   Where the monthly City water use exceeds 25,000 gallons and a
substantial portion of such water consumed is not polluted and is not
discharged into or does not reach the sanitary sewer system.
   3.   Where privately produced water supplies are discharged directly or
indirectly into the sanitary sewer system of the City, the service rental shall
be on an equal basis as may be with the rates which were applied to an equal
quantity in character of waste originating through the use of City water.
99.07   PRIVATE WATER SYSTEMS.
Customers whose premises are served by a private water system shall pay sewer
rentals based upon the water used as determined by the City either by an
estimate agreed to by the customer or by metering the water system at the
customer’s expense. Any negotiated, or agreed upon sales or rentals shall be
subject to approval of the Council.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
99.08   PAYMENT OF BILLS.
All sewer rentals shall be due and payable under the same terms and conditions
provided for payment of a combined service account as contained in Section
92.03 of this Code of Ordinances. Sewer service may be discontinued in
accordance with the provisions contained in Section
92.04 if the combined service account becomes delinquent, and the provisions
contained in Section
92.07 relating to lien notices shall also apply in the event of a delinquent
account.
99.09   LIEN FOR NONPAYMENT.
Except as provided for in Section
92.06 of this Code of Ordinances, the owner of the premises served and any
lessee or tenant thereof shall be jointly and severally liable for sewer
service charges to the premises. Water service charges remaining unpaid and
delinquent shall constitute a lien upon the property or premises served and
shall be certified by the Clerk to the County Treasurer for collection in the
same manner as property taxes.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
99.10   SPECIAL AGREEMENTS PERMITTED.
No statement in these chapters shall be construed as preventing a special
agreement, arrangement or contract between the Council, and any industrial
concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be
accepted subject to special conditions, rate and cost as established by the
Council.

101.01   PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to reduce or eliminate the hazards to the public
health and safety caused by excessive stormwater runoff, reduce the effects of
soil erosion and sedimentation caused by development, reduce economic losses to
individuals and the community at large, enhance broader social and economic
objectives, and protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land
and water resources.
101.02   DEFINITIONS.
When used in this chapter, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the
following words and phrases shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to
them in this section.
   1.   “Control structure” means a structure designed to control the flow of
stormwater runoff that passes through it during a specific length of time.
   2.   “Detention facility” means an area designed to store excess stormwater.
   3.   “Development” means the improvement of the land from its original state
(unimproved and prior to any development) such as a structure, impervious
surface being placed or constructed or agricultural crops thus increasing the
amount of rainwater or surface water runoff.
   4.   “Dry bottom stormwater storage area” means a facility designed to be
normally dry and contain water only when excess stormwater runoff occurs.
   5.   “Erosion” means the loss of natural soils by the action of wind and/or
water.
   6.   “Excess stormwater” means that portion of stormwater which exceeds the
transportation capacity of storm sewers or natural drainage channels serving a
specific watershed.
   7.   “Excess stormwater passageway” means a channel formed in the topography
of the earth’s surface to carry stormwater runoff through a specific area.
   8.   “Natural drainage” means channels formed by the existing surface
topography prior to changes made by unnatural causes.
   9.   “Stormwater runoff” means the flow of water resulting from
precipitation which is not absorbed by the soil or plant material.
   10.   “Stormwater runoff release rate” means the rate at which stormwater
runoff is released from dominant to subservient land.
   11.   “Tributary watershed” means all of the area that contributes
stormwater runoff to a given point.
   12.   “Wet bottom stormwater storage area” means a facility designed to be
maintained as a pond or free water surface and which has the capacity to
contain excess stormwater runoff.
   13.   “‘X’-year storm” means the average recurrence intervals within which a
rainfall of given intensity and duration will be equaled or exceeded only once.
A 100-year storm would have an intensity of rainfall which would, on the
average, be equaled or exceeded only once in 100 years. This does not imply
that it will occur in 100 years, or having occurred, will not happen again for
100 years.
101.03   DESIGN CRITERIA.
The design of stormwater runoff systems, structures, and facilities shall be
based on the following minimum standards, which do not preclude the use of
higher design standards.
101.04   APPLICABILITY.
The provisions of Sections
101.05 through
101.13 shall apply to any of the following areas under development:
   1.   All new residential developments of two acres or more and all
commercial and industrial developments in excess of one acre.
   2.   Any development where the percentage of the impervious area of the lot
is 50 percent or greater.
   3.   Any development which, in the opinion of the City’s Engineer, lacks an
adequate internal or external excess stormwater passageway.
101.05   RUNOFF CALCULATION.
Design flows will be calculated using the “Rational” Method. The “Rational”
Method is defined as:
Q = CIA
where:
“Q” = Resultant runoff rate in cubic feet per second.
“C” = Runoff coefficient (see
Appendix A for values).
“I” = Intensity of rainfall (see
Appendix B for values).
“A” = Tributary watershed in acres.

101.07   RELEASE RATE.
The stormwater runoff release rate from any detention basin required under this
chapter shall not exceed the stormwater runoff rate from the drainage area from
a five-year frequency storm having a runoff coefficient “C” of 0.15. The City
may require a lesser release rate when the downstream outlet is insufficient to
safely convey the release rate as determined.
101.08   DETENTION REQUIREMENTS.
   1.   Storage Volume. The volume of storage potential provided in stormwater
detention facilities shall be sufficient to control the excess stormwater
runoff, as determined to be the difference between the stormwater quantity from
the site in its developed state for a 100-year frequency rainfall less the
allowable release rate as set forth in Section
101.07.
   2.   Detention storage may be provided as a dry bottom or wet bottom storage
area.
      A.   Dry bottom stormwater storage areas may be designed to serve a
secondary purpose for recreation, open space, parking, or other types of uses
that will not be adversely affected by intermittent flooding.
         (1)   A method of carrying the low flow through these areas shall be
provided in addition to a system of drains to prevent soggy areas.
         (2)   Outlet control structures shall be designed as simply as
possible and shall require little or no attention for proper operation. Each
stormwater storage area shall be provided with a method of emergency overflow
in the event that a storm in excess of the 100-year frequency storm occurs.
This emergency overflow facility shall be designed to function without
attention. Hydraulic calculations shall be submitted to substantiate all design
features.
         (3)   Both outlet control structures and emergency overflow facilities
shall be designed and constructed to fully protect the public health, safety,
and welfare. Stormwater runoff velocities shall be kept at a minimum and
turbulent conditions at an outlet control structure will not be permitted
without complete protection for the public safety. The use of fences shall be
kept to a minimum and used only as a last resort when no other method is
feasible.
         (4)   Parking lot surfaces that are to serve as stormwater storage
areas and rooftop storage shall be designed with permanent-type control
outlets. Emergency overflow areas shall be provided.
      B.   Wet bottom stormwater storage areas shall be designed with all of
the items required for dry bottom stormwater storage areas, except that the
provisions of Subsection 2(A)(1) shall not be required. However, the following
additional conditions shall be complied with:
         (1)   Water surface area shall not exceed 1/15 of the tributary
drainage area.
         (2)   Facilities shall be provided to lower the pond elevation by
gravity flow for cleaning purposes and shoreline maintenance. Shoreline
protection shall be provided to prevent erosion.
         (3)   Minimum normal water depth shall be four feet. If fish are to be
maintained, some portion of the pond area should be a minimum of nine feet
deep. The Council may impose a requirement for suitable fencing to provide for
the safety of citizens.
         (4)   Control structures for stormwater release shall be designed to
operate with only a minor increase in water surface level when the design
storage capacity has been exceeded. Hydraulic calculations shall be submitted
to substantiate all design features.
         (5)   Only that portion of the detention area above the normal water
level shall be used in calculating the storage capacity.
101.09   CONSTRUCTION.
   1.   Where development of a property presents the threat of flooding or
damage by flash runoff to downstream residents, the facilities for stormwater
runoff control shall be construed as a part of the first phase of construction
of that project.
   2.   The construction of the stormwater control system shall be accomplished
as part of the cost of land development for each individual lot.
   3.   All flood control items such as earthen embankments, conduits, outlet
structures, flood control structures, spillways, excess stormwater passageway
channels, etc., shall be built as permanent facilities and all materials and
their manner of construction shall be assembled to accomplish as much
permanency as is possible.
   4.   Storm sewer piping shall adhere to the City Specifications for type and
installation.
101.10   MAINTENANCE.
All plans submitted for stormwater detention systems shall describe an adequate
procedure of normal maintenance for the detention system. Any failure of the
stormwater detention system, due to inadequate normal or capital maintenance,
shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property on which the detention
system is located. It shall also be the property owner’s responsibility to
remedy any negligence in maintenance that resulted in the failure of the
system. The submittal of plans for such a system or the purchase of property on
which such system is located shall be deemed as acceptance of responsibility
for normal and capital maintenance of the system. In the event that maintenance
is not provided, the City Administrator shall notify the party responsible for
maintenance to perform the work and set a reasonable time for its completion.
If said party refuses or is unable to comply with said order, the City
Administrator shall cause the maintenance to be completed at the expense of
said party.
101.11   EASEMENTS.
   1.   Drainage easements shall be provided for all areas of the detention
basin, including the outlet structures and emergency spillway.
   2.   No structures (with the exception of drainage structures) shall be
constructed in the easement areas, nor any filling, fencing, or other
obstacles, which will impede its intended use or capacity.
   3.   The developer shall provide reasonable public easements reserving the
land for use as a stormwater detention facility providing the City with the
right to inspect the facility and for ingress and egress.
101.12   PROCEDURE.
   1.   Plans, specifications, and all calculations for stormwater runoff
control shall be submitted for City review and approval prior to the approval
of a final plat (in the case of a subdivision) or issuance of a building permit
(in case of commercial or industrial construction). All plans, specifications,
and calculations shall be prepared and sealed by a professional engineer
registered in the State.
   2.   No Certification of Occupancy for any building in the development will
be issued until the stormwater detention facilities are constructed, inspected,
and approved.
101.13   EROSION CONTROL.
   1.   All developments shall have a temporary and permanent erosion control
system designed in such a way as to do and accomplish the following:
      A.   Provide that all loosened earthen materials, vegetative debris,
construction debris and/or rubbish caused by construction or erection of any
building, structure, or parking lot or construction of streets be contained
within the boundaries of the development during the period of construction.
Permanent erosion controls are established by settling basins, berms, silt
control fences or other standard recognized methods of permanently controlling
erosion prior to removal of temporary erosion control.
      B.   Provide that all stormwater outlets or drainage ways be constructed
with controls to control erosion of material both on and adjacent to the
developed tract of land. Erosion controls shall be provided such that
velocities of stormwater discharged from outlets and into natural drainage ways
be limited to provide a non-erosive velocity flow of three feet per second or
less. Means of controlling erosion shall include, but not be limited to: energy

NATURAL GAS FRANCHISE
 
110.01 Interstate Power and Light Company
 
110.01   INTERSTATE POWER AND LIGHT COMPANY. † 5
   1.   There is hereby granted to Interstate Power and Light Company,
hereinafter referred to as the “Company,” its successors and assigns, the
right, franchise, and privilege for the term of 25 years subject to a limited
right of cancellation at the end of the 10th and 20th year anniversaries of the
anniversary date as defined within; from and after the passage, adoption,
approval, and acceptance of this ordinance, to lay down, maintain, and operate
the necessary pipes, mains, and other conductors and appliances in, along, and
under the streets, avenues, alleys, and public places in the City of DeWitt,
Clinton County, Iowa, as now or hereafter constituted, for the purpose of
distributing, supplying, and selling gas to said City and the residents thereof
and to persons and corporations beyond the limits thereof; also the right of
eminent domain as provided in Section 364.2 of the Code of Iowa. The term “gas”
as used in this franchise shall be construed to mean natural gas only.
   2.   The mains and pipes of the Company must be so placed as not to
interfere unnecessarily with water pipes, drains, sewers, and fire plugs which
have been or may hereafter be placed in any street, alley, and public places in
said City nor unnecessarily interfere with the proper use of the same,
including ordinary drainage, or with the sewers, underground pipe, and other
property of the City, and the Company, its successors and assigns, shall hold
the City free and harmless from all damages arising from the negligent acts or
omissions of the Company in the laying down, operation, and maintenance of said
natural gas distribution system.
   3.   In making any excavations in any street, alley, avenue, or public
place, Company, its successors and assigns, shall protect the site while work
is in progress by guards, barriers, or signals, shall not unnecessarily
obstruct the use of the streets, shall back fill all openings in such manner as
to prevent settling or depressions in surface, and shall replace the surface,
pavement, or sidewalk of such excavations with same materials, restoring the
condition as nearly as practical and, if defects are caused shall repair the
same.
   4.   The Company shall, at its cost and expense, locate and relocate its
existing facilities or equipment in, on, over, or under any public street or
alley in the City in such manner as the City may at any time reasonably require
for the purposes of facilitating the construction, reconstruction, maintenance,
or repair of the street or alley or any public improvement of, in, or about any
such street or alley or reasonably promoting the efficient operation of any
such improvement. If the City orders or requests the Company to relocate its
existing facilities or equipment for the primary benefit of a commercial or
private project, or as the result of the initial request of a commercial or
private developer or other non-public entity, and such relocation is necessary
to prevent interference and not merely for the convenience of the City or other
non-public entity, the Company shall receive payment for the cost of such
relocation as a precondition to relocating its existing facilities or
equipment. The City shall consider reasonable alternatives in designing its
public works projects so as not arbitrarily to cause the Company unreasonable
additional expense in exercising its authority under this subsection. The City
shall also provide a reasonable alternative location for the Company’s
facilities. The City shall give the Company reasonable advance written notice
to vacate a public right-of-way. Vacating a public right-of-way shall not
deprive the Company of its right to operate and maintain existing facilities,
until the reasonable cost of relocating the same are paid to the Company.
   5.   Said Company, its successors and assigns, shall throughout the term of
the franchise distribute to all consumers gas of good quality and shall furnish
uninterrupted service, except as interruptible service may be specifically
contracted for with consumers; provided, however, that any prevention of
service caused by fire, act of God, or unavoidable event or accident shall not
be a breach of this condition if the Company resumes service as quickly as is
reasonably practical after the happening of the act causing the interruption.
   6.   The franchise granted by this chapter shall not be exclusive.
   7.   The Company shall maintain liability insurance coverage during the term
of this franchise as is usual and customary in the industry for similarly
situated utility companies. The Company shall provide to the City evidence of
such coverage in the form of a certificate of insurance upon written request.
The Company shall endeavor to provide 30 days’ notice of cancellation or non-
renewal. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the liability
of the Company under this franchise.
   8.   Franchise Fee. In its monthly billing Company shall include a franchise
fee of zero percent on the gross receipts from the distribution, supply, or
sale of natural gas for customers within the limits of the City. The Company
shall commence collecting the zero percent franchise fee on the date of January
1 or July 1, following six months from the date the acceptance of this
franchise by the Company is filed with the Clerk. The franchise fee may be
increased or decreased by the City on or after January 1, 2007, and shall be
limited to a maximum fee of five percent. The Grantor shall give the Company a
minimum six-month notice prior to the request to implement an increase or
decrease in the franchise fee. Grantor shall be solely responsible for the
proper use of any amounts collected as franchise fees, and shall only use such
fees as collected for a purpose as allowed by applicable law. Collection of the
franchise fee shall cease at the earlier of the City’s repeal of the franchise
fee or the end of the franchise term.
   9.   The franchise fee shall be applied to all customers’ bills in
accordance with Chapters 364.2(f), 423B.5, and 423E.2(3) of the Code of Iowa.
The Company shall not grant exemptions or refunds of the franchise fee beyond
that granted by the Code of Iowa. If at any time the Iowa Utilities Board, or
another authority having proper jurisdiction, prohibits the collection or
payment of a franchise fee, the Company shall be relieved of its obligation to
collect and pay to the City the franchise fee.
   10.   The franchise fee shall include an additional charge not to exceed
0.06 percent on the gross receipts from the distribution, supply, or sale of
gas for customers within the limits of the City. Said additional charge will
cover the administrative and related expenses incurred by Company to
accommodate City’s franchise fee and shall only apply when a franchise fee is
being collected pursuant to Subsection 8.
   11.   City agrees that Company’s obligations related to the franchise fee
are limited to those obligations set forth in Subsections 8, 10, and 13 herein.
City further agrees to bear all costs (including attorney fees), and to defend,
indemnify, and hold Company harmless from any and all liability, claims, or
causes of action associated with disputes related to the billing and/or
collection of the franchise fee, provided that the City shall not be obligated
to bear such costs or to defend, indemnify, and hold Company harmless if such
disputes arise from claims of inaccurate billing by the Company.
   12.   Upon receipt of a final and unappealable order or approval authorizing
annexation, or changes in the limits of said City, the Clerk shall provide
written notification to an officer of Company of such annexation or change in
the limits of said City, and the Company shall apply the franchise fee to its
customers who are affected by the annexation or change in the limits of the
City, commencing six months from receipt of the written notice.
   13.   The sum of such additional charges for the franchise fee and any
additional charges related to Subsection 8 and/or 10 above shall be shown
separately on the utility bill to each customer.
   14.   The Company shall remit collected franchise fees to the City on a
quarterly basis, within 30 days after last day of the last revenue month of the
quarter.
   15.   That said franchise fee shall be in lieu of any other payments to the
City for the Company’s use of streets, avenues, alleys, and public places in
the said City and other administrative or regulatory costs with regard to said
franchise; and said pipes, mains, and other conductor and appliances in, along,
and under the streets, avenues, alleys, and public places in the said City for
the purpose of distributing, supplying, and selling gas to said City and the
residents thereof and to persons and corporations beyond the limits thereof
shall be exempt from any special tax, assessment, license, or rental charge
during the entire term of this franchise.
   16.   The term of the franchise granted by this chapter and the rights
granted thereunder shall continue for the period of 25 years from and after its
acceptance by the Company, as herein provided. The City may cancel this
franchise on the 10th or 20th year anniversary of the anniversary date of this
franchise by notifying Company in writing of its desire to do so, said
notification to be given within 30 days of the 10th or 20th anniversary
respectively of this franchise. If Company is not notified of the cancellation
by the 10th or 20th anniversary, then this franchise shall continue without
cancellation until the 25th year. The anniversary date shall be the date this
franchise is filed with the Clerk or otherwise effective by operation of law.
   17.   This chapter sets forth and constitutes the entire agreement between
the Company and the City with respect to the rights contained herein, and may
not be superseded, modified, or otherwise amended without the approval and
acceptance of the Company. Upon acceptance by the Company, this chapter shall
supersede, abrogate, and repeal the prior gas system ordinance between the
Company and the City as of the date this franchise is accepted by the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the City enact any ordinance
or place any limitations, either operationally or through the assessment of
fees, that create additional burdens upon the Company or which delay utility
operations.

any tree extending into any street, alley, or public grounds to maintain
electric reliability, safety, to restore utility service and to prevent limbs,
branches, or trunks from interfering with the wires and facilities of the

136.04   SIDEWALK REQUIREMENTS.  
Sidewalks are necessary to provide a safe surface for pedestrian traffic to

established within the City:
   1.   Installation of new sidewalks shall be required with the issuance of a
building permit for the construction of a single-family home, a multi-family

permit for an addition to a single-family home, including a deck or porch, a
multi-family home, an apartment, a business or commercial structure, or a
garage. Construction adding useable space shall be considered an addition. An
extension may be granted by the City Administrator who shall report the same to
the Council. These extensions may be granted for special circumstances only
(such as waiting for appropriate weather to do final grading of property) for a
period not to exceed 12 months. Where an extension is granted, the property
owner shall be required to provide proof of intent to install sidewalk or a
bond in the appropriate amount to cover the cost of sidewalk construction.
Property owner’s failing to install sidewalk as required by this section shall
be subject to Section
136.09.

   3.   The property owner shall pay for surveying when required.
   4.   Those businesses with concrete or blacktop aprons shall mark sidewalk
location on the apron in a manner approved by the Building Official. Snow shall

repaired, replaced, or reconstructed, all broken or defective sidewalks, and to
maintain in a safe and hazard-free condition any sidewalk outside the lot and
property lines and inside the curb lines or traveled portion of the public
street.    
(Subsection 5 – Ord. 2024-12 – Dec. 24 Supp.)
136.05   SIDEWALK LOAN FUND.  
The City shall maintain a fund of $2,000 as long as deemed appropriate by the
Council to make first-come, first-served, interest free loans to low and
moderate income (per federal government standards) homeowners who desire to
take advantage of the program. This will be for the repair of existing
sidewalks or the construction of sidewalks in established residential areas
where sidewalks do not now exist. Loan money is not for construction of
sidewalks for new homes, rental units, or businesses.
136.06   PERMITS FOR CONSTRUCTION AND REMOVAL.  
No person shall make any sidewalk improvements, whether ordered by the Council
or not, unless such person obtains a permit from the Building Official. A
permit fee, the amount hereinafter set by resolution, shall be payable at the
time of obtaining the permit. The person obtaining the permit shall agree in
writing that said person will, in making the sidewalk improvements, comply with
the ordinances of the City and with the specifications for sidewalks approved
by the Council and on file in the office of the Clerk and that the work shall
be done under the direction and supervision of the Building Official and
subject to the approval of that officer. All such permits, together with the
written agreement above referred to, shall be filed and preserved in the office
of the Building Official. Before granting any permit to make sidewalk
improvements, the Building Official shall determine the propriety of the same
and shall state in all permits issued when the work is to be commenced and when
the sidewalk work is to be completed. The Building Official may extend the time
of completion for the sidewalk improvements when deemed necessary. All permits
for Council-ordered sidewalk improvements shall be issued in compliance with
the resolution of the Council ordering the improvement. All permits for
sidewalk improvements, not ordered by resolution of the Council, shall be
issued in compliance with this chapter. The Building Official may withhold the
issuance of any permit for any sidewalk improvements for a sufficient period to
determine the necessity for the proposed improvements or when the weather
conditions will adversely affect the sidewalk improvements.
136.07   INSPECTION OF PRIVATE WORK; REMEDIES.  
All sidewalk improvements shall be done under the direction and supervision of
the Building Official and subject to the inspection and approval of the
Building Official. Whenever any sidewalk improvements are made which do not
conform to the provisions of this chapter and with the specifications herein
referred to, or where any sidewalk improvements are made without obtaining a
permit as required by this chapter, or the work is not performed within the
time stated in the permit, the Building Official shall serve upon the property
owner or agent thereof, and upon the contractor doing the work, a notice to
obtain a permit, if not already obtained, or if the sidewalk is in the course
of construction, to stop until a permit is obtained or work is corrected in
compliance with the specifications. If the sidewalk work has been completed,
the owner shall obtain a permit immediately and perform any needed sidewalk
improvement within five days from the receipt of said permit, in the proper
manner and of proper materials as required by the specifications herein
referred to. In case any owner fails to do so, the Building Official shall
cause the sidewalk to be constructed, reconstructed, or repaired in a proper
manner and of proper materials. There shall be returned to the Council an
itemized and verified statement of expenditures of material and of the labor
used in doing such work, and the legal description of the lot, part of lot or
parcel of ground abutting the sidewalk on which such work was performed. The
cost thereof shall be assessed to the property fronting thereon.
136.08   CITY MAY ORDER REPAIRS.
It is the duty of the abutting property owner at any time, or upon receipt of
45 days’ notice from the City, to repair, replace, or reconstruct or cause to
be repaired, replaced, or reconstructed, all broken and defective sidewalks and
to maintain in a safe and hazard-free condition any sidewalk outside the lot
and property lines and inside the curb lines or traveled portion of the public
street abutting said owner's property. If, upon the expiration of 45 days as
provided in said notice, the required work has not been done or is not in the

tower.
All responses to applications for siting of telecommunications towers and
facilities shall be in writing and shall be made within 60 days after all
application materials are received.
153.10   NOISE AND EMISSION STANDARDS.
No equipment shall be operated at towers and telecommunications facilities so
as to produce noise in excess of applicable noise standards under WAC 173-60,
except during emergencies or periodic routine maintenance which requires the
use of a back-up generator, where the noise standards may be exceeded
temporarily. The Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 gives the FCC sole
jurisdiction to regulate radio frequency emissions. Facilities that meet the
FCC standards shall not be conditioned or denied on the basis of emissions
impacts. Applicants for tower sites shall be required to provide information on
the projected power density of the facility and how this meets the FCC
standards.
153.11   ENGINEERING AND INSPECTION FEES.
Engineering fees incurred by the City for review of documents and drawings, and
for inspections of physical improvements, shall be paid by the applicant and
shall be the actual costs of the reviews and inspections to the City.
153.12   PLACEMENT OF FACILITIES AND RELATED LEASE FEES.
The placement and maintenance of communications antennas or towers on City-
owned sites, such as water towers and parks, will be allowed when the following
additional requirements are met.
   1.   The placement of communications towers or antennas on water towers will
be allowed only when the following requirements are met.
      A.   The applicant must have written approval from the Director of Public
Works each time access to the facility is desired. This will minimize the risk
of contamination to the water supply.
      B.   There is sufficient room on the structure and/or the grounds to
accommodate the applicant’s facility.
      C.   The presence of the facility will not increase the water tower
maintenance cost to the City.
      D.   The presence of the facility will not be harmful to the health or
safety of the workers maintaining the water tower.
      E.   The annual fee for placing facilities on a City water tower shall be
negotiated and approved by the Council.
   2.   Parks. The presence of certain communications antennas or tower
represents a potential conflict with the purpose of certain City-owned parks
and recreational facilities. Towers shall be prohibited in City public parks.
153.13   ABANDONMENT.
In the event the use of any communications tower has been discontinued for a
period of 180 consecutive days, the tower shall be deemed to be abandoned.
Determination of the date of abandonment shall be made by the City
Administrator who shall have the right to request documentation or affidavits
from the communications tower owner or operator regarding the issue of tower
usage. Upon such abandonment, the owner or operator of the tower shall have an
additional 180 days within which to:
   1.   Reactivate the use of the tower or transfer the tower to another owner
or operator who makes actual use of the tower.
   2.   Dismantle and remove the tower. At the earliest, 181 days from the date
of abandonment, without reactivating or upon completion of dismantling and
removal, any special exception or variance approval for the tower shall
automatically expire.
   3.   A user violates any of the standards in this chapter or the conditions
attached to the City’s lease agreement.
153.14   TERMINATION.
Before taking action, the City will provide notice to the user of the intended
termination and the reasons for it, and provide an opportunity for a hearing
before the Council regarding the proposed action. This procedure need not be
followed in emergency situations.
153.15   HOME RULE.
This chapter is intended to be and shall be construed as consistent with the
reservation of local authority contained in the 25th Amendment to the State
Constitution granting cities Home Rule powers. To such end, any limitation on
the power of the City contained herein is to be strictly construed and the City
reserves to itself the right to exercise all power and authority to regulate
and control its local affairs and all ordinances and regulations of the City
shall be enforced against the holders of any lease.
153.16   NEW TECHNOLOGIES.
Should, within the term of any lease, developments within the field for which
the grant was made to the holder of the lease present the opportunity to the
holder of the lease to be more effective, efficient, and economical through the
use of a substance or material other than those for which the lease was
originally made, the holder of the lease may petition the Council which, with
such requirements or limitations as it deems necessary to protect public
health, safety and welfare, may allow the use of such substances under the
terms and conditions of the lease.

154.01   PURPOSE AND RULE OF INTERPRETATION.
The Council finds it is necessary for the City to establish uniform rules and
controls to ensure public safety and provide efficient delivery of services by
the City and others wishing to utilize streets and other public property for
the delivery of utility or other services, in order to protect public and
private investment, ensure orderly use of public property and ensure the
health, safety, and welfare of the population, to provide for the regulation
and administration of the public streets and other public property and secure
the rights of the City to a return on its investment in public property. This
chapter is to be interpreted in light of these findings for the benefit of the
public and users of the streets and other public property.
154.02   FRANCHISE, LICENSE, OR LEASE REQUIRED.
No person or other entity shall use the public right-of-way or other public
property without first obtaining a franchise, license, or lease from the City.
The City shall not enter into or issue any franchise, license, or lease that
grants exclusive rights. An application for a license or lease shall be filed
with the Clerk, copy to Director of Public Works, and shall include as a
minimum the following information: the name, address, and telephone number of
the applicant; the name, address, and telephone number of a person whom the
City may notify or contact at any time concerning the license or lease; an
engineering site plan showing the proposed location of the facilities including
any manholes, the size, type, and proposed depth of any conduit or other
enclosures; and any additional information the City may require. All licenses
or leases required by this section shall be granted by the Council.
154.03   FEES REQUIRED.
No franchise, license, or lease for the use of public right-of-way or other
public property shall be granted without requiring the grantee thereof to pay a
reasonable and competitively neutral fee for the use of public right-of-way or
other public property. The fees will be as follows:
   1.   All new franchises shall be assessed a franchise fee of up to five
percent of the gross receipts of customers within the City limits.
   2.   Additionally, any person or other entity shall pay a fee and obtain a
permit in accordance with the provisions of Section
135.09 every time their facility requires excavation in the right-of-way. This
fee will cover costs for street degradation and replacement, inspection, and
obstruction and routing of pedestrian and vehicle traffic. All or part of this
fee may be waived if work is done in conjunction with City construction.
154.04   LIMIT ON TERM.
No franchise, license, or lease for use of the public right-of-way or other
public property shall be granted for a term to exceed 25 years.
154.05   PLACEMENT OF FACILITIES.
The facilities, fixtures, and equipment of the distribution, transmission, or
sale of any utility services, or services provided under license or lease or
easement, shall be placed and maintained so as not to unnecessarily or
unreasonably interfere with the travel on the streets, avenues, alleys,
bridges, and public places in the City, nor shall such facilities, fixtures,
and equipment interfere with the proper use of the same including, but not
limited to ordinary drainage, or the functioning of the sewers, underground
pipe, or other property of the City. In the event that facilities, fixtures,
and equipment of any person or other entity located within a public right-of-
way must be relocated because of paving, road construction, or road
reconstruction, sewer construction, or sewer reconstruction, or the
construction or reconstruction of public drainage systems or similar public
works or the construction or reconstruction of the facilities of any City owned
utility, such relocation, at the written request of the City, shall be
completed by the owner of such facilities at the owner’s cost. The City shall,
upon request of any person or other entity holding a franchise, license, or
lease, review any plans for the construction of facilities, fixtures, and
equipment within the public right-of-way and advise the person or other entity
of any conflict such construction may have with planned or anticipated public
improvements, but failure of the City to so advise such person or other entity
will not relieve the owner of such facilities of its obligations under this
chapter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City may require placement of
equipment or facilities belonging to any holder of a franchise, license, or
lease be limited to locations designated by the Public Works Director if such
limitation is deemed by the Public Works Director to be necessary to protect
the integrity of use of present and future users of the public right-of-way or
other public property.
154.06   INDEMNIFICATION AND BOND.
   1.   The holder of any franchise, license, or lease shall indemnify and hold
the City harmless at all times during the term of the franchise, license, or
lease from and against all claims for injury or damage to any person or
property, including payments under workers’ compensation laws, caused by the
construction, erection, operation, or maintenance of its facilities, fixtures,
or equipment, or the negligence of its contractors or its employees. In case of
any suit or action at law being commenced against the City, upon any claim for
damage arising out of any loss, injury, or damage claimed to have been caused
by any installation, improvement, obstruction, or excavation made or left in,
under, or upon such a street, sidewalk, alley, or public place by the holder of
a franchise, license, or lease, its agents, contractors, or employees, upon
being notified in writing by the City of such action or proceeding, the holder
of said franchise, license, or lease shall appear and make proper defense
thereto at the expense of the holder of the franchise, license, or lease; and
if any judgement or decree shall in any such case be rendered against the City
therein, the holder of said franchise, license, or lease shall assume, pay, and
satisfy such judgement or decree, with the cost thereof.
   2.   Immediately upon issuance of the franchise, license, or lease, the
holder of the franchise, license, or lease shall purchase general liability
insurance. The amount of insurance shall be a minimum of $1,000,000.00 with a
maximum deductible of $5,000.00. The holder of the franchise, license, or lease
shall file with the Clerk a certificate of insurance which clearly discloses on
its face coverage in conformity with these requirements. Upon request of the
City, the holder of the franchise, license, or lease shall submit certified
copy of the policy.
154.07   REGULATION BY THE CITY.
The City reserves the right to make reasonable general regulations for the use
of streets and other public property which, unless otherwise specifically
provided, shall apply to any holder of a franchise, license, or lease.
154.08   CONSTRUCTION AND EXCAVATION BY HOLDERS OF FRANCHISES OR LICENSES OR
LEASES.
    1.   A written permit will be obtained from the Clerk whenever it becomes
necessary for the holder of any franchise, license, or lease to excavate in
streets or public grounds of the City. Such permits shall state a particular
part or point of the street where the excavation is to be made and the length
of time in which such permit shall authorize the work to be done. An exception
to a requirement for a permit shall be made in cases of emergency involving
public safety, in which case a permit will be obtained at the earliest
opportunity after the work has started.
   2.   In making excavations in the streets, the holder of any franchise,
license, or lease shall proceed with such work as to cause the least possible
inconvenience to the public. The holder of any franchise, license, or lease
shall properly protect, according to safety standards generally accepted at the
time of placement, as may be determined from time to time by the Public Works
Director, all excavations, and obstructions by proper placement of shoring,
surface plates, barricades, warning lights, and such other or additional
devices as circumstances may warrant. If, in the opinion of the Public Works
Director, such excavation or obstruction is not properly and safely protected,
the Public Works Director shall notify such holder of a franchise, license, or
lease who shall immediately comply with such reasonable instructions. All
contractor work and operations shall be in compliance with Occupational Health
and Safety Administration (OSHA) standards.
   3.   Immediately after use, any trenches for excavations which the holder of
a franchise, license, or lease has opened shall be filled. However, no trench
or excavation in the streets shall be filled or covered without giving the City
the right to inspect the same. All backfilling in streets will be according to
City specifications. Temporary street surfacing will be placed in such
excavation as soon as the same has been backfilled. Pavements, sidewalks,
curbs, and gutter or other portions of streets and public places opened,
disturbed, or damaged shall be promptly restored and replaced with like
materials at the expense of the holder of a franchise, license, or lease and
left in as good a condition as before the opening, disturbance, or damage
occurred. In the event like replacement materials are not available, the holder
of the franchise, license, or lease shall notify the Public Works Director who
must approve the use of any alternate materials. In the event that the holder
of a franchise, license, or lease fails to comply with the provision of this
section, after having been given reasonable notice, the City may do such works
as may be needed to properly repair such pavements, sidewalks, curbs, and
gutters or other portions of streets and public places and the cost thereof
shall be repaid to the City by the holder of the franchise, license, or lease.
In cases where a cut or disturbance is made in a section of street paving or
sidewalks but causes greater disturbance than to just the area cut, rather than
replace only the area cut, the holder of a franchise, license, or lease shall
replace that area as may be ordered by the Public Works Director, which in no
event shall exceed the panel or panels disturbed.
154.09   CITY CONSTRUCTION AND PAVING.
    1.   Whenever the City shall pave or repave any street or shall change the
grade line of any street or public place or shall construct or reconstruct any
conduit, water main service or water connection, sewer, or other City-owned
public works or City owned utility, it shall be the duty of the holder of any
franchise, license, or lease, when so ordered by the City, to relocate its
service lines and other property in the streets or other public places at its
own expense so as to conform to the established grade or line of such street or
public place and so as not to interfere with the public improvements so
constructed or reconstructed. In the case of other public improvements
including, but not limited to, urban renewal projects, the City may require the
holder of a franchise, license, or lease to relocate its poles, service lines
and appurtenances in the streets at the owner's expense.
   2.   The City may at its discretion assign personnel for inspection of
excavation and related work being performed by the holder of a franchise,
license, or lease. Should the holder of the franchise, license, or lease fail
or refuse to do and perform the things provided in this section, the City may,
after reasonable notice, perform the work and charge the expense thereof to the
holder of the franchise, license, or lease and the holder of the franchise,
license, or lease shall promptly pay such charges.
154.10   DESIGN NOTICE TO CITY.
The holder of a franchise, license, or lease shall promptly, upon request,
furnish the Public Works Director, a detailed map, or maps of its distribution
system both within the City limits and the area within two miles surrounding
the City. The holder of a franchise, license, or lease shall thereafter update
the map or maps at least annually or upon request, showing all subsequent
additions or deletions to the distribution system. Prior to any excavation by
the City or its agents, a representative must contact the holder of any
franchise, license, or lease regarding current information on the location of
underground lines or facilities in the area concerned. The obligation to
contact the holder of franchise, license, or lease under this section shall be
satisfied if contact is made with a corporation pursuant to Chapter 480 of the
Code of Iowa, or an entity with a similar function utilized by both the City
and the company, currently the Iowa One Call System.
154.11   ABOVE-GROUND CABLES, WIRES, CONDUITS, AND POLES.
All cables, wires, and conduits shall be placed underground except where above-
ground connection to buildings or other locations above-ground is reasonably
necessary. Such above-ground connection shall be by means of poles located, as
far as reasonably practical, within alleys. No such poles shall be installed or
erected until the Public Works Director has approved the proposed location,
construction, and pole heights.
154.12   ASSIGNMENT.
No sale or assignment of any franchise, license, or lease of the use of the
public right-of-way or other public property shall be effective until it is
approved by the Council and until the holder thereof has filed in the office of
the Clerk written notice of the proposed sale, transfer, disposition
assignment, such notice to clearly summarize the proposed procedure and the
terms and conditions thereof. Such approval by the City shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The proposed vendee, assignee, or lessee shall similarly
file an instrument, duly executed, reciting such proposal, accepting the terms
of the franchise, license, or lease and agreeing to perform all of the
conditions thereof.
154.13   FORFEITURE.
The violation of any material portion of a franchise, license, or lease by the
holder thereof or its successors or assigns, or its failure promptly to perform
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be cause for forfeiture of said
franchise, license, or lease and the termination of all rights thereunder. Such
forfeiture shall be accomplished by ordinance of the City after written notice
to the holder thereof and a continuation of the violation, failure, or default
specified on the notice for at least 30 days from the date the notice was
served.
154.14   APPLICATION.
This chapter shall apply to all franchises, licenses, or leases and. easements
granted by the City including all existing franchises, licenses, or leases and
easements.
154.15   HOME RULE.
This chapter is intended to be and shall be construed as consistent with the
reservation of local authority contained in the 25th Amendment to the State
Constitution granting cities Home Rule powers. To such end any limitation on
the power of the City contained herein is to be strictly construed and the City
reserves to itself the right to exercise all power and authority to regulate
and control its local affairs and all ordinances and regulations of the City
shall be enforceable against the holder of any franchise, license, or lease.
154.16   NEW TECHNOLOGIES.
Should, within the term of any franchise, license, or lease, developments
within the field for which the grant was made offer to the holder thereof the
opportunity to effectively, efficiently and economically serve its customers
through use of a substance or material other than those for which the grant was
originally made, then the holder of the franchise, license, or lease may
petition the Council which, with such requirements or limitation as it deems
necessary to protect public health, safety, and welfare, may allow the use of
such substances under the terms and conditions of the franchise, license, or
lease.

160.02   STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSE.
   1.   Statutory Authority. The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in
Chapter 414, Code of Iowa, as amended, delegated the power to cities to enact
zoning regulations to secure safety from flood and to promote health and the
general welfare.
   2.   Findings of Fact.
      A.   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community.
      B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by:
         (1)   The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood
damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately
elevated or otherwise protected from flooding; and
         (2)   The cumulative effect of obstructions on the floodplain causing
increases in flood heights and velocities.
      C.   This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
   3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort, and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Section
160.02(2)(A) with provisions designed to:
      A.   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows
so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
      B.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
      C.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
      D.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
      E.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   1.   Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter shall
apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City which are located within
the boundaries of the Floodplain (Overlay) District as established in Section
160.05.
   2.   Establishment of Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) for Clinton County and Incorporated Areas, City of DeWitt,
Panel(s) 19045C0450E, dated July 22, 2020, which were prepared as part of the
Flood Insurance Study for Clinton County are hereby adopted by reference and
declared to be the Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The Clinton County Flood
Insurance Study is hereby adopted by reference and is made a part of this
chapter for the purpose of administering floodplain management regulations.
   3.   Rules for Interpretation of Floodplain (Overlay) District. The
boundaries of the Floodplain (Overlay) District areas shall be determined by
scaling distances on the official Flood Insurance Rate Map. When an
interpretation is needed as to the exact location of a boundary, the
Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The Board of Appeals
shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any
requirement, decision, or determination made by the Administrator in the
enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   4.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used, and no
structure shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered,
without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
   5.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
   6.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
   7.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated Floodplain (Overlay) District areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create
liability on the part of the City, or any officer or employee thereof, for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
   8.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.

160.05   ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING (OVERLAY) DISTRICTS.
The floodplain areas within the jurisdiction of this chapter are hereby divided
into the following districts:
   1.   Floodplain (Overlay) District – those areas identified as Zone A on the
Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The boundaries shall be as shown on the
Official Floodplain Zoning Map. Within these districts, all uses not allowed as
permitted uses are prohibited unless a variance to the terms of this chapter is
granted after due consideration by the Board of Appeals.
160.06   STANDARDS FOR FLOODPLAIN (OVERLAY) DISTRICT.
   1.   Permitted Uses.
      A.   All development within the Floodplain District shall be permitted to
the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance (or underlying
zoning district) and provided they meet applicable performance standards of the
Floodplain District.
      B.   Any development which involves placement of structures, factory-
built homes, fill or other obstructions, storage of materials or equipment,
excavation, or alteration of a watercourse shall be reviewed by the Department
of Natural Resources to determine:
         (1)   Whether the land involved is either wholly or partly within the
floodway or floodway fringe; and
         (2)   The base flood elevation.
The applicant shall be responsible for providing the Department of Natural
Resources with sufficient technical information to make the determination.
      C.   Review by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources is not required
for the proposed construction of new or replacement bridges or culverts where:
         (1)   The bridge or culvert is located on a stream that drains less
than two square miles, and
         (2)   The bridge or culvert is not associated with a channel
modification that constitutes a channel change as specified in 567-71.2(2),
Iowa Administrative Code.
   2.   Performance Standards. All development must be consistent with the need
to minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance
standards. Where base flood elevations and floodway data have not been provided
in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be
contacted to compute such data. The applicant will be responsible for providing
the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to
make such determination. All development shall:
      A.   Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement.
      B.   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
      C.   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant

   3.   Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the base flood elevation. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed subject to favorable
consideration by the Board of Appeals   where existing topography, street
grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods
used must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various
forces and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential structures
located in areas that would become isolated due to flooding of surrounding
ground shall be provided with a means of access that will be passable by
wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this criterion shall not apply
where the Administrator determines there is sufficient flood warning time for
the protection of life and property. When estimating flood warning time,
consideration shall be given to the criteria listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa
Administrative Code.
   4.   Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level. When
floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State
shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to withstand the
flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact, uplift forces, and other factors
associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the base flood
elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water. A record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in
relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
   5.   All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
      A.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
         (1)   A minimum of two openings, with positioning on at least two
walls, having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
         (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one-foot
above grade.
         (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, and
low damage potential storage.
      B.   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
      C.   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
electric meter, electrical service panel box, hot water heater, heating, air
conditioning, ventilation equipment (including ductwork), and other similar
machinery and equipment elevated (or, in the case of nonresidential structures,
optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation.
      D.   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
plumbing, gas lines, water meters, gas meters, and other similar service
utilities either elevated (or in the case of nonresidential structures,
optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation or designed to be watertight and withstand inundation to such a
level.
   6.   Factory-Built Homes.
      A.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the structure
is a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation.
      B.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Anchorage systems
may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to
ground anchors as required by the State Building Code.
   7.   Utility and Sanitary Systems.
      A.   On-site wastewater disposal and water supply systems shall be
located or designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the
system during flooding.
      B.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system as well as
the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment facilities
(other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood protection
equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood elevation.
      C.   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water
supply treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with
a level of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood
elevation.
      D.   Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
   8.   Storage of Equipment and Materials. Storage of materials and equipment
that are flammable, explosive, or injurious to human, animal, or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or:
      A.   Not be subject to major flood damage and be anchored to prevent
movement due to flood waters; or
      B.   Be readily removable from the area within the time available after
flood warning.
   9.   Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as
levees, flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the base
flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for
adequate interior drainage. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources
shall approve structural flood control works.
   10.   Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must
be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources must
approve such alterations or relocations.
   11.   Subdivisions. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and
subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the base flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50 lots
(whichever is less) shall include base flood elevation data for those areas
located within the Floodplain (Overlay) District.
   12.   Accessory Structures to Residential Uses.
      A.   Detached garages, sheds, and similar structures that are incidental
to a residential use are exempt from the base flood elevation requirements
where the following criteria are satisfied:
         (1)   The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential. Its size shall not exceed 600 square feet in size. Those portions of
the structure located less than one foot above the base flood elevation must be
constructed of flood-resistant materials.
         (2)   The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage
potential purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure
shall not be used for human habitation.
         (3)   The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building
site so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
         (4)   The structure shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement which may result in damage to other structures.
         (5)   The structure’s service facilities such as electrical and
heating equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above
the base flood elevation.
         (6)   The structure’s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of Section
160.06(5)(A).
      B.   Exemption from the base flood elevation requirements for such a
structure may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of
the structure and its contents.
   13.   Recreational Vehicles.
      A.   Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of Section
160.06(6) regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built homes when the
following criteria are satisfied.
         (1)   The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less
than 180 consecutive days, and
         (2)   The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
      B.   Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than 180
consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements of
Section
160.06(6) regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built homes.
   14.   Pipeline Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be
buried in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to
prevent rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
   15.   Maximum Damage Potential Development. All new or substantially
improved maximum damage potential development shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated a minimum of one foot above the elevation of the
500-year flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be
floodproofed to such a level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional
engineer registered in the State shall certify that the floodproofing methods
used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact,
uplift forces, and other factors associated with the two-tenths percent annual
chance flood; and that the structure, below the two-tenths percent annual
chance flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator. Where a
two-tenths percent chance flood elevation data has not been provided in the
Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be
contacted to compute such data. The applicant will be responsible for providing
the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to
make such determinations.
160.07   APPOINTMENT AND DUTIES OF BOARD OF APPEALS.
   1.   Appointment and Duties of Board of Appeals. A Board of Appeals is
hereby established which shall hear and decide:
      A.   Appeals; and
      B.   Requests for variances to the provisions of this chapter, and shall
take any other action which is required of the Board.
   2.   Appeals. Where it is alleged that there is any error in any order,
requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in
the enforcement of this chapter, the aggrieved party may appeal such action.
The notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board of Appeals and with the
official from whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason
for the appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to
the Board of Appeals all the documents constituting the record upon which the
action appealed from was taken.
   3.   Variance. The Board of Appeals may authorize upon request in specific
cases such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary
hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.
      A.   Variances shall only be granted upon:
         (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (3)   A determination that the granting of the variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local codes or ordinances.
      B.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      C.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for structures than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that:
         (1)   The issuance of a variance will result in increased premium
rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of
insurance coverage; and
         (2)   Such construction increases risks to life and property.
      D.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
   4.   Hearings and Decisions of the Board of Appeals.
      A.   Hearings. Upon the filing with the Board of an appeal or a request
for a variance, the Board shall hold a public hearing. The Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the hearing and give public notice thereof, as well as due
notice to parties in interest. At the hearing, any party may appear in person
or by agent or attorney and present written or oral evidence. The Board may
require the appellant or applicant to provide such information as is reasonably
deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance or evaluation of a
professional engineer or other expert person or agency, including the
Department of Natural Resources.
      B.   Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal or
variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an appeal, the Board may, so
long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter,
reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in
writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision.
In granting a variance, the Board shall consider such factors as contained in
this section and all other relevant sections of this chapter and may prescribe
such conditions as contained in Section
160.09(4)(B)(2).
         (1)   Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board Shall Be Based. In
passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all relevant
factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
            a.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights
or velocities caused by encroachments.
            b.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
            c.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the
ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary
conditions.
            d.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            e.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the City.
            f.   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
            g.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to
flooding for the proposed use.
            h.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing
development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
            i.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for the area.
            j.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            k.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.
            l.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer,
gas, electrical, and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
            m.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
chapter.
         (2)   Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the
factors listed above, the Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such
conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
            a.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
            b.   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
            c.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed
restrictions.
            d.   Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this chapter.
            e.   Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the
flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration,
rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated
with the regulatory flood. The Board shall require that the applicant submit a
plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
   5.   Appeals to the Court. Any person or persons, jointly or severally,
aggrieved by any decision of the Board may present to a court of record a
petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole
or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be
presented to the court within 30 days after the filing of the decision in the
office of the Board.
160.08   NONCONFORMING USES.
   1.   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful
before the passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but
which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be
continued subject to the following conditions:
      A.   If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any future
use of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
      B.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
      C.   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless
it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
State or local health, sanitary, building, or safety codes or regulations, or
the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
designation.
   2.   Except as provided in Section
160.08(1)(B), any use which has been permitted as a variance shall be
considered a conforming use.
160.09   PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with grants of variances) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any
person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its
requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $500.00 or
imprisoned for not more than 30 days. Each day such violation continues shall
be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the
City from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy
violation.
160.10   AMENDMENTS.
The regulations and standards set forth in this chapter may from time to time
be amended, supplemented, changed, or repealed. No amendment, supplement,

effective for a period of 365 days from the date of issuance or renewal.
162.06   VACANT BUILDING PERMIT CONDITIONS.
All permits issued are subject to all other applicable conditions of the Code
of Ordinances and the following additional conditions:
   1.   Consent to Entry. All applicants and owners holding a permit consent to
the entry of duly authorized officials of the City at all reasonable hours and
upon reasonable notice for the purpose of inspection. A key box, or Knox Box
shall be required for all commercial buildings. Refusal to consent to entry
shall be a violation of this chapter. In addition to issuing a municipal
infraction citation in the event of refusal, the City may file a complaint
under oath to any Court of competent jurisdiction and said Court shall
thereupon issue its order authorizing the appropriate person to enter such
establishment to inspect.
   2.   Consent to Emergency Inspections and Emergency Repairs. All applicants
and owners holding a permit consent to the entry of duly authorized officials
of the City if such official has reason to believe that an emergency situation
exists with respect to the building or structure that tends to create an
imminent hazard to health, welfare, or safety of the general public. Such
official may enter the building to inspect the premises, without notifying the
responsible party or obtaining a warrant. If such official finds an emergency
situation exists in fact, which presents an imminent hazard to the health,
welfare, or safety of the general public, then such official may cause any
reasonable action, including the employment of necessary labor and materials,
to perform emergency repairs to alleviate the hazard. City employees will
confer with legal counsel prior to entering or causing entry to be made to
premises and/ or performing any emergency repairs without prior owner
notification and consent. Costs incurred in the performance of emergency
repairs may be paid by the City and if so paid, the City may levy a special
assessment against the property to recover the costs.
   3.   Cooperation by Owner or Responsible Person. All owners holding a permit
or responsible persons identified in a permit application shall cooperate with
and facilitate inspections of the premises at reasonable times pursuant to
reasonable notice to determine compliance with the requirements of this
chapter. Obstructing a duly authorized inspection, including refusing entry or
access to portions of the building subject to the permit, shall be a violation
of this chapter. The owner shall notify the Building Inspector within 30
business days of any changes to the contact information of the owner or
responsible person.
   4.   Continued Compliance. For the Vacant Building Permit to remain valid,
the building or structure subject to the permit shall continue to comply with

Section
162.02(1), a building owner must complete a Vacant Building Registration Form,
which serves as an application for a Vacant Building Permit.
   1.   There is no charge for the initial inspection as long as the building
is in compliance with all applicable building codes.
   2.   If the building upon the initial inspection is noncompliant with
Chapter 162 necessitating an additional inspection, the building owner or
representative shall pay an inspection fee.
   3.   Upon completion of the inspection, the building owner or representative
shall remedy as ordered. If no repairs are necessary, the permit is valid for
one year from the inspection, at which time the inspection process begins again
with the Vacant Building Permit Application being due annually thereafter.
   4.   If the inspection results in necessary repairs being ordered, a
reinspection will be conducted in accord with the provisions of this chapter.
   5.   In the case of a necessary reinspection, the annual permit shall begin
on that date that the ordered repairs are verified by the Building Official or
designee, and the building is in compliance with all applicable building codes.

first reinspection to determine compliance with an order for corrective action
issued hereunder. There shall be no reinspection fee if the inspection
indicates full compliance, or for a reinspection occurring during the period of
an approved time extension granted for good cause and involving a good faith
effort on the part of the property owner to comply with the order.
      B.   Failure to pay reinspection fees within 30 days of mailing an
invoice to the property owner of record shall constitute a violation of this
chapter for which a municipal infraction citation may be issued.
   4.   Violations.
      A.   Any violation of a provision of this chapter is a municipal
infraction for which a municipal infraction citation may be issued. Each day
that the violation continues shall constitute a separate violation for which a
municipal infraction citation may be issued.
      B.   Abatement of Violations. The issuance of a municipal infraction
citation shall not preclude the City Attorney from instituting appropriate
action to restrain, correct, or abate a violation, or to prevent illegal

CHAPTER 163
SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS
 
163.01 Purpose     163.03 Permitted Accessory Use
163.02 Definitions 163.04 Principal Uses
163.01   PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to allow safe, effective, and efficient use of
solar energy conversion systems, and to identify the locations within the City
where they may not be installed.
163.02   DEFINITIONS.
For purposes of this chapter, the following terms are defined:
   1.   “Solar energy system” means a device, array of devices, or structural
design feature, the purpose of which is to provide for generation of
electricity, the collection, storage, and distribution of solar energy for
space heating or cooling, daylight for interior lighting, or water heating.
Installation types are:
      A.   “Building-integrated” means an integral part of a principal or
accessory building. Building-integrated systems include, but are not limited
to, photovoltaic or hot water systems that are contained within roofing
materials, windows, skylights, and awnings.
      B.   “Ground-mount” means a solar energy system mounted on a rack or pole
that rests on or is attached to the ground. Ground-mount systems can be either
accessory or principal uses.
      C.   “Roof-mount” means a solar energy system mounted on a rack that is
fastened to or ballasted on a building roof. Roof-mount systems can be either
accessory or principal uses.
      D.   “Parallel roof-mount” means a roof-mount solar energy system in
which the solar panels are installed parallel to the roof underneath and no
more than 12” from the surface of the roof. A parallel roof-mount system must
not extend beyond the roof surface underneath it.
      E.   “Wall-mount” means a solar energy system mounted on the side of a
principal or accessory building usually, but not always, for the purpose of
providing direct supplemental space heating by heating and recirculating
conditioned building air.
   2.   “Solar farm” means a commercial facility that converts sunlight into
electricity by means of photovoltaics (PV) for the primary purpose of wholesale
sales of generated electricity. A solar farm is the principal land use for the
parcel on which it is located.
   3.   “Solar garden” means a commercial solar-electric (photovoltaic) array
that provides retail electric power (or a financial proxy for retail power) to
multiple households or businesses residing or located off-site from the
location of the solar energy system. A community solar system/solar garden is a
principal use.
   4.   “Solar resource” means a view of the sun from a specific point on a lot
or building that is not obscured by any vegetation, building, or object for a
minimum of four hours between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. Standard
Time on all days of the year.
   5.   “Solar access” means unobstructed access to direct sunlight on a lot or
building through the entire year, including access across adjacent parcel air
rights, for the purpose of capturing direct sunlight to operate a solar energy
system.
163.03   PERMITTED ACCESSORY USE.
Solar energy systems shall be allowed as an accessory use in all zoning
classifications where structures of any sort are allowed, subject to certain
requirements as set forth below.
   1.   Height. Solar energy systems must meet the following height
requirements:
      A.   Building- or roof-mounted solar energy systems shall not exceed the
maximum allowed height of a structure in any zoning district.
      B.   Ground- or pole-mounted solar energy systems shall not exceed 12
feet in height when oriented at maximum tilt.
   2.   Set-back. Solar energy systems must meet the accessory structure
setback requirements for the zoning district and primary land use associated
with the lot on which the system is located and shall only be located in rear
yards.
      A.   Roof or Building-Mount Solar Energy Systems. In addition to the
building setback, the collector surface and mounting devices for roof-mounted
solar energy systems shall not extend beyond the exterior perimeter of the
building on which the system is mounted or built, unless the collector and
mounting system has been explicitly engineered to safely extend beyond the
edge, and setback standards are not violated. Exterior piping for solar hot
water systems shall be allowed to extend beyond the perimeter of the building
on a back yard exposure. Solar collectors mounted on the sides of buildings and
serving as awnings are considered to be building-integrated systems and are
regulated as awnings.
      B.   Ground-Mount Solar Energy Systems. Ground-mounted solar energy
systems may not extend into the side yard or rear setback when oriented at
minimum design tilt, except as otherwise allowed for building mechanical
systems.
   3.   Location and Visibility.

integrated and wall-mount solar energy systems shall be allowed regardless of
whether the system is visible from the public right-of-way, provided the
building component in which the system is integrated or mounted meets all
required setback, land use, and performance standards for the district in which
the building is located. The color of the solar collectors is not required to
be consistent with other building materials.
      B.   Roof-Mount Solar Energy Systems. Roof-mount solar energy systems
shall not be restricted for aesthetic reasons if the system is not visible from
the closest edge of any public right-of-way other than an alley. Roof-mounted
systems that are visible from the nearest edge of the street frontage right-of-
way shall not have the highest finished pitch steeper than the roof pitch on
which the system is mounted, and shall be no higher than 12 inches above the
roof. The color of the solar collectors is not required to be consistent with
other roofing materials.
      C.   Ground-Mount Solar Energy Systems. Except as indicated in other
parts of this chapter, ground-mount solar energy systems shall be treated as an
accessory structure and shall be subject to the requirements of an accessory
structure. In particular, a ground-mount solar energy system shall not be
located in the required front yard or side yard of a lot.
      D.   Reflectors. No solar energy system using an external reflector to
enhance solar production shall be installed within the City limits.
   4.   Coverage. Roof- or building-mount solar energy systems, excluding
building-integrated systems, shall allow for adequate roof access for fire-
fighting purposes to the south-facing or flat roof upon which the panels are
mounted. Ground-mount systems shall be exempt from impervious surface
calculations if the soil under the collector is maintained in vegetation and is
not compacted. Foundations, gravel, and compacted soils are considered
impervious.
   5.   Historic Buildings. Solar energy systems on historically designated
buildings shall be installed only as allowed by the U.S. Department of
Interior.
   6.   Plan Approvals.
      A.   Building-Integrated Systems: No approvals by the City shall be
required for building-integrated systems beyond the normal building permit
process.
      B.   Wall-Mount, Parallel Roof-Mount and Roof-Mount Systems on Flat

certification of adequate roof load capacity for the proposed system. All wall-
mount solar energy systems, parallel roof-mount solar energy systems, or roof-
mount solar energy systems on flat roofs shall require a City building permit.
      C.   Non-Parallel Roof-Mount and Ground-Mount Systems. Non-parallel roof-
mount and ground-mount systems shall require a building permit, as described in
Chapter 155.
         (1)   Plan applications for non-parallel roof-mounted systems shall
indicate the height of the highest point on the solar collector relative to the
roof directly under that point, along with drawings showing the location of the
system on the building.
         (2)   Plan applications for ground-mount systems shall indicate the
location of solar energy system on the parcel, the lot lines, and the set-backs
required. In addition, they shall indicate the height of the installation at
maximum tilt and the ground footprint at minimum tilt, along with a description
of the ground cover to be used under the system.
   7.   Approved Solar Components. Electric solar energy system components must
have a UL or equivalent listing and solar hot water systems must have an SRCC
rating.

163.04   PRINCIPAL USES.
    1.   Solar Garden. The City permits the development of community solar
gardens, subject to the following standards and requirements:
      A.   Rooftop Solar Gardens. Subject to the requirements of Section
163.02(4), rooftop solar gardens are a special use in all districts, and will
require approval by the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
      B.   Ground-Mount Solar Gardens. Ground-mount community solar energy
systems must be less than two acres in total size, and are a special use in all
districts, and will require approval by the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
      C.   Interconnection. An interconnection agreement must be in place with
the local electric utility before work commences on installation of a solar
garden.
      D.   Dimensional Standards. All structures must comply with set-back,
height, and coverage limitations for the district in which the system is
located.
      E.   Site Security. A solar garden located wholly or partly within the
City limits must be completely surrounded by a chain link fence at least six
feet high. All gates must be locked at all times unless personnel are on site.
All components must be located at least four feet from the fence.
      F.   Other Standards. Ground-mount systems must comply with all required
standards for structures in the district in which the system is located.
      G.   Ground Cover. The City encourages (but does not require) owners of
ground-mount solar gardens to plant the land underneath the solar collectors in
pollinator friendly wildflowers. Such plantings must be maintained in such a
way that they do not go to weeds or become predominately grass, but afford
passers-by a predominantly flower view during blooming season. Such plantings
shall be considered flower beds and shall be exempt from the mowing
requirements of
Chapter 58. If wildflowers are not planted, the land underneath the collectors
must be neatly maintained in compliance with
Chapter 58 of the Code of Ordinances.
      H.   Building Permit. Development of a solar garden inside the City
limits requires the issuance of a building permit, according to the process
detailed in
Chapter 155.
      I.   Decommissioning. The City requires that, as part of the construction
permit application, a decommissioning plan shall be submitted to ensure that
the facilities are properly removed after their useful life. Decommissioning of
the solar garden must occur in the event it (or a majority part of it) is not
in use for 12 consecutive months. The plan shall include provisions for removal
of all structures and foundations, restoration of the soil and vegetation, and
a plan ensuring financial resources will be available to fully decommission the
site. Disposal of the solar panels, racks, and foundations must meet state
requirements applicable at the time of decommissioning. The City may require
the posting of a bond, letter of credit, or the establishment of an escrow
account to ensure proper decommissioning.
   2.   Solar Farm: The City permits the development of solar farms, subject to
the following standards and requirements:
      A.   Development. A solar farm may be developed only on land zoned A-1
(Agricultural) at the time of the development. Solar Farms are a special use,
and will require approval by the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
      B.   Stormwater and NPDES. If the City has stormwater management, erosion
or sediment control provisions, or NPDES permit requirements at the time of the
development, solar farms shall be subject to those requirements.
      C.   Ground Cover and Buffer Areas. Ground around and under solar arrays
and in project buffer areas shall be planted and maintained in perennial
vegetated ground cover, and meet the following standards:
         (1)   Topsoils shall not be removed during development, unless part of
a remediation effort.
      D.   Soils shall be planted and maintained in perennial vegetation to
prevent erosion, manage run off, and build soil. Seeds may include a mix of
grasses and wildflowers, but shall be predominantly wildflowers, ideally native
to the region that will result in a short stature prairie with a diversity of
forbs or flowering plants that bloom throughout the growing season. Blooming
shrubs may be used in buffer areas as appropriate for visual screening. Seed
mixes and maintenance practices should be consistent with recommendations made
by qualified natural resource professionals such as those from the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources, Clinton County Soil and Water Conservation
Service, or the Natural Resource Conservation Service. Plant material must not
have been treated with systemic insecticides, particularly neonicontinoids.
Such plantings must be maintained in such a way that they do not go to weeds or
become predominantly grass, but afford passers-by a predominantly flower view
during blooming season. Such plantings shall be considered flower beds and
shall be exempt from the mowing requirements of
Chapter 58. If wildflowers are not planted, the land underneath the collectors
must be neatly maintained in compliance with
Chapter 58.
      E.   Foundations. A qualified engineer shall certify that the foundation
and design of the solar panels’ racking and support is within accepted
professional standards, given local soil and climate conditions.
      F.   Other Standards and Codes. All solar farms shall be in compliance
with all applicable local, State, and federal regulatory codes, including the
State Uniform Building Code, as amended; and the National Electric Code, as
amended.
      G.   Power and Communication Lines. Power and communication lines running
between banks of solar panels and to nearby electric substations or
interconnections with buildings shall be buried underground. Exemptions may be
granted by the City in instances where shallow bedrock, water courses, or other
elements of the natural landscape interfere with the ability to bury lines, or
distance makes undergrounding infeasible, at the discretion of the City’s
consulting engineer.
      H.   Site Security. A solar farm located wholly or partly within the City
limits must be completely surrounded by a chain link fence at least six feet
high. All gates must be locked at all times unless personnel are on site. All
components must be located at least four feet from the fence.
      I.   Site Plan Required. A detailed site plan for both existing and
proposed conditions must be submitted, showing location of all solar arrays,
other structures, property lines, rights-of-way, service roads, floodplains,
wetlands and other protected natural resources, topography, electric equipment,
and all other characteristics requested by the City. The site plan shall also
show all zoning districts.
      J.   Aviation Protection. For solar farms located within 500 feet of an
airport or within approach zones of an airport, the applicant must complete and
provide the results of the Solar Glare Hazard Analysis Tool (SGHAT) for the
Airport Traffic Control Tower cab and final approach paths, consistent with the
Interim Policy, FAA Review of Solar Energy Projects on Federally Obligated
Airports, or most recent version adopted by the FAA.
      K.   Agricultural Protection. Solar farms must comply with site
assessment or soil identification standards that are intended to protect
agricultural soils.
      L.   Decommissioning. A decommissioning plan shall be required to ensure
that facilities are properly removed after their useful life. Decommissioning
of the installation must occur in the event that a majority of the solar panels
are not in use for 12 consecutive months. The plan shall include provisions for
removal of all structures and foundations, restoration of soil and vegetation,
and a plan ensuring financial resources will be available to fully decommission
the site. Disposal of the solar panels, racks, and foundations must meet State
requirements applicable at the time of decommissioning. The City shall require
the posting of a bond, letter of credit, or the establishment of an escrow
account to ensure proper decommissioning.

This chapter may be known and cited as the “Subdivision Ordinance” of the City.
170.02   PURPOSE.
To encourage orderly community development and provide for the regulation and
control of the extension of public services and utilities, the improvement of
land, and the design of subdivisions, consistent with the approved
Comprehensive Plan and other specific community plans and the standards set
forward in the Zoning Ordinance by providing minimum standards for the design,
development, and improvement of all new subdivision and re-subdivision of land,
so that adequate provisions are made for said public facilities and services,
and so that growth occurs in an orderly manner consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan, and to promote the public health, safety, and general
welfare of the citizens of the City.
170.03   APPLICATION/GENERAL JURISDICTION.
It is unlawful for any person being the owner, agent of person having control
of any land within the corporate limits of the City or, pursuant to Section
354.9, Code of Iowa, within two miles outside those limits, to create a
subdivision or replat of a lot in an existing subdivision unless by plat, in
accordance with the regulations contained herein. Such plat shall be submitted
to the Council for approval or disapproval in accordance with the procedures
contained herein. No plat shall be recorded and no lots shall be sold from such
plat unless and until approved and all public lands and rights dedicated to the
City, or other appropriate jurisdiction within the extraterritorial limit, as
required.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 354)
   1.   The sale or exchange of small parcels of land to or between adjoining
property owners, where such sale or exchange does not create additional
building lots or creates lots that are nonconforming with respect to this and
other City ordinances, shall not be considered a subdivision of land.
   2.   Any landowner within the City or within the unincorporated areas of the
County, within two miles of the limits thereof, who may hereafter establish or
dedicate a road, highway, street, or alley through a tract of land, regardless
of area, shall submit a subdivision plat to the City in accordance with this
chapter. The use of eminent domain to establish or create said road, highway,
street, or alley shall not require the owner to submit a subdivision plat.
170.04   FEES ESTABLISHED.
The application shall be accompanied by a certified check or money order
payable to the City. For a Preliminary Plat the amount is $100.00. For a Final
Plat the amount is $75.00. The purpose of this fee is to cover the cost of
checking and verifying the proposed plat. Additional engineering fees incurred
by the City for review of the plats and the cost of any engineering inspection
for acceptance of physical improvements shall be paid by the subdivider. No
plat for any subdivision or re-subdivision shall be considered filed with the
Clerk, unless and until said plat is accompanied by the fee.

170.06   GENERAL PROCEDURES.
The general procedures relative to the platting process are described below.
Appendix A contains progress checklists and routing flow charts.
   1.   Pre-submission of Plans. Prior to the submission of a preliminary plat,
each subdivider of land shall confer with the City or City officials in order
to become thoroughly familiar with the City Comprehensive Plan and with any
municipal regulations affecting the area to be subdivided. At this time
subdividers are invited to submit to the City studies or sketches which may be
helpful in discussing the preparation of a preliminary plat.
   2.   Preliminary Plats. A preliminary plat is required for any subdivision
that requires the extension of services by the City or potentially impacts the
implementation of the City Comprehensive Plan. Where an area being platted is
part of a larger parcel all of which is not to be platted at this time, the
preliminary plat should address the general circulation and drainage from the
entire property and provide for service extensions to the edge of the area to
be incorporated in a final plat and provisions for future services. Street
circulation shall be designed to ensure access throughout the subdivision.
   3.   Final Plats. Final plats represent the legal division of land from
which lots are sold. The procedures and checklists for final platting are
included in Appendix A to this chapter.
170.07   IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.
The subdivider shall, at the subdivider’s expense, install and construct all
improvements required by this chapter. All required improvements shall be
installed and constructed in accordance with the design standards established
for such improvements by the City, and as shown on the approved preliminary
plat.
170.08   INSPECTION.
All improvements shall be inspected to ensure compliance with the requirements
of this chapter. The cost of such inspection shall be paid by the subdivider
and shall be the actual cost of inspection to the City.
170.09   MINIMUM IMPROVEMENTS.
The improvements set forth in this section shall be considered the minimum
improvements necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.
   1.   Streets. The subdivider of land being subdivided shall provide the
grading of the entire street right-of-way or alley and provide appropriate
paving, including curb and gutter on all streets. All streets or alleys shall
be of such width and shall be so constructed as to meet the standards of the
City. Subdivisions adjacent to existing unimproved streets shall provide for
curbs, sidewalks, drainage, and other improvements that may be required,
provided that the final street grade can be reasonably determined and said
improvements can be provided in a logical way.
   2.   Sanitary Sewer System.
      A.   The subdivider of the land being platted shall make adequate
provision for the disposal of sanitary sewage from the platted area, and
unserved abutting parcels, with due regard being given to present or reasonably
foreseeable needs. There shall be constructed, at the subdivider’s expense, a
sanitary sewer system including all necessary pumping stations, pumping
equipment, manholes, and all other necessary or desirable appurtenances to
provide for the discharge of sanitary sewage from all lots or parcels of land
within the platted area to a connection with the City’s sanitary sewers. The
sanitary sewer system shall be constructed in accordance with the plans and
specifications of the City and at the sewer grades as approved by the City.
      B.   The City may require, as a condition for approval of the plat,
installation of a sanitary sewer that is larger than the standard eight-inch
main in order to meet the needs of the platted area, but necessary to complete
the City sanitary sewer system as it relates to both the area being platted and
other areas. In such event, the City shall pay the subdivider the pre-approved
difference in cost of the pipe and installation between the larger sewer and
the diameter of sewer reasonable to meet the foreseeable needs of the area. The
sanitary sewer system shall, upon final approval and acceptance by the City,
become the property of the City.
   3.   Stormwater Sewer System
      A.   The subdivider shall install and construct a stormwater sewer system
adequate to serve that area, including anticipated extensions to serve
additional areas upstream. The stormwater sewer system shall be constructed in
accordance with plans and specifications of the City and at sewer grades
approved by the City. In the design phase, consideration shall be given to
alternatives and principles of the City’s stormwater management plan contained
in Chapter 101 of this Code of Ordinances.
      B.   The stormwater sewer system within the street shall be constructed
to carry the 10-year storm within the gutters and underground system and to
provide an overflow stormwater route and easement for the 100-year storm. Catch
basins shall be provided at reasonable distances to ensure the flow of the 10-
year storm within the gutters at a maximum depth of six inches.
      C.   The City may require, as a condition of approval of the plat,
installation of a stormwater sewer system, including surface drainage systems
and detention ponds, that are larger than necessary for serving the area being
platted to complete the City stormwater system as it relates to both the area
being platted and other areas. When required, the City will pay the subdivider
the pre-approved difference in cost of the pipe and installation or land and
easements, between the larger stormwater sewer and the diameter of stormwater
sewer reasonable to meet the foreseeable needs of the drainage area.
      D.   The drainage system shall, upon inspection, approval, and acceptance
by the City, become the property of the City.
   4.   Water Main System
      A.   The subdivider shall install and construct a water main system to
adequately serve all lots or parcels of land within and abutting the platted
area, with due regard to the present and reasonable foreseeable needs of the
entire area, and shall connect the same to the City’s existing water mains.
      B.   The City may require, as a condition for approval of the plat,
installation of a water main that is larger than necessary to meet the needs of
the platted area, but necessary to complete the City water distribution system
as it relates to the area being platted and other areas. The City will pay the
subdivider the pre-approved difference in cost of the pipe and installation
between the larger water main and the diameter of water main reasonable to meet
the foreseeable needs of the area platted.
      C.   The water main shall, upon inspection, approval, and acceptance by
the City, become the property of the City.
   5.   Other Improvements. The owner and subdivider of the land being platted
shall be responsible for the installation of sidewalks within the street area;
the installation of walkways as necessary; grading, seeding, or sodding of the
lots; the planting of any required trees in the parking; the installation of
street signs, and the provision of street lighting. All such improvements shall
be under the direction of the Director of Public Works.
   6.   Compliance with Other Plans. The owner and subdivider shall comply with
the Comprehensive Plan, Recreation and Open Space Plan and other approved plans
which identify the acquisition of land, require improvements, or use
restrictions.
170.10   EASEMENTS REQUIRED.
   1.   Public Utilities. Where alleys are not provided or where otherwise
required by the present or future placement of public utilities, easements of
not less than 10 feet in width shall be granted by the owner along rear, front,
or side lot lines for public utilities.
   2.   Along Streams and Watercourses. Where any stream or surface watercourse
is located in an area that is being subdivided, the subdivider shall, at the
subdivider’s own expense, make adequate provisions for the proper drainage of
surface water and shall provide and dedicate to the City an easement along said
stream or watercourse as necessary for proper maintenance of the watercourse.
No person shall place or allow to be placed an accumulation of materials,
including, but not limited to, wood, concrete, stone, brush, grass clippings,
or other debris that might block the flow of stormwater in a stormwater
drainage easement or could reasonably be expected to be carried downstream by
such stormwater to the detriment of either upstream or downstream property
owners.
170.11   MAINTENANCE BOND REQUIRED.
The owner and subdivider of the land being platted shall be required to provide
to the City proper maintenance bonds satisfactory to the City, so as to ensure
that, for a period of two years from the date of acceptance of any improvement,
the owner and subdivider shall be responsible to maintain such improvement in
good repair.
170.12   ALTERNATIVE SYSTEMS FOR SANITARY SEWER OR WATER.
Where connection to the City sanitary sewer or water systems cannot reasonably
be made, the City may approve alternate facilities for the distribution of
water or the collection and disposal of sanitary wastes. Such alternative
systems shall be designed to fully protect the public health, safety, and
welfare, and shall meet all requirements of the State, County, or other
applicable health regulations. Prior to granting approval of such alternate
systems, the City shall require that the owner and subdivider provide to the
City a waiver of assessment protest or such other legally binding documents
necessary to protect the City from the expense of the subsequent installation
of sanitary sewer and water facilities.
170.13   MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR THE DESIGN OF SUBDIVISIONS PRESCRIBED.
The standards set forth in this chapter shall be considered the minimum
standards necessary to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   1.   Land Suitability. No land shall be subdivided which is found to be
unsuitable for subdividing by reason of flooding, ponding, poor drainage,
adverse soil conditions, adverse geological formations, unsatisfactory
topography, or other conditions likely to be harmful to the public health,
safety, or general welfare, unless such unsuitable conditions are corrected to
the satisfaction of the City. If land is found to be unsuitable for subdivision
for any of the reasons cited in this subsection, the Council shall state its
reasons in writing and afford the subdivider an opportunity to present data
regarding such unsuitability. Thereafter, the Council may reaffirm, notify, or
withdraw its determination regarding such unsuitability.
   2.   Lands Subject to Flooding. No subdivision containing land located in a
floodway or a flood hazard area shall be approved by the City without the
approval of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. No lot shall be located
so as to include land located within a floodway or flood hazard area unless the
lot is of such size and shape that it will contain a buildable area not within
the floodway of flood hazard area, suitable for development as allowed by the
zoning ordinance for the zone in which the lot is located. Land located within
a flood hazard area or a floodway may be included within a plat as follows,
subject to approval of the City:
      A.   The land contour of all lots shall contain building sites with an
elevation of sufficient height to permit construction of the habitable floor of
a building one foot above a 100-year flood level.
Chapter 160 of this Code of Ordinances contains the City’s Flood Plain
Regulations.
      B.   Reserved as open space for recreation use by all owners of lots in
the subdivision, with an appropriate legal instrument approved by the City,
providing for its care and maintenance by such owners.
      C.   If acceptable to the City, dedicated to the City as public open
space for recreation and flood control purposes.
   3.   Plat to Conform to Comprehensive Plan. The arrangement, character,
extent, width, grade, and location of all streets and the general nature and
extent of the lots and uses proposed shall conform to the Comprehensive Plan of
the City and other such plans including Transportation Thoroughfare Plan,
Sanitary Sewer System Plan, Recreation and Open Space Plan and other specific
or general plans of the City.
   4.   Construction Standards for Improvements. In addition to the standards
set forth in this chapter, the City Engineer shall, from time to time, prepare
and the Council adopt by resolution, standard specifications for public
improvements. Such standard specifications for public improvements shall
contain the minimal acceptable specifications for the construction of public
improvements, giving due regard to the classification of streets or other
improvements, and the extent and character of the area served by the
improvements. Upon adoption by the Council by resolution, such standard
specifications for public improvements shall have such force and effect as if
they were fully set forth herein. The standard specifications are a separate
document on file at City Hall.
   5.   Street Standards. The following standards shall apply to all streets to
be located within the subdivision:
      A.   Streets shall provide for the continuation of major streets from
adjoining platted areas, and their extension into adjoining unplatted areas.
Where a plat encompasses the location for a major street proposed in the
Comprehensive Plan or Thoroughfare Plan, the plat shall provide for such major
street.
      B.   Street grades shall align to existing streets and all grades for
streets shall be approved by the City. The entire paving, curbing, guttering,
and sidewalks shall be to grade.
      C.   The subdivision shall be so designed as to prohibit direct access to
residential lots from arterial streets and to limit the commercial access
points so they occur at a frequency consistent with street development.
      D.   The standard width for residential streets is 31 feet back of curb
to back of curb.
      E.   Street design shall comply with the following standards:
 
                                                         Minimum Radius of

For 27-foot, 31-foot, 36-foot and 41-foot paving width, longitudinal joint
spacing for Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) shall be eight feet from back of
curb in addition to centerline. Longitudinal joint spacing requirements for PCC
paving are shown in Appendix B to this chapter.
Exception: The Commission and Council may determine a different minimum street
standard within a planned unit development based upon the applicable land use,
number of lots served, and traffic patterns within the development, or as
determined by the Comprehensive Plan and adopted by resolution as standards
pertaining to this chapter.
      F.   Half-streets are prohibited; except where an existing platted half-
street abuts the subdivision, a half-street to complete the street shall be
required.
      G.   Minor streets should be designed to discourage through traffic while
providing safe access to collector or arterial streets.
      H.   Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet shall be
prohibited, except where topography or other physical conditions make such jogs
unavoidable.
      I.   Streets shall intersect as nearly at right angles as possible, and
no street shall intersect any other street at less than 75 degrees.
      J.   At intersections of major streets, and otherwise as necessary, lot
corners abutting the intersection shall be rounded with a radius sufficient to
provide necessary space within the right-of-way for sidewalks, traffic control
devices, and other necessary improvements without encroachment onto the corner
lots.
 
Maximum Gradient Minimum Gradient Clear Sight Distance

continue past the subdivider’s property, a temporary dead end may be allowed.
Cul-de-sacs are permitted, but shall not exceed 1,000 feet in length. The
minimum interior radius for a cul-de-sac on a 27-foot to 31-foot wide street is
40 feet. The entry or exit radius is 50 feet. A diagram is provided in Appendix
C to this chapter.
      L.   When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal lots or parcels,
such lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to permit the logical location and
opening of future streets and appropriate re-subdivision with provision for
adequate utility connections for such re-subdivision. Easement for future
openings and extensions for such streets or utilities may be, at the discretion
of the Council, made a requirement of the plat.
      M.   Streets shall be named in accordance with
Chapter 139 o
      N.   The right-of-way shall be dedicated, at no cost to the City, with
street improvements to the width required provided. Additional width may be
paid by the City.
      O.   Private streets, not dedicated to the City, may be approved by the
City where adequate covenants or other legal documents ensure that the City
will not have or need to assume any maintenance or other responsibility for
such street, unless or until it is brought to full City standards required in
this chapter. In this regard building setback should accommodate the layout of
such public streets in case of future conversion.
   6.   Block and Lot Standards. The following standards shall apply to the
layout of blocks and lots in all subdivisions and, to the extent possible, in
all re-subdivisions:
      A.   No residential block shall be longer than 1,500 feet or shorter than
300 feet measured from street line to street line. The width of blocks should
be arranged so as to allow two tiers of lots with utility easements.
      B.   In blocks over 700 feet in length, the Council may require a public
way or an easement at least 10 feet in width, at or near the center of the
block for use by pedestrians.
      C.   The size and shape of blocks or lots intended for commercial or
industrial use shall be adequate to provide for the use intended and to meet
the parking, loading, and other requirements for such uses contained in the
zoning ordinance.
      D.   Lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will provide
satisfactory building sites, properly related to topography and surrounding
land uses.
      E.   The size and shape of all lots shall comply with all requirements of
the zoning ordinance for the zone in which the lot is located. Corner
residential lots shall be wider than normal in order to permit appropriate
setbacks from both streets.
      F.   All lots shall abut a public street or upon an approved private
street with a minimum frontage of at least 25 feet, measured as a straight line
between the two front corners, or in the case of flag lots, the aggregate sum
of the flags shall be sufficient to produce a minimum street right-of-way but
no less than 10 feet in width with a common access easement (i.e., total width
25 feet for a single flag lot, 40 feet for two flag lots, 50 feet for three to
five lots and 60 feet for six lots).
      G.   All lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or
radial to curved street lines, except where in the judgment of the Council, a
variation to this provision will provide a better street and lot layout.
      H.   Double frontage lots shall only be permitted where these lots abut
arterial streets and such lots shall access only on the minor street. In that
event a planting strip used for a screen, at least 20 feet in width, shall be
provided along the rear of the lot.
      I.   Any lot not to be served by a sanitary sewer system shall have
sufficient area to allow for two satisfactory drain fields. No subdivision to
be served by septic systems shall be approved by the Council until percolation
tests have been performed and the results have been provided to and reported on
by the City Engineer. Septic systems are to be permitted only where sanitary
sewer is unavailable within 500 feet and are not likely to be extended within
seven years.
   7.   Curbs and Gutters. Curbs and gutters shall be constructed by the
subdivider on both sides of all streets.
   8.   Sidewalks. The subdivider shall provide sidewalks on both sides of all
streets including cul-de-sacs, courts, or dead-end streets.
   9.   Parks and Open Space. All residential subdivisions in excess of 20
acres should be so designed as to meet the neighborhood park and open space
needs of its residents. Such needs may be met by dedication and acceptance of
public park and land and/or by reservation by covenant of private open space,
provided there shall exist sufficient covenants, running with the land, to
ensure adequate maintenance by the property owners benefiting from such open
space.
   10.   Parks and School Sites Reserved. When a tract being subdivided
includes lands proposed to be used for parks or school sites in the
Comprehensive Plan or other official plan of the City, the subdivider shall
indicate such areas on the plat and:
      A.   Proposed park sites shall be reserved for three years, giving the
City the option to purchase the land at the appraised raw land value prior to
the subdivision as established by a certified land appraiser. The purchase
price shall also include one-half of the cost for grading and paving, including
curb cuts, of the portion of any streets that are contiguous to the site and
any taxes and interest incurred by the subdivider between the date of the
reservation and date of purchase by the public agency. Should the park site not
be purchased within three years, the subdivider may then amend the final plat
and incorporate the area into the development.
      B.   Proposed school sites shall be reserved for three years, giving the
school district the option to purchase the land at the appraised raw land value
prior to the subdivision as established by a certified land appraiser. The
purchase price shall also include one-half of the cost for grading and paving
including curbs, of the portion of any streets that are contiguous to the site
and any taxes and interest incurred by the subdivider between the date of the
reservation and date of purchase by the school district. Should the school
sites not be purchased within three years, the subdivider may then amend the
final plat.
   11.   Monuments. Steel rods with proper identification of the surveyor in
accordance with the Code of Iowa, a minimum of one-half inch in diameter and 30
inches long shall be in place at all block and lot corners, all points of
curvature, all points of tangency, and all boundary corners within 30 days
after completion of the improvements.

   2.   Review Procedures - Conformance with Minimum Standards. The following
are the procedures for submission and review of a preliminary plat by the City.
The standard for development improvements are contained in this chapter and the
City’s Standard Specifications (a separate document on file at City Hall) for
materials with respect to construction of improvements.
      A.   The Clerk, upon receipt of the 20 large scale copies of the
preliminary plat, shall file one copy in the records of the City, shall retain
one copy for public inspection and shall forward the remaining copies to the
Building Official. The 20 smaller scale copies shall be forwarded to the City
Administrator.
      B.   The Building Official shall provide copies of the plat to the City
Technical Development Committee as prescribed in Appendix A of this chapter and
shall schedule the plat for consideration by the Commission.
      C.   The Commission shall examine the plat and the report of the City
Technical Development Committee (the technical committee is identified in
Appendix A) and other information as it deems necessary to ascertain whether
the plat conforms to the ordinances of the City and conforms to the
Comprehensive Plan and other duly adopted plans of the City. The Commission
shall, within 45 days of the filing of the plat with the Clerk, forward a
report and recommendation regarding the plat to the Council. If such
recommendation is to disapprove or modify the plat, the reasons therefor shall
be set forth in writing in the report, and a copy of the report and
recommendation shall be provided to the applicant.
      D.   The Council shall examine the plat, the report of the Technical
Development Committee, the report of the Commission, and such other information
as it deems necessary or desirable. Upon such examination, the Council shall
determine whether the plat conforms to the Comprehensive Plan and other duly
adopted plans of the City, and will be conducive to the orderly growth and
development of the City, in order to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare. Following such examination, the Council may approve, approve subject
to conditions, or disapprove the plat. If the decision of the Council is to
disapprove the plat or to approve subject to conditions, the reasons therefor
shall be set forth in writing in the official Council proceedings and such
decision shall be provided to the applicant. Action on the preliminary plat by
the Council shall be taken within 60 days of the filing of the plat with the
Clerk unless such time period is extended by agreement between the subdivider
and the City.
   3.   Authorization to Install Improvements, Performance Bond, or Assessment
Waiver. The developer, at the City’s discretion, has the option of installing
the improvements and then submitting the final plat or delaying the
construction of the improvements by providing a performance bond, assessment
waiver, or other similar guarantee exercisable by the City to ensure
installation of the required improvements. The approval of the preliminary plat
shall constitute authorization by the Council for the installation of
improvements as required by this chapter and as shown on the preliminary plat;
provided no such improvements shall be constructed or installed until and
unless the plans, profiles, cross-sections, and specifications of the
construction of such improvements have been submitted to and approved in
writing by the City Engineer and other regulatory bodies. If the developer
elects to install improvements after approval of the final plat, said plan
shall be approved by the City Engineer prior to final plat approval.
   4.   Revocability and Duration of Approval. Approval of the preliminary
plat, or any portion thereof not final platted, is revocable by the Commission.
      A.   If neither a part nor all of the preliminary plat is approved by the
Council as a final plat within two years after the approval of the preliminary
plat, the approval for the preliminary plat shall expire and be void unless an
extension for an additional period not to exceed five years is granted by the
Council with the advice of the Commission.
      B.   If only a part of a preliminary plat is approved as a final plat,
the approval of the remaining portion of the preliminary plat shall
automatically be extended for a period of five years from the platting date.
170.15   FINAL PLAT REQUIREMENTS.

that all improvements and installations to the subdivision required by this
section have been made or installed in accordance with the standard
specifications and this chapter; or
            a.   A performance bond or bonds with the City, which will ensure
to the City that the subdivision improvements will be completed by the
subdivider within two years after Council acceptance of the plat and a
maintenance bond or bonds, from all the subdivider’s contractors, with the City
which will ensure to the City that said improvements will be maintained in good
and suitable condition for a period of two years after Council acceptance of

required with the final plat and to assess the cost thereof against the
subdivided property in accordance with the law regarding special assessments.
However, the subdivider or property owners shall be responsible for any
difference between the cost of the improvements and the amount that can be
legally assessed by the City against the subdivided property, and they shall
furnish the necessary waivers to permit the assessment of the entire cost of
the improvement. Notwithstanding the assessment waiver, the subdivider or
property owner may elect to construct the subdivision improvements, in which
case all their contractors shall file with the City a maintenance bond as set

land to be dedicated, or the owner submits an irrevocable bond payable to the
City in an amount equal to twice the value of the encumbrance, to guarantee the
release of the encumbrance at the time the City chooses. Utility easements
shall not be construed to be encumbrances for the purpose of this section. In

   6.   Final Approval. After approval of the final subdivision plat by the
Commission, the recommendation of approval and the final plat shall be
submitted to the Council for final approval and acceptance. If the Commission
does not approve the final plat of the subdivision, the Council may approve the
plat only by a three-fourths vote of the entire membership of the Council.
Council approval of the final plat shall be by resolution. If the Council
rejects the final plat, it shall state in the Council minutes, wherein said
final plat is objectionable.
170.16   VARIANCES.
Where in the case of a particular proposed subdivision, it can be shown that
strict compliance with the requirements of this chapter would result in
extraordinary hardship to the subdivider, because of unusual topography or
other conditions, the Council may vary, modify, or waive the requirements so
that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured provided,
however, that such variance, modification, or waiver will not have the effect
of nullifying the intent and purpose of this chapter. In no case shall any
variance or modification be more than minimum easing of the requirements as
necessary to eliminate the hardship. In so granting a variance, the Council may
impose such additional conditions as are necessary to secure substantially the
objectives of the requirements so varied, modified, or waived.
170.17   RECORDING OF PLATS.
No subdivision plat, re-subdivision plat, or street dedication within the City
or within two miles of the corporate limits of the City shall be filed for
record with the County Recorder until a final plat of such subdivision, re-
subdivision, or street dedication has been reviewed and approved in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter. Upon the approval of the final plat by the
Council, it shall be the duty of the subdivider to immediately file such plat
with the County Auditor and County Recorder, as required by law. Such approval
shall be revocable after 30 days, unless such plat has been duly recorded and
evidence thereof filed with the Clerk within that period. Within 60 days
following approval of the final plat by the Council, the subdivider shall file
with the City two copies of the recorded final plat.
170.18   PENALTIES.
Any person who shall dispose of or offer for sale, except as conditioned on the
approvals required herein, any lot or lots within the area of jurisdiction of
this chapter, until the plat thereof has been approved by the Council and
recorded as required by law, shall forfeit and pay a fine not to exceed the
limits established in the Code of Iowa, for each lot or part of lot sold,
disposed of, or offered for sale. Nothing contained herein shall in any way
limit the City’s right to any other remedies available to the City for the
enforcement of this chapter.
170.19   BUILDING PERMITS DENIED.
No building permit shall be issued for construction on any lot, parcel, or
tract, where a subdivision is required by this chapter, unless and until a
final plat of such subdivision has been approved and recorded in accordance
with this chapter, and until the improvements are completed in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter.
170.20   CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.
This chapter, or any provision of this chapter, may be changed or amended from
time to time by the Council provided, however, that such changes or amendments
shall not become effective until after study and report by the Commission and
after a public hearing has been held, public notice of which shall have been
published at least once, but not less than four nor more than 20 days before
the date of the hearing.
