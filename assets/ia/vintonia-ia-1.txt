(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.1)
1.04Â Â Â INDEMNITY.
The applicant for any permit or license under this Code of Ordinances, by
making such application, assumes and agrees to pay for any injury to or death
of any person or persons whomsoever, and any loss of or damage to property
whatsoever, including all costs and expenses incident thereto, however arising

court where the action is pending, a brief statement of the alleged facts from
which the cause arose, that the City believes that the person notified is
liable to it for any judgment rendered against the City, and asking the person
to appear and defend. A judgment obtained in the suit is conclusive in any
action by the City against any person so notified, as to the existence of the
defect or other cause of the injury or damage, as to the liability of the City
to the plaintiff in the first named action, and as to the amount of the damage
or injury. The City may maintain an action against the person notified to

â€œordinanceâ€ when applied to this Code of Ordinances.
1.07Â Â Â EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY.
Whenever an officer or employee is required or authorized to do an act by a
provision of this Code of Ordinances, the provision shall be construed as

The catchlines of the several sections of this Code of Ordinances, titles,

and State law references, unless set out in the body of the section itself,
contained in this Code of Ordinances, do not constitute any part of the law and

1.10Â Â Â ALTERING CODE.
It is unlawful for any unauthorized person to change or amend, by additions or

If consent to enter upon or inspect any building, structure, or property

right to exclude, the City officer or employee having the duty to enter upon or
conduct the inspection may apply to the Iowa District Court in and for the
County, pursuant to Section 808.14 of the Code of Iowa, for an administrative
search warrant. No owner, operator or occupant, or any other person having

building, or premises shall fail or neglect, after presentation of a search
warrant, to permit entry therein by the municipal officer or employee.
1.13Â Â Â GENERAL STANDARDS FOR ACTION.
Whenever this Code of Ordinances grants any discretionary power to the Council
or any commission, board, or officer or employee of the City and does not
specify standards to govern the exercise of the power, the power shall be
exercised in light of the following standard: The discretionary power to grant,
deny, or revoke any matter shall be considered in light of the facts and
circumstances then existing and as may be reasonably foreseeable, and due
consideration shall be given to the impact upon the public health, safety and
welfare, and the decision shall be that of a reasonably prudent person under
similar circumstances in the exercise of the police power.
1.14Â Â Â STANDARD PENALTY.
Unless another penalty is expressly provided by this Code of Ordinances for
violation of any particular provision, section, or chapter, any person failing
to perform a duty required by this Code of Ordinances or otherwise violating

resolves to consider such proposal, it shall publish notice and hold a public
hearing thereon. Thereafter, at least 30 days after such hearing, the City

46.01Â Â Â CURFEW.

public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and specifically
to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults responsible for
minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors committed after
the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences and criminal
activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.

be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that responsible
adultâ€™s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful or careless

magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of

permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has

minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at such
time as the court may direct.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minorâ€™s parent, guardian or other person
legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the
law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative
of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person
who is known to the child.

that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew
ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with applicable
penalties.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Responsible Adultâ€™s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as defined
in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows the minor
to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a municipal
infraction.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Minorâ€™s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a minor,
the law enforcement officer shall give the minor a written warning, which
states that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the

penalties, or, at the law enforcement officerâ€™s discretion, may issue the minor
a citation for a first violation.

and the owner of such premises shall inform the Mayor or peace officer that a
guard dog is on duty at said premises.

1.Â Â Â In the event that a dangerous animal or vicious animal is found at large
and unattended upon public property, park property, public right-of- way or the
property of someone other than its owner, thereby creating a hazard to persons
or property, such animal may, in the discretion of the Mayor or peace officer,
be destroyed if it cannot be confined or captured. The City shall be under no
duty to attempt the confinement or capture of a dangerous animal or vicious
animal found at large, nor shall it have a duty to notify the owner of such
animal prior to its destruction.
2.Â Â Â Upon the complaint of any individual that a person is keeping, sheltering
or harboring a dangerous animal or vicious animal on premises in the City, the
Mayor or peace officer shall cause the matter to be investigated and if after
investigation, the facts indicate that the person named in the complaint is
keeping, sheltering or harboring a dangerous or vicious animal in the City, the

remove such animal from the City or destroy the animal within three days of the
receipt of such an order. Such order shall be contained in a notice to remove
the dangerous or vicious animal, which notice shall be given in writing to the
person keeping, sheltering or harboring the dangerous animal or vicious animal,
and shall be served personally or by certified mail. Such order and notice to
remove the dangerous animal or vicious animal shall not be required where such
animal has previously caused serious physical harm or death to any person, in
which case the Mayor or peace officer shall cause the animal to be immediately
seized and impounded or killed if seizure and impoundment are not possible
without risk of serious physical harm or death to any person.
3.Â Â Â The order to remove a dangerous animal or vicious animal issued by the
Mayor or peace officer may be appealed to the Council. In order to appeal such
order, written notice of appeal must be filed with the Clerk within three days
after receipt of the order contained in the notice to remove the dangerous or
vicious animal. Failure to file such written notice of appeal shall constitute
a waiver of the right to appeal the order of the Mayor or peace officer.
4.Â Â Â The notice of appeal shall state the grounds for such appeal and shall be
delivered personally or by certified mail to the Clerk. The hearing of such
appeal shall be scheduled within seven days of the receipt of the notice of
appeal. The hearing may be continued for good cause. After such hearing, the
Council may affirm or reverse the order of the Mayor or peace officer. Such
determination shall be contained in a written decision and shall be filed with
the Clerk within three days after the hearing or any continued session thereof.
5.Â Â Â If the Council affirms the action of the Mayor or peace officer, the
Council shall order in its written decision that the person owning, sheltering,
harboring or keeping such dangerous or vicious animal remove such animal from
the City or destroy it. The decision and order shall immediately be served upon
the person against whom rendered in the same manner as the notice of removal.
If the original order of the Mayor or peace officer is not appealed and is not
complied with within three days or the order of the Council after appeal is not
complied with within three days of its issuance, the Mayor or peace officer is
authorized to seize, impound or destroy such dangerous or vicious animal.
Failure to comply with an order of the Mayor or peace officer issued pursuant
to this chapter and not appealed, or of the Council after appeal, constitutes a
simple misdemeanor.

of the 10-day reclaiming period.
7.Â Â Â If it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identities
and addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders, notice by one
publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the
vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice
under Subsection 2 of this section. The published notice may contain multiple

be provided for every occupied building; except where one building stands at
the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can
be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard, or
driveway. In such cases the building sewer from the front building may be
extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer.
3.Â Â Â Installation. The installation and connection of the building sewer to the
public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the State Plumbing Code and
applicable rules and regulations of the City. All such connections shall be
made gastight and watertight. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and
materials must be approved by the Superintendent before installation.
4.Â Â Â Water Lines. When possible, building sewers should be laid at least 10
feet horizontally from a water service. The horizontal separation may be less,
provided the water service line is located at one side and at least 12 inches
above the top of the building sewer.
5.Â Â Â Size. Building sewers shall be sized for the peak expected sewage flow
from the building with a minimum building sewer size of four inches.
6.Â Â Â Alignment and Grade. All building sewers shall be laid to a straight line

12.Â Â Â Unstable Soil. No sewer connection shall be laid so that it is exposed
when crossing any watercourse. Where an old watercourse must of necessity be
crossed or where there is any danger of undermining or settlement, cast iron
soil pipe or vitrified clay sewer pipe thoroughly encased in concrete shall be
required for such crossings. Such encasement shall extend at least six inches
on all sides of the pipe. The cast iron pipe or encased clay pipe shall rest on
firm, solid material at either end.
13.Â Â Â Preparation of Basement or Crawl Space. No connection for any residence,
business or other structure with any sanitary sewer shall be made unless the
basement floor is poured, or in the case of a building with a slab or crawl
space, unless the ground floor is installed with the area adjacent to the
foundation of such building cleared of debris and backfilled. The backfill
shall be well compacted and graded so that the drainage is away from the
foundation. Prior to the time the basement floor is poured, or the first floor
is installed in buildings without basements, the sewer shall be plugged and the
plug shall be sealed by the Superintendent. Any accumulation of water in any
excavation or basement during construction and prior to connection to the
sanitary sewer shall be removed by means other than draining into the sanitary

as defined herein.
11.Â Â Â Noxious or Malodorous Gases. Any noxious or malodorous gas or other
substance that, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, is capable
of creating a public nuisance or hazard to life or of preventing entry into
sewers for their maintenance and repair.
12.Â Â Â Damaging Substances. Any waters, wastes, materials, or substances that
react with water or wastes in the sewer system to release noxious gases,
develop color of undesirable intensity, form suspended solids in objectionable
concentration or create any other condition deleterious to structures and
treatment processes.
13.Â Â Â Untreatable Wastes. Waters or wastes containing substances that are not
amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed,
or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment
plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having
jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.
97.05Â Â Â RESTRICTED DISCHARGES; POWERS OF SUPERINTENDENT.
If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the
public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in Section
97.04 and which in the judgment of the Superintendent may have a deleterious
effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or
which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the
Superintendent may:
1.Â Â Â Rejection. Reject the wastes by requiring disconnection from the public
sewage system;
2.Â Â Â Pretreatment. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for
discharge to the public sewers;
3.Â Â Â Controls Imposed. Require control over the quantities and rates of
discharge; and/or
4.Â Â Â Special Charges. Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and
treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the
provisions of
Chapter 99.
97.06Â Â Â SPECIAL FACILITIES.
If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows,
the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the Superintendent and subject to the requirements of
all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws. Where preliminary treatment or
flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be
maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at
the ownerâ€™s expense.
97.07Â Â Â CONTROL MANHOLES.
When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the ownerâ€™s
expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
97.08Â Â Â TESTING OF WASTES.
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHâ€™s are determined from
periodic grab samples).

111.03Â Â Â OTHER ORDINANCES.

the Grantee that are granted by the franchise. Neither party may unilaterally

The City shall not authorize or permit any person providing video programming
services to enter into the Cityâ€™s public ways in any part of the service area

operator not be granted an unfair competitive advantage over another, and to
provide all parties equal protection under the law.
111.05Â Â Â TERM.
The franchise granted hereunder shall be for an initial term of 15 years
commencing on the effective date of the franchise â€  , unless otherwise lawfully
terminated in accordance with the terms of this chapter.
Â 
Notes
â€â€  EDITORâ€™S NOTE: Ordinance No. 836 renewing a cable television franchise for the
  City was passed and adopted on September 27, 2001.
111.06Â Â Â CONDITIONS OF OCCUPANCY.
The cable system installed by the Grantee pursuant to the terms hereof shall be
located so as to cause a minimum of interference with the proper use of public
ways and with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who own
property that adjoins any such public ways.
111.07Â Â Â RESTORATION OF PUBLIC WAYS.
If during the course of Granteeâ€™s construction, operation or maintenance of the
cable system there occurs a disturbance of any public way by the Grantee, the
Grantee shall replace and restore such public way to a condition reasonably
comparable to the condition of the public way existing immediately prior to
such disturbance.
111.08Â Â Â RELOCATION AT REQUEST OF THE CITY.
Upon its receipt of reasonable advance notice, to be not less than five
business days, the Grantee shall protect, support, raise, lower, temporarily
disconnect, relocate in or remove from the public way any property of the
Grantee when lawfully required by the City by reason of traffic conditions,
public safety, street abandonment, freeway and street construction, change or
establishment of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, gas or water
pipes or any other type of public structures or improvements which are not used
to compete with the Granteeâ€™s services. The Grantee shall in all cases have the
right of abandonment of its property.
111.09Â Â Â RELOCATION FOR A THIRD PARTY.
The Grantee shall, on the request of any person holding a lawful permit issued
by the City, protect, support, raise, lower, temporarily disconnect, relocate
in or remove from the public way as necessary any property of the Grantee,
provided: (i) the expense of such is paid by the person benefiting from the
relocation, including, if required by the Grantee, making such payment in
advance; and (ii) the Grantee is given reasonable advance written notice to
prepare for such changes. For purposes of this subsection, â€œreasonable advance
written noticeâ€ shall be no less than 10 business days in the event of a
temporary relocation, and no less than 120 days for a permanent relocation.
111.10Â Â Â TRIMMING OF TREES AND SHRUBBERY.
The Grantee shall have the authority to trim trees or other natural growth
under the supervision of the City Street Superintendent in order to access and
maintain the cable system.
111.11Â Â Â SAFETY REQUIREMENTS.
Construction, operation and maintenance of the cable system shall be performed
in an orderly and workmanlike manner. All such work shall be performed in
substantial accordance with generally applicable federal, State and local
regulations and the National Electric Safety Code. The cable system shall not
endanger or unreasonably interfere with the safety of persons or property in
the service area.
111.12Â Â Â UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION.
In those areas of the service area where all of the transmission or
distribution facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone
communications and electric services are underground, the Grantee likewise
shall construct, operate and maintain all of its cable system underground.
Nothing contained in this section shall require the Grantee to construct,
operate and maintain underground any ground-mounted appurtenances.
111.13Â Â Â ACCESS TO OPEN TRENCHES.
The City agrees to include the Grantee in the platting process for any new
subdivision. At a minimum, the City agrees to require as a condition of issuing
a permit for open trenching to any utility or developer that: (i) the utility
or developer give the Grantee at least 10 daysâ€™ advance written notice of the
availability of the open trench; and (ii) the utility or developer provide the
Grantee with reasonable access to the open trench. The requirements of this
section shall not apply if the trench being competed will only include water
distribution facilities.
111.14Â Â Â REQUIRED EXTENSIONS OF THE CABLE SERVICE.
It isÂ the obligation of the Grantee to serve all residents in the service area
except to the extent that density of homes, adverse terrain or other factors
render providing service impracticable, technically unfeasible or economically
non-compensatory. Whenever the Grantee receives a request for cable service
from a subscriber in a contiguous unserved area where there are at least 10
residences within 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet (one-quarter cable mile) from
the portion of the Granteeâ€™s trunk or distribution cable which is to be
extended, it shall extend its cable system to such subscribers at no cost to
said subscribers for cable system extension, other than the published standard/
non-standard installation fees charged to all subscribers. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Grantee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to extend
the cable system into any portion of the service area where another operator is
providing cable service, into any annexed area which is not contiguous to the
present service area of the Grantee, or into any area which is financially or
technically infeasible due to extraordinary circumstances, such as a runway or
freeway crossing.
111.15Â Â Â SUBSCRIBER CHARGES FOR EXTENSIONS OF SERVICE.
No subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily. However, if an area does
not meet the density requirements of Section
111.14, the Grantee shall only be required to extend the cable system to
subscribers in that area if the subscribers are willing to share the capital
costs of extending the cable system. Specifically, the Grantee shall contribute
a capital amount equal to the construction cost per mile, multiplied by a
fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of residences per 1,320
cable-bearing strand feet from the Granteeâ€™s trunk or distribution cable, and
whose denominator equals 10. Subscribers who request service hereunder will
bear the remaining cost to extend the cable system on a pro rata basis. The
Grantee may require that payment of the capital contribution in aid of
construction borne by such potential subscribers be paid in advance.
Subscribers shall also be responsible for any standard/non-standard
installation charges to extend the cable system from the tap to the residence.
111.16Â Â Â CABLE SERVICE TO PUBLIC BUILDINGS.
The Grantee, upon request, shall provide without charge a standard installation
and one outlet of basic cable to those administrative buildings owned or
occupied by the City, fire stations, police stations and accredited K-12
schools, the Senior Center, Iowa Braille and Sight Saving School, the
Recreation Center and the Kirkwood Education Center if passed by its cable
system. The cable service provided shall not be distributed beyond the
originally installed outlet without authorization from the Grantee. The cable
service provided shall not be used for commercial purposes and such outlets
shall not be located in areas open to the public. The City shall take
reasonable precautions to prevent any use of the Granteeâ€™s cable system in any
manner that results in the inappropriate use thereof or any loss or damage to
the cable system. The City shall hold the Grantee harmless from any and all
liability or claims arising out of the provision and use of cable service
required by this section. The Grantee shall not be required to provide an
outlet to such buildings where a non-standard installation is required, unless
the City or building owner/occupant agrees to pay the incremental cost of any
necessary cable system extension and/or non-standard installation. If
additional outlets of basic cable are provided to such buildings, the building
owner/occupant shall pay the usual installation and service fees associated
therewith.
111.17Â Â Â EMERGENCY USE.
The Grantee provides an Emergency Alert System (EAS) and the City shall permit
only appropriately trained and authorized person to operate the EAS equipment
and shall take reasonable precautions to prevent any use of the Granteeâ€™s cable
system in any manner that results in inappropriate use thereof, or any loss or
damage to the cable system. Except to the extent expressly prohibited by law,
the City shall hold the Grantee, its employees, officers and assigns harmless
from any claims arising out of the use of the EAS, including, but not limited
to, reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees and costs.
111.18Â Â Â REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS.
If funds are available to any person using the public way for the purpose of
defraying the cost of any of the foregoing, the City shall reimburse the
Grantee in the same manner in which other persons affected by the requirement
are reimbursed. If the funds are controlled by another governmental entity, the

1.Â Â Â The Grantee shall pay to the City a franchise fee of three percent of

1.Â Â Â The City and the Grantee agree that any proceedings undertaken by the City

2.Â Â Â In addition to the procedures set forth in said Section 626(a), the City
agrees to notify the Grantee of its assessments regarding the identity of
future cable-related community needs and interests, as well as the past
performance of the Grantee under the then current franchise term. The City
further agrees that such assessments shall be provided to the Grantee promptly
so that the Grantee has adequate time to submit a proposal under Section 626(b)
of the Cable Act and complete renewal of the franchise prior to expiration of
its term.
3.Â Â Â Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this section, the
Grantee and the City agree that at any time during the term of the then current

grant a renewal thereof.
4.Â Â Â The Grantee and the City consider the terms set forth in this section to
be consistent with the express provisions of Section 626 of the Cable Act.
111.25Â Â Â CONDITIONS OF SALE.
If a renewal or extension of Granteeâ€™s franchise is denied or the franchise is
lawfully terminated, and the City either lawfully acquires ownership of the
cable system or by its actions lawfully effects a transfer of ownership of the
cable system to another party, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at the
price determined pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 627 of the
Cable Act. The Grantee and the City agree that in the case of a final
determination of a lawful revocation of the franchise, the Grantee shall be
given at least 12 months to effectuate a transfer of its cable system to a
qualified third party. Furthermore, the Grantee shall be authorized to continue
to operate pursuant to the terms of its prior franchise during this period. If,
at the end of that time, the Grantee is unsuccessful in procuring a qualified
transferee or assignee of its cable system which is reasonably acceptable to
the City, the Grantee and City may avail themselves of any rights they may have
pursuant to federal or State law. It is further agreed that the Granteeâ€™s
continued operation of its cable system during the twelve-month period shall
not be deemed to be a waiver, nor an extinguishment of, any rights of either
the City or the Grantee.
111.26Â Â Â TRANSFER OF FRANCHISE.
The Granteeâ€™s right, title or interest in the franchise shall not be sold,
transferred, assigned or otherwise encumbered, other than to an entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Grantee, without
the prior consent of the City, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. No
such consent shall be required, however, for a transfer in trust, by mortgage,
by other hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title or interest of
the Grantee in the franchise or cable system in order to secure indebtedness.
Within 30 days after receiving the request for transfer, the City shall notify
the Grantee in writing of any additional information it reasonably requires to
determine the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the transferee.

120 days after receiving such request, consent by the City shall be deemed
given.

during normal business hours and on a non-disruptive basis, as reasonably
necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of this franchise. Such notice
shall specifically reference the section of the franchise which is under
review, so that the Grantee may organize the necessary books and records for
easy access by the City. Alternatively, if the books and records are not easily
accessible at the local office of the Grantee, the Grantee may, at its sole
option, choose to pay the reasonable travel costs of the Cityâ€™s representative
to view the books and records at the appropriate location. The Grantee shall
not be required to maintain any books and records for franchise compliance
purposes longer than three years. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, the Grantee shall not be required to disclose information which
it reasonably deems to be proprietary or confidential in nature, nor disclose
books and records of any affiliate which is not providing cable service in the
service area. The City agrees to treat any information disclosed by the Grantee

hereof. The Grantee shall not be required to provide subscriber information in
violation of Section 631 of the Cable Act.

showing evidence of the coverage required by this section.

its officers, boards and employees, from and against any liability for damages
and for any liability or claims resulting from property damage or bodily injury

operation or maintenance of its cable system, provided that the City shall give
the Grantee written notice of its obligation to indemnify the City within 10
days of receipt of a claim or action pursuant to this section. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Grantee shall not indemnify the City for any damages,
liability or claims resulting from the willful misconduct or negligence of the
City.
111.32Â Â Â NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
In the event that the City believes that the Grantee has not complied with the

noncompliance.

default, such default cannot be cured within the 30-day period, initiate
reasonable steps to remedy such default and notify the City of the steps being
taken and the projected date that they will be completed.
111.34Â Â Â PUBLIC HEARING.
In the event that the Grantee fails to respond to the notice as described in
Section 111.32 pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section
111.33, or in the event that the alleged default is not remedied within 30 days
or the date projected pursuant to Section
111.33(iii) above, if it intends to continue its investigation into the
default, then the City shall schedule a public hearing. The City shall provide
the Grantee at least 10 daysâ€™ prior written notice of such hearing, which
specifies the time, place and purpose of such hearing and provide the Grantee
the opportunity to be heard.
111.35Â Â Â ENFORCEMENT.
Subject to applicable federal and State law, in the event the City, after the
hearing set forth in 111.34, determines that the Grantee is in default of any
provision of the franchise, the City may:
1.Â Â Â Seek specific performance of any provision which reasonably lends itself
to such remedy, as an alternative to damages; or
2.Â Â Â Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other equitable
relief; or
3.Â Â Â In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the
franchise, seek to revoke the franchise in accordance with Section

111.36Â Â Â REVOCATION.

111.32 â€“
111.35, the City shall give written notice to the Grantee of its intent. The
notice shall set forth the exact nature of the noncompliance. The Grantee shall
have 90 days from such notice to object in writing and to state its reasons for
such objection. In the event the City has not received a satisfactory response
from the Grantee, it may then seek termination of the franchise at a public
meeting. The City shall cause to be served upon the Grantee, at least 30 days
prior to such public meeting, a written notice specifying the time and place of
such meeting and stating its intent to revoke the franchise. At the designated
hearing, the City shall give the Grantee an opportunity to state its position
on the matter, after which it shall determine whether or not the franchise
shall be revoked. The Grantee may appeal such determination to an appropriate
court, which shall have the power to review the decision of the City de novo.
Such appeal to the appropriate court must be taken within 60 days after the
issuance of the determination of the City. The City may, at its sole
discretion, take any lawful action which it deems appropriate to enforce the
Cityâ€™s rights under the franchise in lieu of revocation of the franchise.
111.37Â Â Â FORCE MAJEURE.
The Grantee shall not be held in default under or in noncompliance with the
provisions of the franchise or suffer any enforcement or penalty relating to
noncompliance or default, where such noncompliance or alleged defaults occurred
or were caused by circumstances reasonably beyond the ability of the Grantee to
anticipate and control. This provision includes work delays caused by waiting
for utility providers to service or monitor their utility poles to which
Granteeâ€™s cable system is attached, as well as unavailability of materials and/
or qualified labor to perform the work necessary. Furthermore, the parties
hereby agree that it is not the Cityâ€™s intention to subject the Grantee to
penalties, fines, forfeitures or revocation of the franchise for violations of
the franchise where the violation was a good faith error that resulted in no or
minimal negative impact on the subscriber within the service area, or where
strict performance would result in practical difficulties and hardship to the
Grantee which outweigh the benefit to be derived by the City and/or
subscribers.
111.38Â Â Â ACTIONS OF PARTIES.
In any action by the City or the Grantee that is mandated or permitted under
the terms hereof, such party shall act in a reasonable, expeditious and timely

by the Council.

restrictions on placements or prior permission, or cooperative federal, State,

the street, a sufficient number of approved warning lights or flares, and to
keep them lighted during the entire night and to erect sufficient barricades
both at night and in the daytime to secure the same. The party or parties using

Sidewalks repaired, replaced, or installed as part of the ordinance will be
reimbursed at a rate of $750.00 per side upon approval of the City Council and

full permit fee. Any permittee holding an unexpired permit may apply for an
extension of the time within which work may commence under that permit when the
permittee is unable to commence work within the time required by this section
for good and satisfactory reasons. The building official may extend the time
for action by the permittee for a period not exceeding 180 days on written

155.15Â Â Â CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
No building or structure shall be used or occupied, and no change in the
existing occupancy classification of a building or structure or portion thereof
shall be made until the building official has issued a certificate of occupancy
therefor as provided herein. Issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall not
be construed as approval of a violation of the provisions of this chapter or of
other ordinances of the City. Certificates presuming to give authority to
violate or cancel the provisions of this chapter or other ordinances of the
City shall not be valid.
1.Â Â Â Exception.

same is completed, a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued for a
portion or portions of a building or structure prior to the completion of the
entire building or structure.
4.Â Â Â Posting. The certificate of occupancy shall be posted in a conspicuous
place on the premises and shall not be removed except by the building official.
5.Â Â Â Revocation. The building official may, in writing, suspend or revoke a
certificate of occupancy issued under the provisions of this chapter whenever

supplied, or when it is determined that the building or structure or portion
thereof is in violation of any ordinance or regulation or any of the provisions
of this chapter.

1.Â Â Â Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a just, equitable
and practicable method, to be cumulative with and in addition to any other
remedy provided by the Building Code, Housing Code or otherwise available by
law, whereby buildings or structures which from any cause endanger the life,
health, morals, property, safety or welfare of the general public or their
occupants may be required to be repaired, vacated or demolished. The purpose of
this chapter is not to create or otherwise establish or designate any
particular class or group of persons who will or should be especially protected
or benefited by the terms of this chapter.
2.Â Â Â Scope. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all dangerous or
unsafe buildings, as herein defined, which are now in existence or which may
hereafter become dangerous in the City.
3.Â Â Â Alterations, Additions and Repairs. All buildings or structures which are

such person if ordered to take possession of real property by a court.
2.Â Â Â â€œTechnically infeasibleâ€ means an alteration of a building or a facility
that has little likelihood of being accomplished because the existing
structural conditions require the removal or alteration of a load-bearing
member that is an essential part of the structural frame, or because other
existing physical or site constraints prohibit modification or addition of
elements, spaces or features which are in full and strict compliance with the
minimum requirements for new construction and which are necessary to provide

equipment or is so damaged, decayed, dilapidated, structurally unsafe or of
such faulty construction or unstable foundation, that partial or complete
collapse is possible.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Unsafe Equipment. Unsafe equipment includes any boiler, heating
equipment, elevator, moving stairway, electrical wiring or device, flammable

life, health, property or safety of the public or occupants of the premises or
structure.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Structures Unfit for Human Occupancy. A structure is unfit for human
occupancy whenever the code official finds that such structure is unsafe,
unlawful or, because of the degree to which the structure is in disrepair or
lacks maintenance, is unsanitary, vermin or rat infested, contains filth and
contamination, or lacks ventilation, illumination, sanitary or heating
facilities or other essential equipment required by this chapter, or because
the location of the structure constitutes a hazard to the occupants of the

2.Â Â Â Closing of Vacant Structures. If the structure is vacant and unfit for
human habitation and occupancy, and is not in danger of structural collapse,
the code official is authorized to post a placard of condemnation on the
premises and order the structure closed up so as not to be an attractive
nuisance. Upon failure of the owner to close up the premises within the time
specified in the order, the code official shall cause the premises to be closed
and secured through any available public agency or by contract or arrangement
by private persons and the cost thereof shall be charged against the real
estate upon which the structure is located and shall be a lien upon such real
estate and may be collected by any other legal resource.
3.Â Â Â Notice. Whenever the code official has condemned a structure or equipment
under the provisions of this section, notice shall be posted in a conspicuous

persons violating this chapter shall be allowed a reasonable amount of time to
voluntarily remedy the violation before action to assess costs or penalties for

the time prescribed, the City will abate it and assess the costs against such
person.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Violations which are not voluntarily remedied may be abated by an
administrative abatement process; the municipal infraction process; by court
proceedings; or by City abatement and assessment of costs therefore against the
property owner, at the discretion of the City.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The enforcement officer may, but shall not be required to, give notice
to abate prior to issuance of a civil citation for a repeat offense involving
the same property and occurring within a year of a prior violation and notice
to abate.
2.Â Â Â Notice. When service of a notice to abate is required, it shall be served
upon the owner of the property on which the nuisance exists by: (i) personal
service as provided in Rule of Civil Procedure 1.305; or (ii) by certified mail

the City for that purpose, and shall state the particular section of the
ordinance or interpretation thereof being appealed, and a brief statement of
the grounds upon which such appeal is taken. Failure to file a timely appeal as
prescribed herein shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing, and the
notice shall become final. The hearing will be before the Council at a time and
place fixed by the Council. The findings of the Council shall be conclusive
and, if a nuisance is found to exist, it shall be ordered abated within a
reasonable time under the circumstances.

abated as ordered and within the time specified, the City may abate such
violation by any of the following means:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â By undertaking such abatement and keeping an accurate account of the
expense incurred. The itemized expense account shall be filed with the Clerk
who shall pay such expenses on behalf of the City. The Clerk shall send a
statement of the total expense incurred by certified mail to the property owner
who has failed to abide by the notice to abate, and if the amount shown by the
statement has not been paid within one month, the Clerk shall certify the costs
to the County Treasurer and such costs shall then be collected with, and in the
same manner, as general property taxes.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â By issuance of a civil citation charging the owner with a municipal
infraction violation. Abatement may include but is not limited to repair,
removal, cleaning, extermination, cutting, mowing, grading, sewer repairs,

Abatement costs may include the cost of removing or eliminating the violation;
the costs of investigation, such as title searches, inspection, and testing;
the cost of notification; filing costs; and other related administrative costs,
of which such costs or the balance of such costs may be assessed against the
premises in the same manner as a property tax. Inoperable or obsolete vehicles
which have been impounded may be sold in accordance with State law. If an
inoperable or obsolete vehicle is not sold or if the proceeds of such sale or
redemption are not sufficient to pay the costs of abatement, storage, and sale
of said inoperable or obsolete vehicle, such cost of abatement, storage, and
sale of said inoperable or obsolete vehicle, may be assessed against the
premises in the same manner as a property tax. The court may order any one or
more of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Levy a civil penalty (fine) against the defendant of up to $750.00
for the first offense and up to $1,000.00 for repeat offenses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Order abatement of the violation in any manner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Place a judgment against the person and/or property of defendant
for the costs of abatement.
5.Â Â Â Emergency Abatement Procedure. If an Enforcement Officer determines that a
violation exists and constitutes an imminent, clear, and compelling danger to
health, safety or welfare of persons or property, the Enforcement Officer is
authorized to abate the violation or have it abated without prior notice and
opportunity for hearing. The costs of such action may be assessed against the
premises. However, prior to such assessment, the City shall give a property
owner notice and the opportunity for a hearing before the City Council in
accordance with subsection 3 above.
158.07Â Â Â APPEAL TO CITY COUNCIL.
1.Â Â Â Authority. The City Council is hereby empowered to hold hearings on
appeals from the regulations of this chapter.

set a time and place for them to hear such appeal and shall publish notice
thereof.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The hearing shall be open to the public and shall be recorded either
electronically or manually. All parties shall be afforded an opportunity to
respond and present evidence and argument. If the appellant fails to appear at
such hearing, the City Council may proceed with the hearing and make a decision
in the absence of the appellant.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The City Councilâ€™s finding shall be based upon the kind of evidence on
which reasonably prudent persons are accustomed to rely for the conduct of
their serious affairs, even if such evidence would be inadmissible in a court
of law. The City Councilâ€™s experience, technical competence, and specialized
knowledge may be utilized in the evaluation of the evidence. The presiding
officer of the City Council shall conduct the hearing.
3.Â Â Â Decision of the City Council. No hearing shall be valid unless a majority
of the City Council is present. The City Council shall render a decision based
upon the record, at the conclusion of the hearing or within a reasonable time
thereafter. The City Council may affirm, modify or reverse any action,
interpretation, notice or order which has been issued in connection with the
enforcement of this chapter. Following the decision of the City Council, all

160.02Â Â Â Â STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSE.
1.Â Â Â The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 414, Code of Iowa, as
amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure
safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
2.Â Â Â Findings of Fact.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The flood hazard areas of the City of Vinton are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of
the community.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by:
(i) The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â This ordinance relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
3.Â Â Â Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City of Vinton and its
residents and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and
comfort and convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses
described in Section
160.02(2)(A) of this ordinance with provisions designed to:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows so
that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03Â Â Â GENERAL PROVISIONS.

160.05Â Â Â ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING (OVERLAY) DISTRICTS.
The floodplain areas within the jurisdiction of this ordinance are hereby
divided into the following districts:
1.Â Â Â Floodway (Overlay) District (FW) - those areas identified as Floodway on
the Official Floodplain Zoning Map;
2.Â Â Â Floodway Fringe (Overlay) District (FF) - those areas identified as Zone
AE on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map but excluding those areas identified
as Floodway;
3.Â Â Â General Floodplain (Overlay) District (GF) - those areas identified as
Zone A on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map.
The boundaries shall be as shown on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map. Within
these districts, all uses not allowed as permitted uses are prohibited unless a
variance to the terms of this ordinance is granted after due consideration by
the Board of Adjustment.
160.06Â Â Â FLOODWAY (OVERLAY) DISTRICT (FW).
1.Â Â Â Permitted Uses. All development within the Floodway District shall be
permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance (or
underlying zoning district) and provided they meet applicable performance
standards of the Floodway District.
2.Â Â Â Performance Standards. All Floodway District uses allowed as a permitted
use shall meet the following standards.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No development shall be permitted in the Floodway District that would
result in any increase in the base flood elevation. Consideration of the
effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption
that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly situated
lands.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All development within the Floodway District shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â No development shall affect the capacity or conveyance of the channel
or floodway of any tributary to the main stream, drainage ditch or any other
drainage facility or system.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Structures, buildings, recreational vehicles, and sanitary and utility
systems, if permitted, shall meet the applicable performance standards of the
Floodway Fringe District and shall be constructed or aligned to present the
minimum possible resistance to flood flows.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Structures, if permitted, shall have a low flood damage potential and
shall not be for human habitation.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Storage of materials or equipment that are buoyant, flammable,
explosive or injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited. Storage of
other material may be allowed if readily removable from the Floodway District
within the time available after flood warning.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Watercourse alterations or relocations (channel changes and
modifications) must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within
the altered or relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations
must be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Any fill allowed in the floodway must be shown to have some beneficial
purpose and shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Pipeline river or stream crossings shall be buried in the streambed and
banks or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due to channel
degradation and meandering or due to the action of flood flows.
160.07Â Â Â FLOODWAY FRINGE (OVERLAY) DISTRICT FF.Â Â 
1.Â Â Â Permitted Uses. All development within the Floodway Fringe District shall
be permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance
(or underlying zoning district) and provided they meet applicable performance
standards of the Floodway Fringe District.
2.Â Â Â Performance Standards. All development must be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance standards.
Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no development may increase the base
flood elevation more than one (1) foot. The applicant will be responsible for
providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical
information to make such determination.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All development shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse
or lateral movement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than 1.0 ft. above the
base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed subject to favorable
consideration by the Board of Adjustment where existing topography, street
grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods
used must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various
forces and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential structures
located in areas that would become isolated due to flooding of surrounding
ground shall be provided with a means of access that will be passable by
wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this criterion shall not apply
where the Administrator determines there is sufficient flood warning time for
the protection of life and property. When estimating flood warning time,
consideration shall be given to the criteria listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa
Administrative Code.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Non-Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved non-
residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)

160.09Â Â Â APPOINTMENT AND DUTIES OF BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
1.Â Â Â Appointment and Duties of Board of Adjustment. A Board of Adjustment is
hereby established which shall hear and decide (i) appeals and (ii) requests
for variances to the provisions of this ordinance, and shall take any other
action which is required of the Board.
2.Â Â Â Appeals. Where it is alleged there is any error in any order, requirement,
decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the
enforcement of this ordinance, the aggrieved party may appeal such action. The
notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board of Adjustment and with the
official from whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason
for the appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to
the Board of Adjustment all the documents constituting the record upon which
the action appealed from was taken.
3.Â Â Â Variance. The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in specific
cases such variances from the terms of this ordinance that will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance will result in unnecessary
hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection
for structures than what is ordinarily required by this ordinance, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and
(ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
4.Â Â Â Hearings and Decisions of the Board of Adjustment.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Hearings. Upon the filing with the Board of Adjustment of an Appeal or
a request for a variance, the Board shall hold a public hearing. The Board
shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing and give public notice thereof, as
well as due notice to parties in interest. At the hearing, any party may appear
in person or by agent or attorney and present written or oral evidence. The
Board may require the appellant or applicant to provide such information as is
reasonably deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or
evaluation of a professional engineer or other expert person or agency,
including the Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal or
variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an appeal, the Board may, so
long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance,
reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in
writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision.
In granting a variance, the Board shall consider such factors as contained in
this section and all other relevant sections of this ordinance and may
prescribe such conditions as contained in Section
160.04(4)(B)(2).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board of Adjustment Shall be
Based. In passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this ordinance and:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability
of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.

districts, of which there shall be nine in number, known as:
AÂ Â Â Â Â Â Agricultural District
R-1Â Â Â Â Â Â Single-Family District

restrictive district, with districts becoming progressively less restrictive as
shown on the above list, with the M-2 General Industrial District being the
least restrictive district. Where reference to â€œmoreâ€ or â€œlessâ€ restrictive
districts is made in this chapter, interpretation shall be made in accordance
with the above listing.
165.04Â Â Â DISTRICT MAP.
The boundaries of the districts are shown upon the map which is made a part of
this chapter, which map is designated as the â€œDistrict Map.â€ The District Map
and all the notations, references and other information shown thereon are a
part of the Zoning Ordinance and have the same force and effect as if the
District Map and all the notations, references and other information shown
thereon where all fully set forth and described herein, the original of which
District Map is properly attested and is on file with the Clerk.
165.05Â Â Â CLASSIFICATION.
All territory which may hereafter be annexed to the City shall be automatically

otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be in the same zone as
the property immediately abutting upon such alleys, streets, public ways, or
waterways and railroad rights-of-way. Where the centerline of a street, alley,

the zoning of such areas, unless otherwise specifically designated, shall be
deemed to be the same as that of the abutting property up to such centerline.
165.07Â Â Â AMENDMENTS.
Amendments, supplements or changes of the boundaries of districts as shown on
the Official Zoning Map shall be made by an Ordinance amending the Zoning
Ordinance. The amending ordinance shall refer to the Official Zoning Map and

identify the zoning district as the same exists and the new district
designation applicable to said property. Said ordinance shall, after adoption
and publication, be recorded by the City Clerk as other ordinances and a
certified copy thereof be attached to the Official Zoning Map. Such amendatory
ordinance shall, however, not repeal, or reenact said map, but only amend it.
The Official Zoning Map, together with amending ordinances, shall be the final
authority as to the current zoning status of land and water areas, buildings
and other structures in the City. (See EDITORâ€™S NOTE at the end of this chapter
for ordinances amending the Official Zoning Map.)
165.08Â Â Â RULES FOR INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
In the event that the Official Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or
difficult to interpret because of use, the Council may by resolution adopt a
new Official Zoning Map which shall supersede the prior map. The new Official
Zoning Map may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior map,
and may graphically show changes to the original map made by amendatory
ordinance, but no such correction shall have the effect of amending the
original zoning ordinance or any subsequent amendment thereof in a manner not
provided for within the ordinance. The new Official Zoning Map shall be
identified by date and the signature of the Mayor attested by the Clerk, under
the following words: â€œThis is to certify that this Official Zoning Map
supersedes and replaces the Official Zoning Map adopted as part of the zoning
ordinance of the City.â€

otherwise forbidden or regulated shall be done only in a humane and sanitary
manner and shall not be done open to the view of any public area or adjacent
property owned by another.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â No person shall keep any chickens and ducks unless such person
possesses a City permit issued by the City Clerk.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The City Clerk shall provide an application form upon request,
which shall include consent forms for landlords and owners of adjacent
properties.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The fees and associated costs shall be set by resolution at a cost
of $25.00.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Permits will be granted for one year valid from January 1 through
December 31. Permits may be purchased at any time during the year but will be
valid only through December 31. Bands will be issued with the permit. The
permittee shall place and keep leg bands on all of said permitteeâ€™s chickens
and ducks showing the permit number.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Each chicken and duck shall be banded at all times.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â By the granting of the permit to chickens and ducks and the
application thereof, the permittee authorizes that the City or its agents have
the right to go onto permitteeâ€™s property any time and without prior notice for
the limited purpose of inspection of the premises to ensure that all applicable
conditions have been met.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Within 30 days after the expiration of any permit, the permittee
shall apply for and secure a renewal of the permit in the manner provided for
in this chapter. Failure to renew a permit within the time herein provided
shall result in a delinquent fee, in addition to the regular permit fee, as set
by the City Council. All applicants shall be furnished with permit rules and
regulations at the time the application is made. Permit rules and regulations
shall be approved by resolution of the City Council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â The permit is a limited license for the activity, and no vested
zoning rights arise from the permit being issued.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â The permit does not run with the land. Private restrictions on the
use of the property shall remain enforceable and shall supersede the permit.
The private restrictions include, but are not limited to, deed restrictions,
condominium restrictions, neighborhood association bylaws, covenants and
restrictions, and rental agreements. A permit issued to a person whose property
is subject to private restrictions that prohibit keeping chickens and ducks is
void.

comply with the requirements of this section, the application may be denied or

suspended, or not renewed a permit, the applicant or permit holder may appeal
the Clerkâ€™s decision to the City Administrator within 10 business days of
receipt by the applicant or holder of the permit of the notice of the decision.
The applicant or holder of the permit will be given an opportunity for a
hearing. The decision of the City Administrator or any decision by the Clerk
that is not appealed in accordance to this chapter shall be deemed final
action.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â When an application for a permit is denied or when a permit is
revoked:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The applicant may not re-apply for a new permit for a period of
one year from the date of the denial or revocation unless the denial or
revocation is due to administrative reasons only, as determined by the City
Clerk.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Chickens and ducks shall be removed immediately.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Any coop, fowl house, fencing or other structures shall be

165.25 Â Â Â  ADDITIONAL NONCONFORMING USES.
1.Â Â Â Intent. It is the intent of this section to permit legal nonconforming
lots, structures, or uses to continue until they are removed but not to
encourage their survival.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â It is recognized that there exist within the districts established by
the ordinance codified in this chapter and subsequent amendments, lots,
structures, and uses of land and structures which were lawful before such
ordinance was passed or amended which would be prohibited, regulated, or
restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendments.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Such uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with
permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this
chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended,
nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere
in the same district.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a
nonconforming use of a structure and land in combination shall not be extended
or enlarged after passage of the zoning ordinance by attachment on a building
or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or
by addition of other uses of a nature which would not be permitted generally in
the district involved.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this ordinance and upon which actual building
construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby
defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position
and fastened in a permanent manner; except that where demolition or removal of
existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding such
demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, providing that
work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building involved.
2.Â Â Â Nonconforming Uses of Land. Where at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer
permissible under the terms of this chapter as enacted or amended such use may
be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of
more than 12 months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the
regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which such land is
located.
3.Â Â Â Nonconforming Lot of Record. In any district in which single- family
dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other
provisions of this chapter, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory
buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter. Such lot must be in separate ownership
and not of continuous frontage with other lots of the same ownership. This
provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for
area or width or both that are generally applicable in the district, provided
that yard dimensions and other requirements not involving area or width or
both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which
such lot is located.
4.Â Â Â Nonconforming Structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that could not be built under the
terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height,
yards or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot,
such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject
to the following provisions:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases
its nonconformity. Such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which
does not increase its nonconformity.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more
than 50 percent of its replacement costs, exclusive of the foundation, it shall
be reconstructed only in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Discontinuance. If building damage by fire, flood, explosion, war,
riot, or act of God is more than 50 percent, it shall be removed from said
premises within 30 days following said damage.
5.Â Â Â Nonconforming Uses of Structures and Land. Where a lawful use of a
structure, or of a structure and land in combination exists at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that would not be permitted in
the district under the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may be continued
so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this ordinance
in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which was manifestly arranged or designed for such use, and which
existed at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use
shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district in which such structure is located, and the
nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structures and land in
combination, is discontinued or ceases to exist for a period of more than 12
months, the structure, or structure and land in combination, shall not
thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district
in which it is located.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â A nonconforming lot of record which does not meet the required lot area
or lot width requirements may be developed for a single-family dwelling so long
as the required yard setbacks are maintained.
6.Â Â Â Repairs and Maintenance. On any building devoted in whole or in part to
any nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repairs or
replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing of the building,
provided that the cubic content of the building as it existed at the time of
passage or amendment of this chapter shall not be increased. Nothing in this
chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe
condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by an official
charged with protecting the public safety upon orders of such official.
7.Â Â Â Replacing Damaged Buildings. Any nonconforming building or structure
damaged more than 60 percent of its replacement value exclusive of the
foundations at the time of damage by fire, flood, explosion, war, riot, or act
of God shall not be restored or reconstructed and used as before such
happening, but if less than 60 percent damage above the foundation, it may be
restored, reconstructed, or used as before provided it be started within six
months and finished in one year. If the building damage is more than 60
percent, it shall be removed from said premises within 30 days following said
damage.
8.Â Â Â Uses Under Exception Provisions Not Nonconforming Uses. Any use for which
a special exception is permitted as provided in this ordinance shall not be
deemed a nonconforming use, but shall without further action, be deemed a
conforming use in such district. Any expansion shall be with approval of the
Board of Adjustment.
9.Â Â Â Change of Tenancy or Ownership. There may be a change of tenancy,
ownership, or management of any existing nonconforming uses of land, of
structures, or of structures and land in combination.

assistance of such other persons as the Council may direct. If the
administrative official shall find that any of the provisions of this chapter
are being violated, said official shall notify in writing the person
responsible for such violations, indicating the nature of the violation and
ordering the action necessary to correct it. The administrative official shall
order discontinuance of illegal use of land, buildings, or structures, removal

zoned unincorporated area.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 414.8)
2.Â Â Â Meetings. Meetings of the Board shall be held at the call of the
Chairperson, and at such other times as the Board may determine. Such
Chairperson or, in the absence of the Chairperson, the acting chairperson may
administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the
Board shall be open to the public. The Board shall keep minutes of its
proceedings, showing the vote of each member on each question, or if absent or
failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its
examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately
filed in the office of the Board and shall be a public record. The presence of
three members of a five- member Board or four members of a seven-member Board
shall be necessary to constitute a quorum.
3.Â Â Â Appeals. Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person aggrieved or by
any officer, department, board or bureau of the City affected by any decision
of the administrative officer. Such appeal shall be taken within 10 days by
filing with the administrative officer and with the Board a notice of appeal
specifying the grounds thereof. The administrative officer shall forthwith
transmit to the Board all papers constituting the record upon which the action
appealed from is taken. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the
action appealed from, unless the administrative official certifies to the Board
after notice of appeal shall have been filed with said official, that by reason
of facts stated in the certificate a stay would in the officialâ€™s opinion cause
imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be
stayed unless otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the
Board or by a court of record on application on notice to the administrative
officer, and on due cause shown.
4.Â Â Â Fee for Appeal. See Section
165.32 for schedule of fees.
5.Â Â Â Hearings; Notice. The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing on
the appeal, give public notice thereof as well as due notice to the parties in
interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. At the hearing, any
party may appear in person or by agent, or by attorney. Before an appeal is
filed with the Board, the appellant shall pay the fee for appeal which shall be
credited to the General Fund of the City.
6.Â Â Â Powers - Administrative Review. The Board shall hear and decide appeals
where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or
determination made by the administrative officer in the enforcement of this
chapter.
7.Â Â Â Powers - Special Exceptions. The Board may permit special exceptions to
the district regulations set forth in this chapter subject to the requirements
of this section.
8.Â Â Â Conditions for Special Exceptions. The Board shall hear and decide only
such other special exceptions as the Board is specifically authorized to pass
on by the terms of this chapter, decide such questions as are involved in
determining whether special exceptions should be granted, and grant special
exceptions with such conditions and safeguards as are appropriate under this
chapter, or deny special exceptions when not in harmony with the purpose and
intent of this chapter. A special exception shall not be granted by the Board
unless and until:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A written application for special exception is submitted indicating the
section of this chapter under which the special exception is sought and stating
the grounds on which it is requested.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Notice of public hearing shall be given in advance of public hearing.
The owner of the property for which special exception is sought or an agent and
any other affected property owners shall be notified by mail. Notice of hearing
shall also be posted on the property for which special exception is sought.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person, or by
agent or attorney.
The Board shall make a finding that it is empowered under the section of this
chapter described in the application to grant the special exception, and that
the granting of the special exception will not adversely affect the public
interest. In granting any special exception, the Board may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter.
Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the special exception is granted, shall be deemed a violation of
this chapter and punishable under Section
165.35 of this chapter. The Board may prescribe a time limit within which the
action for which the special exception is required shall be begun or completed,
or both. Failure to begin or complete, or both, such action within the time
limit set shall void the special exception.
9.Â Â Â Powers - Variances. The Board may authorize upon appeal in specific cases
such variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance
from the terms of this chapter shall not be granted by the Board unless and
until:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A written application for a variance is submitted demonstrating that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to
the land, structure, or building involved, and which are not applicable to
other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the
same district under the terms of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant
any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands,
structures, or buildings in the same district.
No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same
district, and no permitted use of lands, structures, or buildings in other
districts shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Notice of public hearing shall be given in advance of public hearing.
The owner of the property for which the variance is sought or an agent and any
other affected property owner shall be notified by mail.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person, or by
agent or by attorney.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The Board shall make findings that all requirements have been met by
the applicant for a variance.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The Board shall further make a finding that the reasons set forth in
the application justify the granting of the variance, and that the variance is
the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land,
building, or structure.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The Board shall further make a finding that the granting of the
variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this
chapter, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental
to the public welfare.
In granting any variance, the Board may prescribe conditions and safeguards in
conformity with this chapter. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when
made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter and punishable under Section
165.35 of this chapter. Under no circumstances shall the Board grant a variance
to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this chapter in the district
involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of
this chapter in said district.
10.Â Â Â Power â€“ Special Uses. The Board may permit special uses as listed in
Section
165.27.
11.Â Â Â Decisions of the Board of Adjustment. In exercising the above mentioned
powers, the Board may, so long as such action is in conformity with the terms
of this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end
shall have powers of the administrative official from whom the appeal is taken.
The concurring vote of three members of a five-member Board or four members of
a seven-member Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement,
decision or determination of the administrative official, or to decide in favor
of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this
chapter, or to effect any variation in the application of this chapter.
12.Â Â Â Appeal from Decision of the Board of Adjustment. Any taxpayer, or any
officer, department, board or bureau of the City or any person or persons
jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision the Board of Adjustment may
present to a court of record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such
decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the
illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within 30 days after
the filing of the decision in the office of the Board. The court may reverse or
affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify the decision brought up for review.
165.30Â Â Â DUTIES ON MATTERS OF APPEAL.
It is the intent of this chapter that all questions of interpretation and
enforcement shall be first presented to the administrative official, and that
such questions shall be presented to the Board of Adjustment only on appeal
from the decision of the administrative official, and that recourse from the
decisions of the Board of Adjustment shall be to the court, as provided by law
and particularly by statute. It is further the intent of this chapter that the
duties of the Council in connection with this chapter shall not include hearing
and deciding questions of interpretation and enforcement that may arise. The
procedure for deciding such questions shall be as stated in this section and
this chapter. Under this chapter, the Council shall have only the duties of:
(i) considering and adopting or rejecting proposed amendments or the repeal of
this chapter, as provided by law; and (ii) establishing a schedule of fees and
charges as stated in Section
165.32; and (iii) the Council may remand a decision to grant a variance to the
Board of Adjustment for further study. The effective date of the variance is

the Code of Iowa.

of the administrative official, and may be altered or amended only by the
Council. No certificate, special exception or variance shall be issued unless
or until such costs, charges, fees or expenses have been paid in full, nor
shall any action be taken on proceedings before the Board of Adjustment unless
or until preliminary charges and fees have been paid in full in accordance with
the following schedule:
1.Â Â Â Occupancy Permit. The building permit fee shall include the occupancy
permit.

Â Â Â Application for Special Use Permit â€“ $18.00
Â Â Â Appeal for Variance, Exception, Interpretation or Review - $50.00
3.Â Â Â Petition for Rezoning â€“ $50.00.
4.Â Â Â Application: Home Occupation Permit in R-1 District â€“ $3.00.
165.32Â Â Â AMENDMENTS.
1.Â Â Â The Council may, from time to time, on its own action or on petition,
after public notice and hearings as provided by law, and after report by the
Zoning Commission, amend, supplement or change the boundaries or regulations
herein or subsequently established, and such amendment shall not become
effective except by the favorable vote of a majority of all the members of the
Council. Whenever any person desires that any amendment or change be made in
this chapter, including the text and/or map, as to any property in the City,
and there shall be presented to the Council a petition requesting such change
or amendment and clearly describing the property and its boundaries as to which
the change or amendment is desired, duly signed by the owners of 50 percent of
the area of all real estate lying outside of said tract but within 200 feet of
the boundaries thereof, and intervening streets and alleys not to be included
in computing such 200 feet, it shall be the duty of the Council to vote upon
such petition within 90 days after the filing of such petition with the Clerk.
In case the proposed amendment, supplement or change be disapproved by the
Zoning Commission, or a written protest against a change or repeal which is
filed with the City Clerk and signed by the owners of 20 percent or more of the
property which is located within 200 feet of the exterior boundaries of the
property for which the change or repeal is proposed, the change or repeal shall
not become effective except by favorable vote of at least three-fourths of all
members of the Council. The protest, if filed, must be filed before or at the
public hearing. Whenever any petition for an amendment, supplement or change of
the zoning or regulations herein contained or subsequently established shall
have been denied by the Council, then no new petition covering the same
property or the same property and additional property shall be filed with or
considered by the Council until one year shall have elapsed from the date of
the filing of the first petition.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 414.5)
2.Â Â Â Temporary Notice Sign. Any person submitting a petition for rezoning will
be provided with an official notice sign to be posted on the property visible
from the public street. Such sign shall be posted within 25 feet of the public
right-of-way and shall give notice that the property is proposed to be rezoned.
The sign shall be posted from the date of petition to at least the Council
public hearing date but no more than 60 days.
165.33Â Â Â COMPLAINTS REGARDING VIOLATIONS.
Whenever a violation of this chapter occurs, or is alleged to have occurred,
any person may file a written complaint. Such complaint stating fully the
causes and basis thereof, shall be filed with the administrative official. The
administrative official shall record properly such complaint, immediately
investigate, and take action thereon as provided by this chapter.
165.34 ENFORCEMENT AND VIOLATIONS.
All departments, officials, and employees of the City who are vested with the
duty or authority to issue permits or licenses shall issue no such permit or
license for any use, structure, or purpose if the same would not conform to the
provisions of this chapter. Violation of the provisions of this chapter or
failure to comply with any of its requirements shall constitute a violation of
this Code of Ordinances. Each day such violation continues shall be considered
a separate offense. The owner or tenant of any building, structure, premises,
or part thereof, and any architect, builder, contractor, agent, or other person
who commits, participates in, assists in, or maintains such violation may each
be found guilty of a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent
the City from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation.

from strict compliance with these regulations, it may make variations or
exceptions to the regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the
public interest secured, provided that such variation or exception shall not
have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations; and
further provided the Council shall not grant variations or exceptions to these
regulations unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to
it in each specific case that:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public

unique to the property for which the variation is sought, and are not
applicable, generally, to other property.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical
conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the
owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict
letter of the regulations were carried out.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to
make more money out of the property.
2.Â Â Â Conditions. In granting variations and exceptions the Council may require
such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives
of the standards or requirements of these regulations.
3.Â Â Â Procedure for a Variance. A petition for any such variance shall be

sale or lease any lots in the City or addition to the City, until the plat
thereof has been acknowledged and recorded as provided in these regulations,
shall forfeit and pay $50.00 for each lot and part of lot sold or disposed of,

The Commission shall, as soon as possible, but not more than 30 days
thereafter, pass upon the preliminary plat as originally submitted or modified.
If the Commission does not act within 30 days, the preliminary plat shall be
deemed to be approved; provided, however, that the subdivider may agree to an
extension of the time period not to exceed an additional 60 days. It shall then
set forth its recommendations in writing, whether of approval, modification or
disapproval.
1.Â Â Â Reasons for Changes or Disapproval. In the event that substantial changes
or modifications are made by the Commission or the Commission recommends
disapproval of the plat, it shall give its reasons therefor and it may request
and cause the revised preliminary plat to be resubmitted in the same manner as

further review and the Clerk shall notify the subdivider of such action. If
approved, the Clerk shall sign five copies of the preliminary plat with the
notation of the date the preliminary plat received the Councilâ€™s tentative
approval. One copy shall be returned to the Commission and three copies shall
be returned to the subdivider. The tentative approval by the Council shall not
constitute final acceptance of the addition or subdivision by the City but an
authorization to proceed with preparation of the final plat.
2.Â Â Â The Council may, upon request of the subdivider, decide to construct
certain improvements itself as part of its tentative approval which
improvements shall fulfill the requirements in other sections of these
subdivision regulations, only as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The City may construct water mains and fire hydrants or sewer mains,

payable until such time as the property is not used as agricultural property
under Section 384.62 of the Code of Iowa.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The City may allow the applicant to construct street bases without
concrete surfacing if it determines that the City will surface the streets
later under other City programs.

one year, at the end of which time final approval must have been obtained. Any
plat not receiving final approval within this period of time shall be void, and
the subdivider shall be required to resubmit a new plat for tentative approval
subject to all new zoning restrictions and subdivision regulations.
171.10Â Â Â COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Before the Council will approve the final plat, all of the required
improvements shall be constructed and accepted by formal resolution of the
Council. Before passage of said resolution of acceptance, the City Engineer
shall report that said improvements meet all City specifications and ordinances
or other City requirements, and the agreements between the subdivider and the
City.
171.11Â Â Â PERFORMANCE BOND.
The completion requirement for improvements may be waived in whole or in part
if the subdivider will post a performance bond with the Council guaranteeing
that improvements not completed will be constructed within a period of one year
from final acceptance of the plat; but final acceptance of the plat will not
constitute final acceptance by the City of any improvements to be constructed.
Improvements will be accepted only after their construction has been completed.
Such performance bond shall be satisfactory to the City Attorney as to form,
sufficiency, and manner of execution. Upon recommendation of the Commission,
the Council may extend the completion date set forth in the bond for a maximum
period of one additional year.

Council together with a certified copy of its resolution showing the action of
the Commission. If the Commission recommends approval of the final plat, such
approval and the date thereof shall be noted on the plat over the signatures of
both the Chairperson and Secretary of the Commission, and the plat and seven
copies shall be transmitted to the Council, and one copy shall be returned to
the subdivider.
171.17Â Â Â ACTION BY THE COUNCIL ON FINAL PLAT.
Upon receipt of the certification by the Commission, the Council shall, within

wherein said proposed plat is objectionable.
2.Â Â Â Acceptance of Plat. In the event that said plat is found to be acceptable
and in accordance with these regulations, the Council shall accept same.
3.Â Â Â Final Approval and Recording of Plat. The passage of a resolution by the

satisfactory evidence of such recording in the office of the Clerk before the
City shall recognize the plat as being in full force and effect.
171.18Â Â Â RESUBDIVISION OF LAND.
The following requirements shall govern the resubdivision of land.
1.Â Â Â Procedure for Resubdivision. For any change in a map of an approved or
recorded subdivision plat, if such change affects any street layout shown on
such map, or area reserved for public use indicated on the map, or any lot
line, or if it affects any map or plan legally established prior to the
adoption of any regulations controlling subdivisions, such parcel shall be
approved by the same procedure, rules, and regulations as for a subdivision.
2.Â Â Â Acreage Lots. Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision
plat shows one or more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are
indications that such lots will eventually be resubdivided into smaller
building sites, the Commission and Council may require that such parcel of land
allow for future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent
streets. Easements providing for the future opening and extension of such
streets may be made a requirement of the plat.

Â 
172.01Â Â Â COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Before the final plat is approved by the Council, all applicants shall be
required to complete, in accordance with the Councilâ€™s decision and to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer, all the street, sanitary, and other
improvements as required in these regulations, specified in the preliminary
plat, and as approved by the Council, and to dedicate same to the City, free
and clear of all liens and encumbrances on the property and public improvements
thus dedicated .
172.02Â Â Â PERFORMANCE BOND.
The Council in its discretion may waive the requirement that the applicant
complete and dedicate all public improvements prior to approving the final
plat, and that, as an alternative, the applicant post a bond at the time of
application for final plat approval in an amount estimated by the Council as
sufficient to secure to the City the satisfactory construction, installation,
and dedication of the incomplete portion of required improvements. In addition:
1.Â Â Â Approved by City Attorney. Such performance bond shall comply with all
statutory requirements and shall be satisfactory to the City Attorney as to
form, sufficiency, and manner of execution as set forth in these regulations.
2.Â Â Â Completion Period. The period within which required improvements must be
completed shall be specified by the Council in the resolution approving the
final plat shall be incorporated in the bond, and shall not exceed one year
from date of final approval.
3.Â Â Â Extension of Completion Period. The performance bond shall be approved by
the Council as to the amount and surety and conditions satisfactory to the
Council. The Commission may, upon proof of difficulty, recommend to the Council
extension of the completion date set forth in such bond for a maximum period of
one additional year. The Council may at any time during the period of such bond
accept a substitution of principal or sureties on the bond.
4.Â Â Â Temporary Improvements. The applicant shall build and pay for all costs of
temporary improvements required by the Council and shall maintain same for the
period specified by the Council. Prior to construction of any temporary
facility or improvement, the developer shall file with the City a separate
suitable bond for temporary facilities, which bond shall insure that the
temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained and removed.
5.Â Â Â Failure to Complete Improvement. For subdivisions for which no performance
bond has been posted, if the improvements are not completed within the period
specified by the Council in the resolution approving the plat, the approval
shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases where a performance bond has
been posted and required improvements have not been installed within the terms
of such performance bond, the City may declare the bond to be in default and
require that all the improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the
building development at the time the bond is declared to be in default.
172.03Â Â Â INSPECTION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
The Council shall provide for inspection of required improvements during
construction and insure their satisfactory completion. The applicant shall pay
to the City an inspection fee equal to the actual cost of inspection. These
fees shall be due and payable upon demand of the City and no building permits
or certificates of occupancy shall be issued until all fees are paid. The

capable of being detected by commonly used magnetic or electronic equipment.
The surveyor shall affix a cap of reasonably inert material bearing an embossed
or stencil cut marking of the Iowa registration number of the surveyor to the
top of the monument.
2.Â Â Â Other Monuments of Record. Other monuments established prior to the
recording of the plat of the subdivision and described on the plat shall be
considered monuments of record and shall be given the same weight as original
permanent control monuments if the monuments remain undisturbed in their
original positions. The additional monuments shall be constructed and embedded
according to the provisions for permanent control monuments prescribed in
subsection 1 of this section.
3.Â Â Â Establishment and Recording of Other Monuments. Monuments other than the
permanent control monuments required in subsection 1 of this section shall not
be required to be established before the recording of the plat or the
conveyancing of lands by reference to the plat if the surveyor includes in the
certification of the plat that the additional monuments required by these
regulations shall be established before a specified future date.
4.Â Â Â Additional Monuments Required. Additional monuments shall be constructed
and embedded according to the provisions for permanent control monuments
prescribed in subsection 1 of this section, and shall be set at all of the

with an existing or created right-of-way line of any street, railroad, or other
way.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â At every point of curve, tangency, reversed curve, or compounded curve
on every right-of-way line established.
5.Â Â Â Placement of Monument. When the placement of a monument required by this
chapter at the prescribed location is impractical, it is permissible to
establish a reference monument in close proximity to the prescribed location.
If the reference monument is established prior to the recording of the plat and
its location properly shown on the plat, the reference monument shall have the
same status as other monuments of record. Where any point requiring
monumentation has been previously monumented, the existence of the monument
shall be confirmed by the surveyor. The existing monument shall be considered a
monument of record when properly shown and described on the recorded plat.
172.13Â Â Â CHARACTER OF THE LAND.
Land which the City finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or development due
to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth
formations or topography, utility easements, or other features which will
reasonably be harmful to the safety, health, and general welfare of the present
or future inhabitants of the subdivision or its surrounding areas or both,
shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are formulated by
the subdivider and approved by the Council, upon recommendation of the
Commission, to solve the problems created by the unsuitable land conditions.

permit appropriate building setback from and orientation to both streets.
2.Â Â Â Street Access. Each lot shall be provided with satisfactory access to a
public street.
3.Â Â Â Double Frontage and Reverse Frontage Lots. Double frontage and reverse
frontage lots shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of
residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific
disadvantages of topography and orientation. A planting screen easement of at
least 10 feet, and across which there shall be no right of access, shall be
provided along the line of lots abutting such a traffic artery or other
disadvantageous use.
4.Â Â Â Side Lot Lines. Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles to
straight street lines or radial to curved street lines.
5.Â Â Â Lot Drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage
away from all buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with
the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so
as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent
lots.
6.Â Â Â Building Lines. Building lines conforming with zoning standards shall be
shown on all lots within the platted area. Where the subdivided area is not
under zoning control, the Council may require building lines in accordance with
the needs of each subdivision.

following requirements related to topography and arrangement:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography. All streets
shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as possible of the building sites at,
or above, the grades of the streets. Grades of streets shall conform as closely
as possible to the original topography. A combination of steep grades and
curves shall be avoided. Specific standards are contained in the design
standards of these regulations.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed
system of streets and dedicated right-of-way.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â All arterials shall be properly related to special traffic generators
such as industries, business districts, schools, churches, and shopping
centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and proposed
land uses.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Municipal service streets shall be laid out to conform as much as
possible to the topography to discourage use by through traffic, to permit
efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of
streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract
to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions,
or unless in the opinion of the Council such extension is not necessary or
desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the
existing layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â In business and industrial developments, the streets and other
accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings,
location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and
maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of
movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian.
4.Â Â Â Access to State or County Jurisdictional Roads. Whenever any part of a
subdivision is designed with access to a road under State or County
jurisdiction, permission for access to such roads shall be obtained from the
appropriate jurisdiction and such access shall be designed according to the
standards of the appropriate jurisdiction.
5.Â Â Â Access to Arterial Streets. Where a subdivision borders on or contains an
existing or proposed arterial street, the Council may require that lot access
to such streets be limited by one of the following means:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Lots shall be designed so as to back onto the primary arterial and
front onto a parallel municipal service street; no access shall be provided
from the arterial street, and screening shall be provided in a strip of land
along the rear property line of such lots.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A series of culs-de-sac entered from and designed generally at right
angles to such a parallel street, with the rear lines of their terminal lots
backing onto the arterial street.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â A frontage or service road, separated from the primary arterial by a
planting or grass strip and having access thereto at suitable points.
6.Â Â Â Street Names. Streets that are in alignment with others already existing
shall bear the name of the existing streets. The proposed names of new streets
shall not duplicate or sound similar to existing street names. Street names
shall be subject to the approval of the Council and Commission.
7.Â Â Â Street Name Signs. Street name signs are to be placed at all intersections
within or abutting the subdivision, the type and location of which to be
approved by the Council. The City shall install all street name signs. The
applicant shall deposit with the City at the time of final subdivision
approval, the estimated cost of installation of each street sign required by
the Council.
8.Â Â Â Street Lights. Installation of street lights shall be required in
accordance with design and specification standards approved by the Council.
9.Â Â Â Construction of Streets and Dead-End Streets. Streets and dead- end
streets shall be in conformance with the following requirements:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Construction of Streets. The arrangement of streets shall provide for
the continuation of principal streets between adjacent properties when such
continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire
protection, and for efficient provision of utilities. If the adjacent property
is undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right-
of- way shall be extended to the property line. A temporary T- or L-shaped
turnabout shall be provided on all temporary dead-end streets, with the
notation on the subdivision plat that land outside the normal street right-of-
way shall revert to abutters whenever the street is continued. The Council may
limit the length of temporary dead-end streets in accordance with the design
standards of these regulations.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Permanent Dead-End Streets. Where a road does not extend to the
boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by the Council
for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall normally not be nearer to
such boundary than 150 feet. However, the Council may require the reservation
of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian
traffic, or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be provided at the end of
a permanent dead-end street in accordance with City construction standards and
specifications. For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police
and fire protection, permanent dead-end streets shall, in general, be limited
in length in accordance with the design standards of these regulations.
172.17Â Â Â STREETS, DESIGN STANDARDS.
The following design standards shall apply to the design of streets:
1.Â Â Â General. In order to provide for streets of suitable location, width, and
improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access
to police, fire fighting, snow removal, sanitation, and street maintenance
equipment, and to coordinate streets so as to compose a convenient system and
avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties the following design standards
for streets are hereby required:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse
curves on municipal arterial and municipal collector streets, and 75 feet on
municipal service streets.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point
by more than 10 degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius
adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than 100 feet for municipal
service and municipal collector streets, and of such greater radii as the
Council shall determine for special cases.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Minimum Roadway and Right-of-Way Standards:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Municipal arterial streets shall have a right-of-way width of not
less than 80 feet and a roadway width of not less than 44 feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Municipal collector streets shall have a right-of- way width of not
less than 60 feet and a roadway width (back-to-back including curb and gutter
width) of not less than 36 feet in commercial or industrial areas, and 29 feet
in fringe or residential areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Municipal service streets shall have a right-of-way of not less
than 50 feet and a roadway width of not less than 26 feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Frontage streets shall have a right-of -way width of not less than
40 feet and a roadway width of not less than 26 feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Culs-de-sac shall meet all the requirements for a municipal service
street and, in addition, shall provide a turnaround with a right-of-way radius
of 60Â feet and a roadway radius of 40Â feet. No cul-de-sac shall exceed 500Â feet
in length.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Street grades, wherever feasible, shall not exceed the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Municipal arterial streets â€“ six percent.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Municipal collector streets â€“ eight percent.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Municipal service streets â€“ 10 percent.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Frontage streets â€“ six percent.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â All changes in street grade shall be connected by vertical curves of
minimum length in feet equal to 20 times the algebraic difference in
percentages of grade.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â No street grade shall be less than one-half of one percent.
2.Â Â Â Street Surfacing and Improvements. After sewer, water and other utilities
to be located underground within the right-of-way have been installed by the
applicant, the applicant shall construct curbs and gutters and shall surface or
cause to be surfaced roadways to the widths prescribed in these regulations.
Said surfacing shall be of Portland concrete cement. Adequate provision shall
be made for culverts, drains, and bridges. All road pavement, shoulders,
drainage improvements and structures, curbs, turnarounds and sidewalks shall
conform to all construction standards and specifications adopted by the City,
and shall be incorporated into the construction plans required to be submitted
by the developer for plat approval.
3.Â Â Â Excess Right-of-Way. Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards
designated in these regulations shall be required whenever, due to topography,
additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes. Such slopes
shall not be in excess of three to one.
4.Â Â Â Railroads and Limited Access Highways. Railroad rights-of-way and limited
access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining
lands shall be treated as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â In residential districts a buffer strip at least 25 feet in depth in
addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be
provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway. This
strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the plat:
This strip is reserved for screening. The placement of structures hereon is
prohibited.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In districts zoned for business, commercial, or industrial uses the
nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad
shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure
suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Streets parallel to the railroad when intersecting a street which
crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a
distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance
shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for
future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
5.Â Â Â Intersections. The following standards shall apply to the design of
intersections:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles. A proposed intersection of two new streets at an angle of less
than 75 degrees shall not be acceptable. An oblique street should be curved
approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right angles for at
least 100 feet therefrom. Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one
point unless specifically approved by the Council.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall,
wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite
side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet
shall not be permitted, except where the intersected street has separated dual
drives without median breaks at either intersection. Where streets intersect
major streets, their alignment shall be continuous. Intersection of major
streets shall be at least 800 feet apart.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two municipal service
streets shall be at least 20 feet; and minimum curb radius at an intersection
involving a municipal collector street shall be at least 25 feet. Abrupt
changes in alignment within a block shall have the corners cut off in
accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe vehicular
movement.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever practical.
In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a leveling area
shall be provided having not greater than a two percent rate at a distance of
60 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting
street.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing
vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting
visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation, including
trees, in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent
deemed necessary to provide an adequate sight distance.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall be
three percent or less.
6.Â Â Â Bridges. Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined by the
Council, shall be constructed at the full expense of the applicant without
reimbursement from the City. The sharing expense for the construction of
bridges not of primary benefit to the applicant as determined by the Council,
will be fixed by special agreement between the Council and the applicant. Said
cost shall be charged to the applicant pro rata as the percentage of land
developed and so served.
7.Â Â Â Alleys. The following design standards for alleys shall be required of all
subdividers:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Alleys shall be prohibited in residential districts.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts, except
that the Planning Commission may waive this requirement where other definite
and assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading,
unloading and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Alleys shall have a right-of-way of not less than thirty 30 feet and a
roadway width of not less than 20 feet.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided,
but where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit safe
vehicular movement.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable,
shall be provided with adequate turn-around facilities at the dead end, as
determined by the Council.
8.Â Â Â Street Dedications and Reservations. The following provisions shall apply
to street dedications and reservations:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Street systems in new subdivisions shall be laid out so as to eliminate
or avoid new perimeter half streets. Where an existing half street is adjacent
to a new subdivision, the other half of the street shall be improved and
dedicated by the subdivider. The Council may authorize a new perimeter street
where the subdivider improves and dedicates the entire required street right-
of-way width within the subdivision boundaries.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow street or when City
plans or zoning setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening
a road that would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the
applicant shall be required to improve and dedicate at the applicantâ€™s own
expense such areas for widening or realignment of such roads. Such frontage
roads and streets shall be improved and dedicated by the applicant at the
applicantâ€™s expense to the full width as required by these subdivision
regulations. Land reserved for any street purposes may not be counted in
satisfying yard or area requirements of the zoning regulations whether the land
is to be dedicated to the City in fee simple or an easement is granted to the
City.
172.18Â Â Â STORM SEWERS AND DRAINAGE.
The following requirements shall apply to the provision of storm sewers and
drainage:
1.Â Â Â General Requirements. The Commission shall not recommend for approval any
plat of a subdivision which does not make adequate provision for storm or flood
water run-off channels or basins. The storm water drainage system shall be
separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers, where
required, shall be designed by methods as approved by the Council, and a copy
of design computations shall be submitted along with plans. Inlets shall be
provided so that surface water is not carried across or around any
intersection, or for a distance of more than 600 feet in the gutter. When
calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a point, no further
allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point, and basins shall be used to
intercept flow at that point. Surface water drainage patterns shall be shown
for each and every lot and block.
2.Â Â Â Nature of Storm Water Facilities. The applicant may be required by the
Council to carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that
may exist either previously to, or as a result of the subdivision. Such
drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible,
or in perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width, and shall be
constructed in accordance with the construction standards and specifications.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the applicant shall install
storm sewer facilities, or if no outlets are within a reasonable distance,
adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of storm waters, subject to
the specifications of the Council. However, in subdivisions containing lots
less than 15,000 square feet in area and in business and industrial districts,
underground storm sewer systems shall be constructed throughout the
subdivisions and be conducted to an approved out-fall.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided eventually, as
determined by the Council, the subdivider shall make arrangements for future
storm water disposal by a public storm sewer system at the time the plat
receives final approval. Provision for such connection shall be incorporated by
inclusion in the performance bond required for the subdivision plat.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â A culvert or other drainage facility shall in each case be large enough
to accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether
inside or outside the subdivision. The Council shall determine the necessary
size of the facility, based on the provisions of the construction standards and
specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed development
permitted by applicable zoning regulations.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The Council shall also study the effect of each subdivision on existing
downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision. City
drainage studies together with such other studies as shall be appropriate shall
serve as a guide to needed improvements. Where it is anticipated that the
additional runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will overload
an existing downstream drainage facility, the Council may withhold approval of
the subdivision until provision has been made for the recovery of the cost for
the improvement of said potential condition in such sum as the Council shall
determine. No subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be
provided to an adequate drainage watercourse or facility.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Whenever a plat is submitted for an area which is subject to flooding,
the Council may approve such subdivision provided that the applicant fills the
affected area of said subdivision to an elevation sufficient to place the
elevation of streets and lots at a minimum of 12 inches above the elevation of
the base flood, which is defined as a flood that has a one percent chance of
occurrence in any given year. The plat of such subdivision shall provide for an
overflow zone along the bank of any stream or watercourse, in a width which
shall be sufficient in times of high water to contain or move the water, and no
fill shall be placed in the overflow zone nor shall any structure be erected or
placed therein. The boundaries of the overflow zone shall be subject to
approval by the Council. Areas of extremely poor drainage should be
discouraged.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The Council may, when it deems it necessary for the health, safety, or
welfare of the present and future population of the area and necessary to the
conservation of water, drainage, and sanitary facilities, prohibit the
subdivision of any portion of the property which lies within the flood plain of
any stream or drainage course. These flood plain areas shall be preserved from
any and all destruction or damage resulting from clearing, grading, or dumping
of earth, waste material, or stumps, except at the discretion of the Council.
3.Â Â Â Dedication of Drainage Easements and Storm Water Detention Facilities. The
following shall apply to the dedication of drainage easements and storm water
detention facilities.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel, or stream, there shall be provided a storm water easement or drainage
right-of- way conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse, and of
such width and construction or both as will be adequate for the purpose.
Wherever possible, it is desirable that the drainage be maintained by an open
channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume
of flow.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Drainage easements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within street rights-of-way,
perpetual unobstructed easements at least 15 feet in width for such drainage
facilities shall be provided across property outside the street lines and with
satisfactory access to the road. Easements shall be indicated on the plat.
Drainage easements shall be carried from the street to a natural watercourse or
to other drainage facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and
indicated on the plat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The applicant shall dedicate, either in fee or by drainage or
conservation easement of land on both sides of existing watercourses, to a
distance to be determined by the Council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Low-lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or
overflowing during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for
dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their natural state as drainage
ways. Such land or lands subject to periodic flooding shall not be computed in
determining the area requirement of any lot.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Storm Water Detention Facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â For sites on which privately owned and maintained storm water
detention and/or conveyance facilities are located, the property owner shall be
responsible for the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â All future grading, repairs and maintenance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Maintenance of the minimum storm water detention volume, as
approved by the City Engineer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Maintenance of the detention basin control structures and
discharge pipes to insure the maximum theoretical storm water release rate, as
approved by the City Engineer, is not increased.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The property owner shall place no fill material or erect any
buildings, obstructions or other improvements on the area reserved for storm
water detention purposes, unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The property owner shall dedicate to the City, by instrument or
final platting, any property on which public detention basins will be located.
Ingress-egress easements for maintenance of public facilities shall be provided
prior to final site approval.

Â 
180.01Â Â Â DEFINITIONS.
As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:
1.Â Â Â â€œAirportâ€ means the Vinton Veteransâ€™ Memorial Airpark.
2.Â Â Â â€œAirport elevationâ€ means the highest point of an airportâ€™s usable landing
area measured in feet above mean sea level, which elevation is established to
be 845 feet.
3.Â Â Â â€œAirport hazardâ€ means any structure or tree or use of land that would
exceed the federal obstruction standards as contained in 14 CFR 77.21, 77.23,
and 77.25, as revised March 4, 1972, and which obstructs the airspace required
for the flight of aircraft and landing or takeoff at an airport or is otherwise
hazardous to such landing or taking off of aircraft.
4.Â Â Â â€œAirport primary surfaceâ€ means a surface longitudinally centered on a
runway. When the runway has a specially prepared hard surface, the primary
surface extends 200 feet beyond each end of that runway. The width of the
primary surface of a runway will be that width prescribed in Part 77 of the
Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) for the most precise approach existing or
planned for either end of that runway. The elevation of any point on the
primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway
centerline.
5.Â Â Â â€œAirspace heightâ€ means, for the purpose of determining the height limits
in all zones set forth in this chapter and shown on the zoning map, the datum
shall be mean sea level elevation unless otherwise specified.
6.Â Â Â â€œControl zoneâ€ means airspace extending upward from the surface of the
earth, which zone may include one or more airports and is normally a circular
area of five statute miles in radius, with extensions where necessary to
include instrument approach and departure paths.
7.Â Â Â â€œInstrument runwayâ€ means a runway having an existing instrument approach
procedure utilizing air navigation facilities or area type navigation
equipment, for which an instrument approach procedure has been approved or
planned.
8.Â Â Â â€œMinimum descent altitudeâ€ means the lowest altitude expressed in feet
above mean sea level, to which descent is authorized on final approach or
during circle-to-land maneuvering in execution of a standard instrument
approach procedure, where no electronic glide slope is provided.
9.Â Â Â â€œMinimum en route altitudeâ€ means the altitude in effect between radio
fixes which assures acceptable navigational signal coverage and meets
obstruction clearance requirements between those fixes.
10.Â Â Â â€œMinimum obstruction clearance altitudeâ€ means the specified altitude in
effect between radio fixes on VOR airways, off-airways routes, or route
segments which meets obstruction clearance requirements for the entire route
segment and which assures acceptable navigational signal coverage only within
22 miles of a VOR.
11.Â Â Â â€œVisual runwayâ€ means a runway intended solely for the operation of
aircraft using visual approach procedures with no straight-in instrument
approach procedure and no instrument designation indicated on an FAA approved
airport layout plan, military services approved military airport layout plan,
or by any planning document submitted to the FAA by competent authority.
180.02Â Â Â AIRPORT ZONES AND AIRSPACE HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.
In order to carry out the provisions of this section, there are hereby created
and established certain zones that are depicted on the Vinton Veteransâ€™
Memorial Airpark Height Zoning Map. A structure located in more than one zone
of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more
restrictive height limitations. The various zones are hereby established and
defined as follows:
1.Â Â Â Horizontal Zone. The land lying under a horizontal plane 150 feet above
the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which is constructed by
swinging arcs of 10,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary
surface of runways 16, 34, 9, and 27 connecting the adjacent arcs by lines
tangent to those arcs. No structure shall exceed 150 feet above the established
airport elevation in the horizontal zone, as depicted on the Vinton Veteransâ€™
Memorial Airpark Height Zoning Map.
2.Â Â Â Conical Zone. The land lying under a surface extending outward and upward
from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20 feet to one for a
horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. No structure shall penetrate the conical
surface in the conical zone, as depicted on the Height Zoning Map.
3.Â Â Â Approach Zone. The land lying under the surface longitudinally centered on
the extended runway centerline and extending outward and upward from each end
of the primary surface.
(Note: An approach surface is applied to each end of each runway based upon the
type of approach available or planned for that runway end.)
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The inner edge of the approach surface is:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â 500 feet wide for runways 16 and 34.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â 500 feet wide for runways 9 and 27.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The outer edge of the approach zone is:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â 3,500 feet for runways 16 and 34.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â 3,500 feet for runways 9 and 27.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The approach zone extends for a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet at a
slope of 34 to one for runways 16, 34, 9 and 27.
No structure shall exceed the approach surface to any runway, as depicted on
the Height Zoning Map.
4.Â Â Â Transitional Zone. The land lying under those surfaces extending outward
and upward at right angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline
extended at a slope of seven to one from the sides of the primary surface and
from the sides of the approach surfaces. No structures shall exceed the
transitional surface, as depicted on the Height Zoning Map.
5.Â Â Â Increase in Elevation of Structures. No structure shall be erected in the
County that raises the published minimum descent altitude for an instrument
approach to any runway, nor shall any structure be erected that causes the
minimum obstruction clearance altitude or minimum en route altitude to be
increased in Benton County.
180.03Â Â Â USE RESTRICTIONS.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of 180.02, no use may be made of land or
water within the City or County in such a manner as to interfere with the
operation of any airborne aircraft. The following special requirements shall
apply to each permitted use:
1.Â Â Â Lighting. All lights or illumination used in conjunction with streets,
parking, signs or use of land and structures shall be arranged and operated in
such a manner that it is not misleading or dangerous to aircraft operating from
the Vinton Veteransâ€™ Memorial Airpark or in the vicinity thereof.
2.Â Â Â Visual Hazards. No operation from any use shall produce smoke, glare, or
other visual hazards within three statute miles of any usable runway of the
Vinton Veteransâ€™ Memorial Airpark.
3.Â Â Â Electronic Interference. No operation from any use in the City or County
shall produce electronic interference with navigation signals or radio
communication between the airport and aircraft.
180.04Â Â Â LIGHTING.
Notwithstanding the provisions of 180.03, the owner of any structure over 200
feet above ground level must install on the structure lighting in accordance
with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Advisory Circular 70-7460-1D and
amendments. Additionally, any structure constructed after the effective date of
this chapter (October, 1980) and exceeding 949 feet above ground level, must
install on that structure high intensity white obstruction lights in accordance
with Chapter 6 of FAA Advisory Circular 7460-1D and amendments. Any permit or
variance granted may be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure
or growth in question to permit the City or County at its own expense to
install, operate, and maintain thereto such markers or lights as may be
necessary to indicate to pilots the presence of an airspace hazard.
180.05Â Â Â VARIANCES.
Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or to
permit the growth of any tree, or otherwise use property in violation of any
section of this chapter, may apply to the Board of Adjustment for variance from
such regulations. No application for variance to the requirements of this
chapter may be considered by the Board of Adjustment unless a copy of the
application has been submitted to the Vinton Airport Commission for an opinion
as to the aeronautical effects of such a variance. If the Airport Commission
does not respond to the Board of Adjustment within 15 days from receipt of the
copy of the application, the Board may make its decision to grant or deny the
variance.
