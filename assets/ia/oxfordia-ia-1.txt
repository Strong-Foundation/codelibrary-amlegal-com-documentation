purposes.

hours after it is declared, except if it is declared after eight o'clock (8:00)

intervals as is possible along the emergency route. Public announcement method
and "emergency routes" may be designated and changed by resolution of the city
council from time to time as deemed necessary.
   D.   Parking Restricted During Winter Weather Emergency; Violation:

same as a single- family detached dwelling.

as to permit being used, as a conveyance upon the public streets or highways
and duly licensed as such, and constructed in such a manner as will permit

convalescent patients who, on admission, are not as a rule, acutely ill and who
do not usually require special facilities, such as an operating room, X-ray
facilities, laboratory facilities, and obstetrical facilities. A nursing home
provides care for persons who have remedial ailments, for which continuing
medical and skilled nursing care is indicated; who, however, are not sick
enough to require general hospital care. Nursing care is their primary need,
but they will require continuing medical supervision. A major factor which
distinguishes a nursing home is that the residents will require the

home" shall also be considered a "convalescent home".

of government, unless the context clearly indicates that "private" is being
used in a broader sense of something not open or available to the general
populace.
PUBLIC: In reference to a building, structure, utility, facility, or use,
"public" means owned and/or operated by a unit of government or an agency
thereof, unless the context clearly indicates that "public" is being used in

more travel trailers, camping trailers, or tent sites for temporary occupancy,
with necessary incidental services, sanitation, and recreation facilities to
serve the traveling public.
TRAVEL TRAILER OR MOTOR HOME: A vehicle with or without motive power used or so
manufactured or constructed as to permit its being used as a conveyance upon
the public streets and highways and so designed to permit the vehicle to be
used as a place of human habitation by one or more persons. Said vehicle may be
up to eight feet (8') in width and any length, provided its length does not
exceed forty feet (40'). If such vehicle shall be customarily or ordinarily
used as a place of human habitation for more than ninety (90) days in any
eighteen (18) month period, it shall be classed as a mobile home, regardless of
the size and weight limitation provided herein.
VARIANCE: A modification of the literal provisions of this title which would
cause undue hardship owing to circumstances unique to the individual property
on which the variance is granted. The crucial points of variance are: a) undue
hardship, b) unique circumstances, and c) applying to property. The authority
to grant variances is vested in the board of adjustment pursuant to Iowa Code
chapter 414.

the depth of the rear yard, the minimum horizontal distance between the lot
lines and the main building line shall be used.
YARD, FRONT: A yard extending across the front of a lot and being the minimum
horizontal distance between the street or place line and the main building or

elect to front his building on a street parallel to the lot line having the
greater dimension.
YARD, REAR: A yard extending across the rear of a lot and being the required
minimum horizontal distance between the rear lot line and the rear of the main
building line or any projections thereof other than the projections of

and extending from the required front yard to the required rear yard, and being
the minimum horizontal distance between a side lot line and the side of the
main building line or any projections of uncovered steps. (Ord. 1994-92, 6-14-

would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case,
proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be
granted by the board of adjustment or by a court of record on application, on
notice to the administrative officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due
cause shown.

this title; to decide such questions as are involved in determining whether

special exceptions when not in harmony with the purpose and intent of this
title. A special exception shall not be granted by the board of adjustment
unless and until:

granting any special exception, the board of adjustment may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this title. Violation

punishable under section
10-3-8 of this title. The board of adjustment shall prescribe a time limit
within which the action for which the special exception is required shall be
begun or completed, or both. Failure to begin or complete, or both, such action

      1.   Conditions For Granting: The board shall have the authority to
authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this
title as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to the
special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this title would
result in unnecessary hardship. A variance from the terms of this title shall
not be granted by the board of adjustment unless and until a written
application for a variance is submitted demonstrating:
         a.   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not
applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district;
         b.   That literal interpretation of the provisions of this title would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the
same district under the terms of this title;
         c.   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this title to other lands,
structures, or buildings in the same district. No nonconforming use of
neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same district, and no
permitted use of lands, structures or buildings in other districts shall be
considered grounds for the issuance of a variance; and
         d.   That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from
the actions of the applicant.
      2.   Public Hearing; Findings Of Board:
         a.   Notice of public hearing shall be given as in subsection D2 of
this section, and in accordance with the state of Iowa open meetings law 1 .
         b.   The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person,
or by agent or by attorney.
         c.   The board of adjustment shall further make a finding that the
reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance, and
that the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the
reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.
         d.   The board of adjustment shall make findings that the requirements
of subsection E1 of this section have been met by the applicant for a variance.
         e.   The board of adjustment shall further make a finding that the
granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of this title, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise
detrimental to the public welfare.
         f.   The decision of the board shall be recorded in the official
minutes of the board of adjustment meeting.
      3.   Prescribe Conditions And Safeguards; Violations: In granting any
variance, the board of adjustment may prescribe appropriate conditions and
safeguards in conformity with this title. Violations of such conditions and
safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted,
shall be deemed a violation of this title and punishable under section
10-3-8 of this title.
      4.   Board Restrictions: Under no circumstances shall the board of
adjustment grant a variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of
this title in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication
prohibited by the terms of this title in said district. (Ord. 1994-92, 6-14-

exceptions to the regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the
public interest secured; provided, that such variation or exceptions to these
regulations meet the following criteria:

11-3-1: IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED:
The subdivider shall, at his or her expense, install and construct all
improvements required by this title and the technical specifications of Oxford
and as shown on the preliminary plat within the subdivision proper. All
required improvements shall be constructed in accordance with the
aforementioned design standards established for such improvements and shall be
reviewed by the city and the city engineer.
   A.   Urban Renewal Area Exception: The city may consider waiving portions of
this section if all of the following circumstances exist:
      1.   The subdivision is located within an active urban renewal area
eligible for tax increment reimbursement; and
      2.   The subdivider can demonstrate how the city's participation in cost
sharing for improvements within the subdivision will achieve the goals and
objectives of the urban renewal area; and
      3.   The subdivider is prepared to offer the city an infrastructure
improvement, property, or service that is equal or commensurate to the city's
financial contribution and meets the stated goals and objectives of the city's
urban renewal plan.
   B.   Extending Utilities: In some cases, there may be a need to extend
municipal utilities and services to the edge of a subdivision. The city will
decide on a case by case basis as to the financial responsibilities of the
subdivider and the city regarding these utility and service extensions. (Ord.
94-90, 3-8-1994, eff. 3-8-1994)
11-3-2: INSPECTION:

(Ord. 94-90, 3-8-1994, eff. 3-8-1994)
11-3-3: MINIMUM IMPROVEMENTS:
The improvements set forth below shall be considered the minimum improvements
necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
All of the minimum improvements mandated by this chapter shall be designed and
constructed in accordance with the requirements of this title, the Oxford
technical specifications, and the minimum requirements of all applicable state
or federal regulatory agencies or departments.
The subdivider must provide evidence of any and all construction permits,
highway or road easements and access, or other appropriate documentation from
state or federal regulatory agencies prior to approval of the final plat.
Easements from all utility companies will also be required.
The city reserves the right to request changes to a proposed subdivision that
may exceed the municipal capacities for streets, sewer, water, or other
services. In this event, the city may request a proportional fee from the
subdivider, to be determined by the city and the city engineer, for any
required capacity improvements.
   A.   Streets, General:
      1.   The subdivider of land being subdivided shall provide the grading of
the entire street right of way, alley or public place and provide appropriate
paving, including curb and gutter on all streets.
      2.   Under some circumstances, the city may require, as a condition for
approval of the plat, dedication and improvement of a street having a width
greater than necessary to meet the needs of the platted area, but necessary to
complete the city street system as it relates to both the area being platted
and other areas. In such event, the city will pay the subdivider the difference
in cost of improving the wider street and the street width reasonable to meet
the foreseeable needs of the subdivision taken alone. The streets shall, upon
final approval and acceptance by the city, become the property of the city.
   B.   Sanitary Sewer System, General: The subdivider of the land being
platted shall make adequate provision for the disposal of sanitary sewage from
the platted area with due regard being given to present or reasonably
foreseeable needs. There shall be constructed, at the subdivider's expense, a
sanitary sewer system including all necessary pumping stations, pumping
equipment, sewer access holes, and all other necessary or desirable
appurtenances to provide for the discharge of sanitary sewage from all lots or
parcels of land within the platted area to a connection with the city's
sanitary sewer. The city's role in reviewing the plans is to determine the
sanitary sewer's placement, size, and route.
      1.   Under some circumstances, the city may require, as a condition for
approval of the plat, installation of a sanitary sewer that is larger than
necessary to meet the needs of the platted area, but necessary to complete the
city sanitary sewer system as it relates to both the area being platted and
other areas. In such event, the city will pay the subdivider the difference in
cost of pipe and installation between the larger sewer and the diameter of
sewer reasonable to meet the foreseeable needs of the area.
      2.   The subdivider must provide evidence of construction permits from
the Iowa department of natural resources prior to approval of the final plat.
      3.   The above mentioned facilities for the collection and disposal of
sanitary sewage from the platted area shall, upon final approval and acceptance
by the city, become the property of the city.
   C.   Storm Sewer System: The subdivider of land being platted shall install
and construct a storm sewer system adequate to serve the area, including
anticipated extension of use to serve additional areas.
      1.   The stormwater drainage system shall be separated and independent of
any sanitary sewer system. The acceptable standard for sizing storm sewers is
to be a five (5) year, twenty four (24) hour storm event.
      2.   Inlets shall be provided so that surface water is not carried across
or around any intersection, nor for a distance of more than six hundred feet
(600') in the gutter. Under some circumstances, the city may require, as a
condition for approval of the plat, installation of a storm sewer system that
is larger than necessary to meet the needs of the platted area, but necessary
to complete the city storm sewer system as it relates to both the area being
platted and other areas. In such event, the city will pay the subdivider the
difference in cost of pipe and installation between the larger sewer and the
diameter of sewer reasonable to meet the foreseeable needs of the area.
      3.   Storm sewer facilities shall be located in the road right of way
where feasible, or in the perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate
width.
      4.   In the storm sewer design phase, the subdivider shall study the
effect of each subdivision on existing downstream drainage facilities outside
the area of the subdivision. The subdivider's drainage studies together with
such other studies as shall be appropriate shall serve as a guide to needed
improvements. Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff incident to
the development of the subdivision will overload an existing downstream
drainage facility, the city council may withhold approval of the subdivision
until provision has been made for the recovery of the cost for the improvement
of said potential condition in such sum as the governing body shall determine.
No subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be provided to
an adequate drainage watercourse or facility.
      5.   The subdivider must document that adequate storm detention is
included in the storm sewer design. This may require work outside of the
proposed subdivision's boundaries which is the sole responsibility of the
subdivider. The city may require this work to be undertaken to protect
surrounding properties as a condition for approval of the subdivision.
      6.   The storm sewers shall, upon inspection, approval and acceptance by
the city, become the property of the city.
   D.   Water Main System, General: The subdivider of land being platted shall
install and construct a water main system to adequately serve all lots or
parcels of land within the platted area, with due regard to the present and
reasonably foreseeable needs of the entire area, and shall connect the same to
the city's existing water mains. The minimum acceptable standard for water main
design will be the same as the IDNR recommended fire flow of two hundred fifty
(250) gpm with twenty (20) psi residual.
      1.   The subdivider shall install adequate water facilities, and fire
hydrants which shall be subject to city specifications and shall be subject for
review and approval by the Oxford fire chief. The location of all fire hydrants
shall be shown on the preliminary plat.
      2.   All Iowa department of natural resources must be secured prior to
approval of the preliminary plat.
      3.   Under some circumstances, the city may require, as a condition for
approval of the plat, installation of a water main that is larger than
necessary to meet the needs of the platted area, but necessary to complete the
city water distribution system as it relates to both the area being platted and
other areas. In such event, the city will pay the subdivider the difference in
cost of pipe and installation between the larger water main and the diameter of
water main reasonable to meet the foreseeable needs of the area.
      4.   The city's inability to generate, treat, or distribute water may be
grounds for rejection of a proposed subdivision. A proportional fee may be
requested by the city, from the subdivider, to pay for the necessary upgrades
in the water system.
      5.   The water supply improvements shall, upon inspection, approval, and
acceptance by the city, become the property of the city.
   E.   Other Improvements: The owner and subdivider of the land being platted
shall be responsible for the installation of sidewalks within the street area;
the installation of erosion control measures, and the installation of street
lighting. All such improvements shall be under the direction of the city
engineer. (Ord. 94-90, 3-8-1994, eff. 3-8-1994)
11-3-4: EASEMENTS REQUIRED:
   A.   Public Utilities: Where alleys are not provided, or where otherwise
required by the present or future placement of public utilities, easements of
not less than ten feet (10') in width shall be granted by the owner along rear,
and where necessary, along side lot lines for public utility requirements.
Except where prohibited by topography, such easements shall be centered on lot
lines. Easements of greater width may be required along lot lines, or across
lots when necessary for the placement and maintenance of utilities. No
buildings or structures, except as necessary for utilities, shall be permitted
on such easements. All applicable utility companies must approve the required
easements prior to approval of the final plat.
   B.   Easements Along Streams And Watercourses: Wherever any stream or
surface watercourse is located in an area that is being subdivided, the
subdivider shall, at his own expense, make adequate provisions for the proper
drainage of surface water and shall provide and dedicate to the city an
easement equal to the floodway along said stream or watercourse to ensure the
proper maintenance of the watercourse, as approved by the city. (Ord. 94-90, 3-
8-1994, eff. 3-8-1994)
11-3-5: MAINTENANCE BOND REQUIRED:
The owner and subdivider of the land being platted shall be required to provide
to the city, proper maintenance bonds satisfactory to the city, so as to ensure
that for a period of one year from the date of acceptance of any improvement,
the owner and subdivider shall be responsible to maintain such improvement in
good repair. (Ord. 94-90, 3-8-1994, eff. 3-8-1994)

The standards set forth in this title shall be considered the minimum standards
necessary to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare. These
standards should also be considered in accordance with the requirements of
applicable state and federal agencies. In the event that the city's minimum
standards should conflict with applicable state and federal requirements, the
state and federal requirements shall prevail. (Ord. 94-90, 3-8-1994, eff. 3-8-
1994)
11-4-2: LAND SUITABILITY:
   A.   Unsuitable Conditions: No land shall be subdivided that is found to be
unsuitable for subdividing by reason of flooding, ponding, poor drainage,
adverse soil conditions, adverse geological formations, unsatisfactory
topography or other conditions likely to be harmful to the public health,
safety or general welfare, unless such unsuitable conditions are corrected to
the satisfaction of the city.
   B.   Statement Of Reasons: If land is found to be unsuitable for subdivision
for any of the reasons cited in this chapter, the governing body shall state
its reasons in writing and afford the subdivider an opportunity to present data
regarding such unsuitability. Thereafter, the governing body may reaffirm,
modify or withdraw its determination regarding such unsuitability. (Ord. 94-90,

   A.   Compliance With Flood Control Regulations: No subdivision containing
land located in a floodway or a flood hazard area shall be approved by the city
unless it is demonstrated that the subdivision complies with all requirements
of the Oxford floodplain management ordinance (title 12 of this code). No lot
shall be located so as to include land located within a floodway or flood
hazard area unless the lot is of such size and shape that it will contain a
buildable area, not within the floodway or flood hazard area, suitable for
development as allowed by the zone in which the lot is located. Those areas
subject to flooding shall be determined by the U.S. federal emergency
management agency (FEMA) floodplain map for the city.

or a floodway may be included within a plat as follows, subject to the approval
of the city:
      1.   Included within individual lots in the subdivision, subject to the
limitations of this chapter.
      2.   Reserved as open space for recreation use by all owners of lots in
the subdivision, with an appropriate legal instrument, approved by the city,
providing for its care and maintenance by such owners.
      3.   If acceptable to the city, dedicated to the city as public open
space for recreation or flood control purposes. (Ord. 94-90, 3-8-1994, eff. 3-

   A.   Prepare Technical Standards: In addition to the standards set forth in
this title, the city engineer shall from time to time prepare, and the
governing body shall from time to time adopt by resolution, technical standards
for public improvements. Such technical standards for public improvements shall
contain the minimum acceptable specifications for the construction of public
improvements. Such technical standards may vary for classes of improvements,
giving due regard to the classification of streets or other improvements, and
the extent and character of the area served by the improvements.
   B.   Adoption Of Standards: Upon adoption by the governing body by
resolution, such technical standards for public improvements shall have such
force and effect as if they were fully set forth herein. (Ord. 94-90, 3-8-1994,
eff. 3-8-1994)
11-4-6: STREET STANDARDS:
   A.   General: The following standards shall apply to all streets to be
located within the subdivision:
      1.   Streets shall provide for the continuation of arterial and collector
streets from adjoining platted areas, and the extension of such streets into
adjoining unplatted areas. Where a plat encompasses the location for an
arterial or collector street proposed in the community development plan or the
street plan, the plat shall provide for such street.
      2.   Street grades shall align to existing streets, and all grades for
streets shall be as approved by the city.

opening of future streets and adequate utility connections. Easements for the
future openings and extensions for such streets or utilities may, at the
discretion of the governing body, be made a requirement of the plat.
      15.   Streets that are or will become extensions of existing streets
shall be given the same name as the existing streets. New street names shall
not be the same or sound similar to existing street names. All street names
shall be at the approval of the governing body.
      16.   Private streets shall be prohibited. The governing body may approve
a variance to this rule where unusual conditions make a private street
desirable, provided adequate covenants or other legal documents ensure that the
city will not have or need to assume any maintenance or other responsibility
for such street.

(Ord. 94-90, 3-8-1994, eff. 3-8-1994)
11-4-8: PARKS AND OPEN SPACES:
All residential subdivisions should be so designed as to meet the neighborhood
park and open space needs of their residents. The following standards and
procedures will be used to determine the park and open space requirements for
all proposed residential developments or subdivisions greater than one-half (1/
2) acre in size within the city:
   A.   Manner Of Providing: For all residential developments and subdivisions,
the subdivider shall be responsible for providing adequate park and open space
in one or both of the following ways, depending on the decision of the city:
      1.   If it is feasible and compatible with the community development plan
of the city, as determined by the city council upon the recommendation of the
planning and zoning commission, the subdivider will be required to dedicate and
reserve an area for parks and open space, without cost to the city.
         a.   The amount of land shall be determined by first calculating the
entire size of the land area of the proposed development as shown on the
preliminary plat or site plan and then to require dedication or reservation of
five percent (5%) of this amount for parks and open space.
         b.   This area shall be denoted on the final plat prior to approval of
the final plat.
      2.   Where such dedication is not feasible or compatible with the
community development plan, as determined by the city council upon
recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, the subdivider shall, in
lieu thereof, pay to the city a fee or combination of fee and land, equivalent
to the value of the required dedication or reservation to be determined and
used in the following manner:
         a.   The city council, upon recommendation of the planning and zoning
commission, shall determine the size of the land area which it would have
required to set aside for parks and open space (5 percent of the total land
area).
         b.   The cash value of said land shall be determined by taking the
total purchase price or cost of all the land in the proposed subdivision and
charge the owner the proportionate value of the land area so designated; based
upon such purchase price or cost; provided such purchase price or cost is the
current fair and reasonable value of the land. If such purchase price or cost
does not reflect the current fair value of the land, the fair value of said
land shall be determined by an impartial appraisal, and in such manner as may
be designated by the city council, cost for said appraisal to be shared equally
between the subdivider and the city.
         c.   All funds so levied, assessed, and collected by the city shall be
deposited in a special fund to be known as the "special fund for the
acquisition and development of public service areas, open space and
recreational facilities", and said funds so levied and collected shall be used
for such purposes at such places and in such a manner as shall be approved,
ordered and directed by a recreation committee appointed by the city council.
Any interest accumulated upon such funds shall be added to the "special fund"
and be used only for acquisition and developments of open space and
recreational facilities.
   B.   Council Determination: At the time of the preliminary plat approval,
the city council, upon recommendation by the planning and zoning commission,
shall determine whether to require a dedication of land within the subdivision
or the payment of a fee, in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, from the
subdivider, for parks and open space.
   C.   Warranty Deed Or Deposit: Where a dedication is required, it shall be
accomplished with a properly executed warranty deed dedicating the required
land to the city without cost to the city. Where a fee, in lieu of dedication,
is required, the fee shall be deposited with the city clerk. Whichever action
is required, it shall be accomplished prior to the approval of the final plat.
   D.   Determining Factors: The determination by the city of whether to
require dedication of land, or a fee, in lieu thereof, shall be based on the
following:
      1.   Recreational element of the city's community development plan.
      2.   Topographic and geologic conditions and access and location of land
in subdivision available for dedication.
      3.   Size and shape of the subdivision and land available for dedication.
      4.   The relation of the subdivision to the community development plan
map, particularly as such plan map may show proposed public service areas, open
space and recreational areas.
      5.   The character and recreational needs of the neighborhood in which
the subdivision is located.
      6.   The unsuitability in the subdivision for open space and recreational
purposes by reason of location, access, greater cost of development and
maintenance.
      7.   The possibility that land immediately adjoining the subdivision will
serve in whole or in part the public service area, open space, and recreational
needs of such subdivision.
      8.   Any and all other information relevant to a proper determination.
The determination of the city council as to whether land shall be dedicated or
reserved or a fee shall be charged, or a combination thereof, shall be final
and conclusive. (Ord. 94-90, 3-8-1994, eff. 3-8-1994)
11-4-9: PARKS AND SCHOOL SITES RESERVED:
When a tract being subdivided includes lands proposed to be parks or school
sites in the community development plan or other official plan of the city, the
subdivider shall indicate such areas on the plat.
   A.   Park Sites: Proposed park sites shall be reserved for three (3) years,
giving the city or other authorized public agency the option to purchase the
land at the appraised raw land value prior to the subdivision as established by
a certified land appraiser. The purchase price shall also include one-half (1/
2) of the cost for grading and paving, including curbs, of the portion of any
streets that are contiguous to the site and any taxes and interest incurred by
the subdivider between the date of reservation and date of purchase by the
public agency. Should the park site not be purchased within three (3) years,
the subdivider may then amend the final plat.
   B.   School Sites: Proposed school sites shall be reserved for three (3)
years, giving the appropriate school district the option to purchase the land
at the appraised raw land value prior to the subdivision as established by a
certified land appraiser. The purchase price shall also include one-half (1/2)
of the cost for grading and paving, including curbs, of the portion of any
streets that are contiguous to the site and any taxes and interest incurred by
the subdivider between the date of reservation and date of purchase by the
school district. Should the school sites not be purchased within three (3)
years, the subdivider may then amend the final plat. (Ord. 94-90, 3-8-1994,
eff. 3-8-1994)
11-4-10: NONRESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS:
The following provisions shall apply to nonresidential subdivisions:
   A.   General: If a proposed subdivision includes land that is used for
commercial or industrial purposes, the layout of the subdivision with respect
to such land may be subject to additional provisions as the governing body may
require. A nonresidential subdivision shall be subject to all the requirements
of these regulations, as well as such additional standards required by the
governing body, and shall conform to the proposed land use and standards
established in city plans and regulations.
   B.   Standards: In addition to the principles and standards in these
regulations, which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the
subdivider shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the street,
parcel, and block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the uses
anticipated and takes into account other uses in the vicinity. The following
principles and standards shall be observed:
      1.   Proposed industrial or commercial parcels shall be suitable in area
and dimensions to the following minimum requirements:
         a.   Commercial; area: Ten thousand (10,000) square feet.
         b.   Industrial; area: Ten thousand (10,000) square feet.
      2.   Street rights of way and pavement shall be adequate to accommodate
the type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated thereupon.
      3.   Special requirements may be imposed by the city with respect to the
installation of public utilities, including water, sewer, and stormwater
drainage.
      4.   Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas
from potential nuisance from a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision,
including the provision of extra depth in parcels backing up on existing or
potential residential development and provisions for a permanently landscaped
buffer strip when necessary.
      5.   Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic,
shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or
potential residential areas. (Ord. 94-90, 3-8-1994, eff. 3-8-1994)

12-1-1: LEGAL AUTHORITY:
The legislature of the state of Iowa has in Iowa Code chapter 364, as amended,
delegated the power to cities to exercise any power and perform any function it
deems appropriate to protect and preserve the rights, privileges and property
of the city or of its residents, and to preserve and improve the peace, safety,
health, welfare, comfort and convenience of its residents. (Ord. 2002-104, 8-
27-2002)
12-1-2: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The flood hazard areas of Oxford are subject to periodic inundation
which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of
the community.
   B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by:
      1.   The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood
damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately
elevated or otherwise protected from flooding; and
      2.   The cumulative effect of obstructions on the floodplain causing
increases in flood heights and velocities. (Ord. 2002-104, 8-27-2002)
12-1-3: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and preserve the rights,
privileges and property of the city and its residents and to preserve and
improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and convenience of its
residents by minimizing those flood losses described in subsection 12-1-2A of
this chapter with provisions designed to:
   A.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
   B.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
   C.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
   D.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the national flood insurance
program. (Ord. 2002-104, 8-27-2002)

floodway area will not cumulatively increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood by more than one foot (1').
FLOODWAY FRINGE: Those portions of the floodplain, other than the floodway,
which can be filled, leveed, or otherwise obstructed without causing
substantially higher flood levels or flow velocities.

flood". This land is identified as zone A, AE, A1-A30, AO and AH on the
community's flood insurance rate map.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other
improvement, was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The
actual start means either the first placement or permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of
pile, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation;
or the placement of a factory built home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: Anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the
ground, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories, sheds, cabins,
factory built homes, storage tanks, and other similar uses.

of the following criteria:
   A.   Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure either: 1) before the "start of construction" of the improvement, or
2) if the structure has been "substantially damaged" and is being restored,
before the damage occurred. The term does not, however, include any project for
improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure
safe conditions for the existing use. The term also does not include any
alteration of a "historic structure", provided the alteration will not preclude
the structure's designation as a "historic structure".
   B.   Any addition which increases the original floor area of a building by
twenty five percent (25%) or more. All additions constructed after August 20,
2002, shall be added to any proposed addition in determining whether the total
increase in original floor space would exceed twenty five percent (25%).
VARIANCE: A grant of relief by a community from the terms of the floodplain
management regulations.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. (Ord. 2002-
104, 8-27-2002)
12-1-5: INTERPRETATION:
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall
be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of
the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other
powers granted by state statutes. (Ord. 2002-104, 8-27-2002)
12-1-6: COMPLIANCE REQUIRED:
No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall be located,
extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the
terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations which apply to uses
within the jurisdiction of this chapter. (Ord. 2002-104, 8-27-2002)
12-1-7: LANDS TO WHICH REGULATIONS APPLY:
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all lands and uses which have
significant flood hazards. The flood insurance rate map (FIRM), panels 131,
133, and 135, dated February 16, 2007, which were prepared as part of the
Johnson County, city of Oxford flood insurance study, shall be used to identify
such flood hazard areas and all areas shown thereon to be within the boundaries
of the 100-year flood shall be considered as having significant flood hazards.
Where uncertainty exists with respect to the precise location of the 100-year
flood boundary, the location shall be determined on the basis of the 100-year

12-1-10: GENERAL FLOODPLAIN STANDARDS:
All uses must be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and meet the
following applicable performance standards. Where 100-year flood data has not
been provided in the flood insurance study, the Iowa department of natural
resources shall be contacted to determine: a) whether the land involved is
either wholly or partly within the floodway or floodway fringe and b) the 100-
year flood level. The applicant will be responsible for providing the
department of natural resources with sufficient technical information to make
such determination.
   A.   All Development: All development within the areas of significant flood
hazard shall:
      1.   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
      2.   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.

governmental agencies including approval when required from the Iowa department
of natural resources.
   B.   Residential Buildings:
      1.   All new or substantially improved residential structures shall have
the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum of one foot (1') above
the 100-year flood level. Construction shall be upon compacted fill which
shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot (1') above the 100-year flood
level and extend at such elevation at least eighteen feet (18') beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers) may be allowed subject to favorable consideration by the city
council, where existing topography, street grades, or other factors preclude
elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods used must be adequate to support
the structure as well as withstand the various forces and hazards associated
with flooding.
      2.   All new residential structures shall be provided with a means of
access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the 100-year flood.

nonresidential buildings shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot (1') above the 100-year flood level, or together
with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level.
When floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the state
of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and
other factors associated with the 100-year flood; and that the structure, below
the 100-year flood level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to national geodetic vertical datum) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the administrator.
   D.   New And Substantially Improved Structures: The following shall be
required for all new and substantially improved structures:
      1.   Fully enclosed areas below the "lowest floor" (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
         a.   A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
         b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot (1')
above grade.
         c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access and
low damage potential storage.
      2.   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
      3.   New and substantially improved structures must be constructed with

other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding.
   E.   Factory Built Homes:
      1.   All factory built homes, including those placed in existing factory
built home parks or subdivisions, shall be elevated on a permanent foundation
such that the lowest floor of the structure is a minimum of one foot (1') above
the 100-year flood level.
      2.   All factory built homes, including those placed in existing factory
built home parks or subdivisions, shall be anchored to resist flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not
limited to, use of over the top or frame ties to ground anchors.
   F.   Utility And Sanitary Systems:
      1.   On site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located or
designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
      2.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system as well as
the discharge of effluent into floodwaters. Wastewater treatment facilities
(other than on site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood protection
equal to or greater than one foot (1') above the 100-year flood elevation.
      3.   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. Water supply
treatment facilities (other than on site systems) shall be provided with a
level of protection equal to or greater than one foot (1') above the 100-year
flood elevation.
      4.   Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
   G.   Storage Of Materials And Equipment: Storage of materials and equipment
that are flammable, explosive or injurious to human, animal or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot (1') above the 100-year flood
level. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or: 1)
not be subject to major flood damage and be anchored to prevent movement due to
floodwaters or 2) be readily removable from the area within the time available
after flood warning.
   H.   Flood Control Structural Works: Flood control structural works such as
levees, floodwalls, etc., shall provide, at a minimum, protection from a 100-
year flood with a minimum of three feet (3') of design freeboard and shall
provide for adequate interior drainage. In addition, structural flood control
works shall be approved by the department of natural resources.
   I.   Watercourse Alterations Or Relocations: Watercourse alterations or
relocations must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the
altered or relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations must
be approved by the department of natural resources.
   J.   Subdivisions And Factory Built Home Parks And Subdivisions:
Subdivisions (including factory built home parks and subdivisions) shall be
consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and shall have adequate
drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage. Development associated
with subdivision proposals (including the installation of public utilities)
shall meet the applicable performance standards of this chapter. Subdivision
proposals intended for residential use shall provide all lots with a means of
access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the 100-year flood.
Proposals for subdivisions greater than five (5) acres or fifty (50) lots
(whichever is less) shall include 100-year flood elevation data for those areas
located within the area of significant flood hazard.
   K.   Accessory Structures:
      1.   Detached garages, sheds, and similar structures accessory to a
residential use are exempt from the 100-year flood elevation requirements where
the following criteria are satisfied:
         a.   The structure shall not be used for human habitation.
         b.   The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential.
         c.   The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building
site so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
         d.   The structure shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation which
may result in damage to other structures.
         e.   The structure's service facilities such as electrical and heating
equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot (1') above the
100-year flood level.
      2.   Exemption from the 100-year flood elevation requirements for such a
structure may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of
the structure and its contents.
   L.   Recreational Vehicles:
      1.   Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of subsection
E of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory built homes when
the following criteria are satisfied:
         a.   The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less
than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days; and
         b.   The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
      2.   Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than one
hundred eighty (180) consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must
satisfy requirements of subsection E of this section regarding anchoring and
elevation of factory built homes.
   M.   Pipeline River And Stream Crossings: Pipeline river and stream
crossings shall be buried in the stream bed and banks, or otherwise
sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due to channel degradation and
meandering. (Ord. 2002-104, 8-27-2002)
12-1-11: SPECIAL FLOODWAY PROVISIONS:
In addition to the general floodplain standards, uses within the floodway must
meet the following applicable standards. The floodway is that portion of the
floodplain which must be protected from developmental encroachment to allow the
free flow of floodwaters. Where floodway data has been provided in the flood
insurance study, such data shall be used to define the floodway. Where no
floodway data has been provided, the department of natural resources shall be
contacted to provide a floodway delineation. The applicant will be responsible
for providing the department of natural resources with sufficient technical
information to make such determination.
   A.   No use shall be permitted in the floodway that would result in any
increase in the 100-year flood level. Consideration of the effects of any
development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption that an equal
degree of development would be allowed for similarly situated lands.
   B.   All uses within the floodway shall:
      1.   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
      2.   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
      3.   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
   C.   No use shall affect the capacity or conveyance of the channel or
floodway of any tributary to the main stream, drainage ditch or any other
drainage facility or system.
   D.   Structures, buildings and sanitary and utility systems, if permitted,
shall meet the applicable general floodplain standards and shall be constructed
or aligned to present the minimum possible resistance to flood flows.
   E.   Buildings, if permitted, shall have a low flood damage potential and
shall not be for human habitation.
   F.   Storage of materials or equipment that are buoyant, flammable,
explosive or injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited. Storage of
other material may be allowed if readily removable from the floodway within the
time available after flood warning.
   G.   Watercourse alterations or relocation (channel changes and
modifications) must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within
the altered or relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations
must be approved by the department of natural resources.
   H.   Any fill allowed in the floodway must be shown to have some beneficial
purpose and shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary.
   I.   Pipeline river or stream crossings shall be buried in the stream bed
and banks or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due to channel
degradation and meandering or due to the action of flood flows. (Ord. 2002-104,
8-27-2002)
12-1-12: SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR SHALLOW FLOODING AREAS:
In addition to the general floodplain standards, uses within shallow flooding
areas must meet the following applicable standards:
   A.   In shallow flooding areas designated as an AO zone on the flood
insurance rate map (FIRM), the minimum floodproofing/flood protection elevation
shall be equal to the number of feet as specified on the FIRM (or a minimum of
2 feet if no number is specified) above the highest natural grade adjacent to
the structure.
   B.   In shallow flooding areas designated as an AH zone on the flood
insurance rate map, the minimum floodproofing/flood protection elevation shall
be equal to the elevation as specified on the FIRM. (Ord. 2002-104, 8-27-2002)
12-1-13: VARIANCES:
   A.   Standards For Granting Variances: The city council may authorize, upon
request in specific cases, such variances from the terms of this chapter that
will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in
unnecessary hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable
standards:
      1.   Variances shall only be granted upon: a) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, b) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and c) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
      2.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the 100-year flood would result. Consideration
of the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
      3.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      4.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the administrator
that: a) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty five dollars ($25.00) for one
hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage, and b) such construction
increases risks to life and property.
      5.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
department of natural resources.
   B.   Factors Upon Which Council Decision Based: In passing upon applications
for variances, the council shall consider all relevant factors specified in
other sections of this chapter, and:
      1.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
      2.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other land or downstream
to the injury of others.
      3.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.
      4.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      5.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the city.
      6.   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
      7.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
      8.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
      9.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for the area.
      10.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      11.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwater expected at the site.
      12.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and bridges.
      13.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
chapter.
   C.   Conditions Attached To Variances: Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the council may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such
conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
      1.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
      2.   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
      3.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
      4.   Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
department of natural resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this chapter.
      5.   Floodproofing measures. (Ord. 2002-104, 8-27-2002)
12-1-14: NONCONFORMING USES:
   A.   Conditions For Continuance: A structure or the use of a structure or
premises which was lawful before the passage or amendment of this chapter, but
which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be
continued subject to the following conditions:
      1.   If such use is discontinued for six (6) consecutive months, any
future use of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
      2.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
   B.   Destruction: If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any
means, including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than
fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred, unless it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter. This limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply
with existing state or local health, sanitary, building or safety codes or
regulations or the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the national
register of historic places; provided, that the alteration shall not preclude
its continued designation. (Ord. 2002-104, 8-27-2002)
12-1-15: AMENDMENTS:
The regulations and standards set forth in this chapter may from time to time
be amended, supplemented, changed, or repealed. No amendment, supplement,
change, or modification shall be undertaken without prior approval of the
department of natural resources. (Ord. 2002-104, 8-27-2002)
12-1-16: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes
greater restrictions, the provision of this chapter shall prevail. All other
ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of
the inconsistency only. (Ord. 2002-104, 8-27-2002)
12-1-17: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The standards required by this chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes. This chapter does not imply that areas outside the designated areas
of significant flood hazard will be free from flooding or flood damages. This
chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. (Ord. 2002-
104, 8-27-2002)
12-1-18: VIOLATION; PENALTY:
Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
the requirements shall constitute a simple misdemeanor or municipal infraction.
Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful
action as is necessary to prevent or remedy violation. (Ord. 2002-104, 8-27-
2002)
