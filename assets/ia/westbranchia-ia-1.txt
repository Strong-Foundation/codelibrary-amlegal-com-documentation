trees whose branches, limbs, roots, or other parts extend into or over the
street right-of-way. The property owner is responsible for ensuring private
trees are trimmed to sufficient height to allow free passage of pedestrians and
vehicular travel and so they will not obstruct or shade streetlights, traffic
lights, signs or any traffic control devices or the view of any street
intersection. Detailed information is contained in the Cityâ€™s Arboricultural
Specifications and Standards of Practice. If it becomes necessary to trim trees
or shrubs on private property to comply with this chapter, the City Forester
shall declare the tree or shrub a nuisance. Whenever the City Forester is
notified or becomes aware of a dead or diseased tree or broken or dead branch
or limb in any private tree which is in imminent danger of falling and thereby
injuring any individual or causing property damage to adjacent property, the
City Forester may declare the tree, branch, or limb a hazard and order the
property owner to remove the hazard in an expedient manner. If the property
owner fails to remove the hazard, the City Forester may cause the hazard to be
removed. For purposes of removing the hazard, City crews or agents shall be
allowed on private property. Attempts should be made to notify the property
owner before entering onto private property.
2.Â Â Â Traffic Control. In the event the planting, maintenance or removal of any
private tree requires equipment or material to be located on or fall onto the
street right-of-way, the homeowner or the homeownerâ€™s agent shall provide for
traffic control. All traffic control shall conform to the requirements and
specifications of the current edition of the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control
Devices (MUTCD). In all cases the disruption of smooth traffic flow shall be
kept to a minimum. Additional warning devices or precautionary measures may be
necessary to control pedestrian traffic.
28.07Â Â Â ENFORCEMENT.
1.Â Â Â Appeals. Any person who receives an order from the City Forester and
objects to all or part of the order may, within ten days of the receipt of the
order, notify the City Forester and City Tree Board in writing of the nature of
the objection and request a hearing on the order thereon. The hearing shall be
held within 30 days of notice to the appellant. Within ten days the Chair of
the Tree Board shall notify the appellant and City Forester of the final
decision.

interfere with the City Forester or any assistants in the execution or
enforcement of this chapter.

chapter, the injury, mutilation or death of a tree, shrub or other plant
located on City-owned property is caused, the cost of repair or replacement of

For purposes of this chapter the following terms are defined:
1.Â Â Â â€œCleanupâ€ means actions necessary to contain, collect, control, identify,

substance.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[1])
2.Â Â Â â€œHazardous conditionâ€ means any situation involving the actual, imminent,

36.03Â Â Â CLEANUP REQUIRED.
Whenever a hazardous condition is created by the deposit, injection, dumping,

or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters, including ground
waters, the responsible person shall cause the condition to be remedied by a
cleanup, as defined in the preceding section, as rapidly as feasible to an

accomplishing the cleanup and stating that the City will proceed to procure
cleanup services and bill the responsible person for all costs associated with
the cleanup if the cleanup is not accomplished within the deadline. In the
event that it is determined that immediate cleanup is necessary as a result of
the present danger to the public health, safety, and welfare, then no notice
shall be required and the City may proceed to procure the cleanup and bill the
responsible person for all costs associated with the cleanup. If the bill for
those services is not paid within 30 days, the City Attorney shall proceed to

46.02 Cigarettes and Tobacco Â 
Â 
46.01Â Â Â CURFEW.
The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote the
public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and specifically
to (i) reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults responsible
for minors; (ii) protect the public from the illegal acts of minors committed
after the curfew hour; and (iii) protect minors from improper influences and
criminal activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.
1.Â Â Â Definitions. For use in this section, the following terms are defined:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â â€œEmergency errandâ€ means, but is not limited to, an errand relating to
a fire, a natural disaster, an automobile accident or any other situation
requiring immediate action to prevent serious illness, bodily injury, or loss
of life.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â â€œKnowinglyâ€ means knowledge that a responsible adult should reasonably
be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that responsible
adultâ€™s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful or careless
adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult responsibility
through an objective test. It is therefore no defense that an adult responsible
for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or
whereabouts of the minor.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â â€œMinorâ€ means any unemancipated person under the age of 18 years.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â â€œNonsecured custodyâ€ means custody in an unlocked multipurpose area,

or used as a secure detention area, and the person arrested is not physically
secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically
accompanied by a law enforcement officer or a person employed by the facility
where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to
providing nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate
juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the personâ€™s
parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but
not for longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or
magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â â€œPublic placeâ€ includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys, and sidewalks dedicated to public use and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises, whether publicly or privately owned,
that are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited
commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is
permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has
access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is
considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â â€œResponsible adultâ€ means a parent, guardian or other adult
specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have
custody or control of a minor.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â â€œUnemancipatedâ€ means unmarried or still under the custody or control
of a responsible adult.
2.Â Â Â Curfew Established. A curfew applicable to minors is established and shall
be enforced as follows. No minor shall be in any public place during the
following times:

3.Â Â Â Exceptions. The following are exceptions to the curfew:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The minor is accompanied by a responsible adult.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The minor is on the sidewalk or property where the minor resides or on
either side of the place where the minor resides and the adult responsible for
the minor has given permission for the minor to be there.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The minor is present at or is traveling between home and one of the
following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Minorâ€™s place of employment in a business, trade or occupation in
which the minor is permitted by law to be engaged or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of work;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Minorâ€™s place of religious activity or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of the religious activity;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Governmental or political activity or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of the activity;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â School activity or, if traveling, within one hour after the end or

the U.S. Constitution guarantees of free exercise of religion, freedom of
speech, freedom of assembly or, if traveling, within one hour after the end or
before the beginning of the activity.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â The minorâ€™s business, trade or occupation, in which the minor is
permitted by law to be engaged, requires the presence of the minor in the
public place.

knowingly to permit or to allow a minor to be in any public place in the City
within the time periods prohibited by this section unless the minorâ€™s presence
falls within one of the above exceptions.
5.Â Â Â Enforcement Procedures.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in the
absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driverâ€™s license,
a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance, use his
or her best judgment in determining age.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody. Grounds for arrest are that
the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the personâ€™s
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any nonsecured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into
custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into custody,
the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the minor as
soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible for the
minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at such
time as the court may direct.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minorâ€™s parent, guardian or other person
legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the
law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative
of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person
who is known to the child.
6.Â Â Â Penalties.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Responsible Adultâ€™s First Violation. In the case of a first violation
by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall, by certified mail, send to the
adult responsible for the minor, written notice of the violation with a warning
that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew
ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with applicable
penalties.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Responsible Adultâ€™s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as defined
in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows the minor
to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a simple
misdemeanor.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Minorâ€™s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a minor,
the law enforcement officer shall give the minor a written warning, which
states that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the
curfew ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with applicable
penalties.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Minorâ€™s Second Violation. For the minorâ€™s second and subsequent
violations of any of the provisions of this section, the minor is guilty of a

of the personâ€™s employment and said person is employed by a person who holds a
valid permit under Chapter 453A of the Code of Iowa or who lawfully offers for

2.Â Â Â Filth or Noisome Substance. Causing or suffering any offal, filth or

occupant shall keep that part of the exterior or interior portion of the
premises which such occupant controls, in a clean, safe, and sanitary condition
so as to protect the life, health and safety of any occupants or of the public.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Containment Systems. In any event where a sewage spill or overflow
occurs from any sewer, septic system, portable toilet, holding tank, sewage or

50.05Â Â Â RIGHT OF ENTRY FOR INSPECTION.
Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any ordinance or whenever

City, any authorized official of the City, or his or her designee, upon
presentation of proper credentials, may enter the building or premises at all
reasonable times to inspect the same or to perform any duty imposed upon the
official by this Code of Ordinances. Except in emergency situations or when

and for the County, pursuant to Code of Iowa Section 808.14, for an
administrative search warrant. No owner, operator or occupant or any other

search warrant, to permit entry therein by the municipal officer, designee or

50.07Â Â Â NUISANCE ABATEMENT.
1.Â Â Â Whenever the Building Official or Code Enforcement Official(s) as
designated by the City Administrator, finds that a nuisance exists, such
officer shall cause to be served upon the property owner a written notice to
abate the nuisance within a reasonable time after notice.
2.Â Â Â In cases where a property owner or a tenant has had a nuisance violation
notice served to them for a nuisance at that specific property location or
address that they own or lease within the corporate limits of the City within
the last year (365 days), a citation may be issued immediately for the creation
of a nuisance as stated in Section
50.04, at the time of the inspection, or, at the time of notification of a
violation; thus foregoing any warning/grace period.
3.Â Â Â With regard to grass nuisance citations as prescribed in Section
50.02(10), property owners found in violation will receive one warning/grace
period a season. Hence after notice the City has the right to abate the
violation immediately. The abatement expense shall be billed and accompanied
with photos showing before and after the abatement.
4.Â Â Â With regard to snow and ice nuisance citations as prescribed in Section
136.03, property owners found in violation will receive one warning/grace

50.08Â Â Â NOTICE TO ABATE; CONTENTS.
The notice to abate shall contain:

2.Â Â Â Location of Nuisance. The location of the nuisance.
3.Â Â Â Acts Necessary to Abate. A statement of the act or acts necessary to abate
the nuisance.
4.Â Â Â Reasonable Time. A reasonable time within which to complete the abatement.
A nuisance notification shall require seven days to abate the nuisance after
receipt of notification. If the nuisance is not abated within the seven-day
period, then the property will be placarded as a nuisance and a posting of the
nuisance notification shall be affixed to a structure, or a conspicuous place
upon the property. The nuisance posting shall require two days for abatement
after the posting occurs. If the nuisance is not abated within this two-day
period then the City will cause the nuisance to be abated under the provisions
of Section
50.12.
5.Â Â Â Assessment of City Costs. A statement that if the nuisance or condition is
not abated as directed and no request for hearing is made within the time
prescribed, the City will abate it and assess the costs against such person.
50.09Â Â Â METHOD OF SERVICE.
The notice may be in the form of this adopted ordinance or sent by certified
mail to the property as per Code of Iowa Section 364.12[3h]. It is not
necessary to do both, but is desired. If service is made by certified mail the
reasonable time for abatement shall not be deemed to have started until such
time as the certified mail is either collected by the property owner, tenant,
or their agent or the certified mail is returned by the post office to the City
after expiration of time for retrieval. The use of ordinance or certified mail
does not prohibit the use of any other manner of service as allowed under the
Iowa Rules of Civil Procedure. If the property owner does not accept certified
mail or any other permissible attempt at notification, or perform necessary
action required under this subsection within a reasonable time after notice,
the City may perform the required action and assess the costs against the
property for collection in the same manner as a property tax. Notice may be in
the form of an ordinance or by certified mail to the property owner as shown by
the records of the County Auditor, and shall state the time within which action
is required. However, in an emergency a City may perform any action which may
be required under this section without prior notice, and assess the costs as
provided in this subsection, after notice to the property owner and hearing.
50.10Â Â Â REQUEST FOR HEARING.
Any person ordered to abate a nuisance may have a hearing with the Nuisance
Hearing Committee as to whether a nuisance exists. A request for a hearing must
be made in writing and delivered to the City Administrator's Office responsible
for ordering the abatement within the time stated in the notice, or it will be
conclusively presumed that a nuisance exists and it must be abated as ordered.
At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing committee shall render a written
or recorded decision as to whether a nuisance exists. If the hearing committee
finds that a nuisance exists, the Building Official or designee of the City
Administrator must order it abated within a time, which must be reasonable
under the circumstances. If the hearing committee does not find that a nuisance
exists that matter will be considered closed. At the hearing, code enforcement
designee or employee and the person to whom the notice of abatement was issued
are parties to the hearing and each may testify, call witnesses and offer
evidence and argument relevant to the issues described by or contained within
the notice of abatement. The findings of the hearing committee shall be
conclusive and, if a nuisance is found to exist, it shall be ordered abated
within a reasonable time under the circumstances. Any further appeal or appeal
of the hearing committee's decision may be had by filing a claim with the
district court.
50.11Â Â Â ABATEMENT IN EMERGENCY.

maintenance of the nuisance or condition, the City may perform any action which
may be required under this chapter without prior notice. The Building Official
or Code Enforcement Official(s) as designated by the City Administrator shall
make a determination as to whether or not an emergency exists based upon:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Inability to contact the property owner by normal efforts;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The seriousness of the violation due to health hazards or physical
hazards to a private individual or to the public as determined by the Building
and Neighborhood Services Official.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Frequency of violations of a property owner or a tenant when the
property owner or a tenant has received more than two nuisance violation
notifications within one calendar year. This determination is in effect for one
calendar year beginning on the date of the most recent nuisance violation
notification.
2.Â Â Â The City shall assess the costs as provided in Section
50.13 after notice to the property owner under the applicable provisions of
Sections
50.07,
50.08, and
50.09 and hearing as provided in Section
50.10.
3.Â Â Â In the event that Section
50.15 is determined to be an emergency by Building Official or Code Enforcement
Official(s) as designated by the City Administrator, or the Public Health
Official of Cedar County or Johnson County of Iowa, Building Official or Code
Enforcement Official(s) as designated by the City Administrator is authorized
to placard the structure as a dangerous building according to
Chapter 157, and to order vacation of the building and securing of all
equipment and structures so as not to constitute an attractive nuisance. This
section applies to all structures residential and non-residential.
50.12Â Â Â ABATEMENT BY CITY.
If the person notified to abate a nuisance or condition neglects or fails to
abate as directed, the City may perform, or cause to be performed, the required
action to abate, keeping an accurate account of the expense incurred. The
itemized expense account shall be filed with the Clerk who shall pay such
expenses on behalf of the City.
50.13Â Â Â COLLECTION OF COSTS.
The Clerk shall send a statement of the total expense incurred by regular mail
to the property owner who has failed to abide by the notice to abate, and if
the amount shown by the statement has not been paid within one month, the Clerk
shall certify the costs to the County Treasurer and such costs shall then be
collected with, and in the same manner, as general property taxes.
50.14Â Â Â INSTALLMENT PAYMENT OF COST OF ABATEMENT.
If the amount expended to abate the nuisance or condition exceeds $500.00, the
City may permit the assessment to be paid in up to ten annual installments, to
be paid in the same manner and with the same interest rates provided for
assessments against benefited property under state law.
50.15Â Â Â FAILURE TO ABATE.
Any person causing or maintaining a nuisance who shall fail or refuse to abate
or remove the same within the reasonable time required and specified in the
notice to abate is in violation of this Code of Ordinances.
50.16Â Â Â INTERFERENCE.
Interference with the lawful removal or abatement of a nuisance by the City or
its agents is prohibited and any person who violates this section is guilty of
a simple misdemeanor and may be fined and or imprisoned as law allows.
50.17Â Â Â LIABILITY.
The owners, agents, contract buyers, tenants, or lessees of all residential
dwellings, commercial establishments, or real estate upon which a violation of
this chapter is found shall be jointly and severally responsible for compliance
with this chapter and jointly and severally liable for any damages or costs
incurred and awarded under this chapter.
50.18Â Â Â FORECLOSURE/RENTAL PROPERTY.
Any real property which is subject to foreclosure, forcible entry and detainer,
eviction, or on which possession is otherwise transferred through legal process
or court action, shall be in full compliance with the Code of Ordinances within
48 hours of the transfer of possession. Failure to comply with the provisions
of this section shall be deemed an emergency. The City is authorized to proceed
in a manner consistent with the emergency provision set forth in this chapter.
Any person, firm partnership, corporation, or other legal entity, including the
property owner and, if applicable, a landlord, violating this section if guilty
of a misdemeanor. Any violation of this chapter may be pursued as a municipal
infraction according to the terms of Sections
50.21(2) and (3) below in lieu of criminal prosecution. Each calendar day a
violation is allowed to continue shall constitute a separate and distinct
violation.
50.19Â Â Â ABANDONED PROPERTY.
The following subsections outline the process in which the City may gain title
to abandoned or unsafe buildings:
1.Â Â Â In lieu of the procedures in Sections 657A.2 through 657A.10 of the Code
of Iowa, abandoned buildings located in the City of West Branch may be
petitioned to the court to enter judgment awarding title to the abandoned
property to the City. A petition filed under this section shall include the
legal description of the abandoned property. If more than one abandoned
building is located on a parcel of real estate, the City may combine the
actions into one petition. The owner of the building and grounds, mortgagees of
record, lienholders of record, or other known persons who hold an interest in
the property shall be named as respondents on the petition.
2.Â Â Â The petition shall be filed in the district court of the county in which
the property is located. Service on the owner and any other named respondents
shall be by personal service or certified mail or, if service cannot be made by
either method, by posting the notice in a conspicuous place on the building and
by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the City. The action
shall be in equity.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Not sooner than 60 days after the filing of the petition, the City may
request a hearing on the petition.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In determining whether a property has been abandoned, the court shall
consider the following for each building that is located on the property and
named in the petition and the building grounds:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Whether any property taxes or special assessments on the property
were delinquent at the time the petition was filed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Whether any utilities are currently being provided to the property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Whether the building is unoccupied by the owner or lessees or
licensees of the owner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Whether the building meets the City's housing code as being fit for
human habitation, occupancy, or use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Whether the building meets the City's building code as being fit
for occupancy or use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Whether the building is exposed to the elements such that
deterioration of the building is occurring.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Whether the building is boarded up or otherwise secured from
unauthorized entry.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Past efforts to rehabilitate the building and grounds.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â Whether those claiming an interest in the property have, prior to
the filing of the petition, demonstrated a good-faith effort to restore the
property to productive use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â The presence of vermin, accumulation of debris, and uncut
vegetation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â The effort expended by the petitioning City to maintain the
building and grounds.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (12)Â Â Â Past and current compliance with orders of the local housing or
building code official.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (13)Â Â Â Any other evidence the court deems relevant.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If the City can establish to the court's satisfaction that all parties
with an interest in the property have received proper notice and either
consented to the entry of an order awarding title to the property to the City
or did not make a good-faith effort to comply with the order of the local
housing or building code official within 60 days after the filing of the
petition, the court shall enter judgment against the respondents granting the
City title to the property.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â If the court determines that the property has been abandoned or that
Subsection 4 applies, the court shall enter judgment and order awarding title
to the City. The title awarded to the City shall be free and clear of any
claims, liens, or encumbrances held by the respondents.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â If a City files a petition under Subsection 1, naming the holder of a
tax sale certificate of purchase for the property as a respondent, the City
shall also file the petition, along with a verified statement declaring that
the property identified in the petition contains an abandoned building, with
the County Treasurer. Upon receiving the petition and verified statement, the
County Treasurer shall make an entry in the County system canceling the sale of
the property and shall refund the purchase money to the tax sale certificate
holder.

1.Â Â Â Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish a procedure whereby
animals that pose a significant threat of causing serious injury to humans,
other animals, or property are identified and subjected to precautionary
restrictions before any such serious injury occurs.
2.Â Â Â Classification of Levels of Dangerousness. An animal shall be classified
as potentially dangerous or dangerous based upon specific behavior exhibited by
the animal. An animal will be considered a potentially dangerous animal if it
exhibits behavior described in Subsections A and B of this section. An animal
will be considered a dangerous animal if it exhibits behavior described in
Subsections C and D. Behaviors establishing various levels of potential
dangerousness are as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Level 1 behavior is established if an animal at large is found to
menace, chase, display threatening or aggressive behavior or otherwise threaten
or endanger the safety of any domestic animal.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Level 2 behavior is established if an animal at large is found to
menace, chase, display threatening or aggressive behavior or otherwise threaten
or endanger the safety of any person.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Level 3 behavior is established if an animal, whether confined or at
large, bites or causes physical injury less than serious injury to any person
or other domesticated animal.
(Paragraph C â€“ Ord. 796 â€“ Jul. 23 Supp.)
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Level 4 behavior is established if:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â An animal, whether or not confined, unprovoked or aggressively
bites or causes wounds of deep puncture or greater, or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â An animal, while at large, kills or causes wounds of deep puncture
or greater to any domesticated animal; or
(Subparagraphs 1 and 2 â€“ Ord. 796 â€“ Jul. 23 Supp.)
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â An animal engages in or is found to have been trained to engage in
exhibitions of fighting; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â An animal that has been classified as a Level 3 dangerous animal
repeats the behavior described in Subsection C of this section after the owner
receives notice of the classification level.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Notwithstanding Subsections A through D of this section, the Chief
Animal Control Officer shall have discretionary authority to refrain from
classifying an animal as potentially dangerous, or dangerous even if the animal
has engaged in behaviors specified in Subsections (1) through (4) of this
section, if the Chief Animal Control Officer determines that the behavior was
the result of:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A person provoking, abusing, or tormenting the animal, or other
extenuating circumstances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A person who is knowingly trespassing on the property of the
animal's owner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Another animal trespassing upon the property of the animal's owner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The animal responding in a manner that an ordinary and reasonable
person would conclude was designed to protect a person if that person is
engaged in lawful activity or is the subject of an assault.
3.Â Â Â Identification of Potentially Dangerous and Dangerous Animals; Appeals;
Restrictions Pending Appeal.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The Chief Animal Control Officer shall have authority to determine
whether any animal has engaged in the behaviors specified in Subsection 2. This
determination shall be based upon an investigation that includes a person's
observation of the animal's upbringing and the owner's control of the animal.
These observations and testimony can be provided by West Branch Animal Control
Officers or by other witnesses who personally observed the behavior. They shall
sign a written statement attesting to the observed behavior and agree to
provide testimony, if necessary, regarding the animal's behavior.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The Chief Animal Control Officer shall notify the owner or agent in
control by certified mail or personal service of the animalâ€™s behavior and
classification as a potentially dangerous or dangerous animal and of the
additional restrictions applicable to that animal by reason of its
classification. The owner of the animal, or the offended party, may appeal the
classification to the Animal Control Appeals Board within ten (10) days of
receipt of the classification order. The owner or offended party may file
notice of appeal and request for a hearing in writing by filing with the City
Clerk. The hearing shall be held within 30 days of the receipt of said notice.
Failure to appeal will result in the classification being final. After said
hearing, the Board shall notify the appealing party of its ruling in writing
within 10 days. The appealing party may file notice of appeal of the Boardâ€™s
ruling with the Iowa District Court within ten (10) days of the date of the
Boardâ€™s ruling.
(Paragraph B â€“ Ord. 796 â€“ Jul. 23 Supp.)
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Once the owner has received notice of the animalâ€™s classification as a
Level 1, 2, or 3 animal, the owner shall comply with the restrictions specified
in the notice within seven days or be subject to penalties (Section
55.21).
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â If the Chief Animal Control Officer finds that an animal has engaged in
Level 4 behavior, he or she shall order the owner or agent in control to
immediately turn the animal over to the Animal Control Facility, an
incorporated humane society, a licensed veterinarian, or a boarding kennel, at
the owner's option, to be retained until a hearing is held regarding the
disposition of the animal. The owner shall notify the person who retains the
animal of the pending hearing and shall notify the Chief Animal Control Officer
as to where the animal is to be held. The expense of boarding, veterinary care,
and retention of the animal is the obligation of the animal's owner. The animal
shall not be returned to the owner until it has a current rabies vaccination
and license as required by State law or this chapter.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The imposition of regulations pursuant to this section shall not
prevent the Chief Animal Control Officer from also filing a complaint under any
other applicable State law or ordinance.
4.Â Â Â Regulation of Potentially Dangerous and Dangerous Animals. In addition to
the other requirements of this chapter the owner of a potentially dangerous
animal shall comply with the following regulations:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â If the animal has engaged in Level l behavior, the animal shall be
restrained by a physical device or structure that prevents the animal from
reaching any public sidewalk or adjoining property whenever that animal is
outside the owner's home and not on a leash. The Chief Animal Control Officer
may adopt administrative rules establishing specifications for the required
device or structure.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If the animal has engaged in Level 2 behavior, the owner shall confine
the animal within a secure enclosure whenever the animal is not on a leash or
inside the home of the owner. The secure enclosure must be located so as not to
interfere with the publicâ€™s legal access to the ownerâ€™s property. For the
purpose of this section, electronic confinement systems are not considered
secure enclosures. The Chief Animal Control Officer shall ascertain compliance
to the secure enclosure provision.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If the animal has engaged in Level 3 behavior, the owner shall meet the
requirements of Subsection B of this section, and shall also post warning signs
within 72 hours of being notified on the property where the animal is kept, by
conformance with administrative rules to be adopted by the Chief Animal Control
Officer, and shall, additionally, not permit the animal to be off the ownerâ€™s
property unless the animal is muzzled and restrained by an adequate leash and
under the control of a person, or is within a securely fastened enclosed cage.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Any animal that has been found to have engaged in Level 4 behavior as
described in Subsection 2 shall be immediately impounded. The animal shall be
euthanized unless the owner files a written request to the Chief Animal Control
Officer within l0 days that he or she wishes disposition of the animal to be
decided by the District Court. Upon receiving said notice from owner or agent
in control of the animal, the Chief Animal Control officer shall file a sworn
complaint that an animal is a dangerous animal and that the animal has caused
serious injury or death to a person, dog, or other domesticated animal with the
District Court. The District Court shall issue summons to the owner ordering
him or her to appear to show cause why the animal should not be destroyed and
then proceed in accordance with the Code of Iowa. If the disposition of a Level
4 animal is to be decided by a District Court and the animal is returned to the
owner, the ID number tattooing or microchip implanting must be completed within
seven days after this decision is made.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â To insure correct identification, all animals that have been classified
as Level 3 shall have an identification number tattooed upon the animal, at the
ownerâ€™s expense, by or under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian within
seven days after this decision is made. The identification number shall be
tattooed on the upper inner left rear thigh of the animal by means of indelible
or permanent ink. If the owner of an animal subject to a tattooing requirement
under this chapter and the Chief Animal Control Officer agree, the animal may
be identified by a micro-chip in lieu of tattooing. The micro-chip must be
implanted by a licensed veterinarian. The cost of implanting the micro- chip
and the cost of the micro-chip itself, shall be the responsibility of the
animal's owner.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â There shall be an annual fee payable to the City of West Branch to be
paid by the owner of any animal that has been classified as dangerous or
potentially dangerous. The fee shall be set by the West Branch City Council in
the City of West Branch Schedule of Fees. For dogs and cats, this shall be an
additional fee imposed at the time the license of the dog and cat expires, and
shall be payable at the time the license is renewed.
5.Â Â Â Reporting of Potentially Dangerous or Dangerous Animals. Any person who
observes or has evidence of animal behavior as described in Subsection 2 shall
forthwith notify the Animal Control Division.

during reasonable hours for the conduct of necessary business concerning
impounded animals.
2.Â Â Â An Animal Control Officer shall impound and hold at the shelter any animal

voluntarily delivered to the animal shelter by the owner thereof requesting
humane destruction. Such animals may be disposed of by euthanasia at any time.
6.Â Â Â A dog or cat shall be released for adoption subject to the following
conditions:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The adoptive owner shall pay the applicable adoption fee;

claim, or interest of the owner, lienholders, or claimants after the expiration
of the 10-day reclaiming period.
7.Â Â Â If it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identities
and addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders, notice by one
publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the
vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice
under Subsection 2 of this section. The published notice may contain multiple

Any connection with a public sanitary sewer must be made under the direct
supervision of the Superintendent and in accordance with the following:
1.Â Â Â Old Building Sewers. Old building sewers may be used in connection with
new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test conducted by
the owner and observed by the Superintendent, to meet all requirements of this
chapter.
2.Â Â Â Separate Building Sewers. A separate and independent building sewer shall
be provided for every occupied building; except where one building stands at
the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can
be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard, or
driveway. In such cases the building sewer from the front building may be
extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer.
3.Â Â Â Installation. The installation and connection of the building sewer to the
public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the State Plumbing Code and
applicable rules and regulations of the City. All such connections shall be
made gastight and watertight. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and
materials must be approved by the Superintendent before installation.
4.Â Â Â Water Lines. When possible, building sewers should be laid at least 10
feet horizontally from a water service. The horizontal separation may be less,
provided the water service line is located at one side and at least 12 inches
above the top of the building sewer.
5.Â Â Â Size. Building sewers shall be sized for the peak expected sewage flow
from the building with a minimum building sewer size of four inches.
6.Â Â Â Alignment and Grade. All building sewers shall be laid to a straight line
to meet the following:

approval of the Superintendent and shall be made only with approved fittings.
7.Â Â Â Depth. Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the
building at an elevation below the basement floor. The depth of cover above the
sewer shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost.
8.Â Â Â Sewage Lifts. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to
permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain
shall be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building
sewer.
9.Â Â Â Pipe Specifications. Building sewer pipe shall be free from flaws, splits,
or breaks. Materials shall be as specified in the State Plumbing Code except
that the building sewer pipe, from the property line to the public sewer, shall

Superintendent. Solvent-welded joints are not permitted.
12.Â Â Â Unstable Soil. No sewer connection shall be laid so that it is exposed
when crossing any watercourse. Where an old watercourse must of necessity be
crossed or where there is any danger of undermining or settlement, cast iron
soil pipe or vitrified clay sewer pipe thoroughly encased in concrete shall be
required for such crossings. Such encasement shall extend at least six inches
on all sides of the pipe. The cast iron pipe or encased clay pipe shall rest on
firm, solid material at either end.
13.Â Â Â Preparation of Basement or Crawl Space. No connection for any residence,
business or other structure with any sanitary sewer shall be made unless the
basement floor is poured, or in the case of a building with a slab or crawl
space, unless the ground floor is installed with the area adjacent to the
foundation of such building cleared of debris and backfilled. The backfill
shall be well compacted and graded so that the drainage is away from the
foundation. Prior to the time the basement floor is poured, or the first floor
is installed in buildings without basements, the sewer shall be plugged and the
plug shall be sealed by the Superintendent. Any accumulation of water in any
excavation or basement during construction and prior to connection to the
sanitary sewer shall be removed by means other than draining into the sanitary
sewer.

impervious material capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in
temperature. They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped
with easily removable covers that shall be gastight and watertight.
3.Â Â Â Maintenance. All such interceptors shall be maintained by the owner at the
ownerâ€™s expense and shall be kept in continuously efficient operations at all
times.
96.07Â Â Â SEWER TAP.
Connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the â€œYâ€
branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If no properly
located â€œYâ€ branch is available, a saddle â€œYâ€ shall be installed at the
location specified by the Superintendent. The public sewer shall be tapped with
a tapping machine and a saddle appropriate to the type of public sewer shall be
glued or attached with a gasket and stainless steel clamps to the sewer. At no
time shall a building sewer be constructed so as to enter a manhole unless
special written permission is received from the Superintendent and in
accordance with the Superintendentâ€™s direction if such connection is approved.
96.08Â Â Â INSPECTION REQUIRED.
All connections with the sanitary sewer system before being covered shall be
inspected and approved, in writing, by the Superintendent. As soon as all pipe
work from the public sewer to inside the building has been completed, and

All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHâ€™s are determined from
periodic grab samples.)

All unconnected properties located within the corporate limits of the City of
West Branch that are located north of Interstate 80.
100.03Â Â Â WASTEWATER SYSTEM UTILITY CONNECTION FEE.
A connection fee is hereby imposed for each connection made to the Municipal
Water System Utility within the boundaries of the District which is legally
described in Section
100.02 above. The proposed improvements are known as the â€œWastewater Lift
Station Connection Fee Districtâ€ (hereinafter the â€œProject Improvementsâ€) and
consist generally of the construction of a wastewater lift station to serve the
properties within the City located generally north of Interstate 80 which have
yet to connect to the Cityâ€™s wastewater system. The Project Improvements will
be constructed in one project to be let by the City in accordance with Chapter
26 of the Code of Iowa. The Project Improvements will serve approximately 1,150
acres within said district. The Executive Summary provided by Veenstra and Kimm
Engineers states that the total project costs are $750,000. The connection fee
payable by a property owner whose property will be served by the Project
Improvements will be calculated and imposed based upon the proposed use as
listed on Exhibit â€œBâ€ on file at City Hall. The connection fee will be payable
in full at the earlier of (i) the time of submission by the property owner to
the City of the subdivision plat for the area for signature and recording by
the City, or (ii) the time of submission by the property owner to the City
Engineer of construction plans for the construction of improvements on any
portion of the ownerâ€™s property to be served by the connection to the Public
Improvements. For properties located north of Interstate 80 currently located
outside of the City limits, the connection fee will become due and payable in
accordance with this chapter upon annexation and platting or connection to the
wastewater system as provided above. As of June 1, 2011, the connection fee
payable for each specific use is described on Exhibit â€œBâ€ on file at City Hall.
Said connection fee will be adjusted annually based upon the interest rate the
City is paying for Series General Obligation Corporate Purpose Bond Series 2013
bonds to fund the Project Improvements. Said adjusted connection fee shall be
kept on file for public inspection by the City Clerk.
100.04Â Â Â PRIVATE SYSTEMS.
Property owners within the district are not mandated to connect to the
Wastewater System Utility if they currently have a properly operating private
wastewater system. If a property ownerâ€™s private wastewater system fails as
determined by guidelines previously established by the City Engineer and the
public wastewater system is located within 200 feet of said property, then the
property owner will be required to connect to the City wastewater system.
100.05Â Â Â OTHER COSTS.
The connection fee imposed by this chapter is in addition to, and not in lieu
of, any other fees for connection required under the other provisions of this
Code of Ordinances. The property owner paying a connection fee will be
responsible for the full cost of providing any necessary sanitary sewer main
extensions or service lines from private property improvements or buildings to
the public mains and extensions being constructed as part of the project
improvements.
100.06Â Â Â NONPAYMENT.
In the event a connection is made to the Municipal Wastewater System without
payment of the connection fee set forth in this chapter, the City shall
disconnect such service until such times as the property owner has paid the
required connection fee. In addition, the City may pursue any additional remedy
provided by law.
100.07Â Â Â USE OF PROCEEDS.
The connection fees collected by the City under this chapter shall be used only
for the purpose of operating the Municipal Wastewater System Utility, or paying
the debt service on obligations issued to finance the project improvements.
100.08Â Â Â INTERPRETATION.
The provisions of this chapter are intended and shall be construed so as to
fully implement the provisions of Section 384.84(3) of the Code of Iowa. In the
event that any provision of this chapter is determined to be contrary to law,
it shall not affect other provisions or application of this chapter which shall
at all times be construed to fully invoke the provisions of Section 384.84(3)
of the Code of Iowa with reference to the assessment and collection of the
connection fees provided herein.

action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the City, its officers,
employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or

State Code, any failure to meet this obligation may constitute a nuisance and
may be subject to an abatement action filed by the City. In the event a
nuisance is found to exist, which the owner fails to properly abate within such
reasonable time as allowed by the City, the City may enter upon the property
and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual
cost thereof assessed against the owner in the same manner as a tax levied
against the property. The City shall have the right, pursuant to the authority
of this section, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon

nonbreaching party that additional time is needed, and the parties agree upon a
longer period for cure. If the breach is not cured within the cure period, the
non-breaching party may terminate this franchise. A party shall not be
considered to be in breach of this franchise if it has operated in compliance

sidewalk in the City, and which installation, improvement, obstruction or
excavation was made or left in, under or upon such street, alley or sidewalk by

writing by the City of such action or proceeding, the Company shall appear and
make proper defense thereto; and if any judgment or decree shall in any such
case be rendered against the City therein, the Company agrees to assume, pay

particular area in which a sidewalk is to be constructed.
4.Â Â Â â€œOne-course constructionâ€ means that the full thickness of the concrete is
placed at one time, using the same mixture throughout.
5.Â Â Â â€œOwnerâ€ means the person owning the fee title to property abutting any

City Council and assess the costs and expenses therefor against the abutting
property for collection in the same manner as property taxes; provided,
however, no such assessment can be made for the repair, reconstruction or
replacement of the public sidewalk unless the City has served upon the person
shown by the records of the Cedar County Auditor or the Johnson County Auditor
to be the owner of the abutting property, by certified mail, a notice requiring
said person to perform, reconstruct or replace the public sidewalk within 90
days from the date said notice is mailed.

Â 
1Â Â Â Deep and shallow wells, as defined in IAC 567-40.2(455B): A deep well is a
well located and constructed in such a manner that there is a continuous layer
of low permeability soil or rock at least five feet thick located at least 25
feet below the normal ground surface and above the aquifer from which water is
to be drawn. A shallow well is a well located and constructed in such a manner
that there is not a continuous layer of low permeability soil or rock (or
equivalent retarding mechanism acceptable to the department) at least five feet
thick, the top of which is located at least 25 feet below the normal ground
surface and above the aquifer from which water is to be drawn.
2Â Â Â The separation distances are dependent upon two factors: the type of piping
that is in the existing sewer or drain, as noted in the table, and that the
piping was properly installed in accordance with the standards.
3Â Â Â Solid wastes are those derived from the treatment of water or wastewater.
Certain types of solid wastes from water treatment processes may be land-
applied within the separation distance on an individual, case-by-case basis.
4Â Â Â Solid waste means garbage, refuse, rubbish, and other similar discarded
solid or semisolid materials, including but not limited to such materials
resulting from industrial, commercial, agricultural, and domestic activities.

160.02Â Â Â STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
1.Â Â Â The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 414, Code of Iowa, as
amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure
safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
2.Â Â Â Findings of Fact.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The flood hazard areas of the City of West Branch are subject to
periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare of the community.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by:
(i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â This ordinance relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
3.Â Â Â Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City of West Branch and its
residents and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and
comfort and convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses
described in Paragraph 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows so
that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03Â Â Â GENERAL PROVISIONS.
1.Â Â Â Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter shall apply
to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City shown on the Official
Floodplain Zoning Map as being within the boundaries of the Floodway, Floodway
Fringe, and General Floodplain, as established in this section.
2.Â Â Â Establishment of Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM) for Cedar County and Incorporated Areas, City of West Branch, Panels
19031C0211C, 0212C, 0213C, 0214C, dated August 19, 2013, which were prepared as
part of the Flood Insurance Study for Cedar County, are hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be the Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The flood
profiles and all explanatory material contained with the Flood Insurance Study
are also declared to be a part of this ordinance.
3.Â Â Â Rules for Interpretation of District Boundaries. The boundaries of the
zoning district areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the Official
Floodplain Zoning Map. When an interpretation is needed as to the exact
location of a boundary, the Administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it
is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
4.Â Â Â Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure
shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
5.Â Â Â Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter to
repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provision of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with
this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
6.Â Â Â Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
7.Â Â Â Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated Floodplain (Overlay) District areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create
liability on the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this Ordinance or any administrative
decision lawfully made there under.
8.Â Â Â Severability. If any section, clause, provision or portion of this chapter
is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction,
the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.

hereby established which shall hear and decide (i) appeals and (ii) requests
for variances to the provisions of this ordinance, and shall take any other
action which is required of the Board.
2.Â Â Â Appeals. Where it is alleged there is any error in any order, requirement,
decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the
enforcement of this chapter, the aggrieved party may appeal such action. The
notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board of Adjustment and with the
official from whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason
for the appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to
the Board of Adjustment all the documents constituting the record upon which
the action appealed from was taken.
3.Â Â Â Variance. The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in specific
cases such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary
hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection
for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the applicant
shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator that: (i)
the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage and
(ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.

well as due notice to parties in interest. At the hearing, any party may appear
in person or by agent or attorney and present written or oral evidence. The
board may require the appellant or applicant to provide such information as is
reasonably deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance or
evaluation of a professional engineer or other expert person or agency,
including the Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an Appeal or
Variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an Appeal, the Board may, so
long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance,
reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in
writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision.
In granting a Variance, the board shall consider such factors as contained in
this section and all other relevant sections of this chapter and may prescribe
such conditions as contained in Subsection (4)(B)(2) of this section.

This chapter shall be known and may be cited and referred to as the West Branch
Zoning Ordinance. The map herein referred to, identified by the title â€œZoning

matter thereon are hereby adopted and made part of this chapter â€  .
Â 
Notes
â€â€  (See EDITORâ€™S NOTE at the end of this chapter for ordinances amending the
  zoning map.)
165.02Â Â Â PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY.
The zoning regulations and districts herein set forth are made in accordance
with a comprehensive plan. They are designed to lessen congestion in the
streets; to secure safety from fire, flood, panic and other dangers; to promote
health and general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the
overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; and to
facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewage, schools,
parks and other public requirements. They are made with reasonable
consideration, among other things, to the character of area of each district
and the peculiar suitability of such area for particular uses, and with a view
to conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use
of land throughout West Branch. For the purpose of promoting the health,
safety, morals, or the general welfare of the community, the Council is hereby
empowered to regulate and restrict the height, number of stories and size of
buildings and other structures, the percentage of lot that may be occupied, the
size of yards, courts and other open spaces, the density of population, and the
location and use of buildings, structures, and land for trade, industry,
residence, or other purposes. The authority of this chapter is based upon the
right of the Council as empowered by the provisions of Chapter 414 of the Code
of Iowa.Â 
165.03Â Â Â CONFLICT AND VALIDITY.
Wherever the regulations made under authority of this chapter require greater
width or size of yards, courts or other open spaces, or require a lower height
of building or less number of stories, or require a greater percentage of lot
to be left unoccupied, or impose other higher standards than are required in
any other statute or local ordinance or regulation, the provisions of the
regulations made under authority of this chapter shall govern. Whenever the
provisions of any other statute or local ordinance or regulation require a
greater width or size of yards, courts or other open spaces, or require a lower
height of building or less number of stories, or require a greater percentage
of lot to be left unoccupied, or impose other higher standards than are
required by the regulations made under authority of Chapter 414, the provisions
of such statute or local ordinance or regulation shall govern. Wherever any
regulation proposed or made under authority of Chapter 414 relates to any
structure, building, dam obstruction, deposit or excavation in or on the flood
plains of any river or stream, prior approval of the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources shall be required to establish, amend, supplement, change, or modify
such regulation or to grant any variation or exception therefrom. Should any
section clause or provision of this chapter be declared invalid, such shall not
affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter.

165.36Â Â Â PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS.
1.Â Â Â Purpose.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The purpose of a Planned Unit Development District (PUD) is to allow
innovative, creative and flexible development that is sensitive to economic,
cultural and environmental considerations. The Planned Unit Development
District is intended to maximize benefits from the use of open spaces, maximize
aesthetics, encourage building design standards that exceed normal standards
and are compatible with surrounding properties and implement the goals of the
City's Comprehensive Plan.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The Planned Unit Development District provides the City Council with
the flexibility to vary the traditional zoning district classifications with
mixed types of uses, the ability to vary setbacks and bulk regulations, support
pedestrian and bicycle safety and encourage environmental protection. The
Planned Unit Development District is intended to promote development which will
surpass the quality of development resulting from the strict application of the
regulations of conventional zoning districts. However, the Planned Unit
Development District shall not be used to circumvent traditional zoning
regulations.
2.Â Â Â Location Criteria. The Planned Unit Development Districts are generally
intended for use in the following urban contexts:

conventional zoning may artificially limit or constrain good urban design, may
restrict the achievement of the City's development objectives, or may not be
appropriate to changes in technology or demand consistent with the best
interests of the City.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Community Development Areas. Areas of the City which are in need of
rehabilitation or redevelopment, including areas which may be deficient in
public facilities or services. In these situations, the PUD District may
encourage private investment by recognizing the need for flexibility that
conventional zoning regulations do not provide.

neighborhoods.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Promotion of infill development and rehabilitation of underutilized
sites.

attention to exterior building design elements, landscaping and how the
proposed improvement or development will complement existing and proposed uses
and building design elements.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The upcoming comprehensive plan will be considered during this review
process. In the event the City Council determines that the proposed project is
not consistent with the direction of the comprehensive plan, the project may be
delayed until such time the plan is complete.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Paramount in this review will include consideration of, exterior
building materials on all sides, coloration of materials, building height, roof
line, size and location of windows and doors, roof mounted appurtenances, and
facades.

is not intended that the details of existing buildings be duplicated precisely,
but those features should be suggestive of the extent, nature and scale of
details that would be appropriate on new buildings or associated with building
alterations.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Materials and Texture. Architectural design within this area shall
recognize the importance of material strength and permanency through the
selection of building materials and the principle of structural strength and

assessed value is needed as the result of unanticipated building or facade
damages due to events such as fire, vandalism, or weather-related damages, site
plan review will not be required, provided that the needed repairs do not alter
the appearance of the structure prior to the event causing the unanticipated
damages.
12.Â Â Â Signage. Signage within the Main Street and Historic District should
align with the aesthetic goals of the district, with size and placement
ensuring visual harmony. Businesses are encouraged to utilize traditional

shall relate to the process of subdividing or to the land subdivided, or, the
resubdivision of land heretofore divided or platted into lots or other
divisions of land, or, if a new street is involved, any division of land.
166.03Â Â Â PLATTING REQUIRED AND FEES.
Every owner of any tract or parcel of land who has subdivided or shall
hereafter subdivide or plat the same for the purpose of laying out an addition,
subdivision, building lot, or lots, acreage or suburban lots within the City
or, pursuant to Section 354.9 of the Code of Iowa, to any land located within
two miles of the corporate limits, shall cause plats of such area to be made in
the form, and containing the information, as hereafter set forth before selling
any lots therein contained or placing the plat on record. The City may, by
resolution, waive its right to review any subdivision outside its City limits
or waive the requirements of any of its standards or conditions of approval,
and if such resolution is made, shall certify the resolution, which shall be
recorded with the plat.

set by ordinance or written City policy adopted by the Council. The costs and
fees shall be paid by the subdivider within 30 days of receipt of the costs by
the subdivider. Failure to pay these costs and fees when assessed to the
subdivider may be cause for denial of the plat or subdivision or any further
plats or subdivisions submitted by the applicant.
166.04Â Â Â PROCEDURE.
In obtaining final approval of a proposed subdivision by the Commission and the
Council, the subdivider shall submit a preliminary plat in accordance with the

166.06Â Â Â REFERRAL OF PRELIMINARY PLAT.
The Clerk shall forthwith refer two copies of the preliminary plat to the City
Engineer and seven copies to the Commission.
166.07Â Â Â ACTION BY THE CITY ENGINEER.
The City Engineer shall carefully examine said preliminary plat as to its
compliance with the laws and regulations of the City, the existing street
system, and good engineering practices, and shall, within two weeks, submit
findings in duplicate to the Commission together with one copy of the plat
received.
166.08Â Â Â ACTION BY THE COMMISSION.
The Commission shall, upon receiving the report of the City Engineer, as soon
as possible, but not more than 30 days thereafter, consider said report,
negotiate with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the kind and
extent of improvements to be made by the subdivider, and pass upon the
preliminary plat as originally submitted or modified. If the Commission does
not act within 30 days, the preliminary plat shall be deemed to be approved;
provided, however, the subdivider may agree to an extension of the time for a
period not to exceed an additional 60 days. It shall then set forth its
recommendations in writing, whether of approval, modification or disapproval.
1.Â Â Â In the event that substantial changes or modifications are made by the
Commission or disapproval of the plat, it shall give its reasons therefor and
it may request and cause the revised preliminary plat to be resubmitted in the
same manner as the original plat.
2.Â Â Â If approved, the Commission shall express its approval as â€œConditional

Commission.
4.Â Â Â The Council shall notify the subdivider that the preliminary plat will be
considered at the next regular Council meeting. The Council shall review the
plat and findings of the Commission and either modify, conditionally approve
said plat or return the plat to the Commission for further modification as
noted.
5.Â Â Â The â€œConditional Approvalâ€ by the Commission and the Council shall not
constitute final acceptance of the addition or subdivision by the City but an
authorization to proceed with preparation of the final plat.
166.09Â Â Â FINAL PLAT.
The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as approved,
and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that portion of the
approved preliminary plat which the subdivider proposes to record and develop
at the time, provided, however, that such portion conforms to all requirements
of these regulations.
166.10Â Â Â REFERRAL OF FINAL PLAT.
The subdivider shall, within 12 months of the â€œConditional Approvalâ€ of the
preliminary plat by the Commission, prepare and file 16 copies of the final
plat and other required documents with the Clerk as hereinafter sets forth, and
upon his failure to do so within the time specified, the â€œConditional Approvalâ€
of the preliminary plat shall be null and void unless an extension of time is
applied for and granted by the Commission. Upon receipt of the final plat and
other required documents, the Clerk shall transmit seven copies of the final
plat to the Commission for its recommendations and approval.
166.11Â Â Â REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINAL PLAT.

proposed plat is objectionable.
2.Â Â Â In the event that said plat is found to be acceptable and in accordance
with this chapter, the Council shall accept the same.
3.Â Â Â The passage of a resolution by the Council accepting the plat shall
constitute final approval of the platting of the area shown on the final plat,
but the subdivider or owners shall cause such plat to be recorded in the office
of the County Recorder and shall file satisfactory evidence of such recording
in the office of the Clerk before the City shall recognize the plat as being in
full force and effect.
166.15Â Â Â GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
The following general requirements shall be followed by all subdividers:
1.Â Â Â Relation to Existing Streets.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all
streets shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets,
to topographic conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their
appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such
streets.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either provide for
the continuation or appropriate projection of existing principal streets in
surrounding areas or conform to a plat for the neighborhood approved by the
Commission to meet a particular situation where topographical or other
conditions made continuance or conformance to existing streets impracticable.
2.Â Â Â Acreage Subdivisions.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where the plat submitted covers only a part of the subdividerâ€™s plat, a
sketch of the prospective future system of the unsubmitted part shall be
furnished and the street system of the part submitted shall be considered in
the light of adjustments in connection with the street system of the part not
submitted.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where the parcel is subdivided into larger tracts than for building
lots such parcels shall be divided so as to allow for the opening of major
streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent minor streets.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Subdivisions showing unplatted strips or private streets controlling
access to public ways will not receive approval.
3.Â Â Â Minor Streets.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Minor streets shall be so planned as to discourage through traffic.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Cul-de-sac streets are permitted where topography and other conditions
justify their use. Such streets shall not be longer than 900 feet and shall
terminate with a turn-around, having an outside roadway diameter of at least 80
feet and a street property line diameter of at least 100 feet. The right-of-way
width of the straight portion of such streets shall be a minimum of 60 feet.
The property line at the intersection of the turn-around and the straight
portion of the street shall be rounded at a radius of not less than 20 feet.
4.Â Â Â Frontage Streets.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial
street, the Commission may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage
with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear
property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other treatment as
may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to
afford separation of through and local traffic.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or
limited access highway right-of-way, the Commission may require a street
approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance
suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes
in residential districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in
appropriate districts. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard
for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations.
5.Â Â Â Street Geometrics.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be
avoided.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse
curves on arterial and collector streets.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point
by more than 10 degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius
adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than 200 feet for minor and
collector streets, and of such greater radii as the Commission shall determine
for special cases.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Street right-of-way widths shall be as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Arterial Streets: a 70-foot right-of-way, 42-foot pavement, and 5-
foot sidewalks per City Specifications.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Collector Streets: a 66-foot right-of-way, 34-foot pavement, and 5-
foot sidewalks per City Specifications.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Minor Streets: a 60-foot right-of-way, 29-foot pavement, and 5-foot
sidewalks per City Specifications.
6.Â Â Â Intersections.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Insofar as is practical, acute angles between streets at their
intersection are to be avoided.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at less than 80
degrees.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a radius
of 15 feet, or of a greater radius where the Commission may deem it necessary.
The Commission may permit comparable cutoffs or chords in place of rounded
corners.
7.Â Â Â Street Names. Streets that are in alignment with others already existing
and names shall bear the name of the existing streets. The proposed names of
new streets shall not duplicate or sound similar to existing street names.
Street names shall be subject to the approval of the Commission.
8.Â Â Â Street Grades.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Street grades, wherever feasible, shall not exceed five percent, with
due allowance for reasonable vertical curves.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â No street grade shall be less than one-half of one percent.
9.Â Â Â Alleys.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts, except
that the Commission may waive this requirement where other definite and assured
provisions are made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading
and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The width of an alley shall be 16 feet.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided,
but where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit safe
vehicular movement.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable,
shall be provided with adequate turn-around facilities at the dead end, as
determined by the Commission.
10.Â Â Â Blocks.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No block may be more than 1,320 feet or less than 280 feet in length
between the centerlines of intersecting streets, except where, in the opinion
of the Commission, extraordinary conditions unquestionably justify a departure
from these limits.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In blocks over 700 feet in length, the Commission may require at or
near the middle of the block a public highway or easement of not less than 10
feet in width for use by pedestrians or as an easement for public utilities.
11.Â Â Â Lots.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation shall be appropriate
for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use
contemplated.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Minimum lot dimensions and sizes shall conform to the requirements of
the Zoning Ordinance. Provided:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Residential lots where not served by public sewer shall not be less
than one acre in area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for commercial
and industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service
and parking facilities required by the type of use and development
contemplated.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Corner lots for residential use shall have an extra 10 feet of
width to permit appropriate building setback from and orientation to both
streets.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The subdividing of the land shall be such as to provide, by means of a
public street, each lot with satisfactory access to an existing public street.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Reverse frontage lots or through lots shall be avoided except where
essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic
arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. A
planting screen easement of at least 10 feet and across which there shall be no
right of access, shall be provided along the lines of lots abutting such a
traffic artery or other disadvantageous use.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles to straight
street lines or radial to curved street lines.
12.Â Â Â Building Lines. Building lines conforming with zoning standards shall be
shown on all lots within the platted area. Where the subdivided area is not
under zoning control, the Commission may require building lines in accordance
with the needs of each subdivision.
13.Â Â Â Easements.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be
provided for utilities where necessary and shall be at least 16 feet wide.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where a subdivision is traversed by a water course, drainage way,
channel or stream, there shall be provided a storm water easement or drainage
right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of such water course, and
further width for construction, or both, as will be adequate for the purposes.
14.Â Â Â Plat Markers. Markers shall be placed at all block corners, angle points,
points of curves in streets, and all such intermediate points as shall be
required by the City Engineer. The markers shall be of such material, size and
length as may be approved by the City Engineer, but in no event less than the
Code of Iowa requires.
15.Â Â Â Erosion Control. It is the responsibility of the developer to control
erosion from the development onto public streets and facilities in platted, but
not fully developed, subdivisions. Developers shall erect mechanical erosion
control devices (e.g., silt fences, haybale fences, etc.) in areas susceptible
to erosion in new developments. These devices shall remain in place and in good
repair until the subdivision is fully developed or permanent ground cover is
established. The City Engineer shall review and approve the grading plan before
the preliminary plat will be recommended to the Council for approval and shall
verify the installation and maintenance of all required erosion control devices
before the remaining public improvements will be recommended to the Council for
acceptance. To assure compliance with the erosion control requirements, the
developer shall either post a bond guaranteeing compliance or deposit funds
with the City, the type and amount of said assurance to be recommended by the
City Engineer and approved by the Council. In the event that the developer
fails to comply with the terms of this section, the City shall have the right
to apply the bond or funds to take the necessary steps to control erosion or
prevent erosion from occurring. After sale of any lot, the actual owner of that
lot shall be responsible for the prevention and control of soil erosion for
that lot.
166.16Â Â Â IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.
The subdivider shall install and construct all improvements required by this
chapter. All required improvements shall be installed and constructed in
accordance with the specifications and under the supervision of the Council and
to its satisfaction.

be constructed to the grade approved by the Council after receiving the report
and recommendations of the City Engineer.
5.Â Â Â Water Lines. Where a public water main is reasonably accessible, the
subdivider shall connect with such water main and provide a water connection
for each lot with service pipe installed to the property line in accordance
with Iowa Department of Natural Resources and the City Water Department
standards, procedure and supervision; and loop said water line where reasonably
possible.
6.Â Â Â Sewers.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where a public sanitary sewer is within 200 feet and reasonably
accessible, the subdivider shall connect or provide for the connection with
such sanitary sewer and shall provide within the subdivision the sanitary sewer
system and br required to make the sewer accessible to each lot in the
subdivision. Sanitary sewers shall be stubbed into each lot. Sewer systems
shall be approved by the Council and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources
and the construction subject to the supervision of the City Engineer.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where sanitary sewers are not available, other facilities, as approved
by the Council and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, must be provided
for the adequate disposal of sanitary wastes.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Adequate provisions shall be made for the disposal of storm waters,
pursuant to the then existing Storm Water Management Policy of the City subject
to the approval of the Council and to the supervision of the City Engineer.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â A subdivision developer shall provide each platted building lot a
direct connection for the discharge from any foundation tile, sump pump, or
roof downspout to the storm water system. All storm water systems shall be
designed in accordance with the adopted Storm Water Management Policy of the
City. All connection materials and connection methods for each lot shall be
engineered and presented as part of the construction drawings before final
approval by the City Engineer.
7.Â Â Â Maintenance Bonds. Maintenance bonds shall be posted with the City by the
subdivider at the subdividerâ€™s cost for improvements required under this
chapter for the following time periods and improvements:
Streets and alleys Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4 years

The type of construction, the materials, the methods and standards of
subdivision improvements shall be equal to the current specifications of the
City for like work. Plans and specifications shall be submitted to the Clerk
for Council approval prior to construction and construction shall not be
started until the plans and specifications have been approved.
166.18Â Â Â INSPECTION.
The Council shall cause the installation of all improvements to be inspected by
the City Engineer to insure compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
The cost of said inspections shall be borne by the subdivider and shall be the
actual cost of said inspections to the City.
166.19Â Â Â COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Before the Council will approve the final plat, and before any building permits
will be issued, as-builts of all of the foregoing improvements, except
sidewalks, shall be constructed and presented to the City. The Council will
then by formal resolution approve the final plat. Before passage of said
resolution of acceptance, the City Engineer shall report that said improvements
meet all City specifications and ordinances or other City requirements and the
agreements between subdivider and the City. Sidewalks shall be installed upon
completion of the building for which the building permit was obtained, unless
an extension is granted by the City Engineer due to weather conditions or
within three years after the approval of any subdivision, whichever event first
occurs.
166.20Â Â Â WAIVER OF COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS.
The completion requirements may be waived in whole or in part if the subdivider
will post a performance bond, a letter of credit, or other Council-approved
reliable guarantee with the Council guaranteeing that improvements not
completed will be constructed within a period of one year from final acceptance
of the plat; but final acceptance of the plat will not constitute final
acceptance by the City of any improvements to be constructed. Improvements will
be accepted only after their construction has been completed, and no public
funds will be expended in the subdivision until such improvements have been
completed and accepted by the City.
166.21Â Â Â LARGE SCALE DEVELOPMENT.
The standards and requirements of these regulations may be modified by the
Council in the case of a plan and program for a new town, a complete community,
or a neighborhood unit, which in the judgment of the Commission provides
adequate public spaces and improvements for the circulation, recreation, light,
area, and service needs of the tract when fully developed and populated, and
which also provides such covenants or other legal provisions as will assure
conformity to and achievement of the plan.
166.22Â Â Â VARIANCES.
Where in the case of a particular proposed subdivision, it can be shown that
strict compliance with the requirements of this chapter would result in
extraordinary hardship to the subdivider, because of unusual topography or
other conditions, the Council may vary, modify or waive the requirements so
that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured. Provided,
however, such variance, modification or waiver will not have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of this chapter. In no case shall any
variance or modification be more than minimum easing of the requirements, and
in no instance shall it be in conflict with any zoning ordinance and such
variances and waivers may be granted only by the affirmative vote of three-
fourths of the members of the Council, and must conform to Zoning Ordinance and
State Code regarding granting of variances by the Board of Adjustment.

This chapter shall be known, cited and referred to as â€œSite Plan Regulations of
the City of West Branch, Iowa.â€
167.02Â Â Â PURPOSE AND APPLICATION.
It is the intent and purpose of this chapter to establish a procedure which
will enable the City to review certain proposed improvements to property within
specified zoning districts of the City to insure compliance with all applicable
zoning, subdivision and building regulations. Site plans shall only be required
whenever any person proposes to place any structure for which a building permit
is required under any other section of this code, on any tract or parcel of
land within any district of the West Branch Zoning Ordinance, and for any use,
except one and two family dwellings.
167.03Â Â Â DESIGN STANDARDS.
The standards of design provided herein are necessary to insure the orderly and
harmonious development of property in such manner as will safeguard the
publicâ€™s health, safety and general welfare.
1.Â Â Â The design of the proposed improvements shall make adequate provisions for
surface and subsurface drainage, for connections to water and sanitary sewer
lines, each so designed as to neither overload existing public utility lines
nor increase the danger of erosion, flooding, landslide, or other endangerment
of adjoining or surrounding property.
2.Â Â Â The proposed improvements shall be designed and located within the
property in such manner as not to unduly diminish or impair the use and
enjoyment of adjoining property and to this end shall minimize the adverse
effects on such adjoining property from automobile headlights, illumination of
required perimeter yards, refuse containers, and impairment of light and air.
For the purpose of this section, the term â€œuse and enjoyment of adjoining
propertyâ€ shall mean the use and enjoyment presently being made of such
adjoining property, unless such property is vacant. If vacant, the term â€œuse
and enjoyment of adjoining propertyâ€ shall mean those uses permitted under the
zoning districts in which such adjoining property is located.
3.Â Â Â The proposed development shall have such entrances and exits upon adjacent
streets and such internal traffic circulation pattern as will not unduly
increase congestion on adjacent or surrounding public streets.
4.Â Â Â To such end as may be necessary and proper to accomplish the standards in
Subsections 1, 2, and 3 above, the proposed development shall provide fences,
walls, screening, landscaping, erosion control or other improvements.
5.Â Â Â The proposed development shall conform to all applicable provisions of the
Code of Iowa, as amended, Iowa Statewide Urban Design and Specifications
(SUDAS), Iowa Stormwater Management Manual and all applicable provisions of the
Code of Ordinances of the City of West Branch, as amended.

plan and filing fees. Resubmittal under these terms shall be considered a new
site plan subject to fees and procedures outlined in Section
167.05.
167.06Â Â Â OPEN SPACE, LANDSCAPING, PARKING AND ARCHITECTURAL REQUIREMENTS.
The requirements set forth in this section for open spaces, landscaping,
parking and architectural standards shall apply to any development or
redevelopment except one and two family dwellings.
1.Â Â Â Open Space Required. On each lot, except for one and two family dwellings,
there shall be provided 25 percent of open space.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Said open space shall be unencumbered with any structure, or off-
street parking or roadways and drives, and shall be landscaped and maintained
with grass, trees and shrubbery. When the entire lot is not developed, the open
space requirement shall be based in proportion to the area of the improved
portion of the lot.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Each principal structure of an apartment or office complex on same site
shall be separated from any other principal structure in the complex by an open
space of not less than 16 feet.
2.Â Â Â Landscaping Required. Any development, except one and two family
dwellings, shall provide the following minimum number and size of landscape
plantings based on the minimum required open space for the development. The
following is the minimum requirement of trees and shrubs, by number and size,
and type of ground cover. Street trees planted in public street right-of-way
subject to approval by the City shall not be counted toward fulfillment of the
minimum site requirements set forth below. Plant species to be used for
landscaping shall be acceptable to the City that are not considered a nuisance
or undesirable species, such as trees with thorns, cottonwood or cottonbearing
poplars, elm trees prone to Dutch Elm Disease, box elder, ash, and silver
maple. Existing trees and shrubs to be retained on site may be counted toward
fulfillment of the landscaping requirements.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Minimum requirements at the time of planting - Two trees minimum or one
tree of the following size per 1,500 square feet of open space, whichever is
greater: 40 Percent 1Â½" - 2" caliper diameter. Balance 1" - 1Â½" caliper
diameter. (Evergreen trees shall not be less than three feet in height.)
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Minimum requirements at the time of planting - six shrubs, or one shrub
per 1,000 square feet of open space, whichever is greater.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â To reduce erosion all disturbed open space areas shall have ground
cover of grass or native vegetation which is installed as sod, or seeded,
fertilized and mulched.
3.Â Â Â Buffer Required. The following conditions shall require a buffer which
shall be a landscaped area, wall, or other structure intended to separate and
obstruct the view between two adjacent zoning districts, land uses or
properties:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any other zoning district, other than an Agricultural A-1 District,
that abuts any residential district shall require a buffer as described in this
section. The buffer shall be provided by the non-residential use when adjoining
a residential district.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All Industrial Districts that abut any other district shall provide a
buffer as required by this section.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Any storage area, garbage storage, junk storage or loading docks, and
loading areas, in any district shall be screened from public street view by a
buffer.
4.Â Â Â Buffers. Buffers required under the provisions of this section or
elsewhere in the Zoning Ordinance shall be accomplished by any one or approved
combination of the following methods:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Buffer Wall: A buffer wall shall not be less than six feet in height;
constructed of a permanent low maintenance material such as concrete block,
cinder block, brick, concrete, precast concrete or tile block; the permanent
low-maintenance wall shall be designed by an architect or engineer for both
structural adequacy and aesthetic quality; weather resistant wood may be used
as a substitute material if designed with adequate structural integrity and
permanency and approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Landscape Buffer: A landscape buffer shall not be less than 25 feet in
width, designed and landscaped with earth berm and predominant plantings of
evergreen type trees, shrubs and plants so as to assure year around
effectiveness; height of berm and density and height of plantings shall be
adequate to serve as a solid and impenetrable screen. A chain link fence may
exist for security purposes, but is not considered a part of the landscape
screening to satisfy the intent of this requirement.
5.Â Â Â Burden of Provision of Buffer. The burden of provision and selection of
the buffer shall be as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where two different zoning districts, requiring a buffer between them,
are developed, the above requirement is not retroactive and a buffer is not
required. If a buffer is desired, it shall be provided by mutual agreement
between adjacent property owners. However, in the event any or all of the
improved property is abandoned, destroyed, or demolished, for the purpose of
renewal or redevelopment, that portion of such property being renewed or
redeveloped, shall be considered vacant and subject to the requirements herein.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where one of two different zoning districts requiring a buffer between
them is partly developed, the developer of the vacant land shall assume the
burden, unless otherwise specified herein.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Where both zoning districts, requiring a buffer between them, are
vacant or undeveloped, the burden shall be assumed by the developer of the land
that is improved or developed, except for agricultural uses and unless
otherwise specified herein.
6.Â Â Â Waiver of Buffer Requirements. Where the line between two districts,
requiring a buffer, follows a street, right-of-way, railroad, stream, or other
similar barrier, the requirement for a buffer may be waived by the City Council
provided such waiver does not permit the exposure of undesirable
characteristics of land use to public view.
7.Â Â Â Surfacing Requirements. All off-street parking and loading areas and
access roadways shall have a durable and dustless surface paved with asphaltic
or Portland cement concrete pavement or pervious pavement in accordance with
the requirements as herein set forth. Off-street parking of automobiles, vans,
campers, trucks, trailers, tractors, recreational vehicles, boats, construction
equipment, and any other mobile vehicles equipped for street and highway travel
shall be on an asphaltic or Portland cement concrete paved off-street parking
area as required herein and not parked or stored within the landscaped open
space area of the front yard between the building and public street right-of-
way, except, however, the storage of a recreational vehicle, a camper, and boat
within the side or rear yard upon an unpaved area shall be permitted. All off-
street parking areas and associated driveways, access roadways and frontage
roads, except driveways for single family residences, shall be constructed with
permanent, integrally attached six inch high curbing or curbing of alternate
height acceptable to the City (prefabricated portable curb stops shall not be
considered an acceptable alternate), and shall be so graded and drained as to
dispose of all surface water accumulation within the area; and shall be so
arranged and marked as to provide for orderly and safe loading or unloading and
parking and storage of self-propelled vehicles. The curbing requirements may be
waived if it is determined that surface drainage can be adequately handled by
other means. All approaches from the back of the street curb to the sidewalk
shall be constructed of at least six inches of Portland Concrete. The minimum
thickness of pavement of the parking area shall be as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Portland cement concrete shall have a minimum thickness of five inches.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Asphaltic cement concrete shall have a minimum thickness of six inches.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Pervious pavement will be subject to review and approval by the City.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Material utilized in the subgrade shall be well drained and not
susceptible to frost boils. The part of the parking utilized for driveways and
access roadways shall be specifically designed to accommodate the type and load
bearing capacity of traffic anticipated. Driveways for attached townhouse style
residences on private property shall be Portland cement concrete or asphaltic
concrete with minimum thickness of five inches and six inches, respectively,
with a sufficiently compacted and well-drained subgrade base and not greater
than 18 feet in width.
8.Â Â Â Landscaping, Screening and Open Space Requirements. It is desired that all
parking areas be aesthetically improved to reduce obtrusive characteristics
that are inherent to their use. Therefore, wherever practical and except for
single and two family detached and townhouse style residential parking in
driveways, parking areas shall be effectively screened from general public view
and contain shade trees within parking islands where multiple aisles of parking
exist. Not less than five percent of the interior parking area shall be
landscaped within parking islands.
9.Â Â Â Off-Street Parking Access to Public Streets and Internal Traffic
Circulation. Off-street parking or loading facilities shall be designed so as
to permit entrance and exit by forward movement of the vehicle for all uses,
except single-family detached or row dwellings which shall permit backward
movement from a driveway. The backing or backward movement of vehicles from a
driveway, off-street parking or loading area onto an arterial street or highway
shall be prohibited for all uses. Driveway approach returns shall not extend
beyond the side lot line as extended, unless such driveway is of joint usage by
the adjoining lots, and driveway approaches at roadway not greater than
established in the Iowa Statewide Urban Design and Specifications. The number
of ingress/egress access points to public streets from off-street parking areas
approved by the City and located to limit vehicular conflicts, provide
acceptable location of driveway accesses to public streets, preserve proper
traffic safety, and, as possible, not impair movement of vehicular traffic on
public streets. The permitted number of ingress/egress driveway approaches to
public streets for an off-street parking lot shall be dependent upon the
projected future average daily traffic (ADT) for the public street and, as
possible, public street accesses shall be located in alignment with driveway
approaches gaining access to the same public street from property on approaches
gaining access to the same public street from property on the opposite side of
the street. The design of off-street parking and loading facilities shall
provide traffic circulation for the internal forward movement of traffic within
the parking lot, so designed, as not to impair vehicular movement on public
streets, or backing of vehicles from an off-street parking or loading area to a
public street.
10.Â Â Â Handicap Accessible Parking Requirements. Provision of handicapped
parking spaces within off-street parking areas shall be in accordance with
applicable federal, State and local regulations, properly identified with
signage and provided with accessible ramps and walks in accordance with federal
and State regulations, and comply with the following parking space minimum
requirements:
TOTAL PARKING Â Â Â Â Â Â REQUIRED MINIMUM NUMBER OF

1001 and over Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¡
â€  Two percent of total
â€¡ Twenty spaces plus one for each 100 over 1000
Access space or aisle adjacent to handicap accessible parking space shall be a
minimum five feet wide. One in every eight handicap accessible spaces, but not
less than one shall be served by an access space or aisle eight feet wide
minimum and shall be designated â€œvan accessible.â€
11.Â Â Â Traffic Analysis Requirements. Any project which contains 100 dwelling
units or 1,000 average day trips as listed for uses in the Trip Generation
Handbook; Institute of Transportation Engineers, current edition, shall submit
a traffic analysis which provides necessary information to determine the effect
that the project will have upon the surrounding traffic. At a minimum the
traffic analysis shall contain project trip generation directional distribution
of project trips, traffic assignment, and capacity analysis, including
identification of congestion and turning-movement conflicts.
12.Â Â Â Waiver of Requirements. The City Council reserves the right to waive or
modify to a lesser requirement any provision or requirement of off-street
parking and loading areas contained in this chapter, provided a report on such
change is received from the Planning and Zoning Commission and City
Administrator, provided adequate area exists for future expansion, and further
provided said waiver or modification does not adversely affect the intent of
these regulations to adequately safeguard the general public and surrounding
property. Exceptions will only be considered for those uses where special
circumstances warrant a change and whereby the modification or waiver is
determined to be in the best interest of the general public.
13.Â Â Â Architectural Standards. As part of the submittal of a site plan for
development within any of the zoning districts and for any of the uses except
one and two family dwellings, architectural plans for buildings shall be
submitted for review and approval by the City Council after recommendation from
the Planning and Zoning Commission. Documentation to be submitted shall include
building elevations showing the buildingâ€™s design and a description of
structural and exterior materials to be used. The following standards shall be
considered by the City to review architectural plans:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Multiple-Family Dwellings in All Districts. The architecture of
multiple-family buildings shall be designed in a manner compatible with
adjoining residential uses in the neighborhood. Architectural design for
multiple-family buildings shall include exterior building materials, exterior
details and texture, treatment of windows and doors, and a variety in the wall
and roof design to lessen the plainness of appearance that can be
characteristic of large residential buildings. Multiple-family buildings with
single plane walls and boxy in appearance shall not be considered acceptable
unless the use of exterior materials such as brick provides the elements
necessary to enhance the buildingâ€™s physical appearance and eliminate its
plainness of appearance. Adequate treatment or screening of negative aspects of
buildings (loading docks, loading areas, outside storage areas, garbage
dumpsters and HVAC mechanical units) from any public street and adjoining
properties shall be required. Buildings shall be designed or oriented not to
expose loading docks, or loading areas to the public.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Non-Residential Uses in the â€œRâ€ Districts. Any building used for a
permitted non-residential use in â€œRâ€ Districts shall be designed and
constructed with architecture and use of materials compatible with the
residential uses within the neighborhood. Buildings located on a residential
street in an "R" District shall be residential in character, and exterior
materials shall be wood, brick,or brick veneer. The architectural design shall
be approved by the City.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â All Uses Within the Commercial Districts. Architectural design and use
of materials for the construction of any building shall be approved by the
City. Buildings within the Commercial Districts shall have as a primary element
of the building exterior fascia glass, brick, concrete panels, textured
concrete block, architectural steel or stone panels, or cement fiber composite
siding, with all sides of any building built consistent in design and use of
materials. No wood, masonite, visible asphaltic exterior wall or roof material,
aluminum or steel siding, nonarchitectural sheet metal non-textured concrete
block, stucco, E.I.F.S. (Exterior Insulation and Finish System) or other
similar materials shall constitute a portion of any building except as a trim
material, unless the City Council after receiving a recommendation from the
Planning and Zoning Commission, shall determine said material when used as a
primary element, does not distract from the physical appearance of the
building. Adequate treatment or screening of negative aspects of buildings
(loading docks, loading areas, outside storage areas, garbage dumpsters and
HVAC mechanical units) from any public street and adjoining properties shall be
required. Building shall not be designed or oriented to expose loading docks,
nonresidential use overhead doors or loading areas to the public.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â All Uses Within Industrial Districts. Architectural design and use of
materials for construction of any building in the Industrial Districts shall be
reviewed as part of the site plan proposal and shall be approved by the City.
While it is not the purpose of this section to dictate, specify, or restrict
the use of building materials and structural elements, the use of appropriate
exterior materials to enhance the appearance of a building is encouraged by the
City. The exclusive use of sheet metal as an exterior building material shall
not be considered acceptable for buildings facing public streets. The exterior
material of the building's front elevation shall be comprised of brick,
concrete panels, textured concrete block, architectural steel or stone panels,
or cement fiber composite siding, or other similar material. Loading areas,
loading docks, storage areas, and garbage dumpsters shall be located, screened
or oriented to minimize their exposure to view from public streets.
167.07Â Â Â ZONING PERMITS.
No zoning compliance permit or building permit shall be issued for the
construction of any structure that is subject to the provisions of this
chapter, until a site plan has been submitted for review covering the land upon
which said structure is to be erected, and further, approved by City Council
for such development in accordance with this chapter.
167.08Â Â Â FEES.
The City Council shall establish a schedule of fees, charges, and expenses and
a collection procedure for site plan approval and other matters pertaining to
this chapter. The schedule of fees shall be posted in the office of the City
Clerk, and may be altered or amended only by the City Council. Until all
applicable fees, charges, and expenses have been paid in full, no action shall
be taken on any application or appeal.

remain valid for one year allowing one year extension with approval of City
Council upon recommendation of the Commission after the date of approval, after
which time the site plan shall be deemed null and void if the development has
not been established or actual construction commenced. For the purpose of this
chapter â€œactual constructionâ€ shall mean that the permanent placement of
construction materials has started and is proceeding without undue delay.
Preparation of plans, securing financial arrangements, issuance of building
permits, letting of contracts, grading of property, or stockpiling of materials
on the site shall not constitute actual construction.
167.10Â Â Â SITE PLAN AMENDMENT.
Any site plan may be amended in accordance with the standards and procedures
established herein, including payment of fees, provided that the Zoning
Administrator may waive such procedures for those minor changes hereinafter
listed. Such minor changes shall not be made unless the prior written approval
