resolves to consider such proposal, it shall publish notice and hold a public
hearing thereon. Thereafter, at least thirty (30) days after such hearing, the

Â Â Â After every service call, the Fire Chief shall prepare and deliver a
statement for any fire, hazmat cleanup or similar service rendered by the

Fire Department.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Billed to Whom. The statement for services rendered shall be sent to
the person, business, or entity responsible for payment.

Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Standby status of support vehicles;
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Manpower needed, and actually used in the response;
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Specialized equipment or services, not locally available; categories
below will be billable only in the event hazardous materials incidents or those
involving more than 4 departments, or if the materials and supplies used are in
excess of the normal amounts;
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The uninsured portion of equipment damaged, contaminated, or

Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Billing Rates. In passing the ordinance codified in this section, the
City acknowledges that the Harrison County Board of Supervisors passed County
Ordinance #2005-01 which authorized billing for fire services rendered in
Harrison County. Included in said ordinance are specific billing rates for
services rendered in the seven categories listed in subsection 2 above. In
preparing his bill for services rendered as provided herein, the Fire Chief
shall make his charges consistent with the Harrison County rates established on
September 1, 2005, in Harrison County Ordinance #2005-01, whether or not the
Harrison County Board of Supervisors repeals said ordinance. Should those
rates, as incorporated herein, be amended, the Missouri Valley Fire Chief shall
keep his statement for fire services rendered consistent with the amended rates
and charge according to the amendments. Further, the City acknowledges that the
Harrison County Board of Supervisors does not bill for extrication services in
its Ordinance #2005-01. However, the City desires to bill for extrication
services at the rate of $450.00 per vehicle for service calls that require the
extrication of any driver or passenger. The Fire Chief may bill accordingly.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Illegal Burning Rates. During a State Fire Marshal ordered burning ban,
all rates and fees established by this section shall be doubled if the Missouri
Valley Fire Department provides services to parties responsible for payment of
fire services who intentionally set fires or â€œcontrolled burnâ€ fires, which are
not accidentally ignored or pre-approved by the Fire Chief.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â False Alarms. Any person, business, or entity causing the Missouri
Valley Fire Department to respond to a fire alarm which said person, business,
or entity knows to be false or upon reasonable inspection, should have known to
be false, shall be responsible for payment of a civil penalty to the Missouri
Valley Fire Department in an amount to be billed by the Fire Chief according to
this section the same as if the false alarm were an actual fire or emergency.
This civil penalty shall be due and payable in addition to any other criminal
or civil penalties incurred due to the false alarm.

be adjusted annually on the date of the bill for the period of April 1 through
April 30. Each customer that has sewer service but does not have water service
shall pay at a rate equivalent to 70% of the water bill of a customer that uses

people at the residence shall be determined by the customerâ€™s water
application.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â New Commercial and Industrial Customers. New commercial and/or
industrial customers will be billed at the minimum sewer charge for the first
three months of service. After the first three months of service the City will

Â Â Â A water metered customer who has had a water leak, causing heavy usage
during the rate settling months, may with property documentation appeal to the
City Council for a rate adjustment within 60 days after the April billing. The
City Council will review the customerâ€™s usage history to determine if a rate
adjustment is warranted. A rate adjustment would defer to the prior yearâ€™s rate

for collection in the same manner as property taxes
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
(Ord. 567 - Mar. 21 Supp.)

material contained with the Flood Insurance Study are also declared to be a
part of this chapter.
160.04 RULES FOR INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
Â Â Â The boundaries of the zoning district areas shall be determined by scaling
distances on the Official Flood Plain Zoning Map. When an interpretation is
needed as to the exact location of a boundary, the Administrator shall make the
necessary interpretation. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals
when it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the Administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
160.05 COMPLIANCE.

160.08 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
Â Â Â The standards required by this chapter are considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes. This chapter does not imply that areas outside the
designated Flood Plain (Overlay) District areas will be free from flooding or
flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City
or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from
reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
160.09 ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING (OVERLAY) DISTRICTS.
Â Â Â The flood plain areas within the jurisdiction of this chapter are hereby
divided into the following districts:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Floodway Fringe District (FF)
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â General Flood Plain District (FP)
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Shallow Flooding District (SF)
The boundaries are as shown on the Official Flood Plain Zoning Map. Within
these districts all uses not allowed as permitted uses or permissible as
conditional uses are prohibited unless a variance to the terms of this chapter
is granted after due consideration by the Board of Adjustment.
160.10 FLOODWAY FRINGE (OVERLAY) DISTRICT - FF.
Â Â Â All development within the Floodway Fringe District shall be permitted to
the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance (or underlying
zoning district) and provided they meet applicable performance standards of the
Floodway Fringe District. All development must be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage and shall meet the following applicable performance
standards. Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no development may
increase the base elevation more than one foot.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â All development shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse
or lateral movement of the structure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the base flood elevations. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
base flood elevations and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers) may be allowed, subject to favorable consideration by the Board of
Adjustment, where existing topography, street graders, or other factors
preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods used must be adequate to
support the structure as well as withstand the various forces and hazards
associated with flooding. All new residential structures shall be provided with
a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the base
flood.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base level, or together with attendant
utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level. When
floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State of
