A municipal infraction that is a violation of Chapter 455B of the Code of Iowa

exists or continues.
   B.   A municipal infraction classified as an environmental violation is

last known mailing address, return receipt requested, or by publication in the

groundwaters, the responsible person shall cause the condition to be remedied
by a cleanup, as defined in the preceding section, as rapidly as feasible to an

the present danger to the public health, safety, and welfare, then no notice
shall be required and the City may proceed to procure the cleanup and bill the
responsible person for all costs associated with the cleanup. If the bill for
those services is not paid within 30 days, the City Attorney shall proceed to

CHAPTER 46
MINORS
 
46.01 Curfew                 46.03 Contributing to Delinquency
46.02 Cigarettes and Tobacco
 
46.01   CURFEW.
The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote the
public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and specifically
to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults responsible for
minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors committed after
the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences and criminal
activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.
1.   Definitions. For use in this section, the following terms are defined:
   A.   “Emergency errand” means, but is not limited to, an errand relating to
a fire, a natural disaster, an automobile accident or any other situation
requiring immediate action to prevent serious illness, bodily injury, or loss
of life.
   B.   “Knowingly” means knowledge that a responsible adult should reasonably
be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that responsible
adult’s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful or careless
adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult responsibility
through an objective test. It is therefore no defense that an adult responsible
for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or
whereabouts of the minor.
   C.   “Minor” means any unemancipated person under the age of 18 years.
   D.   “Nonsecured custody” means custody in an unlocked multipurpose area,
such as a lobby, office or interrogation room that is not designed, set aside,
or used as a secure detention area, and the person arrested is not physically
secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically
accompanied by a law enforcement officer or a person employed by the facility
where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to
providing nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate
juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the person’s
parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but
not for longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or
magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
   E.   “Public place” includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys, and sidewalks dedicated to public use and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises, whether publicly or privately owned,
that are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited
commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is
permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has
access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is
considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.
   F.   “Responsible adult” means a parent, guardian or other adult
specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have
custody or control of a minor.
2.   Curfew Established.
   A.   It is unlawful for any minor under the age of 16 to be or remain upon
any of the alleys, streets, or public places or to be in places of business and
amusement in the City between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. of the
following day.
   B.   It is unlawful for any minor ages 16 years or 17 years to be or remain
upon any of the alleys, streets, or public places or to be in places of

of the following day.
3.   Exceptions. The following are exceptions to the curfew:
   A.   The minor is accompanied by a responsible adult.
   B.   The minor is on the sidewalk or property where the minor resides or on
either side of the place where the minor resides and the adult responsible for
the minor has given permission for the minor to be there.
   C.   The minor is present at or is traveling between home and one of the
following:
      (1)   Minor’s place of employment in a business, trade or occupation in
which the minor is permitted by law to be engaged or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of work;
      (2)   Minor’s place of religious activity or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of the religious activity;
      (3)   Governmental or political activity or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of the activity;
      (4)   School activity or, if traveling, within one hour after the end or
before the beginning of the activity;
      (5)   Assembly such as a march, protest, demonstration, sit-in or meeting
of an association for the advancement of economic, political, religious or
cultural matters, or for any other activity protected by the First Amendment of
the U.S. Constitution guarantees of free exercise of religion, freedom of
speech, freedom of assembly or, if traveling, within one hour after the end or
before the beginning of the activity.
   D.   The minor is on an emergency errand for a responsible adult;
   E.   The minor is engaged in interstate travel through the City beginning,
ending or passing through the City when such travel is by direct route.
4.   Responsibility of Adults. It is unlawful for any responsible adult
knowingly to permit or to allow a minor to be in any public place in the City
within the time periods prohibited by this section unless the minor’s presence
falls within one of the above exceptions.
5.   Enforcement Procedures.
   A.   Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in the
absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driver’s license,
a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance, use his
or her best judgment in determining age.
   B.   Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody. Grounds for arrest are that
the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the person’s
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any nonsecured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into
custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.
   C.   Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into custody,
the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the minor as
soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible for the
minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at such
time as the court may direct.
   D.   Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minor’s parent, guardian or other person
legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the
law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative
of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person
who is known to the child.
6.   Penalties.
   A.   Responsible Adult’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation
by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall, by certified mail, send to the
adult responsible for the minor, written notice of the violation with a warning
that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew
ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with applicable
penalties.
   B.   Responsible Adult’s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as defined
in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows the minor
to violate any of the provisions of this chapter is guilty of a municipal
infraction with applicable penalties including a maximum fine of $200.00 for
each violation.
   C.   Minor’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a minor,
the law enforcement officer shall give the minor a written warning, which
states that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the
curfew ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with applicable
penalties, or, at the law enforcement officer’s discretion, may issue the minor
a citation for a first violation.
   D.   Minor’s Second Violation. For the minor’s second and subsequent
violations of any of the provisions of this section, the minor is guilty of a
municipal infraction with applicable penalties including a maximum fine of
$200.00 for each violation.
   E.   Business Establishment Violation. Any business establishment, including
any owners, agents, or employees of the business, in violation of any
provisions of this chapter is guilty of a simple misdemeanor and subject to a
maximum fine of $200.00 for each violation.
46.02   CIGARETTES AND TOBACCO.
It is unlawful for any person under 21 years of age to smoke, use, possess,
purchase, or attempt to purchase any tobacco, tobacco products, alternative
nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes. Possession of tobacco,
tobacco products, alternative nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes
by an individual under 21 years of age shall not constitute a violation of this
section if the individual under 21 years of age possesses the tobacco, tobacco
products, alternative nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes as part
of the person’s employment and said person is employed by a person who holds a
valid permit under Chapter 453A of the Code of Iowa or who lawfully offers for

Notes
  † EDITOR’S NOTE: A suggested form of notice for the abatement of nuisances is
  included in the Appendix of this Code of Ordinances. Caution is urged in the use
  of this administrative abatement procedure, particularly where cost of abatement
4 is more than minimal or where there is doubt as to whether or not a nuisance does
  in fact exist. If compliance is not secured following notice and hearings, we
  recommend you review the situation with your attorney before proceeding with
  abatement and assessment of costs. Your attorney may recommend proceedings in
  court under Chapter 657 of the Code of Iowa rather than this procedure.

applicable to municipal infractions as set forth in

50.08   PROHIBITION AGAINST FURTHER VIOLATIONS.
   A person who commits an infraction of a City ordinance subject to the
provisions of this chapter may be ordered by the Court to cease further
violations of the same provisions of the ordinance. Failure of the person to
adhere to this order will result in contempt proceedings being initiated by the
City.
50.09   ADULT ESTABLISHMENTS.
1.   As used in this section, “adult establishment” means any business that
provides nude or topless dancing or operates any other adult-oriented business.
2.   A public safety nuisance exists when it is established by clear and
convincing evidence that an owner, manager, employee, contemporaneous patron,
or guest of an adult establishment commits any of the following acts either on
the premises or in any parking lots or areas, including but not limited to
public rights-of-way, adjacent to the premises:
   A.   Unlawfully discharges a firearm or uses an offensive weapon, as defined

three or more dates within a 12-month period to which the police respond and

incident.
3.   When the City Attorney believes a serious threat to the public safety
exists, the City Attorney or any other attorney on behalf of the City Attorney,
may file a suit in equity in the district court without bond seeking abatement
of the public safety nuisance arising from an adult establishment.

WATER MAIN EXTENSIONS
 
93.01 Water Main Extension Policy 93.03 Water Main Construction Standards
93.02 Main Extension Charges      93.04 Inspection and Approval
 
93.01   WATER MAIN EXTENSION POLICY.
A water main extension will be made by the City upon application by any person
desiring service to his or her property who signs a contract for such service
and pays the cost thereof through a connection charge or otherwise as required
by this chapter.
1.   No water main will be extended beyond the City limits for commercial or
residential purposes unless the applicant agrees to voluntarily petition for
annexation simultaneously with such extension where the applicant’s property is
contiguous to the corporate limits, or agrees to so petition as soon as the
applicant’s property becomes contiguous to the City limits and files for future
use such petition so conditioned.
2.   Water mains will be extended beyond the City limits for any industrial
establishment which will employ 10 employees or more within one year of the
extension over the above existing employment in the community, without
annexation being required if it is shown that the industry needs the tax
benefit, or if it is on property not contiguous to the City limits.
3.   If the Public Works Director determines that no foreseeable need will
occur for a public water main, and so recommends to the Council upon Council
approval, an applicant for service may be permitted to construct a private main
in an undeveloped public right-of- way (i.e. no traveled way or no more than a
graded or traveled vehicular way), provided the work shall meet the City
requirements for installations in the public way, including placement in the
standard location, protection of work, quality of construction, and
backfilling. Such main shall originate in a meter and be the property of the
owner who shall be responsible for maintenance in the same manner as with water
service pipes. It shall be a condition of the contract for connection that the
City will not reimburse the owner for such a main if it has to be replaced with
a public main after five years or more use.
93.02   MAIN EXTENSION CHARGES.
Water service shall be provided through an extension of a water main in the
following cases:
1.   For distances up to 50 feet beyond existing end of a City-owned main, upon
request of a person who contracts to immediately tap the main upon the
completion of the extension and who can be expected to use water service upon
the completion of construction of the residence or commercial building or
facility to be served, there shall be no connection charge.
2.   Where two applicants, one on each side of a street, make application at
the same time under the same contract conditions as in Subsection 1 above,
extension will be made for 100 feet with no connection charge.
3.   Where a single tap is contemplated by an applicant for an extension
exceeding 50 feet and it is not foreseeable that other customer taps will be
applied for before construction is begun, the applicant shall deposit with the
City Clerk a sum equal to the estimated cost of the extension required, as
determined by the Superintendent, and enter into a contract providing for the
deposit and any future rebates in accordance with the following provisions:
   A.   The City will refund any excess of deposit over the actual cost for the
extension.
   B.   For each customer later connected to the main, the City will rebate the
proportional share (by feet of frontage) as set out in the contract, the cost
of the extension to the original applicant, but not in excess of the final
payment by that applicant, provided such connections are made within five
years, after which time no rebates shall be paid. However, the applicant shall
be entitled to a refund of the unpaid balance of the full amount deposited with
the City whenever the revenue derived from the sale of water to customers
directly connected to the extension is equal in each of two consecutive 12-
month periods within the five years following application to 10 percent of the
total actual cost of the main extension. Customer is defined as the occupant of
a one-unit dwelling, a one-residence portion of a two-unit dwelling, or as a
single commercial establishment contracting for water in its own name (and from
its own meter).
4.   The main extension shall be built to City standards and become the
property of the City as it is installed. If the applicant hires the
construction, the City shall inspect the work for compliance with City
standards and may enforce the specifications.
93.03   WATER MAIN CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
No water tap will be allowed for service to a property except when a public
water main runs along the street in front of the property (unless an alley or
easement is determined by the City to be the best approach to serving the
property) and at least 10 feet beyond the side property line, extended, nearest
to the supply side of the main. The tap must be at least four feet beyond that
property line, extended, of the abutting property. No public main shall be less
than six inches in diameter, but no such six-inch main shall be extended more
than 200 feet, and only if no foreseeable and feasible user can be served
beyond said 200 feet. The City reserves the right to put in the size of main
required for an adequate system of mains in the future to provide fire flow and
adequate pressure for reasonably foreseeable customer service. The main shall
be installed and of the quality required by specifications adopted by the
Council upon recommendation of the Superintendent.
93.04   INSPECTION AND APPROVAL.
All water service pipes and their connections to the water system must be
inspected and approved by the Superintendent. If approval is refused, the
plumber or property owner must immediately proceed to correct the work in order
to meet approval.

Superintendent. The public sewer shall be tapped with a tapping machine and a
saddle appropriate to the type of public sewer shall be glued or attached with
a gasket and stainless steel clamps to the sewer. At no time shall a building
sewer be constructed so as to enter a manhole unless special written permission
is received from the Superintendent and in accordance with the Superintendent’s
direction if such connection is approved.
96.08   INSPECTION REQUIRED.
All connections with the sanitary sewer system before being covered shall be
inspected and approved, in writing, by the Superintendent. As soon as all pipe
work from the public sewer to inside the building has been completed, and
before any backfilling is done, the Superintendent shall be notified and the
Superintendent shall inspect and test the work as to workmanship and material;
no sewer pipe laid underground shall be covered or trenches filled until after
the sewer has been so inspected and approved. If the Superintendent refuses to
approve the work, the plumber or owner must proceed immediately to correct the
work.
96.09   PROPERTY OWNER’S RESPONSIBILITY.
All costs and expenses incident to the installation, connection, and
maintenance of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall
indemnify the City from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be
occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.
96.10   ABANDONED CONNECTIONS.
When an existing sewer service is abandoned or is to be unused, it shall be
plugged or capped. A building sewer shall be considered abandoned or unused
unless a building permit for a new structure which requires sewer service has
been applied for. If a building sewer is to be reused, it shall be temporarily
disconnected at the property line or in a manner approved by the
Superintendent. This procedure shall be required at the same time the
demolition permit is issued. All lines that are to be plugged or capped must be
inspected by the Superintendent or their designee before they are covered or
buried.
96.11   ABATEMENT OF VIOLATIONS.
Construction or maintenance of building sewer lines, whether located upon the
private property of any owner or in the public right-of-way, which construction
or maintenance is in violation of any of the requirements of this chapter,
shall be corrected, at the owner’s expense, within 30 days after date of
official notice from the Council of such violation. If not made within such
time, the Council shall, in addition to the other penalties herein provided,
have the right to finish and correct the work and assess the cost thereof to
the property owner. Such assessment shall be collected with and in the same
manner as general property taxes.

All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from
periodic grab samples.)

SEWER SERVICE CHARGES
 
99.01 Sewer Service Charges Required 99.05 Payment of Bills
99.02 Special Rates                  99.06 Lien for Nonpayment
99.03 Special Surcharge              99.07 Special Agreements Permitted
99.04 Private Water Systems
 
99.01   SEWER SERVICE CHARGES REQUIRED.
Each customer shall pay sewer service charges for the use of and for the
service supplied by the municipal sanitary sewer system based upon the amount
of water consumed as follows:
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
1.   Residential Rates. Residential rates are calculated based on water
consumption for the winter quarter to eliminate sewer charges for water
consumed for outdoor uses such as sprinkling, gardening, trees, and other uses
where the water consumed does not contribute to the volume of flow to the
wastewater treatment system.
   A.   Residential Base Charge: $26.93
   B.   Residential Usage Charge: $2.92 per 100 cubic feet
2.   Commercial/Light Industrial Rates.
   A.   Commercial/Light Industrial Base Charge: $42.47
   B.   Commercial/Light Industrial Usage Charge: $2.92 per 100 cubic feet
In no case shall the minimum service charge be less than $26.93 per month for
residential usage, or $42.47 for commercial/light industrial usage, which is
necessary to retire the indebtedness, operating and maintenance, and reserve
necessary for maintaining the sanitary sewer facility.
99.02   SPECIAL RATES.
Where, in the judgment of the Superintendent and the Council, special
conditions exist to the extent that the application of the sewer charges
provided in Section
99.01 would be inequitable or unfair to either the City or the customer, a
special rate shall be proposed by the Superintendent and submitted to the
Council for approval by resolution.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
99.03   SPECIAL SURCHARGE.
The Council reserves the right to apply a sewer surcharge to any user whose
discharge strength of waste water is proven to be excessive. Said surcharge to
be determined by resolution of the Council. It is recommended that said
surcharge be employed where the volumes of BOD and suspended solids exceed 300
mg/L each, where grease exceeds 150 mg/L, and where ammonia exceeds 25 mg/L.
The monthly surcharge could then be calculated as follows:
Monthly Surcharge = (8.33/106)VX[(BOD-300)+SS-300)+Grease-150)+NH3-N-25)]
8.33 = lb./gallon
V = volume in gallons per month
X = cost per pound of treated pollutants
106 = conversion factor
99.04   PRIVATE WATER SYSTEMS.
Customers whose premises are served by a private water system shall pay sewer
charges based upon the water used as determined by the City either by an
estimate agreed to by the customer or by metering the water system at the
customer’s expense. Any negotiated or agreed-upon sales or charges shall be
subject to approval of the Council.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
99.05   PAYMENT OF BILLS.
All sewer service charges are due and payable under the same terms and
conditions provided for payment of a combined service account as contained in
Section
92.04 of this Code of Ordinances. Sewer service may be discontinued or
disconnected in accordance with the provisions contained in Section
92.05 if the combined service account becomes delinquent, and the provisions
contained in Section
92.08 relating to lien notices shall also apply in the event of a delinquent
account.
99.06   LIEN FOR NONPAYMENT.
Except as provided for in Section
92.07 of this Code of Ordinances, the owner of the premises served and any
lessee or tenant thereof shall be jointly and severally liable for sewer
service charges to the premises. Sewer service charges remaining unpaid and
delinquent shall constitute a lien upon the property or premises served and
shall be certified by the Clerk to the County Treasurer for collection in the
same manner as property taxes.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
99.07   SPECIAL AGREEMENTS PERMITTED.
No statement in these chapters shall be construed as preventing a special
agreement, arrangement, or contract between the Council, and any industrial
concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be
accepted subject to special conditions, rate, and cost as established by the
Council.

Installation
 
100.01   INTENT.
The intent of this chapter is to establish rules and regulations governing the
installation, use, and discharge of sump pumps or other groundwater conveyance
systems, and to establish the penalty structures required to enforce said rules
and regulations. The rules and regulations governing the use of sump pumps or
other groundwater conveyance systems are being established:
1.   To set forth uniform requirements for the installation, use, and discharge
of sump pumps or groundwater conveyance systems.
2.   To prevent the introduction of clean surface water, including but not
limited to, water from roof or cellar drains, springs, basement sump pumps, and
French drains.
100.02   PROHIBITED WATER.
1.   It is unlawful for any owner, occupant, or user of any premises to direct
into or allow any storm water, surface water, groundwater, well water, or water
from industrial or commercial air conditioning systems (residential properties
may have a 20 gallon per day maximum discharge from air conditioning systems)
to drain into the wastewater collection system. No rainspout, or other form of
surface drainage, and no foundation drainage or sump pump shall be connected or
discharged into any wastewater collection system.
2.   Any new or existing construction in which a sump pump has been or will be
installed shall be required to install a rigid pipe connection discharge in
accordance with this chapter. It is unlawful to maintain any connection with
the sanitary sewer carrying roof water, groundwater, surface water, or any
other natural precipitation.
3.   Exemptions.
   A.   Seasonal Waiver. Exemptions may be granted in the form of a seasonal
waiver, which would allow the property owner to temporarily discharge directly
into the wastewater collection system between the dates of October 15 and April
15. The seasonal waiver shall allow a City employee or designated
representative to certify that, prior to April 15 of each subsequent year,
their discharge water connection has been removed from the City wastewater
collection system. Failure to provide such certification shall place the
seasonal waiver holder in violation and subject to the surcharge penalty as
required under Section
100.06. Seasonal waiver requests shall be submitted on the official form
provided by the City.
      (1)   The owner of the property may place a pipe connecting the sump pump
to the sanitary sewer, which must have a shut-off valve.
      (2)   City employees or designated representatives, on or around April 15
of each year will have right of entry to inspect the system to verify that the
valve is closed so no prohibited water is discharged into the sanitary sewer.
      (3)   The owner has granted permission for City employees or designated
representatives to inspect the connection at any time between October 15 and
April 15 to verify compliance with this section. Such inspections shall be made
between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, and only when a
resident of the premises is on site.
      (4)   Failure to allow such an inspection or to allow City employees or
designated representatives entry for verification of compliance shall result in
the surcharge penalty pursuant to Section
100.06.
   B.   Non-Seasonal Waiver. Exemptions may be granted in the form of
nonseasonal waiver for a particular property owner who can demonstrate undue
hardship because of unique or extenuating circumstances. A non-seasonal waiver
would allow the property owner to discharge directly into the sanitary sewer
system without seasonal restrictions. The non-seasonal waiver request shall be
submitted to the City in writing and, at a minimum, identify the property for
which the waiver is being requested, the name of the property owner or
applicant, and detailed description of the circumstances justifying the
request. Non-seasonal waiver requests shall be submitted on the official form
provided by the City.
100.03   SUMP PUMP AND RIGID PIPE: METHOD OF INSTALLATION.
1.   A discharge pipe shall be installed through the outside foundation wall of
the building with rigid pipe (plastic, copper, or galvanized), one inch inside
diameter minimum, without valves or quick connections that would alter the path
of discharge. The discharge shall be directed away from the foundation wall.
2.   No discharge shall be directed so as to impact neighboring properties.
3.   Where a sump pit exists in any building, it shall have a pump installed
with rigid piping as specified above.
4.   Any plumber who knowingly installs a sump pump or piping that is not in
conformance with this chapter will be subject to a fine amount set by
resolution of the Council.
100.04   INSPECTIONS.
Property owners shall allow a City employee or a designated representative to
inspect the buildings to confirm that there is no sump pump or other prohibited
discharge into the wastewater collection system. The City may periodically re-
inspect any building or premises to determine compliance with the requirements
of this chapter.
100.05   REMOVAL OF CONNECTIONS.
1.   Any property owner who previously made any connection or installation in
violation of this chapter shall immediately remove such connection or correct
such an installation. If not removed or corrected within 30 calendar days after
notice of the violation has been delivered personally or by certified mail to
the owner, the City shall impose a surcharge in the amount provided in Section
100.06. Such a surcharge shall also be imposed upon any property owner, after a
30-calendar day notice has been delivered, if the owner refuses to allow his
property to be inspected.
2.   The owner of a building or premises found to not be in conformance with
this chapter during periodic re-inspections shall be subjected to a surcharge
as provided in Section
100.06 starting from the previous date of inspection.
100.06   SURCHARGE.
A surcharge per month is hereby imposed on every sewer bill to property owners
for the following conditions:

disturbance of any street, or private or public property, within City. Grantee
shall strictly adhere to all State and local laws and building and zoning codes
currently or hereafter applicable to construction, operation, or maintenance of
the system in City and give due consideration at all times to the aesthetics of
the property.
   B.   The City shall have the right to inspect all construction or
installation work performed pursuant to the provisions of the franchise and to
make such tests as it shall find necessary to ensure compliance with the terms
of the franchise and applicable provisions of local, State, and federal law.
   C.   Nothing contained in this franchise shall be construed to give Grantee
the authority to enter upon, or work on, private property in areas not
encumbered with public easements without the permission of the property owner.

private property, which are disturbed or damaged during the construction,
repair, replacement, relocation, operation, maintenance, or reconstruction of
the system shall be promptly and fully restored by Grantee, at its expense, to
a condition as good as that prevailing prior to Grantee’s work, as reasonably
approved by City in the case of streets and other public property. If Grantee
shall fail to promptly perform the restoration required herein, City shall have
the right to put the streets, public, or private property back into a condition
as good as that prevailing prior to the commencement of the construction by
Grantee; provided, however, that City shall be required to give Grantee at
least 30-days’ prior written notice of its intent to repair property pursuant
to this section. The City reserves its rights to pursue reimbursement for such
restoration from Grantee.
3.    Conditions on Street Use.
   A.   Nothing in this franchise shall be construed to prevent City from
constructing, maintaining, repairing, or relocating sewers; grading, paving,
maintaining, repairing, relocating, and/or altering any street; constructing,
laying down, repairing, maintaining, or relocating any water mains; or
constructing, maintaining, relocating, or repairing any sidewalk or other

avoiding damage to Grantee’s property.
   B.   All system transmission and distribution structures, lines, and
equipment erected by the Grantee within City shall be located so as not to
obstruct or interfere with the proper use of streets, alleys, and other public
ways and places, and to cause minimum interference with the rights of property
owners who abut any of the said streets, alleys, and other public ways and
places, and not to interfere with existing public utility facilities. The
Grantee shall furnish to and file with City Administrator the maps, plats, and
permanent records of the location and character of all facilities constructed,
including underground facilities, and Grantee shall file with City updates of
such maps, plats, and permanent records annually if changes have been made in
the system.
   C.   The Grantee shall not place poles, conduits, or other fixtures of
system above or below ground where the same will interfere with any gas,

conduits, or other fixtures placed in any street shall be so placed as to
comply with all lawful and reasonable requirements of City.
   D.   Grantee shall not erect, for any reason, any pole on or along any
street in an existing aerial utility system without the advance written
approval of the City, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. Grantee
shall exercise its best efforts to negotiate the lease of pole space and
facilities from the existing pole owners for all aerial construction.
   E.   If any such property of Grantee shall interfere with the construction
or relocation, maintenance or repair of any street or public improvement,
whether it be construction, repair, maintenance, removal or relocation of a
sewer, public sidewalk, or water main, street or any other public improvement,
30-days’ notice shall be given to Grantee by the City and all such poles,
wires, conduits or other appliances, and facilities shall be removed or
replaced by Grantee.
   F.   With the prior approval of the City, the Grantee shall have the
authority to trim any trees upon and overhanging the streets, alleys,
sidewalks, or public easements of City so as to prevent the branches of such
trees from coming in contact with the wires and cables of the Grantee. The City
reserves the right to accompany Grantee’s tree trimming crews.
   G.   Nothing contained in this franchise shall relieve any person from
liability arising out of the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid
injuring Grantee’s facilities.
4.   Undergrounding of Cable. All new installations of Grantee’s cable and
conduit shall be installed underground at Grantee’s expense where both the
existing telephone and electrical utilities are already underground. Grantee
shall place cable underground in newly-platted areas in concert with both the
telephone and electrical utilities to the extent feasible and provided that
Grantee has sufficient prior notice of such construction, unless this
requirement is waived by the City. Further, at such time as telephone and
electrical utilities change from overhead to underground, Grantee, at its
expense, shall place its cable underground and provided Grantee has at least
30-days’ prior written notice of such construction. Amplifier boxes and
pedestal-mounted terminal boxes may be placed above ground if existing
technology reasonably requires, but shall be of such size and design and shall
be so located as not to be unsightly or unsafe.
5.   Erection, Removal, and Joint Use of Poles. No poles, conduits, or other
wire holding structures shall be erected or installed by the Grantee without
prior approval from the City with regard to placement, location, height,
weight, appearance, safety, and other pertinent factors.

and devices for preventing failures and accidents which are likely to cause
damage, injuries, or nuisances to the public.
   B.   The Grantee shall install and maintain its system wires, cables,
fixtures, and other equipment in substantial compliance with the requirements
of the National Electric Safety Code and all FCC, State, and local regulations,
and in such manner that they will not interfere with any installations of City
or of any public utility serving City.
   C.   All system structures and all system lines, equipment, and connections
in, over, under, and upon the streets, sidewalks, alleys, and public ways and
places of City, wherever situated or located, shall at all times be kept and
maintained in good condition, order, and repair so that the same shall not
menace or endanger the life or property of any person.

maintenance and construction personnel and shall not unnecessarily interfere
with pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
113.05    OPERATIONS PROVISIONS.
1.   Operation and Maintenance of System. The Grantee shall render effective
service, make repairs promptly, and interrupt service only for good cause and
for the shortest time possible. Such interruption, to the extent feasible,
shall be preceded by notice in accordance with Subsection
113.03(8) herein and shall occur during periods of minimum use of the system.
2.   Technical Standards. The technical standards used in the operation of the
system shall comply, at minimum, with the technical standards promulgated by
the FCC relating to cable communications systems pursuant to the Federal
Communications Commission’s rules and regulations and found in Title 47,
Section 76.601 to 76.617, as may be amended or modified from time to time,
which regulations are expressly incorporated herein by reference.
3.   Special Testing. City may require special testing of a location or
locations within the system if there is a particular matter of controversy or
unresolved complaints pertaining to such locations. Demand for such special
tests may be made on the basis of complaints received or other evidence
indicating an unresolved controversy or noncompliance. Such tests shall be
limited to the particular matter in controversy or unresolved complaints. The
City shall endeavor to so arrange its request for such special testing so as to
minimize hardship or inconvenience to Grantee or to the subscribers caused by
such testing. Before ordering such tests, Grantee shall be afforded 30 days to
correct problems or complaints upon which tests were ordered. The City shall
meet with Grantee prior to requiring special tests to discuss the need for such
and, if possible, visually inspect those locations which are the focus of
concern. If, after such meetings and inspections, City wishes to commence
special tests and the 30 days have elapsed without correction of the matter in
controversy or unresolved complaints, the tests shall be conducted by a
qualified engineer selected by City. In the event that special testing is
required by City to determine the source of technical difficulties, the cost of
said testing shall be borne by the City if the testing reveals that the system
meets the minimum technical performance standards set forth in this chapter. If
the testing reveals that Grantee’s system does not meet the minimum technical
performance standards set forth in this chapter, then the cost of said test
shall be borne by Grantee.

from time to time.
   B.   A list of Grantee’s current subscriber rates and charges shall be

any customer service standards adopted by the FCC at 47 C.F.R. § 76.309. At a

franchise area and the City of Orange City.
113.07   COMMUNITY PROGRAMMING PROVISIONS.

facilities to handle playback for the designated access channels.
   G.   Grantee specifically agrees that any costs associated with satisfying
the obligations outlined in this section shall be entirely Grantee’s
responsibility and shall be provided free of charge to the City with no

and the confidentiality of Grantee’s information, the City shall have the right
to inspect, upon 72-hours’ written notice pursuant to Subsection
113.03(8) herein, at a time mutually agreed to by Grantee and City, all books,

places.
5.   Periodic Evaluation and Renegotiation Sessions. The field of cable
communications is a relatively new and rapidly changing one which may see many
regulatory, technical, financial, marketing, and legal changes during the term
of this franchise. Therefore, in order to provide for a maximum degree of
flexibility in this franchise, and to help achieve a continued advanced and
modem system, the following evaluation provisions will apply:
   A.   The City reserves the right to adopt rules and regulations controlling
the procedures as set forth below and the subjects for evaluation and
renegotiation sessions. In the absence of any City action taken to exercise
these rights, Grantee shall be subject to at least the procedures and subjects
described in this section.
   B.   The City may require, at its sole discretion, evaluation sessions at
any time during the term of this franchise; provided, however, there shall not
be more than one evaluation session every three years.
   C.   Topics which may be discussed at any evaluation session include, but
are not limited to, channel capacity, system technical performance,
programming, access, municipal uses of cable, subscriber complaints, judicial
rulings, FCC rulings, and any other topics the City or Grantee deems relevant.
   D.   During an evaluation session, Grantee shall fully cooperate with the
City and shall provide such information and documents as the City may request
to perform the evaluation subject to federal privacy requirements and Grantee’s
need for confidentiality of certain information.

thereafter, until the Grantee has liquidated all of its obligations with City,
the Grantee shall furnish a letter of credit to City in the amount of
$10,000.00 in a form as reasonably acceptable to City. This bond will be
conditioned upon the faithful performance of the Grantee according to the terms
of the franchise and upon the further condition that in the event the Grantee
shall fail to comply with any law, ordinance, or regulation governing the
franchise, there shall be recoverable any damages or loss suffered by City as a
result, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification, or cost
of removal or abandonment of any property of the Grantee, plus a reasonable
allowance for attorneys’ fees and costs, up to the full amount of the letter of
credit, and further guaranteeing payment by the Grantee of claims, liens, and
taxes due City which arise by reason of the construction, operation, or
maintenance of the system. The rights reserved by City with respect to the
letter of credit are in addition to all other rights City may have under the
franchise or any other law. City may, from year to year, in its sole
discretion, reduce the amount of the letter of credit.
   B.   The time for Grantee to correct any violation or liability shall be
extended by City if the necessary action to correct such violation or liability
is of such a nature or character as to require more than 30 days within which
to perform, provided Grantee provides written notice that it requires more than
30 days to correct such violations or liability, commences the corrective
action within the 30 days period, and thereafter uses reasonable diligence to
correct the violation or liability.
   C.   In the event this franchise is canceled by reason of default of Grantee
or revoked, City shall be entitled to collect from the letter of credit that
amount which is attributable to any damages sustained by City pursuant to said
default or revocation. Grantee, however, shall be entitled to the return of
such performance bond, or portion thereof, as remains at the expiration of the
term of the franchise.
   D.   The rights reserved to City with respect to the letter of credit are in
addition to all other rights of City whether reserved by this franchise or
authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with
respect to the performance bond shall affect any other right City may have.
   E.   In addition to recovery of any monies owed by Grantee to the City or
damages to the City as a result of any acts or omissions by Grantee pursuant to
the franchise, the City in its sole discretion may charge to and collect from
the letter of credit the following penalties:
      (1)   For failure to complete any required construction upgrade, unless
the City approves the delay, the penalty shall be $200.00 per day for each day,
or part thereof, such failure occurs or continues.
      (2)   For failure to comply with any of the provision of this franchise
for which a penalty is not otherwise specifically provided pursuant to this
section, the penalty shall be $100.00 per day for each day, or part thereof,
such failure occurs or continues.
      (3)   For failure to provide the services Grantee has proposed,
including, but not limited to, the implementation and the utilization of the
access channels, the penalty shall be $100.00 per day for each day, or part
thereof, such failure occurs or continues.
      (4)   Each violation of any provision of this franchise shall be
considered a separate violation for which a separate penalty can be imposed.
2.   Procedure for Remedying Franchise Violations.
   A.   Upon discovery of a violation of this franchise, the City shall first
notify Grantee of the violation in writing by personal delivery, registered, or
certified mail, state with specificity the violation alleged to have occurred
and demand correction within a reasonable time, which shall not be less than 10
days in the case of the failure of the Grantee to pay any sum or other amount
due the City under this franchise, and 30 days in all other cases. If Grantee
fails to correct the violation within the time prescribed or if Grantee fails
to commence corrective action within the time prescribed and diligently remedy
such violation thereafter, the Grantee shall then be given a written notice of
a public hearing to be held before the Council. Such written notice shall
provide for a reasonable opportunity for Grantee to attend and submit evidence
related to the alleged non-performance or cure.
   B.   At the public hearing, the Council shall hear and consider all relevant
evidence, and thereafter render written findings of fact and its decision.
   C.   In the event the Council finds that Grantee has corrected the violation
or has diligently commenced correction of such violation after notice thereof
from the City and is diligently proceeding to fully remedy such violation, or
that no material violation has occurred, the proceedings shall terminate and no
penalty or other sanction shall be imposed. In determining whether a violation
is material, the City shall take into consideration the reliability of the
evidence of the violation, the nature of the violation and the damage, if any,
caused to the Grantor thereby, whether the violation was chronic, and any
justifying or mitigating circumstances and such other matters as the Grantor
may deem appropriate. In the event that the City attempts to revoke the
franchise, after the public hearing and upon written determination by City to
revoke the franchise, Grantee may appeal said decision with an appropriate
State or federal court or agency. During the review of the appeal by an
appropriate State or federal court or agency, the franchise shall remain in
full force and effect unless the term thereof sooner expires.
   D.   If Grantee remains in non-compliance with the requirement of this
franchise, then the Grantor may pursue any available remedy.
3.   Indemnification of City.
   A.   Except as otherwise provided herein, Grantee shall indemnify, hold
harmless, release, and defend the City, its officers, agents, and employees
from and against any and all lawsuits, claims, actions, demands, damages,
disability, losses, expenses (including attorney’s fees and other defense
costs), or liabilities of any nature that may be asserted by any person or
entity arising out of the activities of Grantee, its subcontractors, employees,
and agents hereunder, except claims arising from or related to PEG access
programming or operation of PEG facilities or equipment. Grantee shall be
solely responsible and save the City harmless from all matters relative to
payment of Grantee’s employees including compliance with social security and
income tax laws and regulations.
   B.   This indemnification obligation is not limited in any way by a
limitation of the amount or type of damages or compensation payable by or for
Grantee under Workers’ Compensation, disability, or other employee benefit
acts, acceptance of insurance certificates required under this franchise, or
the terms, applicability, or limitations of any insurance held by Grantee;
provided, however, that City shall be obligated to promptly notify Grantee of
any claim or action for which it is seeking indemnification ..
   C.   Grantee shall not be required to indemnify the City under this section
for negligence or misconduct solely attributable to the act or omission of the
City, its officials, boards, commissions, agents, or employees.
4.   Insurance.
   A.   On the effective date of this franchise, Grantee shall file with the
City, and at all times thereafter maintain in full force and effect at its sole
expense, a comprehensive general liability insurance policy, including
contractual liability coverage, in protection of City in its capacity as such,
its officers, elected officials, boards, commissions, agents, and employees.
The policy or policies shall name as additional insured City, its officers,
agents, and employees. The policies of insurance shall be in the sum of not
less than $300,000.00 for personal injury or death of any one person, and
$1,000,000.00 for personal injury or death of two or more persons in any one
occurrence, $300,000.00 for property damage to any one person and $1,000,000.00
for property damage resulting from any one act or occurrence.
   B.   The policy or policies of insurance shall be maintained by Grantee in
full force and effect during the entire term of the franchise. Each policy of
insurance shall contain a statement on its face that the insurer will not
cancel the policy or fail to renew the policy, whether for nonpayment of
premium, or otherwise, and whether at the request of Grantee or for other
reasons, except after 30-days’ advance written notice have been provided to
City.

1.   City’s Right to Revoke.
   A.   In addition to all other rights which City has pursuant to law or

federal or State law, including the Bankruptcy Act, 120 days after the
appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over and conduct the business of
Grantee, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other action
or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated
prior to the expiration of said 120 days, or unless:

shall have fully complied with all the provisions of this franchise and

shall make use of existing poles and other facilities available to Grantee to
the extent it is technically and economically feasible to do so.

inconsistent with the terms, conditions, or provisions by which such street was
created or dedicated, or with the present use of the street.
   C.   This franchise shall be nonexclusive, and City reserves the right to
grant a similar use of said streets, alleys, public ways, and places, to any
person at any time, provided, however, that any additional franchise granted
shall contain the same substantive terms and conditions as this franchise.

provided that Grantee complies with federal law regarding notice to City and
subscribers prior to any channel additions, deletions, or realignments, and
further subject to Grantee’s signal carriage obligations pursuant to 47 U.S.C.
§§ 531-536, and subject to City’s rights pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 545. Grantee

programming decisions from subscribers.

1.   Construction Timetable.
   A.   Grantee shall give written notice to the City 60 days prior to the

114.03(5) herein (the “system upgrade”). Grantee shall also notify the City
when a system upgrade is completed. Notice shall be delivered to the City
within 10 days of completion of a system upgrade.
   B.   Upon receipt of notice that all construction on a system upgrade has
been completed, the City shall have 90 days to obtain a written report from an
independent engineer confirming the completion of construction in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this franchise, the cost of such report to be
borne by the City; provided, however, that if the City fails to obtain such a
written report within said 90 days, the construction shall be deemed completed,
unless the failure to obtain such a report is due to unforeseen events, acts of
God, or events beyond the reasonable control of the City.
   C.   Grantee shall furnish the City, upon request of the City, regular
progress reports, on a timeframe and in a format mutually acceptable to Grantee
and City, detailing the progress of a system upgrade.
2.   Construction Codes and Permits.
   A.   Grantee shall obtain all necessary permits from City before commencing
any construction upgrade or extension of the system, including the opening or
disturbance of any street, or private or public property, within City. Grantee
shall strictly adhere to all State and local laws and building and zoning codes
currently or hereafter applicable to construction, operation, or maintenance of
the system in City and give due consideration at all times to the aesthetics of
the property.
   B.   The City shall have the right to inspect all construction or
installation work performed pursuant to the provisions of the franchise and to
make such tests as it shall find necessary to ensure compliance with the terms
of the franchise and applicable provisions of local, State, and federal law.
   C.   Nothing contained in this franchise shall be construed to give Grantee
the authority to enter upon, or work on, private property in areas not
encumbered with public easements without the permission of the property owner.

private property, which are disturbed or damaged during the construction,
repair, replacement, relocation, operation, maintenance, or reconstruction of
the system shall be promptly and fully restored by Grantee, at its expense, to
a condition as good as that prevailing prior to Grantee’s work, as reasonably
approved by City in the case of streets and other public property. If Grantee
shall fail to promptly perform the restoration required herein, City shall have
the right to put the streets, public, or private property back into a condition
as good as that prevailing prior to the commencement of the construction by
Grantee; provided, however, that City shall be required to give Grantee at
least 30-days’ prior written notice of its intent to repair property pursuant
to this section. The City reserves its rights to pursue reimbursement for such
restoration from Grantee.
4.    Conditions on Street Use.
   A.   Nothing in this franchise shall be construed to prevent City from
constructing, maintaining, repairing, or relocating sewers; grading, paving,
maintaining, repairing, relocating, and/or altering any street; constructing,

equipment erected by the Grantee within City shall be located so as not to
obstruct or interfere with the proper use of streets, alleys, and other public
ways and places, and to cause minimum interference with the rights of property
owners who abut any of the said streets, alleys, and other public ways and
places, and not to interfere with existing public utility facilities. The
Grantee shall furnish to and file with City Administrator the maps, plats, and
permanent records of the location and character of all facilities constructed,
including underground facilities, and Grantee shall file with City updates of
such maps, plats, and permanent records annually if changes have been made in
the system.
   C.   The Grantee shall not place poles, conduits, or other fixtures of
system above or below ground where the same will interfere with any gas,
electric, telephone, water or other utility fixtures, and all such poles,

comply with all lawful and reasonable requirements of City.
   D.   Grantee shall not erect, for any reason, any pole on or along any
street in an existing aerial utility system without the advance written
approval of the City, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. Grantee
shall exercise its best efforts to negotiate the lease of pole space and
facilities from the existing pole owners for all aerial construction.
   E.   If any such property of Grantee shall interfere with the construction
or relocation, maintenance or repair of any street or public improvement,
whether it be construction, repair, maintenance, removal or relocation of a
sewer, public sidewalk, or water main, street or any other public improvement,
30-days’ notice shall be given to Grantee by the City and all such poles,
wires, conduits or other appliances, and facilities shall be removed or
replaced by Grantee.
   F.   With the prior approval of the City, the Grantee shall have the
authority to trim any trees upon and overhanging the streets, alleys,
sidewalks, or public easements of City so as to prevent the branches of such
trees from coming in contact with the wires and cables of the Grantee. The City
reserves the right to accompany Grantee’s tree trimming crews.
   G.   Nothing contained in this franchise shall relieve any person from
liability arising out of the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid
injuring Grantee’s facilities.
5.   Undergrounding of Cable. All new installations of Grantee’s cable and
conduit shall be installed underground at Grantee’s expense where both the
existing telephone and electrical utilities are already underground. Grantee
shall place cable underground in newly-platted areas in concert with both the
telephone and electrical utilities to the extent feasible and provided that
Grantee has sufficient prior notice of such construction, unless this
requirement is waived by the City. Further, at such time as telephone and
electrical utilities change from overhead to underground, Grantee, at its
expense, shall place its cable underground and provided Grantee has at least
30-days’ prior written notice of such construction. Amplifier boxes and
pedestal-mounted terminal boxes may be placed above ground if existing
technology reasonably requires, but shall be of such size and design and shall
be so located as not to be unsightly or unsafe.
6.   Erection, Removal, and Joint Use of Poles. No poles, conduits, or other
wire holding structures shall be erected or installed by the Grantee without
prior approval from the City with regard to placement, location, height,
weight, appearance, safety, and other pertinent factors.

fixtures, and other equipment in substantial compliance with the requirements
of the National Electric Safety Code and all FCC, State, and local regulations,
and in such manner that they will not interfere with any installations of City
or of any public utility serving City.
   C.   All system structures and all system lines, equipment, and connections
in, over, under, and upon the streets, sidewalks, alleys, and public ways and
places of City, wherever situated or located, shall at all times be kept and
maintained in good condition, order, and repair so that the same shall not
menace or endanger the life or property of any person.

maintenance and construction personnel and shall not unnecessarily interfere
with pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
114.05    OPERATIONS PROVISIONS.
1.   Operation and Maintenance of System. The Grantee shall render effective
service, make repairs promptly, and interrupt service only for good cause and
for the shortest time possible. Such interruption, to the extent feasible,
shall be preceded by notice in accordance with Subsection
114.03(8) herein and shall occur during periods of minimum use of the system.
2.   Technical Standards. The technical standards used in the operation of the
system shall comply, at minimum, with the technical standards promulgated by
the FCC relating to cable communications systems pursuant to the Federal
Communications Commission’s rules and regulations and found in Title 47,
Section 76.601 to 76.617, as may be amended or modified from time to time,
which regulations are expressly incorporated herein by reference.
3.   Special Testing. City may require special testing of a location or
locations within the system if there is a particular matter of controversy or
unresolved complaints pertaining to such locations. Demand for such special
tests may be made on the basis of complaints received or other evidence
indicating an unresolved controversy or noncompliance. Such tests shall be
limited to the particular matter in controversy or unresolved complaints. The
City shall endeavor to so arrange its request for such special testing so as to
minimize hardship or inconvenience to Grantee or to the subscribers caused by
such testing. Before ordering such tests, Grantee shall be afforded 30 days to
correct problems or complaints upon which tests were ordered. The City shall
meet with Grantee prior to requiring special tests to discuss the need for such
and, if possible, visually inspect those locations which are the focus of
concern. If, after such meetings and inspections, City wishes to commence
special tests and the 30 days have elapsed without correction of the matter in
controversy or unresolved complaints, the tests shall be conducted by a
qualified engineer selected by City. In the event that special testing is
required by City to determine the source of technical difficulties, the cost of
said testing shall be borne by the City if the testing reveals that the system
meets the minimum technical performance standards set forth in this chapter. If
the testing reveals that Grantee’s system does not meet the minimum technical
performance standards set forth in this chapter, then the cost of said test
shall be borne by Grantee.
4.   FCC Reports. The results of tests required to be filed by Grantee with the
FCC shall also be copied to City .

Communications Commission at 47 C.F.R., 76.900 et seq. as they may be amended
from time to time.
   B.   A list of Grantee’s current subscriber rates and charges shall be

any customer service standards adopted by the FCC at 47 C.F.R. § 76.309. At a

5.   Periodic Evaluation and Renegotiation Sessions. The field of cable
communications is a relatively new and rapidly changing one which may see many
regulatory, technical, financial, marketing, and legal changes during the term

flexibility in this franchise, and to help achieve a continued advanced and
modem system, the following evaluation provisions will apply:
   A.   The City reserves the right to adopt rules and regulations controlling

renegotiation sessions. In the absence of any City action taken to exercise
these rights, Grantee shall be subject to at least the procedures and subjects

thereafter, until the Grantee has liquidated all of its obligations with City,
the Grantee shall furnish a letter of credit to City in the amount of
$10,000.00 in a form as reasonably acceptable to City. This bond will be
conditioned upon the faithful performance of the Grantee according to the terms
of the franchise and upon the further condition that in the event the Grantee
shall fail to comply with any law, ordinance, or regulation governing the
franchise, there shall be recoverable any damages or loss suffered by City as a
result, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification, or cost
of removal or abandonment of any property of the Grantee, plus a reasonable
allowance for attorneys’ fees and costs, up to the full amount of the letter of
credit, and further guaranteeing payment by the Grantee of claims, liens, and
taxes due City which arise by reason of the construction, operation, or
maintenance of the system. The rights reserved by City with respect to the
letter of credit are in addition to all other rights City may have under the
franchise or any other law. City may, from year to year, in its sole
discretion, reduce the amount of the letter of credit.
   B.   The time for Grantee to correct any violation or liability shall be
extended by City if the necessary action to correct such violation or liability
is of such a nature or character as to require more than 30 days within which
to perform, provided Grantee provides written notice that it requires more than
30 days to correct such violations or liability, commences the corrective
action within the 30 days period, and thereafter uses reasonable diligence to
correct the violation or liability.
   C.   In the event this franchise is canceled by reason of default of Grantee
or revoked, City shall be entitled to collect from the letter of credit that
amount which is attributable to any damages sustained by City pursuant to said
default or revocation. Grantee, however, shall be entitled to the return of
such performance bond, or portion thereof, as remains at the expiration of the
term of the franchise.
   D.   The rights reserved to City with respect to the letter of credit are in
addition to all other rights of City whether reserved by this franchise or
authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with
respect to the performance bond shall affect any other right City may have.
   E.   In addition to recovery of any monies owed by Grantee to the City or
damages to the City as a result of any acts or omissions by Grantee pursuant to
the franchise, the City in its sole discretion may charge to and collect from
the letter of credit the following penalties:
      (1)   For failure to complete any required construction upgrade, unless
the City approves the delay, the penalty shall be $200.00 per day for each day,
or part thereof, such failure occurs or continues.
      (2)   For failure to comply with any of the provision of this franchise
for which a penalty is not otherwise specifically provided pursuant to this
section, the penalty shall be $100.00 per day for each day, or part thereof,
such failure occurs or continues.
      (3)   For failure to provide the services Grantee has proposed,
including, but not limited to, the implementation and the utilization of the
access channels, the penalty shall be $100.00 per day for each day, or part
thereof, such failure occurs or continues.
      (4)   Each violation of any provision of this franchise shall be
considered a separate violation for which a separate penalty can be imposed.
2.   Procedure for Remedying Franchise Violations.
   A.   Upon discovery of a violation of this franchise, the City shall first
notify Grantee of the violation in writing by personal delivery, registered, or
certified mail, state with specificity the violation alleged to have occurred
and demand correction within a reasonable time, which shall not be less than 10
days in the case of the failure of the Grantee to pay any sum or other amount
due the City under this franchise, and 30 days in all other cases. If Grantee
fails to correct the violation within the time prescribed or if Grantee fails
to commence corrective action within the time prescribed and diligently remedy
such violation thereafter, the Grantee shall then be given a written notice of
a public hearing to be held before the Council. Such written notice shall
provide for a reasonable opportunity for Grantee to attend and submit evidence
related to the alleged non-performance or cure.
   B.   At the public hearing, the Council shall hear and consider all relevant
evidence, and thereafter render written findings of fact and its decision.
   C.   In the event the Council finds that Grantee has corrected the violation
or has diligently commenced correction of such violation after notice thereof
from the City and is diligently proceeding to fully remedy such violation, or
that no material violation has occurred, the proceedings shall terminate and no
penalty or other sanction shall be imposed. In determining whether a violation
is material, the City shall take into consideration the reliability of the
evidence of the violation, the nature of the violation and the damage, if any,
caused to the Grantor thereby, whether the violation was chronic, and any
justifying or mitigating circumstances and such other matters as the Grantor
may deem appropriate. In the event that the City attempts to revoke the
franchise, after the public hearing and upon written determination by City to
revoke the franchise, Grantee may appeal said decision with an appropriate
State or federal court or agency. During the review of the appeal by an
appropriate State or federal court or agency, the franchise shall remain in
full force and effect unless the term thereof sooner expires.
   D.   If Grantee remains in non-compliance with the requirement of this
franchise, then the Grantor may pursue any available remedy.
3.   Indemnification of City.
   A.   Except as otherwise provided herein, Grantee shall indemnify, hold
harmless, release, and defend the City, its officers, agents, and employees
from and against any and all lawsuits, claims, actions, demands, damages,
disability, losses, expenses (including attorney’s fees and other defense
costs), or liabilities of any nature that may be asserted by any person or
entity arising out of the activities of Grantee, its subcontractors, employees,
and agents hereunder, except claims arising from or related to PEG access
programming or operation of PEG facilities or equipment. Grantee shall be
solely responsible and save the City harmless from all matters relative to
payment of Grantee’s employees including compliance with social security and
income tax laws and regulations.
   B.   This indemnification obligation is not limited in any way by a
limitation of the amount or type of damages or compensation payable by or for
Grantee under Workers’ Compensation, disability, or other employee benefit
acts, acceptance of insurance certificates required under this franchise, or
the terms, applicability, or limitations of any insurance held by Grantee;
provided, however, that City shall be obligated to promptly notify Grantee of
any claim or action for which it is seeking indemnification ..
   C.   Grantee shall not be required to indemnify the City under this section
for negligence or misconduct solely attributable to the act or omission of the
City, its officials, boards, commissions, agents, or employees.
4.   Insurance.
   A.   On the effective date of this franchise, Grantee shall file with the

expense, a comprehensive general liability insurance policy, including
contractual liability coverage, in protection of City in its capacity as such,
its officers, elected officials, boards, commissions, agents, and employees.
The policy or policies shall name as additional insured City, its officers,
agents, and employees. The policies of insurance shall be in the sum of not
less than $300,000.00 for personal injury or death of any one person, and
$1,000,000.00 for personal injury or death of two or more persons in any one
occurrence, $300,000.00 for property damage to any one person and $1,000,000.00
for property damage resulting from any one act or occurrence.
   B.   The policy or policies of insurance shall be maintained by Grantee in
full force and effect during the entire term of the franchise. Each policy of
insurance shall contain a statement on its face that the insurer will not
cancel the policy or fail to renew the policy, whether for nonpayment of
premium, or otherwise, and whether at the request of Grantee or for other
reasons, except after 30-days’ advance written notice have been provided to
City.

1.   City’s Right to Revoke. In addition to all other rights which City has
pursuant to law or equity, City reserves the right to revoke, terminate, or

prior to the expiration of said 120 days, or unless:
   A.   Within 120 days after election or appointment, such receiver or trustee
shall have fully complied with all the provisions of this franchise and

shall not be required where Grantee grants a security interest in its franchise
and assets to secure an indebtedness.

of “transient merchant” set forth in Subsection
122.02(3) of this Code of Ordinances shall not be available during the time

chapter shall apply to all owners or operators of facilities, as that term is
described herein, in the public rights-of-way, in addition to, and not in lieu
of any other provisions of this Code of Ordinances. To the extent there is a
conflict between (i) the terms and conditions of this chapter and (ii) any
existing ordinance that applies to an owner or operator of facilities in the
public rights-of-way, the terms of the latter shall be expressly subordinate to
the terms and conditions of the former. Any owner or operator of a facility
that is not required to obtain a franchise or lease for any reason shall
nonetheless be subject to the provisions of this chapter to the maximum extent
permitted by law.
141.04   AUTHORITY.
The ordinance codified in this chapter is adopted pursuant to the City’s
powers, including but not limited to those under Section 38A of the Iowa
Constitution and Section 364.2 of the Code of Iowa.
141.05   RESERVATION OF RIGHTS; POLICE POWER.
No registration shall estop or limit the City in the full exercise of its
governmental powers to protect the health and safety of the public, and all its
governmental powers may be fully exercised except as expressly provided to the
contrary herein. In particular, and without limitation, the City expressly
reserves the right to amend this chapter from time to time in the exercise of
its governmental powers.
141.06   CONDITIONS FOR USING THE PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
1.   Authorization Required. No person shall install, erect, hang, lay, bury,
draw, emplace, construct, reconstruct, maintain, or operate any facility upon,
across, beneath or over any public right-of-way in the City or other City
property without first obtaining from the City the necessary authorization
required under local, State or federal law. An owner or operator of facilities
may be required to hold different authorizations for its use of the public
rights-of-way to provide different services. For example, and without
limitation, the owner or operator of facilities that provides both cable
service and electric services must also obtain both a cable franchise and an
electric service franchise before the owner or operator may offer cable
television service within the City.
2.   Registration Required.
   A.   A person that desires to place or operate a facility shall first
register with the City in accordance with this chapter. Subject to the terms
and conditions prescribed in this chapter and to any other applicable
ordinances and regulations of the City, an approved registrant may place and
operate a facility in the City’s public rights-of-way.
   B.   A registration shall be revocable at will to the extent permitted by
State and federal law.
   C.   No reference herein, or in any registration issued hereunder, to a
public right-of-way shall be deemed to be a representation or warranty by the
City that its interest or other right to control the use of such property is
sufficient to permit its use for such purposes, and a registrant shall be
deemed to acquire only those rights of user as are properly in the City and as
the City may have the undisputed right and power to give.
   D.   A registration under this chapter shall not convey any title or
property interest, equitable or legal, in the public rights-of-way.
   E.   A registration under this chapter does not excuse a person from
obtaining any necessary work permits before carrying out activities in the
public rights-of-way.
   F.   A registration under this chapter does not excuse a person from
obtaining any necessary pole attachment agreements or other permissions before
locating its facilities on private property, or on public property other than
the public rights-of-way.
   G.   Registration shall not in itself reserve priority over any other right-
of-way users for the placement or maintenance of a facility. Registrations are
expressly subject to any future amendment to this chapter and to any other
lawful City ordinances, as well as to any applicable State or federal law.
3.   Registration Requirements.
   A.   If a facility has more than one owner or operator, each such owner or
operator must register.
   B.   Each person that wishes to place or maintain a facility shall file a

Commission certificate of authorization number, if the registrant is a
corporation, proof of authority to do business in the State of Iowa, including
the number of the certificate of incorporation.
   C.   The Public Works Director shall review the information submitted by the
registrant and respond in writing to the applicant within 30 days after receipt
of registration information pursuant to this section. If the City determines
that the information submitted by the registrant is in accordance with
paragraph B above, the City’s response shall approve the registration,
effective immediately. If the City determines that the information submitted by
the registrant is not in accordance with paragraph B above, the City shall
notify the applicant that its registration is not effective, and shall identify
the reasons for the insufficiency of the registration information.
   D.   A registrant may cancel its registration by written notice to the City
stating that it will no longer place, maintain, or operate any facilities in
public rights-of-way within the City and will no longer need to obtain permits
to perform work in public rights-of-way. A registrant may not cancel its
registration if the registrant continues to place, maintain, or operate any
facilities in public rights-of-way.
   E.   Within 30 days of any change in the information that must be submitted
pursuant to paragraph B of this subsection, a registrant shall provide updated
information to the City.
   F.   A registrant shall renew its registration with the City by April 1 of
each even-numbered year, in accordance with the City’s registration
requirements. If no information in the then-existing registration has changed
and no additional information needs to be submitted, the renewal shall state
that no information has changed.
   G.   The Mayor shall issue a certificate of compliance to an owner or
operator of a facility within 30 days after its registration or renewal if the
following conditions have been met:
      (1)   The owner or operator has provided evidence of valid registration
under this section.
      (2)   The owner or operator has demonstrated that it has in effect the
bond or letter of credit required under Section

      (3)   The owner or operator has provided the certificate of insurance
required under Section
141.20.
      (4)   The City is not aware of any noncompliance by the owner or operator
with applicable law.
   H.   If a registrant fails to timely renew its registration, the City may
suspend any certificate of compliance issued pursuant to Subsection
141.06(3)(G) on the basis of the registration until the registrant has complied
with the registration requirements of this chapter.
   I.   To the extent permitted by applicable law, the City may require a
registrant that places or maintains facilities in the public rights-of-way to
pay compensation to the City for such use or occupation of the public rights-
of-way.
141.07   WORK PERMIT REQUIRED.
1.   No person shall install, erect, hang, lay, bury, draw, emplace, construct,
reconstruct, or otherwise work on any facility upon, across, beneath, or over
any public right-of-way in the City, or enter upon a public place or the public
rights-of-way at any time to work on facilities, without first obtaining a work
permit to do so from the Public Works Director, except as otherwise provided in
this chapter. No work permit to work or make an excavation in a public place or
public rights-of-way shall be issued except as provided in this chapter. An
authorization under this chapter shall not render unnecessary or take the place
of such work permits.

excavation and removing all obstructions, material, and debris, and
restoration.
   K.   Any other sketches, maps, studies, engineering reports, tests,
profiles, cross-sections, construction plans, and specifications so the Public
Works Director may fully analyze the application. The application, when
approved and signed by the Public Works Director, shall constitute a work
permit.
4.   Any proposed lane closures will require the completion of a separate lane
closure notice, including a sketch showing the location of the lane to be
closed and applicable dimensions. The form is provided by the Public Works
Director, and must also be submitted to and approved by the Public Works
Director.
5.   The City may withhold work permits for a facility if an owner or operator
thereof lacks an effective certificate of compliance.
141.08   WORK PERMITS NOT TRANSFERABLE.
A work permit issued under the provisions of this chapter shall not be

2.   Routine maintenance, as determined by the Public Works Director. However,
if damage is caused during routine maintenance, restoration shall be in
compliance with Section
141.13 of this chapter.
141.10   CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
1.   Construction, operation, maintenance, and repair of facilities shall be in
accordance with all applicable law and regulation, and with sound industry
practice. All safety practices required by law shall be used during
construction, maintenance, and repair of facilities.
2.   No franchisee, registrant or holder of any work permit for any facility
shall dig, trench, or otherwise excavate in the public rights-of-way without
complying with the provisions of the Iowa One-Call System, Iowa Code § 480.3
et. seq., or its successor.
3.   An owner or operator shall at all times employ at least ordinary care and
shall install and maintain in use commonly accepted methods and devices
preventing failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage, injury, or
nuisance to the public.
4.   In the event of a conflict among codes and standards, the most stringent
code or standard shall apply (except insofar as those standards, if followed,
would result in a system that could not meet requirements of federal, State, or
local law, or is expressly preempted by other such standards).
5.   A franchisee or registrant shall have the authority to trim trees that
overhang public rights-of-way of the City so as to prevent the branches of such
trees from coming in contact with the facilities of the franchisee or
registrant. Notwithstanding that grant of authority, if the franchisee or
registrant performs the work, it shall be fully liable for any damages caused
thereby, and shall be responsible for replacing damaged trees and shrubs.
Franchisee or registrant shall be responsible for notifying abutting property
owners prior to trimming trees and shall obtain permission from the Public
Works Department. At the option of the City, such trimming may be done by it.
6.   The City may adopt additional standards as required to ensure that work
continues to be performed in a safe, orderly, and workmanlike manner.
7.   Every owner or operator shall, at least 30 days prior to commencing
significant construction activity (including a significant rebuild, upgrade, or
repair to existing facilities) upon, across, beneath, or over any public right-
of-way in the City or other City property, specify in writing the date on which
the owner or operator anticipates it will begin construction and the
approximate length of time required for such construction.
8.   Prior to the erection, construction, upgrade or rebuild of any facilities
in the public right-of-way, the owner or operator of such facilities shall
first submit to the City for approval a concise description of the facilities
proposed to be erected or installed, including engineering drawings, if
required by the City, together with maps and plans indicating the proposed
location of all such facilities. The owner or operator shall provide the best
information it has in such reasonable format as may be specified by the City
for the City’s planning function. No such erection or construction shall be
commenced by any person until approval therefor has been received from the
City.
9.   Any contractor or subcontractor used for work or construction,
installation, operation, maintenance or repair of facilities in the public
rights-of-way must be properly licensed under laws of the State and all
applicable local ordinances. Each contractor or subcontractor shall have the
same obligations with respect to its work as an owner or operator of the
facility would have if the work were performed by the owner or operator. An
owner or operator shall be responsible for all activities carried out by its
contractors, subcontractors and employees at the owner or operator’s request.
10.   The owner or operator of facilities in the public rights-of-way shall
notify the public prior to commencing any construction that will significantly
disturb or disrupt public property or have the potential to present a danger or
affect the safety of the public generally. Written notice of such construction
work shall be delivered to the City at least one week prior to commencement of
that work. Notice shall be provided to those persons most likely to be affected
by the work in at least two of the following ways: by telephone, in person, by
mail, by distribution of flyers to residences, by publication in local
newspapers, or in any other manner reasonably calculated to provide adequate
notice. If an owner or operator must enter a building or other structure, it
must schedule an appointment at the convenience of the owner or resident.
141.11   PLACEMENT OF FACILITIES.
1.   All facilities shall be installed and located to minimize interference
with the rights and convenience of other property owners.
2.   An owner or operator of a facility shall not place facilities, equipment,
or fixtures where they will interfere with any other utility or cable
facilities, or obstruct or hinder in any manner the various utilities serving
the residents of the City or their use of any public rights-of-way.
3.   The City may reasonably direct the specific placement of facilities to
ensure that users of the public rights-of-way do not interfere with each other
and that the public rights-of-way are used safely and efficiently.
4.   Every franchisee or registrant that shall cease operating or maintaining
any facility shall, upon written request of the City within two years or the
cessation or maintenance of such facility, promptly remove it. Should the
franchisee or registrant neglect, refuse, or fail to remove such facility, the
City may remove the facility at the expense of the franchisee or registrant.
The obligation to remove shall survive the termination of the franchise or
license for a period of two years and shall be bonded.  
5.   No owner or operator of a facility shall erect new aerial plant in or on a
public right-of-way in which one or more public service providers (electricity,
telephone, cable television) has placed its lines underground, or in an area
which the City has by ordinance forbidden new aerial plant to be constructed or
existing aerial plant to be maintained.
6.   If at any time the City determines that existing wires, cables, or other
like facilities of public utilities anywhere in the City shall be changed from
an overhead to underground installation, the owner or operator of a facility
shall at the owner’s or operator’s sole expense, convert its system to an
underground installation.
7.   To the extent practicable, above-ground equipment placed on private
property shall be placed at the location requested by the property owner. An
owner or operator shall provide affected homeowners with at least 10 days’
advance written notice of its plans to install such equipment, and shall make
reasonable efforts to confer with such homeowners before any work is done.
8.   Whenever above-ground equipment is placed on private property, the
operator shall either provide landscaping camouflage acceptable to the property
owner, at the operator’s expense, or shall provide a cash allowance to the
property owner for such landscaping in the amount of $2000.00, adjusted
annually for inflation based on the Consumer Price Index. An operator may
provide such allowance either in the form of a credit against customer
billings, if the property owner is a customer, or in the form of a cash
payment.
141.12   RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.
1.   The owner or operator of a facility on or within the public rights-of-way
shall, at its own expense, upon written notice from the City reasonably in
advance, promptly relocate any facility located on or within the public rights-
of-way as the City may deem necessary or appropriate to facilitate the
realignment, reconstruction, improvement or repair of public streets,
sidewalks, curbs, drains, sewers, and public improvements of any sort;
provided, however, an operator may be permitted to abandon any property in
place with the written consent of the City.
2.   If any removal, relaying, or relocation is required to accommodate the
construction, operation, or repair of the facilities of another person that is
authorized to use the public rights-of-way, an owner or operator of a facility
shall, upon 30 days’ advance written notice, take action to effect the
necessary changes requested by the responsible entity. The City may resolve
disputes as to responsibility for costs associated with the removal, relaying,
or relocation of facilities as among entities authorized to install facilities
in the public rights-of-way if the parties are unable to do so themselves, and
if the matter is not governed by a valid contract between the parties or a
State or federal law or regulation.
3.   In the event of an emergency, or where a facility creates or is
contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety, or property, the City may
remove, relay, or relocate any or all parts of that communications system
without prior notice.
141.13   RESTORATION.
If an owner or operator of a facility disturbs a pavement, sidewalk, driveway,
or other surfacing or landscaping, either on private property or in public
rights-of-way, the owner or operator shall, in a manner approved by the City,
replace and restore all pavement, sidewalk, driveway, or other surfacing or
landscaping disturbed, in substantially the same condition and in a good,
workmanlike, timely manner, in accordance with any standards for such work set
by the City. Such restoration shall be undertaken within no more than 30 days
after the damage is incurred, and shall be completed as soon as reasonably
possible thereafter. The owner or operator shall guarantee and maintain such
restoration for at least one year against defective materials or workmanship.
141.14   BUSINESS LICENSE.
A franchise or lease under this chapter does not render unnecessary or take the
place of any generally applicable business license that may be required by the
City for the privilege of transacting and carrying on a business within the
City generally.
141.15   REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS.
All registrants will reimburse the City for its internal and out-of-pocket
costs, including but not limited to attorneys’ and consultants’ fees, actually
and reasonably incurred by the City in connection with the review of any
authorization under this chapter, as determined by the City after it takes
action on the application. Any application fee submitted with the application
will be credited against this amount. The applicant will remit to the City
payment for such costs within 30 days of its receipt of the City’s invoice.

Each owner and operator of facilities in the public rights-of-way shall
maintain books, records, and plant accounts sufficient to document its
obligations for right-of-way fees under this chapter or any other fee owed
pursuant to this Code of Ordinances. Such books, records, and accounts shall be
maintained and available for inspection for a period of four years; provided,
however, such books, records, and accounts shall be maintained and available
during the continuation of any audit by or on behalf of the City commenced
during such four-year period or during any dispute or litigation with respect
thereto.
141.18   REPORTS AND RECORDS.
1.   Open Books and Records.
   A.   The City shall have the right to inspect and copy at any time during
normal business hours at the nearest office of an owner or operator of a

designate, all books, receipts, maps, records, codes, programs, and disks or
other storage media and other like material which the City reasonably deems
appropriate in order to monitor compliance with the terms of this chapter or
applicable law. This includes not only the books and records of the operator,
but any books and records held by an affiliate, or any contractor,
subcontractor or any person holding any form of management contract for the
facilities in the public rights-of-way to the extent such books or records
relate to the facilities. An owner or operator is responsible for collecting
the information and producing it at a location as specified above.
   B.   Access to an owner or operator’s records shall not be denied on the
basis that said records contain “proprietary” information. Any confidential
information received by the City shall remain confidential insofar as permitted
by the Iowa Fair Information Practices Act, Iowa Code § 22.1111 and other
applicable State and federal law.
2.   Annual Report. Unless this requirement is waived in whole or in part in
writing by the City, no later than 90 days after the end of its fiscal year,
each owner or operator of facilities in the public rights-of-way shall submit a
written report to the City, in a form directed by the City, which shall
include:
   A.   An organizational chart showing all corporations or partnerships with
more than a five percent ownership interest in the owner or operator, and the
nature of that ownership interest (limited partner, general partner, preferred
shareholder, etc.); and showing the same information for each corporation or
partnership that holds such an interest in the corporations or partnerships so
identified, and so on until the ultimate corporate and partnership interests
are identified.
   B.   Detailed, updated maps depicting the location of all facilities in the
City.
3.   Special Reports. Unless this requirement is waived in whole or in part by

   A.   An owner or operator shall submit monthly construction reports to the
City for any major construction undertaken in the public rights-of-way until
such construction is complete. The owner or operator must submit updated as-
built system design maps to the City, or make them available for inspection
with notice of their availability, within 30 days of the completion of system
construction in any geographic area. These maps shall be developed on the basis
of post-construction inspection by the owner or operator and construction
personnel. Any departures from design must be indicated on the as-built maps.
   B.   An owner or operator must submit a copy and brief explanation of any
request for protection under bankruptcy laws, or any judgment related to a
declaration of bankruptcy by the owner or operator or by any partnership or
corporation that owns or controls the owner or operator directly or indirectly.
4.   Records Required. An owner or operator of facilities in the public rights-
of-way shall at all times maintain:
   A.   A full and complete set of plans, records, and “as built” maps showing
the exact location of all equipment installed or in use in the City, exclusive
of customer service drops.
   B.   A file showing its plan and timetable for construction of the
facilities.
5.   Voluminous Materials. If any books, records, maps or plans, or other
requested documents are too voluminous, or for security reasons cannot be
copied and moved, then an owner or operator of facilities in the public rights-
of-way may request that the inspection take place at some other location,
provided that (i) the owner or operator must make necessary arrangements for
copying documents selected by the City after review; and (ii) the owner or
operator must pay all travel and additional copying expenses incurred by the
City in inspecting those documents or having those documents inspected by its
designee.
141.19   BOND OR LETTER OF CREDIT.
No person shall install, erect, hang, lay, bury, draw, emplace, construct,
reconstruct, maintain, or operate any facility upon, across, beneath, or over
any public right-of-way in the City or other City property until the owner or
operator shall have filed with the City a bond or letter of credit, in a form
acceptable to the City, running in favor of the City, to guarantee the
obligations of the owner or operator under this chapter and applicable law. The
amount of the bond or letter of credit shall be no less than the reasonable
cost of removal of the facilities and restoration of any affected public
rights-of-way or other property pursuant to this chapter.
141.20   INSURANCE.
Prior to the issuance of a certificate of compliance to an owner or operator of
a facility, the owner or operator of the facility shall purchase general
liability insurance, specifically identifying the City of Orange City, Iowa as
an additional insured, in a minimum amount of $1,000,000.00, with a maximum
deductible of $5,000.00, to cover any and all claims arising from the owner’s
or operator’s use of the public right-of-way within the City. Upon request of
the City, the owner or operator of a facility shall submit a certified copy of
this insurance policy to the City.

other applicable law: $200.00 per day for each violation for each day the
violation continues.
2.   Additional Remedies. In addition to any other remedies hereunder, the City
may seek an injunction to mitigate or terminate a violation, or employ any
other remedy available at law or equity, including but not limited to
imposition of penalties pursuant to Subsection 5 of this section.
3.   Timely Performance. Any failure of the City to insist on timely
performance or compliance by any person shall not constitute a waiver of the
City’s right to later insist on timely performance or compliance by that person
or any other person.
4.   Termination on Account of Certain Assignments or Appointments.
   A.   To the extent not prohibited by the United States Bankruptcy Code, an
authorization under this chapter shall terminate automatically by force of law
120 calendar days after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the
appointment of a receiver or trustee (including a debtor-in-possession in a
reorganization) to take over the business of the owner or operator, whether in
bankruptcy or under a State law proceeding; provided, however, such
authorization shall not so terminate if, within that 120-day period:
      (1)   Such assignment, receivership or trusteeship has been vacated; or
      (2)   Such assignee, receiver, or trustee has cured any defaults and has
fully complied with the terms and conditions of this chapter and any applicable
agreement and has executed an agreement, approved by any court having
jurisdiction, under which it assumes and agrees to be bound by the terms and
conditions of this chapter and any applicable agreement.
   B.   In the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the
facilities, equipment, or property of an owner or operator of facilities in the
public rights-of-way, its authorization under this chapter shall automatically
terminate 30 calendar days after such foreclosure or sale, unless:
      (1)   The City has approved a transfer to the successful bidder; and
      (2)   The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the City to
assume and be bound by the terms and conditions binding its predecessor.
   C.   Any mortgage, pledge or lease of facilities in the public rights-of-way
shall be subject and subordinate to the rights of the City under this chapter,
any applicable agreement, and other applicable law.
   D.   If an authorization under this chapter is terminated for any reason,
the City may, at its discretion, require the franchisee or registrant to remove
its facilities from the public rights-of-way and to restore the public rights-
of-way to their prior condition at the owner or operator’s expense, or that of
their sureties. If an owner or operator whose authorization has been terminated
fails, after reasonable notice from the City, to remove its facilities from the
public rights-of-way, such facilities shall be deemed abandoned and ownership
forfeited to the City.
5.   All remedies specified in this section are cumulative unless otherwise
expressly stated. The exercise of one remedy shall not foreclose use of
another, nor shall the exercise of a remedy or the payment of liquidated
damages or penalties relieve an operator of its obligations to comply with this
chapter.
6.   The owner or operator shall pay any penalty assessed in accordance with
this section within 14 days after receipt of notice from the City of such
penalty.
7.   The City may reduce or waive any of the above-listed penalties for good
cause shown.
141.22   INDEMNIFICATION.
1.   An owner or operator of facilities in the public rights-of-way shall, at
its sole cost and expense, indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the City, its
officials, boards, commissions, commissioners, agents, and employees, against
any and all claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings, and judgments for
damages or equitable relief arising out of the construction, maintenance, or
operation of its facilities in the public rights-of-way, or the conduct of the
owner or operator’s business in the City, or in any way arising out of the
owner or operator’s activities in the City’s public rights-of-way, regardless
of whether the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or
prohibited by this chapter.
2.   The indemnity provided under Subsection 1 includes, but is not limited to,
the City’s reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in defending against any such
claim, suit, or proceeding.
3.   Recovery by the City of any amounts under insurance, the performance bond,
letter of credit, or otherwise shall not limit in any way a person’s duty to
indemnify the City, nor shall such recovery relieve a person of its obligations
pursuant to an authorization under this chapter, limit the amounts owed to the
City, or in any respect prevent the City from exercising any other right or
remedy it may have.
141.23   TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.
This chapter applies to the provision of telecommunications services for hire
in the public rights-of-way but does not include such provision of cable

145.02   GENERAL DEFINITION OF UNSAFE.
All buildings or structures that are structurally unsafe or not provided with
adequate egress, or that constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise dangerous
to human life, or that in relation to existing use constitute a hazard to
safety or health, or public welfare, by reason of inadequate maintenance,
dilapidation, obsolescence, or abandonment, are, for the purpose of this
chapter, unsafe buildings. All such unsafe buildings are hereby declared to be
public nuisances and shall be abated by repair, rehabilitation, demolition, or
removal in accordance with the procedure specified in this chapter.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 657A.1 and 364.12[3a])

3.   Inadequate Maintenance. Whenever a building or structure, used or intended
to be used for dwelling purposes, because of dilapidation, decay, damage,
faulty construction, or otherwise, is determined by any health officer to be
unsanitary, unfit for human habitation or in such condition that it is likely
to cause sickness or disease.
4.   Fire Hazard. Whenever any building or structure, because of dilapidated
condition, deterioration, damage, or other cause, is determined by the Fire
Marshal or Fire Chief to be a fire hazard.
5.   Abandoned. Whenever any portion of a building or structure remains on a
site after the demolition or destruction of the building or structure or
whenever any building or structure is abandoned for a period in excess of six
months so as to constitute such building or portion thereof an attractive
nuisance or hazard to the public.
145.04   NOTICE TO OWNER.
The enforcement officer shall examine or cause to be examined every building or
structure or portion thereof reported as dangerous or damaged and, if such is
found to be an unsafe building as defined in this chapter, the enforcement
officer shall give to the owner of such building or structure written notice
stating the defects thereof. This notice may require the owner or person in
charge of the building or premises, within 48 hours or such reasonable time as
the circumstances require, to commence either the required repairs or
improvements or demolition and removal of the building or structure or portions
thereof, and all such work shall be completed within 90 days from date of
notice, unless otherwise stipulated by the enforcement officer. If necessary,
such notice shall also require the building, structure, or portion thereof to
be vacated forthwith and not reoccupied until the required repairs and
improvements are completed, inspected, and approved by the enforcement officer.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[3h])
1.   Notice Served. Such notice shall be served by sending by certified mail to
the owner of record, according to Section 364.12[3h] of the Code of Iowa, if
the owner is found within the City limits. If the owner is not found within the
City limits, such service may be made upon the owner by registered mail or
certified mail. The designated period within which said owner or person in
charge is required to comply with the order of the enforcement officer shall
begin as of the date the owner receives such notice.
2.   Hearing. Such notice shall also advise the owner that he or she may
request a hearing before the Council on the notice by filing a written request
for hearing within the time provided in the notice.
145.05   CONDUCT OF HEARING.
If requested, the Council shall conduct a hearing in accordance with the
following:
1.   Notice. The owner shall be served with written notice specifying the date,
time and place of hearing.

In case the owner fails, neglects, or refuses to comply with the notice to
repair, rehabilitate, or to demolish and remove the building or structure or
portion thereof, the Council may order the owner of the building prosecuted as
a violator of the provisions of this chapter and may order the enforcement
officer to proceed with the work specified in such notice. A statement of the

156.01   PURPOSE.
It is the purpose of this chapter to detail the requirements of a rental
housing inspection program, in order to:
1.   Protect, preserve, and promote the physical health and social wellbeing of
the people;
2.   Prevent and control the incidence of communicable diseases;
3.   Reduce environmental hazards to health;
4.   Regulate rental dwellings for the purpose of maintaining adequate
sanitation; and
5.   Protect the life, safety, and possessions of the people.
156.02   DEFINITIONS.
For the purpose of this chapter, certain terms and words are hereby defined:
1.   “Exempt rentals” means rental units that are inspected by a certified
third-party inspection organization. Such rentals will not require an
inspection from the City. The Code Enforcement Department of the City will
maintain a list of all rental units that are exempt from the inspection
requirements of this chapter.
2.   “Newly-constructed units” means any unit that has been newly-constructed
within the last year.

renting or leasing of rental units, which shall include the owners of such
property or their designated representative.
4.   “Owner’s representative” means a person who is appointed by a rental
property owner to act as the property manager. The owner’s representative
should be able to provide a City inspector access to the entire property for
inspections and be at least 18 years old.
5.   “Rental unit” means any building or portion thereof which is allowed to be
occupied by one or more persons as a dwelling space which includes one or more
of the following activities: sleeping, eating, or general habitation. As a
condition of occupying the space, the renter or renters exchange cash or other
valuable considerations for the right to occupy the space.
6.   “Tenant” or “renter” means a person or group occupying a rental unit.

156.03   ENFORCEMENT.
The Code Enforcement Department is responsible for the enforcement of this
chapter.
156.04   PERMIT REQUIRED.
Any person or entity wishing to engage in the renting of dwelling units within
the City limits shall first obtain a rental permit from the City. This permit
shall be deemed to be a public record and shall be made available to the public
upon request.
1.   No owner or landlord shall rent or lease any rental unit or any portion of
a rental unit to a tenant or renter until a valid rental permit has been issued
by the City for the rental unit being rented.
2.   It is the responsibility of the owner or landlord to ensure that the
rental unit has been inspected and granted a rental permit. Failure to obtain a
rental permit or renew a rental permit after a prior rental permit has expired
will result in a notice being sent to the property owner that the rental unit
is not in compliance and can no longer be rented to a tenant or renter until a
new permit is issued.
3.   Rental units that are found to be exempt rentals are required to be
registered as exempt rentals with the City.

registered before they are occupied. The final inspection of the building
permit process will serve as the first inspection of the rental inspection
program.
5.   Failure by an owner or landlord to obtain a rental permit for any rental
units within 90 days of adoption of this policy will result in the rental unit
being in violation of this chapter and the rental unit can no longer be rented
to a tenant or renter until a rental permit is obtained for said rental unit.
The owner or landlord may also be assessed fines or municipal ordinance
infraction penalties due to the failure to obtain a rental permit on a timely
basis.
6.   Rental permits will be valid for only one building. For properties that
have multiple buildings on site, a permit will be required for each building on
the property.
7.   A rental permit or the renewal of a rental permit may be denied or revoked
if the property owner has one or more rental units in which the property has
been cited for violations of this chapter or any other provisions of this Code
of Ordinances. Prior violations that have been corrected shall not be counted
as a prior violation for purposes of this section. If the rental property has
three or more violations within a 12-month period, the City shall, in its sole
and absolute discretion, deny or revoke the rental permit.
8.   An owner or landlord may appeal the denial or revocation of a rental
permit per the procedure set out in Section

adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the permit fee will be
discounted by 50 percent.
   B.   If the owner or landlord registers a rental unit within 90 days of
adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the permit fee will be
discounted by 25 percent.
2.   The owner or landlord shall pay an additional $50.00 late permit fee for
any rental unit which is not registered within the time frame set forth above.
156.06   EXPIRATION OF PERMIT.
Every rental permit issued by the Code Enforcement Department under the
provisions of this policy shall be valid for five years. Permits that are
revoked as herein provided shall be null and void at time of revocation. Owners
or landlords shall have 30 days from the date of expiration of the rental
permit term to renew the rental permit. If at the end of the 30-day renewal
period the permit has not been renewed, the rental dwelling is then no longer
considered an eligible rental. The owner or landlord can no longer rent said
rental to a tenant, and the owner or landlord must reapply for a rental permit
for said rental unit.
156.07   TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP.
If ownership of a rental property is transferred to a new owner or landlord,
the new owner or landlord shall apply for a new rental permit no later than 30
days following date of closing of purchase. No refunds will be given to the
original property owners for the previously paid rental permit. If the new
owner or landlord does not register the rental property within the first 30-
days of renting the property, the new owner or landlord shall not be able to
rent the rental property to a tenant or renter until a new rental permit is
obtained, and shall pay a late fee of $50.00 in addition to the registration

complaints of possible building code violations of a rental unit during the
five-year term. Inspections of a rental unit shall be subject to the following
terms and conditions:

4.   All fees are to be collected before inspection, at time of application.

rental unit subject to a violation finding be discontinued and vacated until
the violation is corrected. Notice to vacate or removal of tenants shall be

from date of receipt of the letter to complete the necessary repairs to remedy
the violation, or submit an appeal of the Code Enforcement Officer’s
determination of a violation per Section

amended, delegated the power to cities to exercise any power and perform any
function it deems appropriate to protect and preserve the rights, privileges,
and property of the City or of its residents, and to preserve and improve the
peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort, and convenience of its residents.
2.   Findings of Fact.
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation
which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community.
   B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by:
(i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Paragraph 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
   A.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
   B.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
   C.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
   D.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
1.   Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this ordinance shall
apply to all lands and development which have significant flood hazards. The
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Sioux County and Incorporated Areas, City
of Orange City, Panels 19167C0464D, 0468D, 0469D, 0627D, 0631D, 0632D, dated
August 2, 2022, which were prepared as part of the Sioux County Flood Insurance
Study, shall be used to identify such flood hazard areas and all areas shown
thereon to be within the boundaries of the base flood shall be considered as
having significant flood hazards. The Flood Insurance Study for Sioux County is
hereby adopted by reference and is made a part of this ordinance for the
purpose of administering floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 835 - Oct. 22 Supp.)
2.   Rules for Interpretation of Flood Hazard Boundaries. The boundaries of the
Special Flood Hazard areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the
official Flood Insurance Rate Map. When an interpretation is needed as to the
exact location of a boundary, the Code Enforcement Officer shall make the
necessary interpretation. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals
when it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the Code Enforcement Officer in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
3.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used, and no structure
shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered, without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
4.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
5.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
6.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated special flood hazard areas will be
free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on
the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
7.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.
160.04   ADMINISTRATION.

in writing, of the specific reasons therefor. The Administrator shall not issue
permits for variances except as directed by the Board of Adjustment.
   D.   Construction and Use to Be as Provided in Application and Plans.
Floodplain Development Permits based on approved plans and applications
authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in such
approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement, or construction.
Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that authorized shall be
deemed a violation of this chapter. The applicant shall be required to submit
certification by a professional engineer or land surveyor, as appropriate,
registered in the State of Iowa, that the finished fill, structure floor
elevations, floodproofing, or other flood protection measures were accomplished
in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to the use or
occupancy of any structure.
160.05   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT STANDARDS.
All development must be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and
meet the following applicable performance standards. Where base flood
elevations have not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to determine: (i) whether
the land involved is either wholly or partly within the floodway or floodway
fringe; and (ii) the base flood elevation. The applicant will be responsible
for providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical
information to make such determination. Review by the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources is not required for the proposed construction of new or
replacement bridges or culverts where: (i) the bridge or culvert is located on
a stream that drains less than two square miles; and (ii) the bridge or culvert
is not associated with a channel modification that constitutes a channel change
as specified in 567 IAC 71.2(2).
1.   All Development. All development within the special flood hazard areas
shall:
   A.   Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement.
   B.   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood damage.
   C.   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant to
flood damage.
   D.   Obtain all other necessary permits from federal, State, and local
governmental agencies including approval when required from the Iowa Department
of Natural Resources.
2.   Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the base flood elevations. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
base flood elevations and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed subject to favorable
consideration by the City Council, where existing topography, street grades, or
other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods used must
be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various forces
and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential structures located in
areas that would become isolated due to flooding of surrounding ground shall be
provided with a means of access that will be passable by wheeled vehicles
during the base flood. However, this criterion shall not apply where the
Administrator determines there is sufficient flood warning time for the
protection of life and property. When estimating flood warning time,
consideration shall be given to the criteria listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa
Administrative Code.
3.   Non-Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved non-
residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, or together
with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level.
When floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State
of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and
other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the
base flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
(Subsection 3 - Ord. 835 - Oct. 22 Supp.)
4.   All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
   A.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including basements)
that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
      (1)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than
one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
      (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade.
      (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access and
low damage potential storage.
   B.   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
   C.   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
electric meter, electrical service panel box, hot water heater, heating, air
conditioning, ventilation equipment (including ductwork), and other similar
machinery and equipment elevated (or in the case on non-residential structures,
optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood
elevation.
(Paragraph C - Ord. 835 - Oct. 22 Supp.)
   D.   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
plumbing, gas lines, water/gas meters and other similar service utilities
either elevated (or in the case of non-residential structures, optionally
floodproofed to) a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation or
designed to be watertight and withstand inundation to such a level.
(Paragraph D - Ord. 835 - Oct. 22 Supp.)
5.   Factory-Built Homes.
   A.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including those
placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be elevated
on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the structure is a
minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation.
   B.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including those
placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be anchored
to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may
include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground
anchors. Anchorage systems may include, but are not limited to, use of over-
the-top or frame ties to ground anchors as required by the State Building Code.
6.   Utility and Sanitary Systems.
   A.   On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located or
designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
   B.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system as well as
the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment facilities
(other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood protection
equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood elevation.
   C.   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water supply
treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a
level of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood
elevation.
   D.   Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
7.   Storage of Materials and Equipment. Storage of equipment and materials
that are flammable, explosive, or injurious to human, animal or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or:
(i) not subject to major flood damage and be anchored to prevent movement due
to flood waters; or (ii) readily removable from the area within the time
available after flood warning.
8.   Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as levees,
flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the base flood
with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for adequate
interior drainage. In addition, structural flood control works shall be
approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
9.   Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must be
designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations must be
approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
10.   Subdivisions. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and
subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the base flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50 lots
(whichever is less) shall include base flood elevation data for those areas
located within the Special Flood Hazard Area.
11.   Accessory Structures to Residential Uses. Detached garages, sheds, and
similar structures that are incidental to a residential use are exempt from the
base flood elevation requirements where the following criteria are satisfied.
   A.   The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage potential. Its
size shall not exceed 600 square feet in size. Those portions of the structure
located less than one foot above the BFE must be constructed of flood-resistant
materials.
   B.   The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage potential
purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure shall not
be used for human habitation.
   C.   The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building site so
as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
   D.   The structure shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation, collapse,
and lateral movement.
   E.   The structure’s service facilities such as electrical and heating
equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above the base
flood elevation.
   F.   The structure’s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of Subsection 4(A) of this section.
Exemption from the base flood elevation requirements for such a structure may
result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of the structure
and its contents.
12.   Recreational Vehicles.
   A.   Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of Subsection 5
of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built homes when
the following criteria are satisfied.
      (1)   The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less than
180 consecutive days; and
      (2)   The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
   B.   Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than 180
consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements of
Subsection 5 of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built
homes.
13.   Pipeline Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be buried
in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent
rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
14.   Maximum Damage Potential Development. All new or substantially improved
maximum damage potential development shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the elevation of the 500-
year flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be
floodproofed to such a level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional
engineer registered in the State of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing
methods used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities,
impact and uplift forces and other factors associated with the 0.2% annual
chance flood; and that the structure, below the 0.2% annual chance flood
elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water. A record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in
relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator. Where 0.2% chance flood
elevation data has not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The
applicant will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources
with sufficient technical information to make such determinations.
(Subsection 14 - Ord. 835 - Oct. 22 Supp.)
160.06   ESTABLISHMENT OF VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
1.   The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in specific cases such
variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances
granted must meet the following applicable standards.
   A.   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
   B.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
   C.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   D.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection
for structures than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the applicant
shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator that: (i)
the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage;
and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
   E.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
2.   Factors upon Which the Decision of the Board of Adjustment Shall Be Based.
In passing upon applications for variances, the Board of Adjustment shall
consider all relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
   A.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
   B.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or downstream
to the injury of others.
   C.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
   D.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
   E.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
City.
   F.   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
   G.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for
the proposed use.
   H.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
   I.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for the area.
   J.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles.
   K.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood water expected at the site.
   L.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
   M.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this chapter.
3.   Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such
conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
   A.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
   B.   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
   C.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
   D.   Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes, levees,
and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the Department of
Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative to achieving
the purpose of this chapter.
   E.   Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the flood
protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration, rate
of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated with
the regulatory flood. The Board of Adjustment shall require that the applicant
submit a plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that
the floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
160.07   NONCONFORMING USES.
1.   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before
the passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but which
is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be continued
subject to the following conditions:
   A.   If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any future use
of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
   B.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
2.   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means, including
flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50 percent of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless it is
reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary, building or safety codes or regulations or the
cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
designation.
160.08   PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
the requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this
chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction
thereof be fined not more than $500.00 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days.
Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful
action as is necessary to prevent or remedy violation.
160.09   AMENDMENTS.
The regulations and standards set forth in this chapter may from time to time
be amended, supplemented, changed, or repealed. No amendment, supplement,
change, or modification shall be undertaken without prior approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.

vehicular access from abutting public and private streets or roads to each
manufactured home site. Alignment and gradient shall be properly adopted to
topography. Access to manufactured home parks shall be designed to minimize
congestion and hazards at the entrance or exit and allow free movement of
traffic on adjacent streets. The entrance road connecting the park streets with
a public street or road shall have minimum road pavement width of 41 feet where
parking is permitted on both sides, or a minimum road pavement width of 31 feet
where parking is limited to one side. When primary entrance road is more than
100 feet long and does not provide access to abutting manufactured home lots
within such distance, the minimum road pavement width may be 24 feet; with
parking limited to one side, 31 feet; and with parking permitted on both sides,
41 feet.
   R.   Required standards for roadways, parking, and traffic shall be as
follows:
 
VEHICLE PARKING                TRAFFIC USE MINIMUM PAVEMENT WIDTH

shall terminate in an open space, preferably circular, and have a minimum
dimension of 100 feet. Except in unusual instances, no dead-end street or place
shall exceed 600 feet in length.
   T.   All streets of a manufactured home park providing ingress and egress
from an abutting public street or road shall have the location and design of
intersection with said public street or road approved by the City and by any
other governmental agency exercising control over such streets or roads.
   U.   All parks shall be furnished with lighting units spaced and equipped
with approved fixtures, placed at mounting heights that will provide the
following average maintained levels of illumination for safe movement of
pedestrians and vehicles at night:
      (1)   All parts of the park street system 0.6 foot-candle, with a minimum
of 2.5 foot-candle.
      (2)   Potentially hazardous locations, such as major street intersections
and steps or stepped ramps, individually illuminated with a minimum of 0.4
foot-candle.
   V.   All streets intended for general public use shall be dedicated as a
public right-of-way and subject to such improvements as may be required by the
City.
   W.   All streets intended primarily for use of park occupants, guests, and
services shall be owned and maintained by the manufactured home park owner.
Private streets shall be constructed with either hot mix asphaltic concrete or
Portland cement concrete to provide for drainage, and shall be constructed to
specifications approved by the City. Street surfaces shall be maintained free
of cracks, holes, and other hazards.
   X.   Grades of all streets shall be sufficient to insure adequate surface
drainage, and shall have prior approval of the City before commencing of
construction.
   Y.   Streets shall be at approximately right angles within 50 feet of an
intersection. A distance of at least 100 feet shall be maintained between
center line of off-set intersecting streets unless specifically approved by the
City. Intersections of more than two streets at one point shall be avoided.
   Z.   The limits of each manufactured home site shall be clearly marked on
the ground by permanent steel or iron rods driven into the ground with the top
of said rods flush with the finished lot grade. Location of lot limits on the
ground shall be approximately the same as shown on the approved plans. The
degree of accuracy obtainable by working with a scale on the plan and then a
tape on the ground is acceptable. Precise engineering of lot limits is not
required either on the plans or on the ground. This is not to be construed as
permitting lots of a lesser size than the required minimum or permitting lesser
yard or setback dimensions than set forth elsewhere in this chapter.
   AA.   No manufactured home shall be connected to water, sewer, or electrical
service unless the manufactured home complies with the standards and
requirements prescribed by “Standards for Mobile Homes, USAS A119.1, 1963” and
amendments thereto, published by the United States of America Standards
Institute as applicable, which said publication is hereby adopted and by
reference made a part of this chapter, a copy of which is and shall remain on
file in the office of the Zoning Officer. Compliance with these standards shall
be determined by the Zoning Officer. A certificate, if issued by the
manufacturer of the manufactured home, shall be permanently affixed on a
readily visible location on the exterior of the manufactured home as prima
facia evidence of such compliance.
   BB.   The maximum ground coverage of the manufactured home park shall be 70
percent with the remaining 30 percent reserved for landscaping.

   B.   Only one unrelated person living outside of the residence, and members
of the immediate family, may be employed in the home occupation, with the
exception of contracting businesses that are managed out of the home and work
conducted off the premises. Unrelated persons are allowed in this case.
   C.   In cases where a contracting business is managed in the home occupation
with work performed off-premises, there are no limitations on employees who
work at the off-site locations.
   D.   The use must be conducted as a secondary use and in such a manner as
not to give an outward appearance, nor manifest any characteristics, of a
business in the ordinary meaning of the term. The occupation must be conducted
entirely within the dwelling which is a bona fide residence of the
practitioners, or within an attached garage.
   E.   The use must not infringe upon the right of neighboring residents to
enjoy peaceful and healthy occupancy of their home for which purpose the
residential district was created and primarily intended.

dust, odor, heat, glare, fumes, electrical interference, or waste run-off
outside the dwelling unit or on the property surrounding the dwelling unit.

materials, and no other exterior indication of the home occupation or variation
from the residential character of the principal building.

two students at any one time. Dance lessons, when operated as a home
occupation, shall be limited to no more than four students at any one time.

occupations as home occupations: animal hospitals, animal breeding, clinics,
hospitals, contractor’s yards, salvage yards, restaurants, rental outlets,
vehicular repair shops, or massage parlors. Daycare for more than six children
shall not be allowed as a home occupation.

use of the property and meets the placement criteria for the zone.
   B.   Only accessory storage buildings defined in Subsection
165.24(1)(C) above shall be permitted as accessory storage containers on
property in any residential zone of the City, or on any property within the
City the primary use of which is residential. Cargo containers, railroad cars,
truck vans, converted mobile homes, travel trailers, recreational vehicles, bus
bodies, vehicles, and similar prefabricated items and structures originally
built for purposes other than the storage of goods and materials are not
permitted to be used as accessory storage building on property zoned
residential or on property the primary use of which is residential.
   C.   Notwithstanding the provisions set forth in Subsection 3(B) of this
section, the temporary placement of cargo containers on residentially-zoned
properties, or on properties the primary use of which are residential, for the
limited purpose of loading and unloading household contents shall be permitted
for a period of time not exceeding 90 days in any one calendar year without
approval for a limited extension from the City Code Enforcement Officer.
Original permit holder is allowed two placements of the container within the
90-day period when listed on the original permit. Denial of any extension from
the Code Enforcement Officer can be appealed to the Planning and Zoning
Commission for an extension.
   D.   Notwithstanding the provisions set forth in Subsection 3(B) of this
section, all contractors may use cargo containers for the temporary location of
an office, equipment, or materials storage structure during construction which
is taking place on the property where the cargo container is located, if the
use of the cargo container is authorized pursuant to a City zoning permit.
(Exception: With written approval from adjacent lot owner at the time of permit
application, container may be placed on adjacent property during construction.)
   E.   Cargo containers shall not occupy required off-street parking or City
rights-of-way.

cargo container. The application shall show the proposed cargo container is
accessory to the permitted use of the property and meets the placement criteria
for the zone. (Exception: Placement on lessors property within a zoning
district listed in the above Subsection 3(F) is permitted without permit.)
   H.   The use of a cargo container as an accessory storage container is
further limited to properties in the zones identified above in Subsection 3(F)
only if the property upon which the cargo container is proposed to be located
is not primarily for residential purposes.
   I.   Cargo containers shall not be stacked above the height of a single
container device, except for placement within the I-1 or I-2 Districts.
   J.   Cargo containers shall not be used for off-site advertising and shall
remain properly maintained. (Exception: Owner or rental company advertising
allowed.)
   K.   Cargo containers shall meet the setback requirements of the underlying
zone. (Exception: For temporary placement in setback on construction sites with
an approved building permit.)
   L.   Cargo containers shall be in an approved designated area and on the
same property as the principal use and be included in the calculation of
overall lot coverage. (Exception: With written approval from adjacent lot owner
at the time of building permit application, container may be placed on adjacent
property during construction.)
   M.   As a condition of placement, cargo container sites shall be required to
meet all zoning regulations listed in
Chapter 50 of this Code of Ordinances.
   N.   Materials stored within cargo containers are subject to review by the
Fire Chief. The Fire Chief shall conduct such investigation or inspection and
make such recommendations that he considers necessary as authorized by
Subsections
35.09(9) and
35.09(10) of this Code of Ordinances. Failure to timely eliminate any fire
hazards as recommended by the Fire Chief shall constitute a municipal
infraction.

1.   Computation of Spaces.
   A.   In the case of any building, structure, or premises, the use of which
is not specifically mentioned herein, the provisions for a use which is so
mentioned and to which said use is similar, shall apply, as determined by the
Zoning Administrative Officer.
   B.   Where fractional spaces occur, the parking spaces required shall be
construed to be the nearest whole number.
   C.   Whenever a building or use constructed or established after the
effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter is changed or enlarged
in floor area, number of employees, number of dwelling units, seating capacity,
or otherwise to create a need for an increase of 10 percent or more in the
number of existing parking spaces, such spaces shall be provided on the basis
of the enlargement or change. Whenever a building or use existing prior to the
effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter is enlarged to the
extent of 50 percent or more in floor area or in the area used, said building
or use shall then and thereafter comply with the parking requirements set forth
herein.
   D.   In the case of mixed or joint uses, the parking spaces required shall
equal the sum of the requirements of the various uses if computed separately.
2.   Location and Type of Parking Spaces. All parking spaces required herein
shall be located on the same lot as the building or use served, except that
where an increase in the number of spaces is required due to a change or
enlargement of use or where such spaces are provided collectively or used
jointly by two or more buildings or establishments, the required spaces may be
located and maintained no more than 300 feet from an institutional or other
non-residential building being served.
   A.   In any case where the required parking spaces are not located on the
same lot with the building or use served, or where such spaces are collectively
or jointly provided and used, a written agreement thereby assuring their
retention for such purposes shall be properly drawn and executed by the parties
concerned, approved as to form and execution, and shall be filed with the
application for a building permit.
   B.   Off-street parking spaces may be located within the required front yard
in any C-1, C-2 or I-1 district; however, no off-street parking shall be
permitted in the required front yard in any R-1, R-2, R-3, or RS-1 district
except upon a driveway providing access to a garage, carport, or parking area
for the dwelling.
   C.   All required off-street parking areas in any C-1, C-2, or I-1 district
of more than five spaces shall be surfaced with either asphalt, concrete, or
gravel so as to provide a durable surface. They shall be graded and drained to
dispose of all surface water accumulation within the lot, and shall be arranged
to provide for orderly and safe loading or unloading.
   D.   Any lighting used to illuminate any off-street parking areas shall be
arranged to reflect light away from adjacent lots and uses of land.
   E.   No part of any parking space shall be closer than five feet from any
street right-of- way. In case the parking lot adjoins an R-1, R-2, R-3, or RS-
1 district, is shall be at least five feet from the property line and shall be
effectively screened immediately by the use of a fence, hedge, other similar
methods, or by City approval.
3.   Off-Street Loading Spaces Required.
   A.   In any district, in connection with every building or part thereof
hereafter erected, having a gross floor area of 10,000 square feet or more,
which is to be occupied by manufacturing, storage, warehouse, goods display,
retail store, wholesale store, market, hotel, hospital, mortuary, laundry, dry
cleaning, or other uses similarly requiring the receipt or distribution by
vehicles of materials or merchandise, there shall be provided and maintained on
the same lot with such building, at least one off-street loading space plus one
additional loading space for each 20,000 square feet or fraction thereof.
   B.   Each loading space shall be no less than 10 feet in width and 25 feet
in length.
   C.   Such space may occupy all or any part of any required yard or open
space, except where adjoining a residential district. If the loading space is
adjacent to a residential district, it shall be set back at least 10 feet from
said district and be effectively screened from view.
4.   General Parking Area and Surface Requirements. All off-street parking
areas as required in this section shall comply with the following area and
surface requirements:
   A.   Owners of two or more uses or parcels of land may agree to jointly
utilize the same parking spaces provided that satisfactory legal evidence is
presented in the form of deeds, leases, or contract documents to establish such
a joint area of use.
   B.   Parking spaces shall be surfaced with Portland cement, concrete,
asphaltic concrete, or equivalent hard surface; or two-inch thickness pit run
one inch screened gravel.
   C.   Enclosed parking areas or garages shall qualify to meet the minimum
parking space requirements under this section.

165.28   NONCONFORMITIES.
It is the intent of this section to permit legal nonconforming lots,
structures, or uses to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage
their survival. It is recognized that there exists within the districts
established by this chapter and subsequent amendments, lots, structures, and
uses of land and structures which were lawful before the ordinance codified in
this chapter was passed or amended which would be prohibited, regulated, or
restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendments. Such uses are
declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the
districts involved. It is further the intent of this chapter that
nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used
as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district. A nonconforming uses of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or
a nonconforming use of a structure and land in combination shall not be
extended or enlarged after passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter by
attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen
from off the premises, or by addition of other uses of a nature which would not
be permitted generally in the district involved.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a
change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which
actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this chapter and upon which actual building construction has
been diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby defined to include
the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a
permanent manner; except that where demolition or removal of existing building
has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding such demolition or
removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, providing that work shall be
diligently carried on until completion of the building involved.
1.   Nonconforming Uses of Land. Where at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, lawful use of land exists
that is made no longer permissible under the terms of this chapter as enacted
or amended such use may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the following provisions:
   A.   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter with the
exception of areas zoned commercial where the nonconforming land use is of
residential nature, whereas expansion of accessory buildings will be allowed
following the residential districts site development regulations.
   B.   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

more than one year, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the
regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which such land is
located.
2.   Nonconforming Lot of Record. In any district in which single-unit
dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other
provisions of this chapter, a single-unit dwelling and customary accessory
buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter. Such lot must
be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots of the
same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet
the requirements for area or width or both that are generally applicable in the
district, provided that yard dimensions and other requirements not involving
area or width or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the
district in which such lot is located.
3.   Nonconforming Structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter that
could not be built under the terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on
area, lot coverage, height, yards or other characteristics of the structure or
its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   A.   No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases
its nonconformity. Such structures may be enlarged or altered in a way which
does not increase its nonconformity with the exception of areas zoned
commercial where the nonconforming land use is of residential nature, whereas
expansion of accessory buildings will be allowed following the residential
districts site development regulations.
   B.   Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more
than 50 percent of its replacement costs, exclusive of the foundation, it shall
be reconstructed only in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
   C.   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatsoever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
   D.   Discontinuance. In the event that a non-conforming building or
structure or premises is discontinued for a period of one year, the use of the
same shall conform thereafter to the uses permitted in the district in which it
is located.
   E.   Exception for Existing Single-Unit Residential Dwellings. Existing,
legally-established, non-conforming single-unit residential dwellings located
in non-single-unit residentially-zoned districts may make alterations and
construct additions to the dwelling (so long as they meet the R-1 District’s
setback regulations and no additional dwelling units are constructed or
created.). Construction of the dwelling shall start within six months of its
approved building permit and shall be completed within one year of the start of
construction. This exception does not apply to mobile homes.
4.   Nonconforming Uses of Structures and Land in Combination. Where a lawful
use of a structure, or of a structure and land in combination, exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this
chapter that would not be permitted in the district under the terms of this
chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   A.   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in
the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed,
reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the
structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located with the
exception of areas zoned commercial where the nonconforming land use is of
residential nature, whereas expansion of accessory buildings will be allowed
following the residential districts site development regulations.
   B.   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which was manifestly arranged or designed for such use, and which
existed at the time of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this
chapter, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such
building.
   C.   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district in which such structure is located, and the
nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
   D.   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structures and land in
combination, is discontinued or ceases to exist for a period of more than one
year, the structure, or structure and land in combination, shall not thereafter
be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it
is located.
   E.   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
   F.   A nonconforming lot of record which does not meet the required lot area
or lot width requirements may be developed for a single-unit dwelling so long
as the required yard setbacks are maintained.
5.   Repairs and Maintenance. On any building devoted in whole or in part to
any nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repairs or
replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing of the
building, provided that the cubic content of the building as it existed at the
time of passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall
not be increased. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof
declared to be unsafe by an official charged with protecting the public safety
upon orders of such official.
6.   Replacing Damaged Buildings. Any non-conforming building or structure
damaged more than 50 percent of its replacement value exclusive of the
foundation at the time of damage by fire, flood, explosion, war, riot, or Act
of God shall not be restored or reconstructed and used as before such
happening, but if less than 50 percent damage above the foundation, it may be
restored, reconstructed, or used as before provided it be started within one
year of such happening.
7.   Uses Under Exception Provisions Are Not Nonconforming Uses. Any use for
which a special exception is permitted, as provided in this chapter, shall not
be deemed a nonconforming use, but shall, without further action, be deemed a
conforming use in such district. Any expansion shall be with the Board of
Adjustment.

ownership, or management of any existing nonconforming uses of land, of
structures, or of structures and land in combination.

common open space either by private reservation or dedication to the public.
         e.   In the case of private reservation, the open area to be reserved
shall be protected against building development by conveying to the City as
part of the conditions for project approval an open space easement over such
open areas restricting the area against any future building or use except as is
consistent with that of providing landscaped open space for the aesthetic and
recreational benefit of the development. Buildings or uses for noncommercial,
recreational or cultural purposes compatible with the open space objective may
be permitted only where specifically authorized as part of the development plan
or subsequently, with the expressed approval of the Zoning Board of Adjustment
following approval of building, site and operational plans by the Planning
Commission. All easements subject to acceptance by the City Council. The care
and maintenance of such open space reservation shall be assured by

building, site and operational plans for the development, as approved, as well
as all other commitments and contractual agreements with the City offered or
required with regard to project value, character and other factors pertinent to
an assurance that the proposed development will be carried out basically as
presented in the official submittal plans, shall be recorded by the developer
within 90 days in the County Recorder’s Office. This shall include posting a
performance bond or certified check with City guaranteeing that required
improvements will be constructed according to the approved implementation
schedule. This shall be accomplished prior to the issuance of any building
permit.
         d.   Any subsequent change or addition to the plans or use shall first
be submitted for approval to the Zoning Board of Adjustment and Planning
Commission and if such change or addition constitutes a substantial alteration
of the original plan, the procedures in above shall be required.

Board of Adjustment is specifically authorized to pass on by the terms of this
chapter.
   C.   Variances: To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance
from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest
where, owing to the special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions
of this chapter would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance from the terms
of this chapter shall not be granted by the Board of Adjustments unless and
until:
      (1)   A written application for a variance is submitted demonstrating:
         a.   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not
applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district;
         b.   That literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this chapter;
         c.   That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from
the actions of the applicant.
         d.   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands,
structures, or buildings in the same district. No nonconforming use of
neighboring lands, structures or buildings in other districts shall be
considered grounds for the issuance of a variance.
      (2)   Notice of public hearing shall be given to immediately adjacent
property owners and to those required by law.
      (3)   The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person or
by agent or attorney.

of this section have been met by the applicant for a variance.

reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance and
that the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the
reasonable use of the land, building or structure.
      (6)   The Board of Adjustment shall further make a finding that the
granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of this chapter, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise
detrimental to the public welfare.
      (7)   The application for a variance shall be accompanied by a fee to be
determined by resolution of City Council.
   D.   In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter.

under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this
chapter and punishable under Section
165.31 of this chapter.
12.   Decisions Of the Board Of Adjustment. In exercising the above mentioned
powers, the Board of Adjustment may, so long as such action is in conformity
with the terms of this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may
modify, order requirements, decision, or determination as ought to be made and
to that end shall have powers of the Administrative Officer from whom the
appeal is taken. The concurring vote of three members of the Board shall be
necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the
Administrative Officer, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter
upon which it is required to pass under this chapter, or to affect any
variation in application of this chapter.
13.   Appeals From the Board Of Adjustment Any person or persons, or any board,
taxpayer, department, board or bureau of the community aggrieved by any
decision of the Board of Adjustment may seek review of such decision of the

proposed amendment to the ordinance codified in this chapter. A notice of such
public hearing shall be published not less than seven days prior to the date

property within 200 feet of the property for which the change is requested. In
no case shall the public hearing be held earlier than the next regularly
scheduled City Council meeting following the published notice. Such notice
shall include the time and place for the public hearing.
3.   In case the Planning and Zoning Commission does not approve the change, or
in a case of a protest filed with the City Council against a change in district
boundaries signed by the owners of 20 percent or more either of the area of the
lots included in such proposed change or of those immediately adjacent thereto
and within 200 feet of the boundaries thereof, such amendment shall not be
passed except by the favorable vote of three-fourths of all the members of the
City Council.
4.   Application For Change in Zoning District Boundaries.
   A.   Any person may submit to the Council, an application requesting a

shall be forwarded immediately to the Planning and Zoning Commission for study
and recommendation. The Commission shall, prior to making a recommendation,
determine the following:
      (1)   Whether or not the current district classification of the property
to be rezoned is valid.
      (2)   Whether there is a need for additional land zoned for the purpose
requested.
      (3)   Whether the proposed change is consistent with the current land use
plan, considering such factors as:
         a.   Whether the rezoning would result in a population density or
development which would in turn cause demand for services and utilities in
excess of the capacity planned for the area;
         b.   Whether the rezoning would result in the generating of traffic in
excess of the capacity of existing or planned streets in the vicinity.
         c.   Whether there is an intent on the part of the applicant to
develop the property to be rezoned diligently and within a reasonable time.
5.   The Commission shall report its determinations and recommendations to the

the Commission. The Council shall then hold a public hearing as provided in
Subsection 2 of this section.
165.34 MIXED USE OVERLAY ZONE
The intent of the Mixed Use Overlay Zone (MUO) is intended to allow greater
flexibility of development alternatives, especially attractive higher density
residential development and live-work buildings, in appropriate areas of the
City. More specifically, the intent of the Mixed Use Overlay Zone is to
accomplish the following objectives:
1.   To encourage mixed use projects that combine residential with
nonresidential uses in the same building or building site area as a means to
create an active street life and enhance the vitality of businesses;
2.   To provide a meaningful blend of residential and nonresidential uses that
enhances and builds upon the City’s commercial base;
3.   To provide additional housing options for people, including but not
limited to, young professionals and older people, who want to live near their
workplaces and/or near retail and other non-residential uses;
4.   To encourage consolidation of small parcels into viable, block-size mixed
use development in designated areas;
5.   To ensure on-site compatibility of residential and non-residential uses;
and
6.   To ensure compatibility of mixed use projects with surrounding uses and
development patterns.

in the underlying zone. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of
the Mixed Use Overlay Zone and the provisions of the underlying zone, the
provisions of the Mixed Use Overlay Zone shall prevail when a mixed use project
is being developed. If the Mixed Use Overlay Zone is silent in relation to any
development standard, the development standard identified in the underlying
zone shall prevail.
8.   Special Focus Area. With application of the Mixed Use Overlay Zone, the
City seeks to take advantage of development opportunities in key areas of the
City, each of which faces unique opportunities and constraints. A description
of the desired purpose of these areas is described in this section to provide
guidance for those seeking to construct mixed use development in such areas.

166.05   PROCEDURE.
The design and layout of all subdivisions shall conform with the requirements
of this chapter. The subdivider shall make improvements and shall submit
preliminary and final plats, all in accordance herewith.
1.   Consultation with Officials and Agencies. Before the subdivision plan is
prepared, the subdivider shall consult with:
   A.   The Planning and Zoning Commission to become thoroughly familiar with
all the subdivision requirements and with all applicable zoning regulations and
proposals of the Comprehensive Plan of the City;
   B.   The Planning and Zoning Commission and Public Works Director regarding
roads and drainage or other construction, and the availability of sanitary
sewers and water lines; and
   C.   The State Department of Health regarding all sanitation including wells
and septic tanks when water and sanitary sewer are not available.
2.   Pre-application Procedures. Previous to the filing of an application for
conditional approval of the preliminary plat, the subdivider shall submit to
the Planning and Zoning Commission plans and data as specified in Section
166.07. This step does not require formal application, fee, or filing of plat
with the Planning and Zoning Commission.
3.   Within 30 days, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall inform the
subdivider that the plans and data as submitted or as modified do or do not
meet the objectives of these regulations. When the Commission finds the plans
and data do not meet the objectives of these regulations it shall express its
reasons therefore.
4.   Preliminary Plan.
   A.   The subdivider shall first prepare and file with the Commission four
copies of a preliminary plan conforming to the requirements set forth in this
chapter. The Commission shall forthwith refer two copies to the Public Works
Director and Administrative Officer. Before any preliminary plats are
considered, annexation within the City limits must occur.
   B.   Hearing. A hearing on the proposal will be held before the Commission
at its first meeting following the filing. No hearing shall be held by the
Commission until notice thereof, which shall include the time and place, shall
be given to interested parties by the City Attorney in behalf of the Commission
by publication of notice of said hearing in a newspaper having general
circulation in the City for at least one insertion a week prior to the date of
said hearing and by mailing a notice to the person or persons who filed the
preliminary plans to the address set forth in the filing papers.
   C.   The Administrative Officer and Public Works Director shall carefully
examine said plan as to its compliance with the laws and regulations of the
City, the existing street system, and good engineering practices, and shall,
within 15 days, submit findings in duplicate to the Commission together with
one copy of the plan received.
   D.   The Commission shall, upon receiving the reports, as soon as possible,
but not more than 30 days thereafter, consider said report and pass upon the
plan. It shall then set forth its recommendations in writing, whether of
approval, modification, or disapproval. In the case of modification or
disapproval, it shall give its reasons therefore. The Commission shall
forthwith return one copy of the approved preliminary plan to the subdivider.
   E.   The approval of the preliminary plan by the Commission is revocable and
does not constitute final approval or acceptance of the subdivision by the City
Council or authorization to proceed on construction of improvements within the
subdivision but shall constitute approval of layout and general engineering
proposals and plans.
5.   Final Plat.
   A.   Upon approval of the preliminary plan by the Commission, the subdivider
may proceed with the preparation of the final plat and detailed construction
drawings and specifications for the improvements required under this
regulation.
   B.   Before submitting the final plat to the Commission for approval, the
subdivider shall furnish all plans and information as listed in Sections
166.08 (Final Plat) and
166.09 (Minimum Improvements Required) and obtain the approval of the
Administrative Officer and Public Works Director which shall be endorsed,
thereon.
   C.   For final plat approval, the subdivider shall submit to the Commission:
      (1)   Nine copies of the final plat.
      (2)   A performance bond in the amount approved by the Administrative
Officer.
      (3)   One copy of the certified approved plans, profiles, cross sections,
and specifications .
      (4)   A certificate from the Administrative Officer that the final plat
is substantially in accord with the preliminary plan as approved by the
Commission.
      (5)   Where any municipal improvement system is planned for larger
installations than what the subdivider needs for a particular subdivision, the
Administrative Officer and Public Works Director, shall submit estimates of
costs or also suggested negotiable financing arrangement to the Planning and
Zoning Commission, who shall in turn consider such negotiations and submit
their recommendations to the City Council.
   D.   When the final plat has been passed upon by the Commission, six copies
of the final plat and performance bond shall forthwith be transmitted to the
City Council, together with a certificate showing the action of the Commission.
   E.   When the final plat has been approved by the City Council, the
performance bond accepted, and all six copies duly certified, two copies shall
be delivered to the Commission; two copies to the Administrative Officer and
one to the City Clerk for their respective files, and one to the subdivider for
filing with the County Recorder. If said plat is disapproved by the City
Council, such disapproval shall point out, in writing, wherein said proposed
plat is objectionable.
6.   Recording.
   A.   The passage of the resolution accepting the plat shall constitute final
approval of the platting of the area shown on the final plat, but the owner
shall cause such plat to be recorded in the office of the County Recorder of
Sioux County, Iowa, and shall file satisfactory evidence of such recording in
the office of the City Clerk before the City shall recognize the plat as being
in full force and effect.
   B.   Upon receipt of the duly certified copies of the final plat by the
Commission, the Recording Secretary of the Commission will transmit copies of
the plat, as determined by the Administrative Officer, to the subdivider, City
Clerk, and Public Works Director or Administrative Officer.
7.   Final Approval in Effect.
   A.   Receipt of the duly certified final plat and submission of a
performance bond or certified check by the subdivider shall constitute the
final act to enforce approval and is authorization that he may proceed with the
installation and construction of the required improvements .
   B.   The City Council will return the performance bond to the subdivider
upon certification by the Administrative Officer, of satisfactory completion of
the installation and construction of the required improvements by the City
Council. Prior to certification, the subdivider shall file with the
Administrative Officer plans, profiles, and cross sections of the required
improvements as they have been built, which drawing shall be clearly noted with
the words “AS-BUILT.”
166.06   SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS.
1.   Streets. All new streets shall be of the hard-surface Portland concrete
type conforming to the standards and specifications approved by the Planning
and Zoning Commission, and shall further conform to the following regulations:
   A.   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all
streets shall conform to the Comprehensive Plan and shall be considered in
their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to
public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the
proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets.
   B.   Where such is now shown in the Comprehensive Plan, the arrangement of
streets in a subdivision shall either:
      (1)   Provide for the continuation of appropriate projection of existing
principal streets in surrounding areas, or
      (2)   Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the
Planning and Zoning Commission to meet a particular situation where
topographical or other conditions make continuance or conformance to existing
streets impracticable.
   C.   The width of such streets in new subdivisions shall be not less than
the minimum width established herein or as otherwise determined by the Planning
and Zoning Commission based on traffic engineering studies. The street and
alley arrangement shall not cause a hardship to adjacent property owners to
provide for access to adjacent property.
   D.   Where the parcel of land is subdivided into larger tracts than
ordinarily used for building lots, such parcel shall be divided so as to allow
for the opening and the ultimate extension of adjacent minor streets. Easements
providing for the future opening and extension of such streets or thoroughfares
may, at the discretion of the City Council, be made a requirement of the plat.
   E.   Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic
will be discouraged.
   F.   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial
street, the Planning and Zoning Commission may require marginal access street,
reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a non-access reservation
along the real property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other
treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties
and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
   G.   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or
limited access highway right-of-way, the Planning and Zoning Commission may
require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-
way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as
for park purposes in residential districts, or for commercial or industrial
purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances shall be determined with due
regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations.
   H.   Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except
where their control is definitely placed in the City under conditions approved
by the Planning and Zoning Commission .
   I.   Streets with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet shall be avoided.
   J.   A tangent of at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse
curves on arterial and collector streets.
   K.   When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point
by more than 10 degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius
adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than 100 feet for minor and
collector streets, and of such greater radii as the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall determine for special cases.
   L.   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at less than 10
degrees.
   M.   Property lines at street intersections shall be platted with a radius
of 10 feet or an acceptable chord length, or of a greater radius where the
Planning and Zoning Commission may deem it necessary.
   N.   Half-streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the
reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of these regulations, and where the Planning and Zoning Commission
finds it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when
the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever a half-street is adjacent to a
tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within
such tract.
   O.   Dead-end streets, designed to be so permanently, shall not be longer
than 500 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a cul-de-sac, having
a minimum outside roadway diameter of at least 80 feet, and a street property
line diameter of at least 125 feet.
   P.   No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with
the names of existing streets. Street names shall be subject to the approval of
the Planning and Zoning Commission.
2.   Street Grades. Street grades, wherever feasible, shall not exceed the
following, with due allowance for reasonable vertical curves:
 
STREET TYPE       PERCENT GRADE
Arterial or Major 5
Collector         7
Minor             10
Marginal Access   15
 
3.   Street Right-of-Way.
   A.   Street right-of-way widths for major streets will be shown on the Major
Streets Plan of the Comprehensive Plan or unless otherwise noted, shall be a
continuation of the adjoining existing arterial street.
   B.   Street right-of-way widths for minor street shall be 75 feet for
streets designed for on-street parking and a minimal 35 feet shall be dedicated
whenever subdivided property adjoins a half street as designated by the
Planning and Zoning Commission. The remainder of the street shall be dedicated.
No homes shall be constructed on half streets.
4.   Alleys. Vehicular alleys may not be provided in a residential block.
Service alleys may be provided in a residential block. Alleys are required in
the rear of all business lots unless other adequate provisions are made for
service and deliveries, and shall be at least 20 feet wide.
5.   Blocks. No block shall be longer than 1,200 feet. Where blocks are over
750 feet in length, a cross walk with a right-of-way of at least 10 feet in
width may be required near the center of the block.
6.   Lots.
   A.   The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will provide
satisfactory and desirable building sites, properly related to topography and
to the character of surrounding development.
   B.   However, no residential lot shall be less than 70 feet in width at the
building line, or less than 6,500 square feet in area.
   C.   In any subdivision where neither a public sewer nor a public water
supply is available, no lot shall have an area of less than 20,000 square feet
or a width of less than 125 feet measured at the building line. Where a public
water supply is available but individual sewage disposal devices are used, no
lot shall have an area of less than 12,000 square feet or a width of less than
100 feet.
   D.   Corner lots shall have extra width sufficient to permit the
establishment of front building lines on both adjoining streets.
   E.   In all lots so far as possible, the side lines shall be at right angles
to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines, except where a
variation of this rule will provide a better street and lot layout.
   F.   Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided, except
where their use will produce definite advantages in meeting special situations
in relation to topography, sound site planning, and proper land use.
7.   Public Sites and Open Spaces. Where an area being subdivided includes
lands, proposed to be used for parks or schools under the duly adopted
Comprehensive Plan of the City, the subdivider shall indicate the location of
such areas on the subdivision plat. Park sites within the City limits are to be
purchased within two years of the recording date of the subdivision by the City
at the appraised raw land value prior to subdivision plus one-half of the cost
of grading and paving, including curbs, of the portion of any streets that are
contiguous to the site. School sites are to be reserved for four years, giving
the public school system the right to purchase the land at the appraised raw
land value prior to subdivision, plus one-half the cost of grading and paving,
including curbs, of any streets contiguous to the site. Should the park or
school sites not be purchased within the time limit specified above, the
subdivider may then sell them for an alternate purpose as shown on the approved
subdivision plat.
8.   Character of Development. The Commission and City Council may require that
certain minimum regulations regarding type and character of development be
incorporated in the owner’ s declaration of plat. Such regulations shall be
intended to protect the character and development of the platted subdivision as
well as that of the surrounding development.
9.   Easements Along Streams and Watercourses. Wherever any stream or surface
watercourse is located in an area that is being subdivided, the subdivider
shall, at his own expense, make adequate provisions for the proper drainage of
surface water and shall also provide and dedicate to the City an easement along
said streams and watercourses, meeting the approval of the Commission.
10.   Easements for Public Utilities. Public rights-of-way dedicated for
alleys, parks, and service roads, may be used for public utilities. All
easements to be granted for utilities shall be constructed as either pedestrian
walkways, park-ways, plazas, open spaces, or playgrounds as may be deemed
appropriate by the Commission. All easements and rights-of-way for parks or
service roads or alleys shall be not less than eight feet and granted by each
adjoining owner. Larger dimensions may be required where it is necessary for
extension of main sewers or other utilities or where both water and sewer are
located in the same easement. No buildings or structures will be permitted on
any part of an easement without approval of the Commission and authorization of
the City Council.
11.   Buffer Zones Between Subdivisions. Where an area being subdivided borders
an existing subdivision and the proposed subdivision will have a different
zoning designation than the existing subdivision, a buffer zone between the two
districts may be required, especially where the existing subdivision is zoned
residential. The buffer zone shall be continuous in length along the boundary
of the proposed subdivision in the area where different adjoining designations
occur. The buffer zone shall be of adequate width to allow the placement of
fences, trees, landscaping, green spaces, etc. to provide an aesthetically
pleasing separation between the different districts. The area designated as the
buffer zone may contain required easements for utilities, etc., but the width
of the buffer zone shall be in addition to any required yard setbacks as set
forth in this chapter. Where a public street right-of-way separates the
proposed and existing subdivisions, such public street right-of-way may be
considered an adequate buffer zone.
166.07   PRELIMINARY PLAN.

      (1)   All streets and public ways shall be graded to their full width,
including side slopes, and to the appropriate grade as shown in the improvement
plans or approved by the consulting City Engineer or Administrative Officer.
Where the streets serve lots having an area of less than 20,000 square feet, it
shall be surfaced to a width of not less than 31 feet with a gravel base of not
less than three inches of a good grade of pit run gravel which meets the
approval of the Street Commissioner. All of such construction shall be in
accordance with standards and specifications of the consulting City Engineer.
Concrete curbs shall be installed along each side of the pavement.
      (2)   Where lots are 20,000 square feet or more in area, minimum

consulting City Engineer or the Administrative Officer. The width shall be as
shown on the Official Comprehensive Plan.
   D.   Water Supply. Where a public water main is reasonably accessible, the
subdivider shall continue with such water main and provide a water connection
for each lot in accordance with standards, procedure, and supervision of the
Municipal Water Department. Main sizes shall be determined by the Public Works
Director. Water main connection shall be done to the instruction of the Public
Works Director to fit into any looping or extension plan. A share of the total
cost of water main extensions may be borne by the City. The exact amount borne
shall be determined by negotiation with the subdivider with decision of the
City Council as final. Fire hydrants shall be installed as specified by the
Municipal Utilities, and their use will be regulated by all ordinances
pertaining thereto. In subdivisions more than 300 feet from an existing main,
pending availability of a public water supply, wells or a private water supply
system shall be constructed to insure that an adequate supply of potable water
will be available to each lot.
   E.   Sanitary Sewers.
      (1)   Where existing sanitary sewers are within 200 feet of an existing
municipal sanitary sewer, the subdivider shall install sanitary sewerage in
accordance with plans approved by the consulting City Engineer.
      (2)   In other cases, where lots are less than 20,000 square feet and
where plans for installation of sanitary sewers in the vicinity of the
subdivision have been prepared by the City or other agency, the subdivider may
be required to install sewers in conformity with such plans. In such cases,
until a connection can be made with the public sewer system, the use of a
primary sewage treatment plan will be permitted, provided such disposal
facilities are constructed in accordance with the requirement of the Iowa
Department of Health.
      (3)   In subdivisions where the lots are 20,000 square feet or more, a
minimum width of 100 feet, and are not served by a public supply of potable
water, the subdivider may install individual disposal devices for each lot at
the time improvements are erected thereon. If a lot is served by a public
supply of potable water, has an area of not less than 12,000 square feet and a
width of 80 feet or more, the subdivider also may install individual disposal
services. All such individual sewage disposal systems shall be constructed in
accordance with regulations and requirements of the Iowa Department of Health.
      (4)   The City will pay 50 percent of the sanitary sewer infrastructure
costs for these improvements in the subdivision. This reimbursement will be
reviewed with the costs of the project and with the need of the design for
sanitary sewer determined by the City and project engineer prior to the start
of the project. The City will issue a determination of assistance for this
portion of the project prior to the start of the project.
   F.   Storm Drainage. All necessary improvements, including storm sewers or
open drainage ditches, shall be made to provide for the adequate disposal of
storm water and to maintain any natural drainage course. All construction shall
be in accordance with plans approved by the consulting City Engineer or by
other officials having jurisdiction.
   G.   Monuments. Monuments shall be placed at block corners, point of curves,
change in direction along lot lines, and at each lot corner in accordance with
City specifications. Monuments shall be marked by three-fourths inch diameter
iron pins or one-half inch diameter rebar, at least 30 inches long.
166.10   VARIATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.

develop his property in a reasonable manner, but so that, at the same time, the
public welfare and interests of the City and surrounding areas are protected
and the general intent and spirit of these regulations preserved. Any
