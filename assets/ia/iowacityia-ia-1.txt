Ordinance No. 25-4965
Ordinance amending Title 14, Zoning Code and Title 15, Land Subdivision, to
update the Neighborhood Open Space Requirements (REZ25-0012)
Whereas, neighborhood open space is considered a vital part of Iowa City’s
community and often serves as a focal point of neighborhood activity; and
Whereas, attractive open space enhances and serves the immediate and future
needs of area residents in the same way as other capital improvements such as
streets, water mains, and sanitary and storm sewers serve residents of a
neighborhood; and
Whereas, it is the intent of the City of Iowa City, Iowa, to ensure that
adequate usable neighborhood open space, parks and recreation facilities are
provided in a manner consistent with the Parks Master Plan adopted on September
19, 2017 (Resolution No. 17-309), and that the method of assuring such open
space is calculated in a predictable and reasonable way as development occurs
in the City; and
Whereas, the City of Iowa City, Iowa has determined that new subdivisions
impact existing neighborhood open space, as well as a need for additional
neighborhood open space; and
Whereas, the provision of neighborhood open space through dedication and/or the
payment of fees to be used for land acquisition in lieu of dedication is a
reasonable and objective method for addressing and alleviating such impact, and
also promoting and protecting the public health, safety and welfare of the
residents of Iowa City; and
Whereas, the current neighborhood open space requirements, adopted in 1994
(Ordinance No. 94-3648), are based on maximum residential density, and
significant zoning code updates since that time have rendered this formula
unworkable in some cases; and
Whereas, the adoption of the Form-Based Code and Standards allows a wide range
of housing types, resulting in theoretical maximum densities that do not
reflect likely development patterns, and thereby distort the open space
calculation; and
Whereas, some zoning districts, such as those in the Riverfront Crossings
District and the Central Business District, do not have maximum density
standards, making the existing open space formula infeasible to implement; and
Whereas, the City seeks to adopt a new open space formula that is predictable
and functional across all zoning districts, regardless of density assumptions;
and
Whereas, the inclusion of a 10% cap on the neighborhood open space requirement
ensures that the amount of land or fee in-lieu contribution remains
proportional to the scale of the development, preventing disproportionately
high burdens on projects with smaller sites or higher densities; and
   Whereas, the Planning and Zoning Commission reviewed the zoning code
amendments set forth below at the July 16, 2025 meeting and recommended
approval.
   Now, therefore, be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Iowa City,
Iowa:
   Section I. Amendments. The Code of Ordinances of the City of Iowa City, Iowa
is hereby amended as follows:
A.   Amend 14-5K-1, Purpose, by deleting the strikethrough text and adding the
underlined text:
The neighborhood open space requirements ensure that adequate usable
neighborhood open space, parks and recreation facilities are provided in a
manner that is consistent with the neighborhood open space   parks master plan,
as amended, by using a calculable method to equitably apportion the costs of
acquiring and developing land for those purposes. The provisions of this
article require development, which creates increased needs for neighborhood
open space ("open space impact"), to pay a proportionate share of the city's
capital improvements to fulfill said open space impact. Usable neighborhood
open space includes pedestrian/bicycle trails, preferably located within
natural greenway systems, private open space that is publicly accessible,  and
neighborhood parks that serve nearby residents. Portions of larger community
parks may be adapted for neighborhood use, but this article is not intended to
fund the acquisition of community parks or large playing fields for organized
sports.  This article is also intended to encourage, wherever reasonably
feasible, the dedication of sensitive areas in conjunction with usable open
space. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
B.   Amend 14-5K-2, Applicability, by deleting the strikethrough text and
adding the underlined text:
As a condition of approval for preliminary plats containing residential uses  
residential subdivisions, and commercial subdivisions containing residential
uses, and planned developments , the applicant shall dedicate land, pay a fee
in lieu of land, or a combination thereof, for park, greenway, recreational and
open space purposes, as determined by the city and in accordance with the
provisions of this article. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
C.   Amend 14-5K-3, Dedication of Land, by deleting the strikethrough text and
adding the underlined text:
A.   Amount Of Land To Be Dedicated: The amount of land dedication shall be
determined by the following formula. This formula is deemed a reasonable
calculation of the additional need for neighborhood open space created by the
subject subdivision or planned development. 
A x 0.65DU x PDU x 3/1000, where
A = Acres of undeveloped property;
DU = Maximum dwelling units per undeveloped acre (43,560 divided by the minimum
lot area requirement for the highest density residential use allowed in the
subject base zone);
0.65 = This percentage figure reflects the average development density
occurring in Iowa City;
# of units x PDU x 3/1000, where
# of units = Number of new units is determined as noted in the Table 5K-1;
PDU = Persons per dwelling unit based on the most recent census; and
3/1,000 = The community standard of a Acres for of active neighborhood open
space required per 1,000 persons, as determined by the formulas set out in the
neighborhood open space plan, as amended.
Table 5K-1: Determining Unit Number
 
Zone                                    Unit Number Determined by
                                        Allowable units based on the following

                                        units per undeveloped acre (43,560
Multi-Family Residential and Commercial divided by the minimum lot area

                                        residential use allowed in the subject
                                        base zone) x 0.65
River Front Crossings and Eastside      Unit number to be provided by developer

                                        Plan
B. Dedication Cap: The maximum land dedication requirement is 10% of the total
acres of land being developed.
B. C. Nature Of Land To Be Dedicated: Except as otherwise required by the city,
all dedications of land shall meet the following criteria:
1.   Usability: At least ninety percent (90%) of the land required to be
dedicated shall be located outside of floodways, lakes or other water bodies,
areas with slopes greater than fifteen percent (15%), wetlands subject to
federal or state regulatory jurisdiction and other areas the city reasonably
deems unsuitable for neighborhood open space due to topography, flooding or
other appropriate considerations. Dry bottom storm water detention facilities
and dry creek areas may be credited toward reaching a portion of the required
land dedication when the city determines that such areas are suitable for use
as neighborhood open space. Pedestrian/bicycle trails and private open space
that is publicly accessible may be credited toward reaching the required land
dedication when the city determines that such areas are suitable for use as
neighborhood open space.  The city encourages the dedication of lakes, ponds,
creeks, other water bodies, wetlands falling under the jurisdiction of state or
federal agencies and other sensitive areas including woodland areas, both as
ten percent (10%) of and in addition to the dedicated land required by this
article, if sufficient abutting land is dedicated as a usable, public
recreation area or park.
2.   Unity: The dedicated land shall form a single parcel of land, except where
the city determines that two (2) or more parcels or greenways/trails would best
serve the public interest, given the type and distribution of neighborhood open
space needed to adequately serve the proposed development. If the city
determines that two (2) or more parcels would best serve the public interest,
the city may require that such parcels be connected by a dedicated strip of
land at least twenty feet (20') wide in order to provide access and continuity
between said parcels.
3.   Location: The dedicated land shall be located so as to reasonably serve
the recreation and open space needs of the residents of the subdivision or
planned development.
4.   Shape: If a sufficient amount of land is dedicated to accommodate
recreational facilities and activities, such as fields, courts or playground
equipment, the shape of the dedicated land shall be suitable for such
facilities and activities. Linear open space should be of sufficient width to
accommodate trails and adjacent greenways.
5.   Access:
a.   Greenways/Trails: Public access to greenways/trails shall be provided by a
public access easement at least twenty feet (20') in width. In addition,
greenways/trails shall be connected to existing or proposed greenways/trails on
adjacent property.
b.   Parks: Public access to the dedicated land to be used for parks shall be
provided either by adjoining public street frontage or by a dedicated public
access easement at least fifty feet (50') in width, which connects the
dedicated land to a public street or right of way. The grades adjacent to
existing and proposed streets shall permit reasonable access to the dedicated
land. The parcel shall be safely accessible to pedestrian traffic.
6.   Responsibility For Site Preparation:
a.   The city may require the subdivider or developer to grade and seed those
portions of the dedicated land to be improved prior to dedication of the
property and prior to the city's acceptance of the dedication.
b.   Where the dedicated land is located adjacent to a street, the subdivider
or developer shall remain responsible for the installation of utilities,
sidewalks and other improvements required along that street segment.
c.   Prior to dedication, the subdivider or developer shall be responsible for
restoring satisfactory ground cover and controlling erosion on land to be
dedicated that has been disrupted as a result of development activities by the
subdivider or developer.
D. C. Procedure For Dedication Of Land:
1.   The dedication of land shall be reviewed as part of the preliminary
subdivision plat or preliminary planned development plan, whichever is
applicable. The subdivider or developer shall designate the area or areas of
land to be dedicated pursuant to this article on the preliminary subdivision
plat or planned development plan. Where wetlands have been delineated on the
property, the preliminary subdivision plat or planned development plan shall
also identify the boundaries of such wetlands.
2.   Upon receipt of the preliminary subdivision plat, the director of planning
and community development (PCD) director of neighborhood & development services
(NDS) shall submit a copy to the director of parks and recreation director of
the department of parks and recreation for review by the parks and recreation
commission. The parks and recreation commission shall submit recommendations
concerning the land to be dedicated to the planning and zoning commission
within twenty-one (21) business days of the receipt of a complete application
for preliminary subdivision plat or preliminary planned development.
3.   Once the final subdivision plat or final planned development is approved,
and any public improvements required to be installed by the subdivider or
developer within the land to be dedicated have been installed, approved, and
accepted by the city, and the subdivider or developer has completed site
preparation pursuant to subsection B6 of this section, the subdivider or
developer shall provide a properly executed warranty deed conveying the
dedicated land to the city within two (2) years of final plat approval (or
final planned development approval) or by the time the city issues fifty
percent (50%) of the certificates of occupancy for the subdivision, at the
discretion of the city, or as otherwise specified in the subdivider's or
developer agreement.
4.   The city shall formally accept the dedication of land for open space,
parkland or greenways/trails by resolution. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)

any and all recommendations concerning the payment of fees in lieu of
dedication to the planning and zoning commission within twenty one (21)
business days of the date a complete application for preliminary subdivision
plat or planned development is submitted.
3.   The planning and zoning commission will consider the request for payment
of fees in lieu of land dedication during the subdivision or planned
development review process and forward its recommendations to the city council.
C.   Determination Of Fees In Lieu Of Dedication Criteria: The city may, at its
discretion, require the payment of fees in lieu of the subdivider dedicating
land, if the city finds that all or part of the land required for dedication is
not suitable for public recreation and open space purposes, or upon a finding
that the recreational needs of the proposed subdivision can be met by other
park, greenway, or recreational facilities planned or constructed by the city
within reasonable proximity to the subdivision. The city shall consider the
following factors in making its determination:
1.   Recreational and open space elements of the city comprehensive plan, as
amended, and the relation of the subdivision to the proposed open space and
recreational areas;
2.   Topographic and geologic conditions of the land available for dedication;
3.   Size, shape, location of and access to the land available for dedication;
4.   The character and recreational needs of the neighborhood where the

land that otherwise would have been required for dedication. The fair market
value of the undeveloped land shall be determined by a qualified real estate
appraiser  or by other means who is  acceptable to both the city and the
subdivider or developer. The city and subdivider/developer will equally share
the appraisal costs. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
E.   Amend 14-5K-5, Requiring Both Dedication of Land and Payment of Fee, by
deleting the strikethrough text and adding the underlined text:
The city may, at its discretion, require a subdivider or a developer of a
planned development to dedicate a portion of the land required under the
formula set forth in this article, and also to pay a fee in lieu of dedication
for the remaining portion of the land by said formula. The fee for the
remaining portion shall be determined by a qualified real estate appraiser or
by other means who is  acceptable to both the city and subdivider or developer.
The city and subdivider/developer will equally share the appraisal costs. (Ord.
05-4186, 12-15-2005)
F.   Amend 14-5K-6, Use of Funds, by deleting the strikethrough text and adding
the underlined text:

open space account designated by the name of the contributing development. All
payments will be used to acquire or develop open spaces, parks, recreation
facilities and greenways/trails that are located within the neighborhood open
space district containing the subject subdivision or planned development and
will benefit the residents of the subdivision or planned development for which
payment has been made.

B.   The city must use the payment in lieu of dedication within five (5) years
from the date received. This period will be automatically extended an
additional five (5) years if the subdivider/developer has not constructed at
least fifty percent (50%) of the units within the subdivision or planned
development for which payment in lieu of dedication has been made.
C.   If the city has not spent the funds by the last day of the five (5) year

action now pending under or by virtue of any general ordinance of the city
herein repealed, and the provisions of all general ordinances contained in this
code shall be deemed to be continuing provisions and not a new enactment of the
same provisions; nor shall this chapter be deemed as discontinuing, abating,
modifying or altering any penalty accrued or to accrue, or as affecting the

city under any ordinance or provision thereof in force at the time of the
adoption of this city code. (1978 Code §1-5; amd. 1994 Code)

hereby declares that it would have passed each section, subsection,
subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase thereof irrespective of the
fact that any one or more sections, subsections, subdivisions, paragraphs,
sentences, clauses or phrases be declared unconstitutional, invalid or
ineffective. (1994 Code)

commission from releasing such information concerning alleged or acknowledged
discriminatory practices to the state civil rights commission, the United
States civil rights commission, the federal equal employment opportunity
commission, and other agencies or organizations whose primary purpose is the
enforcement of civil rights legislation. This section does not prevent any

a bona fide occupational qualification. (Ord. 94-3647, 11-8-1994)

identity, marital status, national origin, race, religion, sex or sexual
orientation. (Ord. 95-3697, 11-7-1995)
   E.   It shall not be unlawful for a public accommodation to take any action
otherwise prohibited by this section where age is a bona fide factor or
qualification based on health, safety or developmental differences between age

      1.   It shall be unlawful for any creditor to refuse to offer credit,
life or health and accident insurance because of age, color, creed, disability,
gender identity, marital status, national origin, race, religion, sex or sexual
orientation. Refusal by a creditor to offer credit, life or health and accident
insurance based upon the age or physical disability of the consumer shall not
be an unfair or discriminatory practice if such denial is based solely upon
bona fide underwriting considerations not prohibited by title XIII, subtitle 1,
code of Iowa, as amended. (Ord. 95-3697, 11-7-1995)
      2.   The provisions of this section shall not be construed by negative

this section shall not include the University Of Iowa or any other educational
division of the state.
   C.   This section does not prohibit an educational institution from
maintaining separate toilet facilities, locker rooms or living facilities for

practice occurred within this city. (Ord. 15-4650, 12-15-2015)
   G.   A complaint or any part thereof may be withdrawn by the complainant at
any time prior to notice of a public hearing and thereafter at the discretion
of the commission. However, nothing herein shall preclude the human rights
coordinator from continuing the investigation and initiating a complaint on the
commission's behalf against the original respondent whenever it deems it in the
public interest. (Ord. 03-4105, 12-16-2003; amd. Ord. 15-4650, 12-15-2015)
2-4-2: INVESTIGATION OF COMPLAINTS; PREDETERMINATION SETTLEMENT:
   A.   Upon the filing of a verified complaint, the human rights coordinator
shall serve notice on the respondent. Notice shall include both a copy of the
complaint and a statement of the respondent’s procedural rights and obligations
under the law or ordinance. Service shall be effected by certified mail, email,
or personal service within twenty (20) days of filing for complaints in the
areas of employment, public accommodation, credit or education, and within
seven (7) days of filing for complaints alleging discrimination in the area of
housing.
   B.   The human rights coordinator may draft and mail to the parties written
questionnaire/document requests to which respondent and complainant are
required to respond. Answers and documents are to be received by the human
rights coordinator’s office within thirty (30) days of receipt of the
questionnaire/document request for complaints in the areas of employment,
public accommodation, credit and education, and within fifteen (15) days of
receipt of the questionnaire/document request for complaints in the area of
housing. The human rights coordinator may grant extensions of time to respond.
   C.   After reviewing materials responsive to the questionnaire/document
request, the human rights office shall determine whether the complaint warrants
further investigation. If the human rights office finds there is a reasonable
possibility of a probable cause determination or the legal issues present in
the complaint need further development, the human rights office shall promptly
resume the investigation of the complaint. A complaint determined by the human
rights office not to warrant further processing by the human rights office
shall be administratively closed. Notice of such closure shall be promptly
served upon the complainant and the respondent by certified mail, email, or
personal service. Service is effective upon mailing or emailing. Such notice
shall state the reasons for administrative closure.
   D.   A complainant may object to the administrative closure within ten (10)
days of service by filing a written request for review that states the basis
for the objection. If a complainant makes a timely written request for review
of the administrative closure, the human rights office shall promptly review
the complainant’s request and all relevant material. If, after review by the
human rights office, it is determined that the complaint does not warrant
further processing, the human rights office shall close the file and notify the
complainant and respondent of the final decision of administrative closure. If,
after review, the human rights office determines that there is a reasonable
possibility of a probable cause determination or the legal issues presented in
the complaint need further development, the allegations will be investigated
further.
   E.   A complaint may be administratively closed at any time if the
complainant cannot be contacted after diligent efforts or is uncooperative
causing unreasonable delay in the processing of a complaint.
   F.   Upon completion of the investigation, the human rights office shall
issue a written investigative summary and recommendation as to whether probable
cause exists that the person charged in the complaint has committed a
discriminatory practice.
   G.   Any time after a complaint is filed under this title, but before the
human rights office issues a probable cause determination, the human rights
office may seek a disposition of the complaint through a predetermination
settlement.
   H.   A complaint may be closed as satisfactorily adjusted when the
respondent has made an offer of settlement acceptable to the human rights
coordinator but not the complainant. Notice of intended closure shall state the
reasons for closure and be served by certified mail, email, or personal service
upon the complainant. The complainant shall be allowed thirty (30) days to
respond in writing to the human rights coordinator either stating the reasons
why the offer is unacceptable or accepting the offer. The human rights
coordinator will review and consider the response before making a closure
decision.
   I.   In all complaint areas except housing, the complainant or respondent
may request mediation of the complaint at any time during the complaint process
prior to the probable cause determination. Mediation shall not be undertaken
unless both the complainant and respondent agree to participate. Mediation may
be discontinued at the request of either party. If the complainant and
respondent do not reach a mediation agreement, the complaint process shall
continue to resolution as provided in this section.
      1.   A mediation agreement is an agreement between the respondent and
complainant. It is not subject to review or approval of the commission.
      2.   All verbal or written information relating to the subject matter of
a mediation agreement and transmitted between either the complainant or
respondent and a mediator to resolve a complaint filed under this chapter,
whether reflected in notes, memoranda, or other work product, is confidential
as provided in subsection
2-2-4B of this title.
   J.   In the area of housing, the commission shall, during the period
beginning with the filing of a complaint and ending with the finding that there
is or is not probable cause as defined in this chapter, to the extent feasible,
engage in mediation with respect to the complaint.
      1.   A mediation agreement is an agreement between a respondent and the
complainant and is subject to commission approval.
      2.   A mediation agreement may provide for binding arbitration or other
method of dispute resolution. Dispute resolution that results from a mediation
agreement may authorize appropriate relief, including monetary relief.
      3.   A mediation agreement shall be made public unless the complainant
and respondent agree otherwise, and the commission determines that disclosure
is not necessary to further the purposes of this chapter relating to unfair
practices or discrimination in housing or real estate.
      4.   The proceedings or results of mediation shall not be made public or
used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding under this chapter without the
written consent of the persons who are party to the mediation. (Ord. 94-3647,
11-8-1994; amd. Ord. 03-4105, 12-16-2003; Ord. 12-4484, 5-15-2012; Ord. 15-
4606, 1-20-2015; Ord. 15-4650, 12-15-2015; Ord. 21-4845, 1-19-2021)
2-4-3: PROCEEDINGS ON COMPLAINTS; PROBABLE CAUSE:
   A.   If the human rights office finds that probable cause exists regarding
the allegations of the complaint, the human rights office shall notify the
complainant and the respondent of the finding. The human rights office shall
promptly endeavor to eliminate the discriminatory or unfair practice by
conference, conciliation and persuasion.
   B.   If the human rights office finds that no probable cause exists, the
human rights office shall issue a written finding dismissing the complaint and
notifying the parties of the complainant’s right to appeal the finding. Notice
of the no probable cause determination shall be promptly mailed to the
complainant and to the respondent by certified mail or email. Service is
effective upon mailing or emailing. The no probable cause determination may
also be personally sesrved.
   C.   A complainant may object to the finding of no probable cause within ten
(10) days of service by filing a written request for review that states the
basis for the objection. If a complainant makes a timely written request for
review of the finding, the human rights office shall hear the complainant’s
evidence within thirty (30) days of the request for review. If no probable
cause is again the finding after further review by the human rights office, the
human rights office shall notify the complainant in writing of the decision,
and shall close the file. If the human rights office finds probable cause after
review, the human rights office shall proceed with efforts to eliminate the
discriminatory or unfair practice by conference, conciliation and persuasion.
   D.   In the area of housing, the commission shall determine based on the
facts whether probable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing or
real estate practice has occurred or is about to occur. The commission shall
make this determination not later than one hundred (100) days after a complaint
is filed unless any of the following applies:
      1.   It is impracticable to make the determination within that time
period.
      2.   The commission has approved a mediation agreement relating to the
complaint.
      3.   If it is impracticable to make the determination within the time
period provided by this subsection, the commission shall notify the complainant
and respondent in writing of the reasons for the delay.
      4.   The final administrative disposition of a complaint shall be made
within one year of the date of receipt of the complaint, unless it is
impracticable to do so. If final administrative disposition within one year is
impracticable, the human rights coordinator shall notify the complainant and
respondent in writing. (Ord. 94-3647, 11-8-1994; amd. Ord. 12-4484, 5-15-2012;
Ord. 15-4650, 12-15-2015; Ord. 21-4845, 1-19-2021)
2-4-4: ADDITIONAL PROCEEDINGS; HOUSING:
   A.   The commission may join a person not named in the complaint as an
additional or substitute respondent if, in the course of the investigation, the
commission determines that the person should be alleged to have committed a
discriminatory housing or real estate practice.
   B.   In addition to the information required in the notice, the commission
shall include in a notice to a respondent joined under this section an
explanation of the basis for the determination under this section that the
person is properly joined as a respondent. (Ord. 94-3647, 11-8-1994; amd. Ord.
15-4650, 12-15-2015)
   C.   If the commission concludes, following the filing of a complaint, that
prompt judicial action is necessary to carry out the purpose of this title
relating to unfair or discriminatory housing or real estate practices, the
commission may authorize a civil action for appropriate temporary or
preliminary relief pending final disposition of the complaint and the city
attorney and/or a designated agent shall promptly commence and maintain such
proceedings. (Ord. 97-3785, 5-20-1997; amd. Ord. 15-4650, 12-15-2015)
   D.   The commission shall prepare a final investigative report. A final
report under this section may be amended by the commission if additional
evidence is discovered.
   E.   After the completion of the commission's investigation, the commission
shall make available to the aggrieved person and the respondent information
derived from the investigation and the final investigative report relating to
that investigation.
   F.   If the commission determines that probable cause exists to believe that
a discriminatory housing or real estate practice has occurred or is about to
occur, the commission shall immediately issue a determination unless the
commission determines that the legality of a zoning or land use law or
ordinance is involved as provided in subsection H of this section. A
determination issued under this subsection must include all of the following:
      1.   A short and plain statement of the facts on which the commission has
found probable cause to believe that a discriminatory housing or real estate
practice has occurred or is about to occur.
      2.   The determination must be based upon the final investigative report.
      3.   The determination need not be limited to the facts or grounds
alleged in the complaint.
   G.   Not later than twenty (20) days after the commission issues a
determination, the commission shall send a copy of the determination with
information concerning the election under this title to all of the following
persons:
      1.   Each respondent. The respondent shall also receive a notice of the
opportunity for a hearing as provided under this title.
      2.   Each aggrieved person on whose behalf the complaint was filed.
   H.   If the commission determines that the matter involves the legality of a
state or local zoning or other land use ordinance, the commission shall not
issue determination and shall immediately refer the matter to the city attorney
for appropriate action.
   I.   If the commission determines that no probable cause exists to believe a
discriminatory housing or real estate practice has occurred or is about to
occur, the commission shall promptly dismiss the complaint. The commission
shall make public disclosure of each dismissal under this section.
   J.   The commission shall not issue a determination under this section
regarding an alleged discriminatory housing or real estate practice after the

discriminatory housing or real estate practice has occurred, the commission
may, after notice, provide for a hearing on the charges in the complaint. The
hearing shall be conducted in accordance with chapter 17A, code of Iowa, as
amended, for contested cases.
   L.   If the commission determines at a hearing under subsection K of this
section that a respondent has engaged or is about to engage in a discriminatory
housing or real estate practice, the commission may order the appropriate
relief, including actual damages, reasonable attorney fees, court costs and
other injunctive or equitable relief. To vindicate the public interest, the
commission may assess a civil penalty against the respondent. (Ord. 94-3647,
11-8-1994; amd. Ord. 15-4650, 12-15-2015)
2-4-5: CONCILIATION PROCEDURES:
   A.   Following a probable cause determination, the human rights coordinator
shall endeavor to eliminate the discriminatory or unfair practice by
conciliation, conference and persuasion, unless the coordinator determines
conciliation efforts are impracticable. If the conciliation process is
determined to be impracticable, the coordinator shall state in writing the
reason(s) for bypassing conciliation efforts. (Ord. 15-4650, 12-15-2015)
   B.   A conciliation agreement shall become effective after it has been
signed by the respondent, or authorized representative, the complainant, or
authorized representative and by the human rights coordinator on behalf of the
commission. Copies of the agreement shall be served on all parties. The
commission shall be informed of the agreement.
   C.   The terms of a conciliation agreement reached with the respondent may
require the respondent to refrain in the future from committing discriminatory
or unfair practices of the type stated in the agreement; to take remedial
action which, in the judgment of the human rights coordinator, will carry out
the purposes of this title; and to consent to the entry in an appropriate
district court of a consent decree embodying the terms of the conciliation
agreement. Violation of such a consent decree may be punished as contempt by
the court in which it is filed, upon a showing by the human rights coordinator
of the violation at any time within six (6) months of its occurrence. In all
cases in which a conciliation agreement is entered, the human rights
coordinator shall issue an order stating its terms and furnish a copy of the
order to the complainant, the respondent, and such other persons as the
coordinator deems proper. At any time, in the discretion of the human rights
coordinator, the coordinator may investigate whether the terms of the agreement
are being complied with by the respondent. Upon a finding that the terms of the
conciliation agreement are not being complied with by the respondent, the human
rights coordinator shall take appropriate action to assure compliance. (Ord.
03-4105, 12-16-2003; amd. Ord. 15-4650, 12-15-2015)

business in a form prescribed by the commission and inclusion of notices in

   H.   Payment to the complainant of damages caused by the discriminatory or
unfair practice which may include actual damages, emotional distress damages,
front pay, court costs and reasonable attorney fees. (Ord. 03-4105, 12-16-2003;

   I.   In addition to the remedies in the preceding provisions of this
section, the commission may issue an order requiring the respondent to cease
and desist from the discriminatory or unfair practice and to take such
affirmative action as in the judgment of the commission will carry out the
purposes of this chapter as follows:
      1.   In the case of a respondent operating by virtue of a license issued
by the state or a political subdivision or agency, if the commission, upon
notice to the respondent with an opportunity to be heard, determines that the
respondent has engaged in a discriminatory or unfair practice and that the
practice was authorized, requested, commanded, performed or knowingly or
recklessly tolerated by the board of directors of the respondent or by an
officer or executive agent acting within the scope of their employment, the
commission shall so certify to the licensing agency. Unless the practice is
reversed in the course of judicial review, the finding of discrimination is
binding on the licensing agency. If a certification is made pursuant to this
subsection, the licensing agency may initiate licensee disciplinary procedures.
      2.   In the case of a respondent who is found by the commission to have
engaged in a discriminatory or unfair practice in the course of performing
under a contract or subcontract with the state or political subdivision or
agency, if the practice was authorized, requested, commanded, performed or
knowingly or recklessly tolerated by the board or executive agent acting within
the scope of their employment, the commission shall so certify to the
contracting agency. Unless the commission's finding of a discriminatory or
unfair practice is reversed in the course of judicial review, the finding of
discrimination is binding on the contracting agency.
      3.   Upon receiving a certification made under this subsection, a
contracting agency may take appropriate action to terminate a contract or
portion thereof previously entered into with the respondent, either absolutely
or on condition that the respondent carry out a program of compliance with the
provisions of this title, and assist the state and all political subdivisions
and agencies thereof to refrain from entering into further contracts. (Ord. 94-
3647, 11-8-1994; amd. Ord. 15-4650, 12-15-2015)
   J.   The election of an affirmative order under subsections A through H of
this section shall not bar the election of affirmative remedies provided in
subsection I of this section. (Ord. 15-4650, 12-15-2015)
   K.   In connection with housing discrimination complaints only under this
title, the commission may, to vindicate the public interest, assess a civil
penalty against the respondent in an amount not to exceed those established by
code of Iowa chapter 216.15A as amended. Funds collected under this section
shall be paid to the city for deposit to the city treasury to the credit of the
general fund. (Ord. 97-3785, 5-20-1997; amd. Ord. 15-4650, 12-15-2015)
   L.   Any other relief that the administrative law judge finds to be
appropriate. (Ord. 03-4105, 12-16-2003; amd. Ord. 15-4650, 12-15-2015)

to be represented in all hearings or prehearing conferences related to their
case.

      1.   The administrative law judge shall rule on admissibility of evidence
and may, where appropriate, take official notice of facts in accordance with
all applicable requirements of law.
      2.   Stipulation of facts is encouraged.
      3.   Evidence in the proceeding shall be confined to the issues as to

12-16-2003; amd. Ord. 15-4650, 12-15-2015)
      4.   With the exception of hearings regarding housing, the rules of
evidence do not apply in a contested case hearing. Findings shall be based upon
the kind of evidence on which reasonably prudent persons are accustomed to rely

judge shall give effect to the rules of privilege recognized by law. (Ord. 15-
4650, 12-15-2015)
      5.   No evidence shall be received at any hearing concerning offers or
counter offers of adjustment during efforts to conciliate or settle an alleged

      6.   The burden of proof shall be by a preponderance of evidence.
   S.   Evidence Of Past Sexual Practices:
      1.   Discovery: In a contested case alleging conduct which constitutes
sexual harassment, a party seeking discovery of information concerning the
complainant's sexual conduct with persons other than the person who committed
the alleged act of sexual harassment must establish specific facts showing good
cause for discovery, and that the information sought is relevant to the subject
matter of the action, and reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.
      2.   Evidence: In a contested case against a respondent who is accused of
sexual harassment, or whose agent or employee is accused of sexual harassment,
evidence concerning the past sexual behavior of the alleged victim is not
admissible.
   T.   Cost Of Copies Of Record: Upon request by a party the commission shall
provide a copy of the whole or any portion of the record at cost. The cost of
preparing a copy of the record shall be paid by the requesting party.
   U.   Posthearing Briefs:
      1.   Submission Of Posthearing Briefs: The administrative law judge may
fix times for submission of posthearing briefs. Unless otherwise ordered, such
briefs shall be filed simultaneously by all parties and there shall be no page
limit nor any other formal requirements.

file a reply brief within ten (10) days after service of the brief to which the
reply is made.
   V.   Requests To Present Additional Evidence:
      1.   In General: A party may request the taking of additional evidence
only by establishing that the evidence is material, that good cause existed for
failure to present the evidence at the hearing, and that the party has not
waived the right to present the evidence.
      2.   Filing Request: If a request to present additional evidence is made
after the issuance of the proposed decision, then the request must be filed
with the appeal or, by a nonappealing party, within fourteen (14) days after
the service of the appeal. If the commission grants the motion to present
additional evidence, the commission shall remand the case to the administrative
law judge for the taking of the additional evidence and any appropriate
modification of the proposed order.
   W.   Proposed Decision: After a review of the transcript, the evidence, and
the briefs, the administrative law judge shall set forth, in writing, findings
of fact, conclusions of law, and a proposed decision and order. The proposed
decision becomes the final decision of the commission without further
proceedings unless there is an appeal to, or review on motion of, the
commission within thirty (30) days.
   X.   Review Of Proposed Decision On Appeal To Commission:
      1.   Appeal By Party: Any adversely affected party may appeal a proposed
decision to the commission within thirty (30) days after issuance of the
proposed decision.
      2.   Review: The commission may initiate review of a proposed decision on
its own motion at any time within thirty (30) days following the issuance of
such a decision.
      3.   Notice Of Appeal: An appeal of a proposed decision is initiated by
filing a timely notice of appeal with the commission. The notice of appeal must
be signed by the appealing party or a representative of that party and contain
a certificate of service. The notice shall specify:
         a.   The parties initiating the appeal;
         b.   The proposed decision or order appealed from;
         c.   The specific findings or conclusions to which exception is taken
and any other exceptions to the decision or order;
         d.   The relief sought; and
         e.   The grounds for relief.
      4.   Oral Argument: All parties or their attorneys shall be allowed ten
(10) minutes to present oral argument to the commission whenever the commission
reviews a proposed decision pursuant to this rule. The commission may, in its
discretion, allow oral argument to continue longer.

days of the notice of appeal or order for review, each appealing party may file
exceptions and briefs. Within ten (10) days thereafter, any party may file a
responsive brief. The commission may shorten or extend the briefing period as
appropriate.
   Y.   Scope Of Review By Commission:
      1.   Whenever the commission reviews a proposed decision, it has all the
power it would have in initially making the final decision. The commission may
adopt, modify, or reject the administrative law judge's proposed decision or it
may remand the case to the administrative law judge for the taking of
additional evidence and the making of any further proposed findings of fact,
conclusions of law, or decision that it deems necessary.
      2.   Whenever the commission reviews a proposed decision, it shall
consider only those issues actually presented to the administrative law judge
unless the issue was one which either:
         a.   Was raised prior to the proposed decision by a party, but not
ruled upon; or
         b.   Was discussed in the proposed decision, but not argued on brief
by the parties.
   Z.   Intervention:
      1.   Motion: A motion for leave to intervene in a contested case
proceeding shall state the grounds for the proposed intervention, the position
and interest of the proposed intervenor, and the possible impact of
intervention on the proceeding. A proposed answer or petition in intervention
shall be attached to the motion. Any party may file a response within fourteen
(14) days of service of the motion to intervene unless the time period is
extended or shortened by the administrative law judge.
      2.   Grounds For Intervention: The movant shall demonstrate that: a)
intervention would not unduly prolong the proceedings or otherwise prejudice
the rights of existing parties; b) the movant is likely to be aggrieved or
adversely affected by a final order in the proceeding; and c) the interests of
the movant are not adequately represented by existing parties.
      3.   Effect Of Intervention: A person granted leave to intervene is a
party to the proceeding. The order granting intervention may restrict the
issues that may be raised by the intervenor or otherwise condition the
intervenor's participation in the proceeding.
   AA.   Awards Of Attorney Fees:
      1.   In any final decision in which it is determined that the complainant
is entitled to an award of attorney fees, but the actual amount has not yet
been determined, there is, by operation of this provision, an express retention
of jurisdiction of the case by the commission in order to determine the actual
amount of attorney fees to which the party is entitled and to enter a
subsequent order awarding those fees, regardless of whether or not such
retention of jurisdiction is expressed in the final decision. In such case, the
decision is final in all other respects except the determination of the amount
of the attorney fees.
      2.   If the amount of attorney fees is not stipulated to by the parties,
the administrative law judge shall schedule a hearing on the issue of the
amount of the attorney fees. The administrative law judge's decision is a
proposed decision, and either party may appeal as provided in subsections V
through X of this section.
   BB.   Waiver, Modification Of Rules:
      1.   Upon notice to all parties, the administrative law judge may, with
respect to matters pending, modify or waive any rule herein upon a
determination that no party will be prejudiced and that the ends of justice
will be served.
      2.   Unless otherwise precluded by law, the parties in a contested case
proceeding may waive any provision of this chapter. However, the administrative
law judge, in the discretion of the presiding officer, may refuse to give
effect to such a waiver when the administrative law judge deems the waiver to
be inconsistent with the public interest.
   CC.   Application For Rehearing:
      1.   By Whom Filed: Any party to a contested case proceeding may file an
application for rehearing from a final order.
      2.   Content Of Application: The application for rehearing shall state on
whose behalf it is filed, the specific grounds for rehearing, and the relief
sought. In addition, the application shall state whether the applicant desires
reconsideration of all or part of the decision on the existing record and
whether the applicant requests an opportunity to submit additional evidence.
      3.   Time Of Filing: The application shall be filed with the commission
within twenty (20) days after the issuance of the final decision.
      4.   Notice To Other Parties: A copy of the application shall be timely
mailed by the applicant to all parties of record not joining therein.
      5.   Disposition: Any application for a rehearing shall be deemed denied
unless the commission grants the application within twenty (20) days after its
filing. The commission shall notify the parties in writing that the application
was denied.
   DD.   Assessment Of Costs Of Hearing:
      1.   General Rule: If the commission prevails in the hearing, the
respondent shall pay the "contested case costs" incurred by the commission. If
the respondent prevails in the hearing, the commission shall itself bear the
"contested case costs" incurred by the commission.
      2.   Mixed Results: Where the commission is successful as to part of the
remedies sought at the hearing and unsuccessful as to part of the remedies, the
administrative law judge may recommend an equitable apportionment of "contested
case costs" between the commission and the respondent.
      3.   Costs Allowable: The following "contested case costs" and no others
will be assessed or apportioned:
         a.   The daily charge of the court reporter for attending and
transcribing the hearing.
         b.   All mileage charges of the court reporter for traveling to and
from the hearing.
         c.   All travel time charges of the court reporter for traveling to
and from the hearing.

not limited to, lodging and transportation.
   EE.   Appeals To District Court: Appeals to the district courts from the
decision of the commission shall be perfected pursuant to the provisions of
Iowa Code chapter 17A. (Ord. 03-4105, 12-16-2003; amd. Ord. 15-4650, 12-15-
2015)
2-4-8: FINDINGS AND ORDER:
   A.   If upon taking into consideration all of the evidence at a hearing, the
commission determines that the respondent has engaged in a discriminatory or
unfair practice, the commission shall state its findings of fact and
conclusions of law and shall issue an order requiring the respondent to cease
and desist from the discriminatory or unfair practice and to take the necessary
remedial action as in the judgment of the commission shall carry out the
purposes of this title. A copy of the order shall be delivered to the
respondent and complainant and to any other public officers and persons as the
commission deems proper. A description of possible remedial actions appears in
section
2-4-6 of this chapter.
   B.   If upon taking into consideration all of the evidence at a hearing, the
commission finds that a respondent has not engaged in any such discriminatory
or unfair practice, the commission shall issue an order denying relief and
stating the findings of fact and conclusions of the commission, and shall cause
a copy of the order dismissing the complaint to be served by certified mail,
email, or personal service on the complainant and the respondent. (Ord. 94-
3647, 11-8-1994; amd. Ord. 15-4650, 12-15-2015; Ord. 21-4845, 1-19-2021)
2-4-9: JUDICIAL REVIEW; ENFORCEMENT:
   A.   The commission may obtain an order of court for the enforcement of
commission orders in a proceeding as provided in this section. Such an
enforcement proceeding shall be brought in the district court of the county
where the discriminatory practice occurred.
   B.   Such an enforcement proceeding shall be initiated by the filing of a
petition in the court and the service of a copy thereof upon the person
charged. The commission shall then file with the court a transcript of the
record of the hearing before it. The court has the power to grant such
temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper, and to make
and enter upon the pleadings, testimony and proceeding set forth in such
transcript an order enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or
setting aside the order of the commission, in whole or in part.
   C.   An objection that has not been urged before the commission shall not be
considered by the court in an enforcement proceeding, unless the failure or
neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary
circumstances.
   D.   Any party to the enforcement proceeding may move the court to remit the
case to the commission in the interest of justice for the purpose of adducing
additional specified and material evidence and seeking findings thereof,
providing such parties shall show reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce
such evidence before the commission.
   E.   In the enforcement proceeding the court shall determine its order on
the same basis as it would in a proceeding reviewing commission action under
section 17A.19, code of Iowa, as amended.
   F.   The commission's copy of the testimony shall be available to all
parties for examination at all reasonable times, without cost, and for the
purpose of judicial review of the commission's orders.
   G.   The commission may appear in court by the city attorney or a designee.
   H.   If no proceeding to obtain judicial review is instituted within thirty
(30) days from the service of an order of the commission issued pursuant to
this section, the commission may obtain an order of the court for the
enforcement of such order upon showing that the person charged is subject to
the jurisdiction of the commission and resides or transacts business within the
county in which the petition for enforcement is brought.
   I.   Judicial review of the actions of the commission may be sought in
accordance with the terms of the Iowa administrative procedure act, as amended.
Notwithstanding the terms of such act, petition for judicial review may be
filed in the district court in which an enforcement proceeding under
subsections A and B of this section may be brought. For purposes of the time
limit for filing a petition for judicial review under the Iowa administrative
procedure act, as amended, the issuance of a final decision of the commission
under this title occurs on the date notice of the decision is mailed by
certified mail to the parties. Notwithstanding the time limit provided in
section 17A.19, subsection 3 of the code of Iowa, as amended, a petition for
judicial review of no probable cause decisions and other final agency actions
which are not of general applicability must be filed within thirty (30) days of
the issuance of the final agency action. (Ord. 94-3647, 11-8-1994; amd. Ord.

as provided in subsection
2-4-1E of this chapter.

an action in the district court. A release under this subsection shall not be
issued if a finding of no probable cause has been made on the complaint, or a
conciliation agreement has been executed, or the commission has served notice
of hearing upon the respondent, or the complaint is closed as an administrative
closure and two (2) years have elapsed since the issuance date of the closure.

when the court finds that the complainant's action was frivolous.
   G.   Legislative Intent: It is the legislative intent of this section that
every complaint be at least preliminarily screened by the commission during the
first sixty (60) days. This subsection does not authorize administrative
closures if an investigation is warranted. (Ord. 94-3647, 11-8-1994; amd. Ord.

obtain appropriate relief with respect to the discriminatory housing or real
estate practice or breach of a conciliation agreement.
      1.   The two (2) year period does not include the time between the filing
of a housing or real estate practice discrimination complaint and the
disposition of that complaint by the city attorney.
      2.   An aggrieved person may file an action under this section whether or
not a discriminatory housing or real estate complaint has been filed under
sections
2-3-5 and/or
2-3-6 of this title, and without regard to the status of any discriminatory
housing or real estate complaint filed under those sections, but:
         a.   If the human rights coordinator obtains a conciliation agreement

have actual notice of the charge issued under this title.
   C.   If the commission issues an order with respect to a discriminatory
housing practice that occurred in the course of a business subject to a

of the following:

under this section.

CHAPTER 5
FAIR HOUSING
(Rep. by Ord. 15-4650, 12-15-2015)
CHAPTER 6
DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP
SECTION:
2-6-1: Purpose
2-6-2: Requirements And Eligibility
2-6-3: Statements Of Domestic Partnership; Registration
2-6-4: Termination
2-6-5: Records
2-6-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   The city recognizes that nationwide debate has advanced an expanded
concept of familial relationships beyond traditional marital and blood
relationships. This expanded concept recognizes the relationship of two (2)
nonmarried but committed adult partners. Recognizing this, the city hereby
adopts a process to provide persons to declare themselves as domestic partners,
thus enabling employers to voluntarily provide equal treatment in employment
benefits for such partners and their dependents.
   B.   This chapter establishes a mechanism for the public expression and
documentation of the commitment reflected by the domestic partnership whose
members cannot or choose not to marry.
   C.   It is appropriate and fair that certain of the societal privileges and
benefits now accorded to members of a marriage be extended to those who meet
the qualifications of a domestic partnership. The mechanism established by this
chapter will facilitate the definition of those entitled to such privileges.
(Ord. 94-3647, 11-8-1994)
2-6-2: REQUIREMENTS AND ELIGIBILITY:
A domestic partnership shall exist between two (2) adults if all of the
following are true:
   A.   The persons are not related by blood closer than permitted under the
marriage laws of the state.
   B.   Neither person is married.
   C.   The persons are competent to enter into a contract.
   D.   The persons declare that they are each other's sole domestic partner.
   E.   The persons declare that they are in a relationship of mutual support,
caring and commitment and are responsible for each other's welfare. For these
purposes, "mutual support" means that they contribute mutually to each other's
maintenance and support.
   F.   The persons file a statement of domestic partnership as set forth in
this chapter.
   G.   The persons agree to notify the city of the termination of their
domestic partnership, or a change in their employment or residence which would
render them ineligible to register as domestic partners under this chapter.
(Ord. 94-3647, 11-8-1994)
2-6-3: STATEMENTS OF DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP; REGISTRATION:
   A.   The city clerk shall accept an application to register as domestic
partners from persons who state in such application that they meet the
definition of "domestic partners" in this chapter. The city clerk shall provide
forms as necessary to interested individuals.
   B.   The city clerk shall only accept applications for registration of
domestic partnership from those persons:
      1.   In a partnership where at least one person resides in Iowa City; or
      2.   In a partnership in which at least one person is employed in Iowa
City.
   C.   The city clerk shall charge an application fee as set by resolution of
the city council for the registration of a domestic partnership. The payment of
this fee entitles the person filing a statement on behalf of the domestic
partnership to two (2) copies of the statement certified by the city clerk.
Additional certified copies may be purchased by the person. These copies of the
certified statement shall not be issued prior to the third working day after
the date of application.
   D.   The application and certified statement may be used as evidence of the
existence of a domestic partners relationship. (Ord. 94-3647, 11-8-1994)

required due to economic obsolescence and the reconstruction is necessary to
implement recognized industry standards for the manufacturing and processing of
specific products and the reconstruction is required for the owner of the
building or structure to continue to competitively manufacture or process those
products, which determination shall receive prior approval from the city
council upon the recommendation of the Iowa development commission or its
successor.
   NEW MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT: New machinery and equipment assessed as real

3-2-5: APPLICATION FOR PRIOR APPROVAL:
A person may submit a proposal to the city council to receive prior approval

eff. 6-1-2010)
   B.   However, the provisions of subsection A of this section shall not apply

hours.
      2.   The person under the legal age is accompanied by a parent, guardian,
spouse or domestic partner registered as such under section
2-6-3 of this code who is the legal age or older.
      3.   The licensee or permittee applies for and qualifies for an exception
certificate from the chief of police, or his or her designee, as follows: (Ord.
12-4462, 1-24-2012, eff. 5-1-2012)
         a.   Qualification: A licensee or permittee whose primary business
purpose is not the sale of alcoholic beverages, wine or beer may qualify for an
exception by filing with the city clerk a verified statement from an accountant
which establishes that on average over a calendar year more than fifty percent
(50%) of the licensee's or permittee's gross sales on the premises are from the
sale of goods or services other than alcoholic beverages, wine or beer. Income
from fees charged to gain entry to or remain on the premises, such as cover
charges, as well as drink mixes, or any part of an alcoholic beverage as
defined in chapter 123 of the state code are to be counted as alcohol sales.
Any purchases required to gain entry shall be considered cover charges. Ticket
sales for any event performed in a theater in which the entire audience area is
consistent with traditional theater seating shall be counted as nonalcohol
sales. The statement shall recite the actual percentage of nonalcohol sales, as
defined herein, and be based on records made in the regular course of the
licensee's or permittee's business. No certificate will be issued to the
establishment if any of the following is true:
            (1)   Applicant possesses a trailing twelve (12) month possession
of alcohol under the legal age (PAULA) ratio over the allowable limit, as
defined and set by city council by resolution.
            (2)   Where operation under the exception certificate would be
detrimental to the safety, health, and welfare of the residents of the city.
Where a preponderance of the evidence shows that the licensee, permittee, or
any employees or agents thereof, sold, gave, or delivered alcohol to any patron
under the legal drinking age more than once within the last two (2) years, the
licensee or permittee shall serve the suspension called for under subsection
B3g of this section before being eligible for issuance of the exception
certificate. Said suspension will commence on the day the chief of police would
otherwise have approved the application. Assuming the applicant remains
eligible at that time, the chief of police shall issue the exception
certificate following completion of the suspension. (Ord. 16-4679, 10-4-2016)
         b.   Proof Of Qualification; Audit: In addition to the aforementioned
statement, proof of qualification for the exception may include the business
records on which the statement is based, profit and loss statements, state and
federal tax records, applications for dramshop insurance and audits performed
to determine dramshop insurance premiums, and receipts from vendors for goods
purchased, which records shall be made available to the chief of police or
designee for review upon request. The chief of police or designee may require
an audit of the establishment by an auditor selected by the chief of police or
designee, which audit will be performed at the expense of the applicant. In
that event, the applicant must submit a deposit to the city in an amount set by
city council via resolution for the payment of the audit. At the conclusion of
the audit, any additional costs over the deposit amount must be paid by the
applicant before an application will be considered further. Any surplus funds
from the deposit will be promptly returned to the applicant. Failure to submit
the deposit or pay costs of the audit will result in a denial of the
application. The factors the chief of police or designee will consider in
determining whether to require an audit will be established by resolution of
the city council, but the final decision to require an audit will be that of
the chief of police or designee.
         c.   Issuance: If the chief of police or designee determines that the
licensee has satisfied the above requirements an exception certificate shall be
issued.
         d.   Duration: An exception certificate shall be effective for the
duration of the alcoholic liquor control license, wine or beer permit.
         e.   Temporary Certificate: A new licensee or permittee, as opposed to
one applying for a renewal of an existing license or permit, whose primary
business purpose is not the sale of alcoholic beverages, wine or beer may
obtain a temporary six (6) month exception certificate if the licensee's or
permittee's business plan anticipates sales as required by subsection B3a of
this section and the licensee or permittee submits an affidavit which details
the nature of the new establishment and the anticipated percentage of sales of
food and nonalcoholic beverages. At the end of the six (6) month period the
licensee or permittee may obtain an exception certificate for the remainder of
the duration of the license or permit in accordance with subsections B3a
through B3c of this section if sales during the six (6) month period support an
exception, and the licensee or permittee has met the PAULA ratio requirement
referenced in subsection B3a of this section. No more than one temporary
exception certificate may be granted for any location within a three (3) year
period. Applicants who sign an affidavit pursuant to this subsection but fail
to secure renewal of the exception certificate following the six (6) month
certificate for the subject location may not be awarded an exception
certificate for any other new location within three (3) years of the granting
of the subject six (6) month certificate.
         f.   Posting Required: To be effective in excepting the licensee or
permittee from the prohibition in subsection A of this section, the exception
certificate issued by the chief of police or designee must be posted at every
entrance to the licensed or permitted establishment in view of patrons of the
licensed or permitted establishments. In addition, the licensee or permittee
must provide staff of sufficient number and capability to monitor all patrons
to prevent underage possession of alcohol. (Ord. 12-4462, 1-24-2012, eff. 5-1-
2012)
         g.   Revocation: Exception certificates may be revoked by the chief of
police, or designee, for good cause. Licensees or permittees may appeal a
revocation to the city manager or designee by filing a written notice of appeal
with the city clerk within ten (10) days of the mailing, by first class mail,
of the revocation decision. Appeals will ordinarily be heard no later than
fourteen (14) days, and in no event later than thirty (30) days, following the
filing of an appeal in the office of the city clerk. In the event of a
revocation, the licensee may continue to operate with their exception
certificate until the ten (10) day appeal period has passed, or in the event of
an appeal to the city manager or designee, until after the city manager or
designee has issued his or her ruling on appeal. In the event the city manager
or designee affirms the revocation, the establishment's exception certificate
will expire seven (7) days from the mailing, by first class mail, of the appeal
decision. Good cause for revocation includes, but is not limited to, the
following:
            (1)   Where a preponderance of the evidence shows that the
licensee, permittee, or any employees or agents thereof, sold, gave, or
delivered alcohol to any patron under the legal drinking age more than once
within the last two (2) years; or
            (2)   Where at the end of any month the venue's trailing twelve
(12) month PAULA ratio, as determined solely by the chief of police, rises
above the maximum allowed PAULA ratio, as established by city council by
resolution; or
            (3)   Where the establishment has failed to cooperate fully with
the police department; or
            (4)   Where continued operation under the exception certificate
would be detrimental to the safety, health, and welfare of the residents of the
city.
Revocations for violations of subsection B3g(1) of this section shall last for
thirty (30) days for the second violation within the last two (2) years, and
for ninety (90) days for the third and subsequent violations within the last
two (2) years. All other revocations shall last twelve (12) months. Following
the period of revocation, the applicant may reapply for an exception
certificate. (Ord. 16-4679, 10-4-2016)
      4.   The person under the legal age is on the premises during a time that
the licensee or permittee has, in accordance with a written notice and plan
given in advance to and approved by the chief of police or designee, suspended
dispensing alcoholic beverages on the licensed premises. Said plan must provide
a method by which alcoholic beverages will be out of sight and reach of
patrons. If the plan is approved, the chief of police or designee shall issue a
certificate approving the event, which certificate shall be posted at every
entrance to the licensed establishment in view of patrons of the licensed or
permitted establishment. It shall be the strict duty of a licensee or permittee
permitting such persons under the legal age onto the licensed premises pursuant

requiring immediate action to prevent serious illness, bodily injury or loss of
life.
   KNOWINGLY: Knowledge which a responsible adult should reasonably be expected
to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that responsible adult's
custody. This is an objective standard. It shall, therefore, be no defense that

purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is considered to be a
public place when in the areas defined above.
   RESPONSIBLE ADULT: A parent, guardian or other adult specifically authorized
by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have custody or control of a
minor.
   UNEMANCIPATED: Unmarried and/or still under the custody or control of a

shall be enforced as follows:
      1.   Unless accompanied by a responsible adult, no minor thirteen (13)
years of age or younger shall be in any public place between the hours of ten
o'clock (10:00) P.M. and five o'clock (5:00) A.M.
      2.   Unless accompanied by a responsible adult, no minor fourteen (14)

years of age through seventeen (17) years of age shall be in any public place
between the hours of twelve o'clock (12:00) midnight to five o'clock (5:00)
A.M.

following:

which the minor is permitted by law to be engaged or, if traveling, within one
hour before or one hour after the work shift;

public place.
   D.   Parental Responsibility: It shall be unlawful for a parent or guardian
having legal custody of a minor knowingly to permit or by ineffective control
to allow the minor to be in violation of this section. This requirement is
intended to hold a neglectful or careless parent or guardian up to a reasonable
community standard of parental responsibility through an objective test. It
shall, therefore, be no defense that a parent or guardian was completely
indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such minor.
   E.   Enforcement Procedures:
      1.   Determination Of Age: In determining the age of the juvenile and in
the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driver's
license, a peace officer on the street shall, in the first instance, use his or
her best judgment in determining age.

taking a minor into custody for a curfew violation are that the person refuses
to sign the citation without qualification; persists in violating this section;
refuses to provide proper identification or to identify himself or herself; or
constitutes an immediate threat to the person's own safety or to the safety of
the public. A law enforcement officer who takes a minor into custody for a
curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in a shelter care
facility or in any nonsecured setting. The officer shall not place bodily
restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor physically resists
or threatens physical violence when being taken into, or while in, custody, or
presents a risk of injury to the minor or others. A minor shall not be placed
in detention for a curfew violation.
      3.   Notification Of Responsible Adult: After a minor is taken into
custody, the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the
minor as soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible
for the minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at
such time as the court may direct.
      4.   Minor Without Adult Supervision: If a peace officer determines that
a minor does not have adult supervision because the peace officer cannot locate
the minor's parent, guardian or other person legally responsible for the care
of the minor, within a reasonable time, the peace officer shall attempt to
place the minor with an adult relative of the minor, an adult person who cares
for the child or another adult person who is known to the child. In the event
no such person can be promptly located, the peace officer shall place the minor
in shelter care as specified in Iowa Code sections 232.20 and 232.21.
   F.   Violation: A violation of this section shall be a simple misdemeanor
punishable by a fine not in excess of fifty dollars ($50.00).
   G.   Annual City Council Review: The city council shall be provided with and
review enforcement data, including demographic, frequency and location data,
associated with all citations issued under this section on an annual basis.

encouraged to intervene at the time the biased policing or racial profiling
incident occurs and, in any event, shall report such biased policing or racial
profiling to a supervisor as soon as practicable under the circumstances. Where
unreasonable use of force occurs, officers have a duty to immediately
physically intervene, when in a position to do so, to prevent the use of
unreasonable force.

jurisdiction to investigate or adjudicate alleged violations of this chapter,
the commission staff shall educate the public about the complaint process and
shall assist individuals in filing a biased policing or racial profiling
complaint with the Iowa Civil Rights Commission (ICRC). The ICRC has
jurisdiction over racial profiling complaints against law enforcement as such
complaints allege discrimination in public accommodations by a local government
unit that offers services to the public based on the individual demographics
prohibited by the Iowa Civil Rights Act. Iowa Code Sec. 216.7; see also, Iowa
Code Sec. 216.2(13) as now adopted or hereinafter amended. The remedies
afforded by the Iowa Civil Rights Act are not exclusive and do not foreclose a

and guidance in regard to unbiased policing and prohibited racial profiling
while conducting law enforcement activities and police services, which training
shall include de-escalation, cultural diversity, cultural competency, and
implicit bias and may include, but is not limited to: training on subjects
related to police ethics, police interactions with members of the public,
active by-stander intervention, standards of conduct, conducting motor vehicle
stops, and related topics suitable for preventing incidents of biased policing
and racial profiling. (Ord. 20-4841, 12-15-2020)
8-9-7: PENALTY:
Racial profiling and biased policing are violations of this Chapter. Any
penalty for violation of this Chapter related to any employee not acting in
conformity therewith shall be limited to that provided under state or federal
law, which violation may include serving as cause for discipline up to and
including termination from employment as consistent with federal and state law
requirements including Iowa Code Chapters 400, 80F and 20 as applicable. The
limitation related to violations of this Chapter related to employee violations
is not intended to expand or limit any other remedy or cause of action
available under state or federal law, nor to expand or restrict the time for
seeking such remedy or cause of action and shall not be construed as doing so,
nor as conferring jurisdiction on the Iowa City Human Rights Commission but,
pursuant to Section
8-9-4 hereof, Commission staff shall assist individuals who desire to file any
complaint with the Iowa Civil Rights Commission for investigation and
resolution. The declaration of the prohibitions set forth in this Chapter shall
not create any new or separate legal rights or claims by or on behalf of any

All traffic control devices shall conform to the manual and specifications
approved by the Iowa department of transportation or its successor. All devices
required hereunder for a particular purpose shall, so far as practicable, be
uniform as to type and location throughout the city. All traffic control
devices so erected and not inconsistent with the provisions of state law or
this title shall be official traffic control devices. (1994 Code)
9-2-2: TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL LEGEND:
Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting different
colored lights or colored lighted arrows, whether successively one at a time or
in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except for
special pedestrian signals as defined in section
9-6-3 of this title. Such colored lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of
vehicles and, where no other pedestrian signals are present, to pedestrians as
follows: (Ord. 07-4266, 6-19-2007)
   A.   Green Indication:
      1.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular steady green illuminated signal
may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place
prohibits such turn. Vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles and pedestrians lawfully
within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is
displayed.
      2.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady green illuminated arrow signal,
shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow or such other
movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within
an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      3.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a
turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked
crosswalk.
   B.   Circular Yellow Or Yellow Arrow: When shown following the steady green
signal or green arrow, vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before
entering the nearest crosswalk at the intersection, but if such stop cannot be
made in safety, a vehicle may be driven cautiously through the intersection.
Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is insufficient
time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to cross shall
yield the right of way to all vehicles.
   C.   Circular Red:
      1.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop at a
clearly marked stop line, but if no stop line is present, said vehicle traffic
shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection
or if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing
until an indication to proceed is shown. A right turn shall be permitted at an
intersection by vehicular traffic which has come to a complete stop unless a
sign is in place prohibiting such a turn. Any right turn made pursuant to this
subsection shall be made in such a manner that it does not interfere with other
vehicular or pedestrian traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      2.   Vehicular traffic on a one-way highway facing a steady red circular
signal may, after making a stop pursuant to this subsection, cautiously enter
the intersection and make a left turn onto an intersecting one-way highway on
which traffic travels to the left unless a sign is in place prohibiting such
turn. Any left turn made pursuant to this subsection shall be made in such a
manner that it does not interfere with other vehicular or pedestrian traffic
lawfully using the intersection.
      3.   No pedestrian facing a steady red circular signal shall enter the
roadway unless the pedestrian can do so safely and without interfering with any
vehicular traffic, but a vehicle turning right at such intersection shall yield
the right of way to a pedestrian lawfully entering such intersection.
   D.   Red With Green Arrow: Vehicular traffic facing a steady red circular
with green arrow signal may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the
movement indicated by such arrow, but shall not interfere with other traffic or
endanger pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk. No pedestrian facing such
signal shall enter the roadway unless the pedestrian can do so safely and
without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   E.   Flashing Signals: Whenever flashing red or yellow signals are used,
they shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
      1.   Flashing Red (Stop Signal): When a red lens is illuminated by
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, and the
right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      2.   Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal): When a yellow lens is illuminated
with intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signals only with caution. (1978 Code §23-34; amd.
1994 Code)
9-2-3: OBEDIENCE REQUIRED:
It shall be unlawful for the driver of any vehicle to disobey the instructions
of any official traffic sign or signal placed in accordance with the provisions
of this title unless otherwise directed by a peace officer. (1978 Code §23-29)
9-2-4: PRESUMPTION OF LEGALITY:
Any official traffic control device placed pursuant to the provisions of this
title and purporting to conform to the lawful requirements pertaining to such
devices shall be presumed to comply with the requirements of this title unless
the contrary shall be established by competent evidence. (1978 Code §23-33;
amd. 1994 Code)
9-2-5: UNAUTHORIZED SIGNS, SIGNALS OR MARKINGS:
No person shall place, maintain or display upon or in view of any highway,
street or alley any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or other device which
purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official parking sign,
curb, marking or traffic control device or railroad sign or signal or which
attempts to direct the movement of traffic or which hides from view or
interferes with the effectiveness of any official traffic control device or any
railroad sign or signal. No person shall place or maintain upon any highway or
street or alley any traffic sign or signal bearing thereon any commercial
advertising. This section shall not be deemed to prohibit the placement upon
private property adjacent to highways any signs giving useful directional
information of a type that cannot be mistaken for official signs and subject to
the zoning laws as provided in the ordinances of the city. (1978 Code §23-35;
amd. 1994 Code)
9-2-6: INTERFERENCE WITH TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICE:
No person, without lawful authority, shall attempt to or in fact alter, deface,

   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to provide a system to declare

or designee shall declare a snow emergency when the city manager or designee
finds, on the basis of falling snow, sleet, freezing rain or on the basis of a

vehicle traffic to be expedited and for parking on certain city streets to be
prohibited or restricted for snow plowing or other purposes. The following
parking regulations shall be in effect during snow emergencies:
      1.   On all streets where parking is allowed on both sides, vehicles
shall be parked on only the even street numbered side of the street on even

      2.   On all streets where parking is allowed on both sides, vehicles
shall be parked on only the odd street numbered side of the street on odd days
of the month after eight o'clock (8:00) A.M.
      3.   On all streets where parking is allowed on only one side, vehicles
shall be parked on only the even street numbered side of the street on even
days of the month after eight o'clock (8:00) A.M. and shall be parked on only
the odd street numbered side of the street on odd days of the month after eight
o'clock (8:00) A.M. No parking shall be permitted on the side of the street
where parking is prohibited.
      4.   All other posted parking regulations and prohibitions shall remain
in effect. For example, on all streets where odd-even calendar parking or other
restrictions are posted, those restrictions shall continue in force and effect
notwithstanding subsections B1 and B2 of this section.
      5.   These regulations shall not apply to metered parking spaces,
designated loading zones, and those streets located within the central business
district, which, starting at the intersection of Burlington and Gilbert

not earlier than four (4) hours after it is declared, except if a snow
emergency is declared after eight o'clock (8:00) P.M., it shall not take effect
until eight o'clock (8:00) A.M. the next day, unless otherwise indicated in the
declaration. A snow emergency shall be in force for a minimum of forty eight
(48) hours after taking effect unless canceled or changed under subsection D of
this section.
   D.   Declaration And Notice:
      1.   The city manager or designee shall declare a snow emergency by
written signed notice, filed with the city clerk, stating the beginning and
ending time for the period of snow emergency, which ending time shall be a
minimum of forty eight (48) hours after taking effect. If the office of the
city clerk is closed, the city manager or designee shall file such notice
promptly when the office next is open during normal business hours.
      2.   The city manager or designee may cancel such declaration or change
the beginning or ending time. Notice as provided in subsection D1 of this
section shall be given for such cancellations or changes.
      3.   The city manager or designee shall inform the Iowa City/Cedar Rapids
area radio and television stations and the Iowa City newspapers of the snow
emergency declaration and when the snow emergency parking regulations for Iowa
City will be in effect and ask that public service announcements be made.
      4.   The public works director or designee shall post information
concerning the snow emergency declaration, when the snow emergency parking
regulations for Iowa City will be in effect and summarizing the regulations on
the city website and shall post signs on all major highways and streets
entering the city at or reasonably near the city limits, informing motorists
that a snow emergency has been declared and alternate side parking is required.
      5.   The city manager or designee may take such other actions to inform
the public of the snow emergency as appropriate.
   E.   Towing Of Improperly Parked Vehicles: Any vehicle found to be parked
where not permitted during a snow emergency will be issued a notice of parking
violation pursuant to section
9-4-14 of this chapter and towed to a place designated for the storage of
impounded vehicles pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 08-4321, 11-18-2008)

CHAPTER 2
BASE ZONES
ARTICLE A. SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL ZONES
SECTION:
14-2A-1: Establishment And Intent Of Single-Family Residential Zones
14-2A-2: Land Uses Allowed
14-2A-3: General Provisions
14-2A-4: Dimensional Requirements
14-2A-5: Maximum Occupancy For Household Living Uses
14-2A-6: Single-Family Site Development Standards
14-2A-7: Special Provisions
14-2A-1: ESTABLISHMENT AND INTENT OF SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL ZONES:
The full names, short names, and map symbols of the established single-family
residential zones are listed in this section. When this title refers to the
single-family residential zones, it is referring to the zones listed in this
section. When this title refers to residential zones, or R zones, it is
referring to both the single-family residential zones listed in this section
and the multi-family residential zones listed in
chapter 2, article B of this title.
   A.   Rural Residential Zone (RR-1): The rural residential zone (RR-1) is
intended to provide a rural residential character for areas in the city that
are not projected to have the utilities necessary for urban development in the
foreseeable future or for areas that have sensitive environmental features that
preclude development at urban densities.
   B.   Low Density Single-Family Residential Zone (RS-5): The low density
single-family residential zone (RS-5) is primarily intended to provide housing
opportunities for individual households. The regulations are intended to
create, maintain, and promote livable neighborhoods. The regulations allow for
some flexibility of dwelling types to provide housing opportunities for a
variety of household types. This zone also allows for some nonresidential uses
that contribute to the livability of residential neighborhoods, such as parks,
schools, religious institutions, and daycare facilities. Related nonresidential
uses and structures should be planned and designed to be compatible with the
character, scale, and pattern of the residential development.
   C.   Medium Density Single-Family Residential Zone (RS-8): The purpose of
the medium density single-family residential zone (RS-8) is primarily to
provide for the development of small lot single-family dwellings. The
regulations are intended to create, maintain, and promote livable
neighborhoods. The regulations allow for some flexibility of dwelling types to
provide housing opportunities for a variety of household types. Special
attention should be given to site design to ensure the development of quality
neighborhoods. Nonresidential uses and structures permitted in this zone should
be planned and designed to be compatible with the character, scale, and pattern
of the residential development.
   D.   High Density Single-Family Residential Zone (RS-12): The high density
single-family residential zone (RS-12) is intended to provide for development
of single-family dwellings, duplexes and attached housing units at a higher
density than in other single- family zones. Because this district represents a
relatively high density for single-family development, dwellings should be in
close proximity to all city services and facilities, especially parks, schools
and recreational facilities. Special attention should be given to site design
to ensure the development of quality neighborhoods. Nonresidential uses and
structures permitted in this zone should be planned and designed to be
compatible with the character, scale, and pattern of the residential
development.
   E.   Neighborhood Stabilization Residential Zone (RNS-12): The purpose of
the neighborhood stabilization residential zone (RNS-12) is to stabilize
certain existing residential neighborhoods by preserving the predominantly
single-family residential character of these neighborhoods. Provisions in this
zone prevent the conversion or redevelopment of single-family uses to multi-
family uses. However, existing conforming multi-family uses retain their
conforming status when rezoned to RNS-12. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-2A-2: LAND USES ALLOWED:
   A.   Determining Principal Uses Allowed:
      1.   
Table 2A-1, located at the end of this section, indicates whether a principal
land use is permitted (P), allowed with provisions (PR), or allowed by special
exception (S) in a particular single-family residential zone. A number in
superscript indicates that a special provision applies. See table notes for
more information.
      2.   Specific land uses are grouped into the categories and subgroups
listed in the table. For example, a church is classified as religious/private
group assembly. To find out how a specific land use is categorized, see
chapter 4, article A, "Use Categories", of this title.
      3.   Provisional uses are allowed, subject to the additional requirements
contained in
chapter 4, article B, "Minor Modifications, Variances, Special Exceptions, And
Provisional Uses", of this title.
      4.   Uses listed as special exceptions are allowed only after approval
from the Iowa City board of adjustment. The general approval criteria for
special exceptions are stated in
chapter 4, article B of this title, along with specific approval criteria for
most special exception uses.
   B.   Accessory Uses Allowed: Regulations pertaining to accessory uses are
stated in
chapter 4, article C, "Accessory Uses And Buildings", of this title. (Ord. 05-
4186, 12-15-2005)

14-2A-4: DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
The dimensional requirements for the single-family residential zones are stated
in
 table 2A-2, located at the end of this section. Each of the following
subsections describes in more detail the regulations for each of the
dimensional requirements listed in the table. Provisional uses and uses allowed
by special exception may have specific dimensional requirements not specified
in
table 2A-2, located at the end of this section. Approval criteria for these
uses are addressed in
chapter 4, article B of this title. Dimensional requirements may be waived or
modified for developments approved through the planned development (see
chapter 3, article A, "Planned Development Overlay Zone (OPD)", of this title)
or through the historic preservation exception as outlined in section
14-2A-7, "Special Provisions", of this article.
   A.   Minimum Lot Requirements:
      1.   Purpose: The minimum lot area and width requirements are intended to
ensure that a lot is of a size, width, and frontage that is appropriate for the
uses permitted in the subject zone and will ensure, in most cases, that the
other site development standards of this title can be met. The lot area per
dwelling unit standards control the intensity of use on a lot to ensure
consistency and compatibility of new dwellings with the surrounding
development.
      2.   Standards: Generally, the minimum lot area and width standards for
the various single-family residential zones and for specific residential uses
are stated in
table 2A-2, located at the end of this section.
      3.   Minimum Lot Sizes For Specific Land Uses:
         a.   Provisional uses and uses allowed by special exception may have
specific lot size requirements not specified in
table 2A-2, located at the end of this section. Approval criteria for these
uses are addressed in
chapter 4, article B, "Minor Modifications, Variances, Special Exceptions, And
Provisional Uses", of this title.
         b.   If a minimum lot size is specified within a zone for a particular
land use or dwelling type, whether permitted, provisional or a special
exception, that use or dwelling type may not be established on a smaller lot,
even if smaller lots are permitted in the subject base zone, except as
permitted under
chapter 4, article E, "Nonconforming Situations", of this title.
   B.   Minimum Setback Requirements For Principal Buildings:
      1.   Purpose: The minimum setback requirements are intended to:
         a.   Maintain light, air, separation for fire protection, and access
for firefighting;
         b.   Provide opportunities for privacy between dwellings;
         c.   Reflect the general building scale and placement of structures in
the city's neighborhoods;
         d.   Promote a reasonable physical relationship between buildings and
between residences; and
         e.   Provide flexibility to site a building so that it is compatible
with buildings in the vicinity.
      2.   General Setback Requirements: Generally, the minimum required
setbacks for principal buildings in residential zones are stated in
table 2A-2, located at the end of this section. The minimum setbacks for
principal buildings create required setback areas within which principal
buildings are not allowed, except for certain building features as specified in
this subsection.
      3.   Specific Setback Requirements: The following provisions contain
setback requirements that apply in specific situations:
         a.   Setbacks Along Arterial Streets:
            (1)   On lots platted after December 31, 1983, a minimum forty foot
(40') front setback is required along any lot line that abuts an arterial
street or future arterial street as shown on the Iowa City arterial street map,
located in
chapter 5, article C, "Access Management Standards", of this title.
            (2)   If a lot is located along an arterial street that is
substandard with regard to the width of the public right of way as specified in
title 15, "Land Subdivisions", of this code, then the minimum forty foot (40')
front setback along said street is increased by the number of additional feet
that will be required for future upgrade of said street to city standards. Lots
platted prior to December 31, 1983, are exempt from this requirement. In
addition, setback averaging may apply in certain circumstances. (See subsection
B3e of this section.)
         b.   Lots With Multiple Frontages:
            (1)   On corner lots, no building, structure or planting, unless
specifically exempted, may be located within the vision triangle, as set forth
in
chapter 5, article D, "Intersection Visibility Standards", of this title.
            (2)   If a lot fronting on two (2) or more streets is required to
have a front setback, a minimum setback equal to the required front setback
must be provided along all streets, and such setback will be considered a front
setback for purposes of this title.
         c.   Lots With Multiple Buildings: The principal buildings on the lot
must be separated by a horizontal distance of at least ten feet (10').
Proximity of building walls will be subject to all current building code fire
protection requirements.
         d.   Overlay Zones And Special Districts: If specific setbacks have
been established in a historic or conservation district, a planned development,
or in the central planning district, those setbacks supersede the setback
requirements of the base zone. For properties located in a historic or
conservation district, refer to
chapter 3, article B of this title and also the applicable setback provisions
in the Iowa City historic preservation handbook. For a property located in a
planned development overlay zone, refer to the approved planned development
overlay plan for the subject property. For two-family uses, multi-family uses,
group living uses, and institutional/civic uses located on property in the
Central Planning District, refer to the applicable setback provisions in
section
14-2B-6, "Multi-Family Site Development Standards", of this chapter.
         e.   Setback Averaging:
            (1)   Where at least fifty percent (50%) of the lots along a
frontage have been developed and all of these developed lots are occupied by
principal buildings that are located at least five feet (5') further from the
street than the required front setback, the required front setback along the
frontage is increased to the equivalent of the setback of the building closest
to the street. However, this averaging provision does not apply to frontages
that contain three (3) or fewer lots.
Figure 2A.1 - Setback Averaging (1)

IMAGES/0-0-0-2542.png]
 
            (2)   Where at least fifty percent (50%) of the lots along a
frontage are occupied by principal buildings that are located closer to the
street than the required front setback, the front setback may be reduced to the
average of the respective setbacks on the abutting lots. Only the setbacks on
the lots that abut each side of the subject property along the same street may
be used to calculate the average. Setbacks across the street or along a
different street frontage may not be used. When one abutting lot is vacant or
if the lot is a corner lot, then the average is based on the setback of the
nonvacant lot and the required setback for the zone in which the lot is
located. (See
figure 2A.2 of this section.)

      4.   Building Features Permitted Within Required Setback Area: The
following building features may extend into the required principal building
setback area, subject to the conditions indicated and provided that location of
such a feature does not violate the provisions of
chapter 5, article D, "Intersection Visibility Standards", of this title. The
setback regulations for detached accessory structures and structures not
considered part of the principal building are addressed in
chapter 4, article C, "Accessory Uses And Buildings", of this title.
         a.   Awnings, uncovered balconies, bay windows, belt courses,
buttresses, canopies, chimneys, cornices, sills, and other similar features
that extend beyond the wall of a principal building may project up to six feet
(6') into the required front or rear setbacks. Except for balconies, bay
windows, and chimneys, all such projecting building features may extend up to
three feet (3') into the required side setback. Balconies and bay windows may
not extend into the required side setback. Chimneys may extend up to two feet
(2') into the required side setback. Projections from the principal building
must in all cases be at least two feet (2') from any side lot line.
         b.   Enclosed porches, covered decks, and covered patios that are
attached to the principal building must comply with the principal building
setbacks of the base zone and may not extend into the required setback area.
Unenclosed and screened-in porches (non- habitable space) may extend up to
fifteen feet (15') into the rear setback, provided they are set back at least
twenty feet (20') from the rear lot line. The standards for uncovered decks and
patios are specified in
chapter 4, article C, "Accessory Uses And Buildings", of this title. Enclosed
porches, covered decks, and covered patios that are attached to an accessory
building must comply with the standards for accessory buildings as specified in
chapter 4, article C, "Accessory Uses And Buildings", of this title.
         c.   Fire escapes may extend into any setback, provided they do not
extend more than three feet (3') into any side setback.
         d.   Stairways that function as the principal means of access to
dwelling units located above the ground or first floor of a building may not
extend into any required setback.
         e.   Stoops and wheelchair ramps that function as a means of access to
the ground or first floor of a building may extend into the rear setback, up to
eight feet (8') into the required front setback, and into the side setback,
provided they are set back at least three feet (3') from any side lot line. In
cases where, due to topography or other site characteristics, a wheelchair ramp
cannot meet this standard, a minor modification may be requested according to
the approval criteria and procedures for minor modifications contained in
chapter 4, article B of this title.
      5.   Adjustments To Principal Building Setback Requirements:
         a.   A minor modification to reduce principal building setback
requirements may be requested according to the approval criteria and procedures
for minor modifications contained in
chapter 4, article B of this title.
         b.   A special exception may be requested to reduce principal building
setback requirements beyond what is allowed by minor modification. The Board of
Adjustment may adjust setback requirements if the owner or lawful occupant of a
property demonstrates that the general special exception approval criteria and
the following specific approval criteria have been satisfied:
            (1)   The situation is peculiar to the property in question;
            (2)   There is practical difficulty in complying with the setback
requirements;
            (3)   Granting the exception will not be contrary to the purpose of
the setback regulations; and
            (4)   Any potential negative effects resulting from the setback
exception are mitigated to the extent practical.
            (5)   The subject building will be located no closer than three
feet (3') to a side or rear property line, unless the side or rear property
line abuts a public right-of-way or permanent open space.
   C.   Building Bulk Standards:
      1.   Maximum Height:
         a.   Purpose: The height regulations are intended to promote a
reasonable building scale and relationship between buildings; provide options
for light, air, and privacy; and discourage buildings that visually dominate
other buildings in the vicinity.
         b.   Standards: Generally, the maximum height standards for structures
in single-family residential zones are stated in
 table 2A-2, located at the end of this section. Height standards for accessory
buildings are addressed in
chapter 4, article C, "Accessory Uses And Buildings", of this title.
         c.   Exemptions: If allowed in the subject zone, the following
structures or parts thereof are exempt from the height limitations set forth in
the zones indicated, provided an increase in height does not conflict with
chapter 6, "Airport Zoning", of this title:
            (1)   Chimneys or flues.
            (2)   Spires on religious or other institutional buildings.
            (3)   Cupolas, domes, skylights and other similar roof protrusions
not used for the purpose of obtaining habitable floor space.
            (4)   Farm structures, including barns, silos, storage bins and
similar structures when accessory to an allowed agriculture use.
            (5)   Flagpoles that extend not more than ten feet (10') above the
height limit or not more than five feet (5') above the highest point of the
roof, whichever is less.
            (6)   Parapet or fire walls extending not more than three feet (3')
above the limiting height of the building.
            (7)   Poles, towers and other structures accessory to a basic
utility use, such as street lights and utility poles.
            (8)   If allowed in the subject zone, basic utilities and
communication transmission facilities are exempt from the base zone height
standards, but are subject to any limitations placed by the Board of
Adjustment.
            (9)   Roof structures, including solar energy systems, elevator
bulkheads, stairways, ventilating fans, cooling towers and similar necessary
mechanical and electrical appurtenances required to operate and maintain the
building.
            (10)   Television antennas and similar apparatus.
         d.   Adjustment Of Height Standards:
            (1)   The maximum height for a principal building may be increased;
provided, that for each foot of height increase above the height standard, the
front, side, and rear setbacks are each increased by an additional two feet
(2'); and provided, that an increase in height does not conflict with the
provisions of chapter 6, "Airport Zoning", of this title.
            (2)   A minor modification may also be requested to adjust the
maximum height for a particular building or property according to the
procedures and approval criteria for minor modifications contained in
chapter 4, article B of this title.
      2.   Minimum Building Width:
         a.   Purpose: The minimum building width requirements promote a
reasonable building scale and relationship between dwellings in a neighborhood.
         b.   Standards: The minimum building width requirements for principal
structures in single-family residential zones are stated in
 table 2A-2, located at the end of this section. A principal building must be
in compliance with the specified minimum building width for at least seventy
five percent (75%) of the building's length. (See
 figure 2A.3 below.)
Figure 2A.3 - Minimum Building Width

IMAGES/0-0-0-2546.png]
 
   D.   Maximum Lot Coverage Standards:
      1.   Total Building Coverage:
         a.   Purpose: The total building coverage standard helps to define the
character of single-family residential zones by limiting the land area that can
be covered by buildings. These standards work in conjunction with the minimum
lot requirements and building bulk standards to determine how built up a
neighborhood appears.
         b.   Standards: The total building coverage standards for the various
single-family residential zones are stated in
 table 2A-2, located at the end of this section. The maximum building coverage
standard establishes the percentage of the total area of a lot that can be
covered by buildings. The total building area of all buildings on the property,
including both principal and accessory buildings, is used to calculate the
building coverage.
      2.   Front Setback Coverage:
         a.   Purpose: The front setback coverage standard ensures that a
certain portion of the front setback area remains free of impervious surface,
which helps to maintain a consistent and pleasant environment along
neighborhood streets. These standards increase public safety by preventing
excessive front yard paving and vehicular storage that may obscure the
principal dwelling and the main entrance from view of the street. In addition,
this standard helps to prevent neighborhood streets that are dominated by front
yard pavement, particularly along frontages with narrow residential lots.
         b.   Standard: The maximum front setback coverage standard for the
single-family residential zones is stated in
 table 2A-2, located at the end of this section. The table lists the maximum
percentage of the required front setback that may be covered by impervious
surface, including driveways, walkways, patios, decks, and other paved areas.
Front setback coverage may not exceed the percentage indicated in said
 table 2A-2.
         c.   Exception: A special exception may be requested to increase the
allowed front setback coverage. The Board of Adjustment may adjust the front
setback coverage standard if the owner or lawful occupant of a property
demonstrates that the general special exception approval criteria set forth in
chapter 4, article B of this title, and the following specific approval
criteria have been satisfied:
            (1)   The lot is of an irregular shape or contains severe
topography, such that there is practical difficulty meeting the front setback
coverage standard.
            (2)   The applicant has demonstrated that every effort has been
made to design buildings, paved areas, and vehicular use areas to meet the
front setback coverage standard. Such efforts include reducing the width of
driveways, reducing paved areas and size of garages and providing alternative
means of vehicular access to the property. If vehicular access to an alley or
private rear lane is available, the front setback coverage standard may not be
increased.
            (3)   Granting the exception will not be contrary to the purpose of
the front setback coverage regulations.
            (4)   Any potential negative effects resulting from the exception
are mitigated to the extent practical.
   E.   Minimum Open Space Requirements:
      1.   Purpose: The minimum open space requirements are intended to ensure
a minimum amount of private, usable open space is provided to support the
health, well-being and enjoyment of the residents of the dwelling. The intent
of the open space is to support passive recreation, leisure activities,
informal gathering, and opportunities for interaction with nature.
      2.   Minimum Requirements:
         a.   On lots that contain multi-family uses or group living uses,
usable open space shall be provided on each lot at a ratio of ten (10) square
feet per bedroom, but not less than four hundred (400) square feet, located in
one or more clearly defined, compact areas, with each area not less than two
hundred twenty five (225) square feet with no dimension less than fifteen feet
(15'). On lots that contain multi-family uses in the RS-12 zone, a minimum of
one hundred fifty (150) square feet of usable open space per unit shall be
provided, located in the rear yard with no dimension less than ten feet (10').
         b.   On lots that contain detached single family uses, a minimum of
five hundred (500) square feet of usable open space shall be provided, located
in the rear yard with no dimension less than twenty feet (20').
         c.   On lots that contain attached single family uses, a minimum of
one hundred fifty (150) square feet of usable open space shall be provided,
located in the rear yard with no dimension less than ten feet (10').
         d.   On lots that contain two family uses, a minimum of three hundred
(300) square feet of usable open space per dwelling unit shall be provided,
located in one or more clearly defined, compact areas, with each area not less
than three hundred (300) square feet with no dimension less than twelve feet
(12').
      3.   Standards:
         a.   For multi-family uses and group living uses, open space shall
meet the standards as set forth in subsections
14-2G-7E1 through E7 of this chapter, except that multi-family uses in the RS-
12 zone shall comply with the standards below.
         b.   For single family uses, two family uses, and multi-family uses in
RS-12 zones, open space shall be located behind the principal dwelling in an
area visible and easily accessible from the principal dwelling and shall
consist of open planted green space, which may include trees, planters,
gardens, and other amenities that support passive recreation or leisure
activities. Paved areas shall not be counted toward usable open space. For
attached single family uses, rooftop or upper floor open air terraces or rear
yard-facing porches, including screened-in porches (non-habitable space only)
may count toward the open space requirement.
      4.   Minor Modification: A minor modification may be requested according
to the provisions and approval criteria of section
14-4B-1, "Minor Modifications", of this title, to reduce the required open
space for single family and two family uses in the following circumstances,
provided the additional approval criteria stated in subsection E4e of this
section, are satisfied. Note that reducing the open space may reduce the
allowed occupancy of a rental property (see title 17, chapter 5, "Housing
Code", of this Code):
         a.   In order to establish up to two (2) off-street parking spaces
(surface parking or in a garage) on a lot that currently has fewer than two (2)
off-street parking spaces; or
         b.   If the lot is a corner lot, is irregular in shape, substandard in
size, or contains severe topography, or other unique circumstance, such that
there is practical difficulty meeting the standard; or
         c.   The lot contains a manufactured home, where due to the shape/
dimensions of the home there is practical difficulty meeting the standard; or
         d.   The lot contains a detached zero lot line dwelling, where the
side yard is designed to serve as usable open space for the dwelling;
         e.   Approval criteria:
            (1)   The applicant has demonstrated that every effort has been
made to design buildings, paved areas, and vehicular use areas to meet the open
space requirement. Such efforts may include but are not limited to reducing the
width of driveways, reducing paved areas and size of new buildings or
additions, and providing alternative means of vehicular access to the property;
and
            (2)   The open space requirement will be satisfied to the extent
possible in another location on the lot, such as a side yard; and
            (3)   Any potential negative effects resulting from the exception
are mitigated to the extent possible.

n/a = not applicable
Notes:
   1.    Other uses must comply with the standards listed in this table unless
specified otherwise in
chapter 4, article B of this title.
   2.    Minimum side setback is 5 feet for the first 2 stories plus 2 feet for
each additional story. Detached zero lot line dwellings must comply with the
applicable side setback standards in
chapter 4, article B of this title.
   3.    A building must be in compliance with the specified minimum building
width for at least 75 percent of the building's length.
   4.    See the special provisions of this article regarding multi-family
uses.
   5.    See applicable side setbacks for attached single-family as provided in
chapter 4, article B, "Minor Modifications, Variances, Special Exceptions, And
Provisional Uses", of this title.
   6.    The principal dwelling must be set back at least 15 feet, except on
lots located around the bulb of a cul-de-sac; on such lots the principal
dwelling must be set back at least 25 feet. On all lots, garages, both attached
and detached, must be set back as specified in
chapter 4, article C, "Accessory Uses And Buildings", of this title.
   7.    Minimum lot width is 20 feet for attached units on interior lots and
28 feet for end lots in a row of attached units. When only 2 units are
attached, lots must be 28 feet wide.
   8.    If the single family density bonus options have been applied, the
minimum lot area, lot area per unit, lot width and lot frontage requirements
may be reduced accordingly. (See section
14-2A-7 of this article.)
   9.    The principal building rear setback is 20 feet, except in the Central
Planning District and Downtown Planning District, where the rear setback is
dependent on the depth of the lot. For lots equal to or less than 100 feet in
depth: minimum rear setback = 20 feet. For lots greater than 100 feet in depth:
minimum rear setback = lot depth less 80 feet. For purposes of this provision,
garages located in the rear yard and attached to the principal dwelling with a
(non-habitable) breezeway (8 feet or narrower in width) will be considered
detached accessory buildings and, therefore, are subject to the setback
requirements for detached accessory buildings, rather than principal building
setback requirements. Similarly, subject breezeways shall be treated as
detached accessory structures/buildings.
   10.    Open space must meet standards set forth in subsection
14-2A-4E of this section.
   11.    Outside of the University Impact Area (see map 2B.1 in Section
14-2B-6), the maximum number of bedrooms may be increased by one (1). Any
bedroom within a multi-family, attached single family or duplex that exceeds
225 square feet in size or has any horizontal dimension greater than 16 feet
shall count as 2 or more bedrooms, as determined by the City. The maximum
number of bedrooms may be further constrained by the provisions of title 17,
chapter 5, "Housing Code", of this Code.
(Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd. Ord. 09-4365, 12-1-2009; Ord. 12-4488, 8-21-
2012; Ord. 18-4744, 4-2-2018; Ord. 23-4893, 1-24-2023; Ord. 23-4914, 11-6-2023;
Ord. 24-4919, 1-16-2024)
14-2A-5: MAXIMUM OCCUPANCY FOR HOUSEHOLD LIVING USES:
The residential occupancy of a household living use is limited to one
"household" per dwelling unit, as this term is defined in
chapter 9, article A, "General Definitions", of this title. The residential
occupancy of a household living use is constrained by the provisions of title
17, chapter 5, "Housing Code", of this Code. Occupancy of properties that are
not in compliance with the minimum Zoning Code requirements may be limited as
set forth in subsection
17-5-18S, "Regulation Of Noncompliant Situations", of this Code. (Ord. 18-4744,
4-2-2018)
14-2A-6: SINGLE-FAMILY SITE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Purpose: The single-family site development standards are intended to:
      1.   Ensure that parking areas are located so as to prevent drainage onto
adjoining properties, to prevent vehicles from blocking sidewalks and to ensure
that front yard areas remain free of large parking areas that will detract from
the residential character of the neighborhood.
      2.   Enhance public safety for residents and visitors by lining streets
with active living spaces, ensuring that there is a physical and visual
connection between the living area of the residence and the street.
      3.   Enhance the pedestrian oriented character of the neighborhood by
preventing blank facades and large expanses of concrete along the street.
   B.   Applicability:
      1.   The standards of this section apply to all single-family and two-
family uses located in any zone.
      2.   Multi-family dwellings, group living uses, and institutional/civic
uses located in a single-family zone are subject to the multi-family site
development standards specified in
chapter 2, article B, "Multi-Family Residential Zones", of this title.
   C.   Garage, Driveway And Parking Location Standards:
      1.   For single-family uses and two-family uses, a required parking space
may be located behind another parking space on a regularly constructed aisle,
provided the spaces are not stacked more than two (2) spaces deep, counting the
space within a garage. (See
figure 2A.4 of this section.)

      2.   Parking for single-family uses and two-family uses may be designed
to allow cars to exit by backing into a street, except if street access is
restricted or alley access is required.
      3.   Parking is not permitted in the front principal dwelling setback,
except in the following situations:
         a.    For single-family uses, one of the required parking space(s) may
be provided in the front principal dwelling setback on a regularly constructed
aisle that leads directly to a parking space that is not located in the front
principal dwelling setback, provided not less than fifty percent (50%) of the
front principal dwelling setback area remains open space, free of impervious
surface.
         b.   For two (2)-family uses and group households, two (2) of the
required parking spaces may be provided in the front principal dwelling setback
on a regularly constructed aisle that leads directly to a parking space that is
not located in the front principal dwelling setback, provided not less than
fifty percent (50%) of the front principal dwelling setback area remains open
space, free of impervious surface.
         c.   For single-family uses, two-family uses, and group households, up
to three (3) nonrequired parking spaces may be provided in the front principal
dwelling setback, provided any such space is located on a regularly constructed
aisle that leads directly to a parking space that is not located in the front
principal dwelling setback, and provided that not less than fifty percent (50%)
of the front principal dwelling setback area remains open space, free of
buildings and impervious surfaces. (See figure 2A.5 of this section.)

      4.   Garages and carports must be located so as to provide a driveway, at
least twenty five feet (25') in length, between the entrance to the garage or
carport and the street right of way line. Garages and carports accessed from an
alley must be located so as to provide a driveway at least five feet (5') in
length between the entrance to the garage or carport and the alley right of way
line. In cases where the configuration of the lot, the topography, and/or other
physical characteristic of the property makes the application of this standard
impractical, a minor modification may be requested to reduce the driveway
length, provided that the following approval criteria are met in addition to
the general minor modification standards set forth in subsection
14-4B-1B of this title:
         a.   There will be at least twenty five feet (25') of driveway length
between the entrance to the garage or carport and any existing public sidewalk.
In cases where there is no public sidewalk, but where a public sidewalk is
likely to be built in the future, there must be at least twenty five feet (25')
of driveway length between the entrance of the garage or carport and the likely
location of a future public sidewalk, as determined by the city.
         b.   The resulting garage or carport location and driveway length will
not compromise public safety along the fronting street or alley.
      5.   A nonhard surfaced drive or aisle may not be located closer than
three feet (3') to a lot line, except at the point of access with a street,
alley, or private rear lane. Hard surfaced drives must be set back at least
three feet (3') from any side or rear lot line, except under the following
circumstances:
         a.   The drives and aisles are pitched or curbed and drained to
prevent the flow of water onto adjoining property; or
         b.   A drainage course has been established along lot lines to handle
stormwater runoff; or
         c.   Any specific location along a side or rear lot line where a drive
is shared with an abutting lot; or
         d.   At the point of access with an alley or private rear lane.
      6.   On lots less than sixty feet (60') in width, the length of any
garage wall that faces a street-side lot line may not exceed sixty percent
(60%) of the total length of the building facade that faces the same street-
side lot line. On corner lots, only the garage wall(s) containing a garage door
must meet this standard. For two-family uses and attached single-family
dwellings, additional vehicular access standards may apply. See applicable
standards in section
14-4B-4, "Specific Approval Criteria For Provisional Uses And Special
Exceptions", of this title.
   D.   Pedestrian Circulation: Where no sidewalk exists, sidewalks shall be
constructed in the abutting public right-of-way according to the standards in
section
15-3-3. The Director of Neighborhood and Development Services may exempt a
property from this requirement where a finding is made that such a sidewalk is
unlikely to connect to future pedestrian routes. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005;
amd. Ord. 11-4451, 10-18-2011; Ord. 19-4815, 12-17-2019; Ord. 21- 4858, 6-1-
2021; Ord. 22-4882, 6-21-2022)
14-2A-7: SPECIAL PROVISIONS:

   C.   Special Provisions In Neighborhood Stabilization Residential Zone:
      1.   At the time a property is rezoned to neighborhood stabilization
residential (RNS-12), any uses that were conforming with regard to use and
minimum lot area per unit requirements under the previous zoning designation
shall be considered conforming with regard to use and minimum lot area per unit
requirements under the neighborhood stabilization residential zone. Any
building containing a conforming use may be torn down and rebuilt to its
present density or to the allowed density in the neighborhood stabilization
residential zone; provided, that it conforms to all other provisions of this
title.
      2.   The special provision described in subsection C1 of this section
does not exempt a property from compliance with other relevant dimensional

14-2B-1: ESTABLISHMENT AND INTENT OF MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL ZONES:
The full names, short names, and map symbols of the established multi-family
residential zones are listed below. When this title refers to the multi-family
residential zones, it is referring to the zones listed below. When this title
refers to residential zones, or R zones, it is referring to both the single-
family residential zones listed
chapter 2, article A of this title and the multi-family residential zones
listed below.
   A.   Low Density Multi-Family Residential Zone (RM-12): The purpose of the
low density multi-family residential zone (RM-12) is to provide for the
development of high density, single-family housing and low density, multi-
family housing. This zone is intended to provide a diverse variety of housing
options in neighborhoods throughout the city. Careful attention to site and
building design is important to ensure that the various housing types in any
one location are compatible with one another.
   B.   Medium Density Multi-Family Residential Zone (RM-20): The purpose of
the medium density multi-family residential zone (RM-20) is to provide for the
development of medium density multi-family housing. This zone is particularly
well suited to locations adjacent to commercial areas and in areas with good
access to all city services and facilities. This zone allows a mix of detached
and attached single-family housing, duplexes, and multi-family housing. Careful
attention to site and building design is important to ensure that the various
housing types in any one location are compatible with one another.
   C.   Neighborhood Stabilization Residential Zone (RNS-20): The purpose of
the neighborhood stabilization residential zone (RNS-20) is to stabilize and
preserve the character of older neighborhoods that contain a mix of single-
family housing, duplexes, single-family structures that have been converted to
multi-family housing, and properties that have been redeveloped with multi-
family housing. Higher density multi-family uses that were conforming prior to
rezoning to RNS-20 remain conforming when rezoned to RNS-20. Conversions and
redevelopment may occur up to the density allowed in this zone.
   D.   High Density Multi-Family Residential Zone (RM-44): The purpose of the
high density multi-family residential zone (RM-44) is to establish areas for
the development of high density, multi- family dwellings and group living
quarters. Properties zoned RM-44 should be located with good access to all city
services and facilities, including public transportation services. Vehicular
access and parking should be designed carefully to ensure efficient traffic and
pedestrian circulation on adjacent streets. Due to the high density permitted
in this zone, careful attention to site design is expected to ensure that
buildings are compatible with surrounding land uses and that a quality living
environment will be maintained over time.
   E.   Planned High Density Multi-Family Residential Zone (PRM): The purpose
of the planned high density multi-family residential zone (PRM) is to provide
for development of high density multi-family housing in close proximity to
centrally located employment, educational, and commercial uses. Because of the
high density of development anticipated in this zone, special consideration of
building and site design is required. Density bonuses may be granted when
additional amenities are provided. Establishing a pleasant, safe and efficient
pedestrian environment is important, since many of the city's primary
destinations are within walking distance of properties zoned PRM. (Ord. 05-
4186, 12-15-2005)
14-2B-2: LAND USES ALLOWED:
   A.   Determining Principal Uses Allowed:
      1.   
Table 2B-1, located at the end of this section, indicates whether a principal
land use is permitted (P), allowed with provisions (PR), or allowed by special
exception (S) in a particular multi-family residential zone.
      2.   Specific land uses are grouped into the categories and subgroups
listed in the table. For example, a rooming house is classified as independent
group living. To find out how a specific land use is categorized see
chapter 4, article A, "Use Categories", of this title.
      3.   Provisional uses are allowed, subject to the additional requirements
contained in
chapter 4, article B, "Minor Modifications, Variances, Special Exceptions, And
Provisional Uses", of this title.
      4.   Uses listed as special exceptions are allowed only after approval
from the Iowa City board of adjustment. The approval criteria for special
exceptions are stated in
chapter 4, article B of this title.
   B.   Accessory Uses Allowed: Regulations pertaining to accessory uses are
stated in
chapter 4, article C, "Accessory Uses And Buildings", of this title. (Ord. 05-
4186, 12-15-2005)

14-2B-4: DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
The dimensional requirements for the multi-family residential zones are stated
in
table 2B-2, located at the end of this section. Each of the following
subsections describes in more detail the regulations for each of the
dimensional requirements listed in the table. Provisional uses and uses allowed
by special exception may have specific dimensional requirements not specified
in
table 2B-2, located at the end of this section. Approval criteria for these
uses are addressed in chapter 4, article B of this title. Dimensional
requirements may be waived or modified for developments approved through the
planned development process (see chapter 3, article A, “Planned Development
Overlay Zone (OPD)”, of this title) or through minor adjustments in PRM Zones
as outlined in section
14-2B-7, “PRM Zone bonus And Minor Adjustment Provisions” or the historic
preservation exception as outlined in section
14-2B-8, “Special Provisions”, of this article.
   A.   Minimum Lot Requirements:
      1.   Purpose: The minimum lot area and width requirements are intended to
ensure that a lot is of a size, width, and frontage that is appropriate for the
uses permitted in the subject zone and will ensure, in most cases, that the
other site development standards of this title can be met. The lot area per
dwelling unit standards control the intensity of use on a lot to ensure
consistency and compatibility of new dwellings with the surrounding
development.
      2.   Standards: Generally, the minimum lot area and width standards for
the various multi-family residential zones and for specific residential uses
are stated in
table 2B-2, located at the end of this section.
      3.   Minimum Lot Requirements For Specific Land Uses:
         a.   Provisional uses and uses allowed by special exception may have
specific lot size requirements not specified in
table 2B-2, located at the end of this section. Approval criteria for these
uses are addressed in chapter 4, article B of this title.
         b.   If a minimum lot size is specified within a zone for a particular
land use or dwelling type, whether permitted, provisional or a special
exception, that use or dwelling type may not be established on a smaller lot,
even if smaller lots are permitted in the subject base zone, except as
permitted under chapter 4, article E, "Nonconforming Situations", of this
title.
         c.   The single-family density bonus options for the RS-12 zone, as
specified in section
 14-2A-7 of this title, may be applied to detached single-family dwellings and
detached zero lot line dwellings located in the RM-12 and RM-20 zones. If the
single- family density bonus options have been applied, the minimum lot area,
lot area per unit, lot width and lot frontage requirements may be reduced
accordingly.
   B.   Minimum Setback Requirements For Principal Buildings:
      1.   Purpose: The minimum setback requirements are intended to:
         a.   Maintain light, air, separation for fire protection, and access
for firefighting;
         b.   Provide opportunities for privacy between dwellings;
         c.   Reflect the general building scale and placement of structures in
the city's neighborhoods;
         d.   Promote a reasonable physical relationship between buildings; and
         e.   Provide flexibility to site a building so that it is compatible
with buildings in the vicinity.
      2.   General Setback Requirements: Generally, the minimum required
setbacks for principal buildings in multi-family residential zones are stated
in
 table 2B-2, located at the end of this section. The minimum setbacks for
principal buildings create required setback areas within which principal
buildings are not allowed, except for certain building features as specified in
this subsection.
      3.   Specific Setback Requirements: The following provisions contain
principal building setback requirements that apply in specific situations:
         a.   Setbacks Along Arterial Streets:
            (1)   On lots platted after December 31, 1983, a minimum forty foot
(40') front setback is required along any lot line that abuts an arterial
street or future arterial street as shown on the Iowa City arterial street map,
located in
chapter 5, article C, "Access Management Standards", of this title.
            (2)   If a lot is located along an arterial street that is
substandard with regard to the width of the public right of way as specified in
title 15, "Land Subdivisions", of this code, then the minimum forty foot (40')
front setback along said street is increased by the number of additional feet
that will be required for future upgrade of said street to city standards. Lots
platted prior to December 31, 1983, are exempt from this requirement. In
addition, setback averaging may apply in certain circumstances. (See subsection
B3e of this section.)
         b.   Lots With Multiple Frontages:
            (1)   On corner lots, no building, structure or planting, unless
specifically exempted, may be located within the vision triangle, as set forth
in
chapter 5, article D, "Intersection Visibility Standards", of this title.
            (2)   If a lot fronting on two (2) or more streets is required to
have a front setback, a minimum setback equal to the required front setback
must be provided along all streets, and such setback will be considered a front
setback for purposes of this title.
         c.   Lots With Multiple Buildings: The principal buildings on a lot
must be separated by a horizontal distance of at least ten feet (10').
Buildings containing residential uses must be designed to preserve privacy.
This can be achieved by placement of windows to prevent direct views into the
windows of adjacent residential dwelling units. In addition, balconies and air
conditioning units may not be located along a building wall that is within
twenty feet (20') of a building wall of an adjacent principal building on the
same lot, if the wall of the adjacent building contains window or door openings
into dwelling units. Proximity of building walls will be subject to all current
building code fire protection requirements.
         d.   Overlay Zones And Special Districts: If specific setbacks have
been established in a historic or conservation district, a planned development,
or in the central planning district, those setbacks supersede the setback
requirements of the base zone. For properties located in a historic or
conservation district, refer to
chapter 3, article B of this title and also the applicable setback provisions
in the Iowa City historic preservation handbook. For a property located in a
planned development overlay zone, refer to the approved planned development
overlay plan for the subject property. For two-family uses, multi-family uses,
group living uses, and institutional/civic uses located on property in the
central planning district, refer to the applicable setback provisions in
section
14-2B-6, "Multi-Family Site Development Standards", of this article.
         e.   Setback Averaging:
            (1)   Where at least fifty percent (50%) of the lots along a
frontage have been developed and all of these developed lots are occupied by
principal buildings that are located at least five feet (5') further from the
street than the required front setback, the required front setback along the
frontage is increased to the equivalent of the setback of the building closest
to the street. However, this averaging provision does not apply to frontages
that contain three (3) or fewer lots.
Figure 2B.1 - Setback Averaging (1)

IMAGES/0-0-0-2550.png]
 
            (2)   Where at least fifty percent (50%) of the lots along a
frontage are occupied by principal buildings that are located closer to the
street than the required front setback, the front setback may be reduced to the
average of the respective setbacks on the abutting lots. Only the setbacks on
the lots that abut each side of the subject property along the same street may
be used to calculate the average. Setbacks across the street or along a
different street frontage may not be used. When one abutting lot is vacant or
if the lot is a corner lot, then the average is based on the setback of the
principal building on the nonvacant lot and the required setback for the zone
in which the lot is located. (See
 figure 2B.2 of this section.)

      4.   Building Features Permitted Within Required Setback Area: The
following building features may extend into the required principal building
setback area, subject to the conditions indicated and provided that location of
such a feature does not violate the provisions of
chapter 5, article D, "Intersection Visibility Standards", of this title. The
setback regulations for detached accessory structures and structures not
considered part of the principal building are addressed in
chapter 4, article C, "Accessory Uses And Buildings", of this title.
         a.   Awnings, uncovered balconies, bay windows, belt courses,
buttresses, canopies, chimneys, cornices, sills, and other similar features
that extend beyond the wall of a principal building may project up to six feet
(6') into the required front or rear setbacks. Except for balconies, bay
windows, and chimneys, all such projecting building features may extend up to
three feet (3') into the required side setback. Balconies and bay windows may
not extend into the required side setback. Chimneys may extend up to two feet
(2') into the required side setback. Projections from the principal building
must in all cases be at least two feet (2') from any side lot line.
         b.   Enclosed porches, covered decks, and covered patios that are
attached to the principal building must comply with the principal building
setbacks of the base zone and may not extend into the required setback area.
Unenclosed and screened-in porches (non- habitable space) may extend up to
fifteen feet (15') into the rear setback, provided they are set back at least
twenty feet (20') from the rear lot line. The standards for uncovered decks and
patios are specified in
chapter 4, article C, "Accessory Uses And Buildings", of this title. Enclosed
porches, covered decks, and covered patios that are attached to an accessory
building must comply with the standards for accessory buildings as specified in
chapter 4, article C, "Accessory Uses And Buildings", of this title.
         c.   Fire escapes may extend into any setback, provided they do not
extend more than three feet (3') into any side setback.
         d.   Stairways that function as the principal means of access to
dwelling units located above the ground or first floor of a building may not
extend into any required setback.
         e.   Stoops and wheelchair ramps that function as a means of access to
the ground or first floor of a building may extend into the rear setback, up to
eight feet (8') into the required front setback, and into the side setback,
provided they are set back at least three feet (3') from any side lot line. In
cases where, due to topography or other site characteristics, a wheelchair ramp
cannot meet this standard, a minor modification may be requested according to
the approval criteria and procedures for minor modifications contained in
chapter 4, article B of this title.
      5.   Adjustments To Principal Building Setback Requirements:
         a.   A minor modification to reduce principal building setback
requirements may be requested according to the approval criteria and procedures
for minor modifications contained in chapter 4, article B of this title.
         b.   A special exception may be requested to reduce principal building
setback requirements beyond what is allowed by minor modification. The Board of
Adjustment may adjust setback requirements if the owner or lawful occupant of a
property demonstrates that the general special exception approval criteria set
forth in chapter 4, article B of this title and the following specific approval
criteria have been satisfied:
            (1)   The situation is peculiar to the property in question;
            (2)   There is practical difficulty in complying with the setback
requirements;
            (3)   Granting the exception will not be contrary to the purpose of
the setback regulations; and
            (4)   Any potential negative effects resulting from the setback
exception are mitigated to the extent practical.
            (5)   The subject building will be located no closer than three
feet (3') to a side or rear property line, unless the side or rear property
line abuts a public right of way or permanent open space.
   C.   Building Bulk Standards:
      1.   Maximum Height:
         a.   Purpose: The height regulations are intended to promote a
reasonable building scale and relationship between buildings; provide options
for light, air, and privacy; and discourage buildings that visually dominate
other buildings in the vicinity.
         b.   General Standards: Generally, the maximum height standards for
structures in multi-family residential zones are stated in
table 2B-2, located at the end of this section. Height standards for accessory
buildings are addressed in chapter 4, article C, "Accessory Uses And
Buildings", of this title.
         c.   Specific Standards:
            (1)   In the multi-family zones, if any portion of a building is
within fifteen feet (15') of a single-family residential zone boundary, then
the portion of the building located within fifteen feet (15') of said zone may
not exceed two and one-half (21/2) stories in height.
            (2)   In the RM-12, RM-20, and RNS-20 zones, if any portion of a
two-family use, multi-family use, group living use, or nonresidential use is
located within fifteen feet (15') of a property that contains an existing
single-family use, then the portion of the building located within fifteen feet
(15') of said property may not exceed two and one-half (21/2) stories in
height.
         d.   Exemptions: If allowed in the subject zone, the following
structures or parts thereof are exempt from the height limitations set forth in
the zones indicated, provided an increase in height does not conflict with
chapter 6, "Airport Zoning", of this title.
            (1)   Chimneys or flues.
            (2)   Spires on religious or other institutional buildings.
            (3)   Cupolas, domes, skylights and other similar roof protrusions
not used for the purpose of obtaining habitable floor space.
            (4)   Farm structures, including barns, silos, storage bins and
similar structures when accessory to an allowed agriculture use.
            (5)   Flagpoles that extend not more than ten feet (10') above the
height limit or not more than five feet (5') above the highest point of the
roof, whichever is less.
            (6)   Parapet or fire walls.
            (7)   Poles, towers and other structures accessory to a basic
utility use, such as street lights and utility poles.
            (8)   If allowed in the subject zone, basic utilities and
communication transmission facilities are exempt from the base zone height
standards, but are subject to any limitations placed by the board of
adjustment.
            (9)   Roof structures, including solar energy systems, elevator
bulkheads, stairways, ventilating fans, cooling towers and similar necessary
mechanical and electrical appurtenances required to operate and maintain the
building.
            (10)   Television antennas and similar apparatus.
         e.   Adjustment Of Height Standards:
            (1)   The maximum height for a principal building may be increased;
provided, that for each foot of height increase above the height standard, the
front, side, and rear setbacks are each increased by an additional two feet
(2'); and provided, that an increase in height does not conflict with the
provisions of chapter 6, "Airport Zoning", of this title.
            (2)   A minor modification may also be requested to adjust the
maximum height for a particular building or property according to the
procedures and approval criteria for minor modifications contained in chapter
4, article B of this title.
      2.   Minimum Building Width:
         a.   Purpose: The minimum building width requirements promote a
reasonable building scale and relationship between dwellings in a neighborhood.
         b.   Standards: The minimum building width requirements for principal
structures in multi-family residential zones are stated in
 table 2B-2, located at the end of this section. A building must be in
compliance with the specified minimum building width for at least seventy five
percent (75%) of the building's length. (See

   D.   Maximum Lot Coverage Standards:
      1.   Total Building Coverage:
         a.   Purpose: The total building coverage standard helps to define the
character of multi-family residential zones by limiting the land area that can
be covered by buildings. These standards work in conjunction with the minimum
lot requirements and building bulk standards to determine how built up a
neighborhood appears.
         b.   Standards: The total building coverage standards for the various
multi-family residential zones are stated in
table 2B-2, located at the end of this section. The maximum building coverage
standard establishes the percentage of the total area of a lot that can be
covered by buildings. The total building area of all buildings on the property,
including both principal and accessory buildings, is used to calculate the
building coverage.
      2.   Front Setback Coverage:
         a.   Purpose: The front setback coverage standard ensures that a
certain portion of the front setback remains free of impervious surface, which
helps to maintain a consistent and pleasant environment along neighborhood
streets. These standards increase public safety by preventing excessive front
yard paving and vehicular storage that may obscure the principal dwelling and
the main entrance from view of the street. In addition, this standard helps to
prevent neighborhood streets that are dominated by front yard pavement,
particularly along frontages with narrow residential lots.
         b.   Standard: The maximum front setback coverage standard for the
multi-family residential zones is stated in
 table 2B-2, located at the end of this section. The table lists the maximum
percentage of the required front setback that may be covered by impervious
surface, including driveways, walkways, patios, decks, and other paved areas.
Front setback coverage may not exceed the percentage indicated in
 table 2B-2, located at the end of this section.
         c.   Exception: A special exception may be requested to increase the
allowed front setback coverage. The board of adjustment may adjust the front
setback coverage standard if the owner or lawful occupant of a property
demonstrates that the general special exception approval criteria and the
following specific approval criteria have been satisfied:
            (1)   The lot is of an irregular shape or contains severe
topography, such that there is practical difficulty meeting the front setback
coverage standard.
            (2)   The applicant has demonstrated that every effort has been
made to design buildings, paved areas, and vehicular use areas to meet the
front setback coverage standard. Such efforts include reducing the width of
driveways, reducing paved areas and size of garages and providing alternative
means of vehicular access to the property. If vehicular access to an alley or
private rear lane is available, the front setback coverage standard may not be
increased.
            (3)   Granting the exception will not be contrary to the purpose of
the front setback coverage regulations.
            (4)   Any potential negative effects resulting from the exception
are mitigated to the extent practical.
   E.   Minimum Open Space Requirements:
      1.   Purpose: The minimum open space requirements are intended to ensure
a minimum amount of private, usable open space is provided to support the
health, well-being and enjoyment of the residents of the dwelling. The intent
of the open space is to support passive recreation, leisure activities,
informal gathering, and opportunities for interaction with nature.
      2.   Minimum Requirements:
         a.   On lots that contain multi-family uses or group living uses,
usable open space shall be provided on each lot at a ratio of ten (10) square
feet per bedroom, but not less than four hundred (400) square feet, located in
one or more clearly defined, compact areas, with each area not less than two
hundred twenty five (225) square feet with no dimension less than fifteen feet
(15').
         b.   On lots that contain detached single family uses, a minimum of
five hundred (500) square feet of usable open space shall be provided, located
in the rear yard with no dimension less than twenty feet (20').
         c.   On lots that contain attached single family uses, a minimum of
one hundred fifty (150) square feet of usable open space shall be provided,
located in the rear yard with no dimension less than ten feet (10').
         d.   On lots that contain two family uses, a minimum of three hundred
(300) square feet of usable open space per dwelling unit shall be provided,
located in one or more clearly defined, compact areas, with each area not less
than three hundred (300) square feet with no dimension less than twelve feet
(12').
      3.   Standards:
         a.   For multi-family uses and group living uses, open space shall
meet the standards as set forth in subsections
14-2G-7E1 through E7 of this chapter.
         b.   For single family uses and two family uses open space shall be
located behind the principal dwelling in an area visible and easily accessible
from the principal dwelling and shall consist of open planted green space,
which may include trees, planters, gardens, and other amenities that support
passive recreation or leisure activities. Paved areas shall not be counted
toward usable open space. For attached single family uses, rooftop or upper
floor open air terraces or rear yard-facing porches, including screened-in
porches (non-habitable space only) may count toward the open space requirement.
      4.   Minor Modification: A minor modification may be requested according
to the provisions and approval criteria of section
14-4B-1, "Minor Modifications", of this title, to reduce the required open
space for single family and two family uses in the following circumstances,
provided the additional approval criteria stated in subsection E4e of this
section, are satisfied. Note that reducing the open space may reduce the
allowed occupancy of a rental property (see title 17, chapter 5, "Housing
Code", of this Code):
         a.   In order to establish up to two (2) off-street parking spaces
(surface parking or in a garage) on a lot that currently has fewer than two (2)
off-street parking spaces; or
         b.   If the lot is a corner lot, is irregular in shape, substandard in
size, or contains severe topography, or other unique circumstance, such that
there is practical difficulty meeting the standard; or
         c.   The lot contains a manufactured home, where due to the shape/
dimensions of the home there is practical difficulty meeting the standard; or
         d.   The lot contains a detached zero lot line dwelling, where the
side yard is designed to serve as usable open space for the dwelling;
         e.   Approval criteria:
            (1)   The applicant has demonstrated that every effort has been
made to design buildings, paved areas, and vehicular use areas to meet the open
space requirement. Such efforts may include but are not limited to reducing the
width of driveways, reducing paved areas and size of new buildings or
additions, and providing alternative means of vehicular access to the property;
and
            (2)   The open space requirement will be satisfied to the extent
possible in another location on the lot, such as a side yard; and
            (3)   Any potential negative effects resulting from the exception
are mitigated to the extent possible.

Notes:
   1.    Non-residential uses must comply with the standards listed in this
table unless specified otherwise in chapter 4, article B, "Minor Modifications,
Variances, Special Exceptions, And Provisional Uses", of this title.
   2.    Minimum side setback is 5 feet for the first 2 stories plus 2 feet for
each additional story. Detached zero lot line dwellings must comply with the
applicable side setback standards in chapter 4, article B of this title.
   3.    A building must be in compliance with the specified minimum building
width for at least 75 percent of the building's length.
   4.    See applicable side setbacks for attached single-family as provided in
chapter 4, article B, "Minor Modifications, Variances, Special Exceptions, And
Provisional Uses", of this title.
   5.    The principal dwelling must be set back at least 15 feet, except on
lots located around the bulb of a cul-de-sac; on such lots the principal
dwelling must be set back at least 25 feet. On all lots, garages, both attached
and detached, must be set back as specified in chapter 4, article C, "Accessory
Uses And Buildings", of this title.
   6.    Minimum lot width is 20 feet for attached units on interior lots and
28 feet for end lots in a row of attached units. When only 2 units are
attached, lots must be 28 feet wide.
   7.    If the single family density bonus options have been applied, the
minimum lot area, lot area per unit, lot width and lot frontage requirements
may be reduced accordingly. (See subsection
14-2B-4A, "Minimum Lot Requirements", of this section.)
   8.    Additional height restrictions may apply on properties adjacent to
single family zones or single family uses. (See subsection
14-2B-4C, "Building Bulk Standards", of this section.)
   9.    See the special provisions of this article regarding minimum lot area
per unit requirements in the RNS-20 Zone.
   10.    The principal building rear setback is 20 feet, except in the Central
Planning District and Downtown Planning District, where the rear setback is
dependent on the depth of the lot. For lots equal to or less than 100 feet in
depth: minimum rear setback = 20 feet. For lots greater than 100 feet in depth:
minimum rear setback = lot depth less 80 feet. For purposes of this provision,
garages located in the rear yard and attached to the principal dwelling with a
(non-habitable) breezeway (8 feet or narrower in width) will be considered
detached accessory buildings and, therefore, are subject to the setback
requirements for detached accessory buildings, rather than principal building
setback requirements. Similarly, subject breezeways shall be treated as
detached accessory structures/buildings.
   11.    May be reduced to 5 feet if rear lot line abuts an alley.
   12.    Open space must comply with standards set forth in subsection
14-2B-4E of this section.
   13.    Outside of the University Impact Area (see map 2B.1 in Section 14-2B-
6), the maximum number of bedrooms may be increased by one (1). Any bedroom
within a multi-family, attached single family, or duplex that exceeds 225
square feet in size or has any horizontal dimension greater than 16 feet shall
count as 2 or more bedrooms, as determined by the City. The maximum number of
bedrooms may be further constrained by the provisions of the title 17, chapter
5, “Housing Code”, of this Code.

Note:
   1.    New bedrooms must be a minimum of 100 square feet in size. However,
for purposes of the provisions within this table, any existing habitable room
that is larger than 70 square feet in size with a horizontal dimension of at
least 7 feet, that meets the egress requirements as specified in the Building
Code, and is not a typical shared living space, such as a living room, dining
area, kitchen, or bathroom will be considered a bedroom.

14-2B-5: MAXIMUM OCCUPANCY FOR HOUSEHOLD LIVING USES:
The residential occupancy of a household living use is limited to one
"household" per dwelling unit, as this term is defined in chapter 9, article A,
"General Definitions", of this title. The residential occupancy of a household
living use is constrained by the provisions of title 17, chapter 5, "Housing
Code", of this Code. Occupancy of properties that are not in compliance with
the minimum Zoning Code requirements may be limited as set forth in subsection
17-5-18S, "Regulation Of Noncompliant Situations", of this Code. (Ord. 18-4744,
4-2-2018)
14-2B-6: MULTI-FAMILY SITE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Purpose: The multi-family site development standards promote safe,
attractive, pedestrian friendly neighborhoods by preventing expanses of
concrete, blank walls and parking lots along street frontages; controlling the
building bulk; screening unsightly features; ensuring that pedestrian entrances
are visible and clearly identifiable from the street; and minimizing potential
conflicts between pedestrians and automobiles.
   B.   Applicability:
      1.   The standards of this section apply to all multi-family uses, group
living uses, and institutional/civic uses located in residential zones and in
the Central Planning District. (See Central Planning District map of this
section.)
      2.   Single-family uses and two-family uses located in a multi- family
zone must comply with the single-family site development standards specified in
chapter 2, article A, "Single-Family Residential Zones", of this title. Two-
family uses located in the Central Planning District must also comply with the
provisions of subsection I, "Additional Standards In Central Planning
District", of this section, which will be administered through the design
review process, as set forth in chapter 8, article B, "Administrative Approval
Procedures", of this title.
      3.   For properties subject to these standards located outside the
Central Planning District, the standards in this section will be administered
through the site plan review process, as set forth in title 18 of this Code.
For properties located in the Central Planning District and the PRM Zone, the
regulations of this section will be administered through the design review
process as set forth in chapter 8, article B, “Administrative Approval
Procedures”, of this title.
      4.   For properties located in a Historic or Conservation District
Overlay Zone, the standards of this section will be administered concurrently
with review of the proposed development by the Historic Preservation
Commission. If the provisions of the Historic or Conservation District Overlay
Zone conflict with the provisions of this section, the provisions of the
Historic or Conservation District Overlay Zone will supersede the provisions of
this section.

   C.   Location And Design Standards For Surface Parking And Detached Garages:
      1.   Location: Surface parking, parking within accessory structures, and
loading areas must be located behind principal building(s) and concealed from
view of fronting streets. Parking and loading areas may not be located directly
between a principal building and the street or within the required side setback
area. Any portion of a parking or loading area that is not completely concealed
from view of a fronting street must be screened to the S2 standard. (See
figures 2B.4 and 2B.5 below.) (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)

      2.   Aisles And Drives: Drives that are internal to a parking area,
including drives that provide circulation around the perimeter of the parking
area are considered part of the parking area and must meet the location
standards for parking areas as stated in subsection C1 of this section, and the
landscape buffering standard as stated in subsection C3 of this section. A
nonhard surfaced drive or aisle that is external to a parking area may not be
located closer than three feet (3') to a lot line, except at the point of
access with a street, alley, or private rear lane. Hard surfaced drives that
are external to a parking area must be set back at least three feet (3') from
any side or rear lot line, except under the following circumstances:
         a.   The drives and aisles are pitched or curbed and drained to
prevent the flow of water onto adjoining property; or
         b.   A drainage course has been established along lot lines to handle
storm water runoff; or
         c.   Any specific location along a side or rear lot line where a drive
is shared with an abutting lot; or
         d.   At the point of access with an alley or private rear lane.
      3.   Landscape Buffering:
         a.   A buffer area at least ten feet (10') in width and landscaped to
at least the S2 standard must be provided between any parking area and adjacent
properties and between any parking area and street rights of way. (See chapter
5, article F, "Screening And Buffering Standards", of this title.) The city may
exempt from this requirement any specific location along a side or rear lot
line where a parking area, aisle or drive is shared with an abutting lot. The
city may also waive the landscape screening requirement where the view from
adjacent properties is or will be blocked by a significant change in grade or
by natural or humanmade features, such that the screening is effectively
provided and the intent of the standard is met, as determined by the building
official.
         b.   A buffer area at least five feet (5') in width and landscaped to
the S1 standard must be provided between any parking area containing more than
eight (8) parking spaces and an adjacent alley.
         c.   No parking area or drive shall be closer than ten feet (10') to
any portion of a building other than a garage entrance or loading area apron.
This ten foot (10') area must be used for walkways and landscaping consisting
of at least fifty percent (50%) vegetative coverage. If parking spaces are
located where headlights of vehicles shine onto a wall containing ground level
windows, said parking spaces must be screened from view of the windows to at
least the S2 standard.
   D.   Building Entrances For Multi-Family And Group Living Uses:
      1.   For residential uses, buildings must have at least one door on the
exterior of the building that provides pedestrian access to dwelling units
within the building. Access to dwelling units must not be solely through a
parking garage.
      2.   When a lot contains one principal building, the building must be
oriented such that at least one facade faces a public or private street. The
street facing facade must have at least one main entrance to the building, or
may contain separate main entrances to ground level dwelling units. If the
building is located on a corner lot, only one wall must meet this requirement.
      3.   When a lot contains two (2) or more principal buildings, the
buildings must be oriented towards a public street, private street, or interior
courtyard. Any building with a street facing facade must have at least one main
entrance oriented toward the street. Buildings located interior to a lot must
have main entrances that are clearly visible from interior private streets/
drives or surface parking areas.
      4.   Main entrances to a building, including main entrances to ground
level individual dwelling units, must be clearly demarcated by one of the
following means: (See
 figure 2B.6, located at the end of this subsection D4.)
         a.   Covered porch or canopy.
         b.   Transom and sidelight windows.
         c.   Pilasters and pediment.
         d.   Other significant architectural treatment that emphasizes main
entrances. Simple trim around the doorway does not meet this standard.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2564.png]
 
      5.   Patio style doors, such as sliding glass doors, may not be used for
main entrance doors.
      6.   To provide for the safety of residents, access to entrance doors of
any individual dwelling units located above the ground level must be provided
from an enclosed lobby or corridor and stairway. Unenclosed or partially
enclosed exterior stairways may not be used as the primary means of access to
dwelling units located above the ground level floor of the building. This
provision does not preclude the use of fire egress structures.
      7.   (Rep. by Ord. 14-4586, 6-3-2014)
      8.   A pedestrian circulation system must be provided that connects
residential entrances to adjacent public rights of way, and to parking areas
and other on site facilities.
   E.   Building Scale:
      1.   Outside the Central Planning District: Street-facing walls that are
greater than fifty feet (50') in length must be articulated with bays,
projections, or recesses (see
figure 2B.7 of this section) according to the following standards:
         a.   Bays and projections must be at least six feet (6') in width and
at least sixteen inches (16") but not more than six feet (6') in depth.
Recesses must be at least six feet (6') in width and have a depth of at least
sixteen inches (16").
         b.   The bays, projections, and recesses must have corresponding
changes in the roofline or, alternatively, must be distinguished by a
corresponding change in some other architectural element(s) of the building,
such as a change in exterior wall materials, a change in window pattern, the
addition of balconies, variation in the building and/or parapet height; or
variation in architectural details, such as decorative banding, reveals, stone
or tile accents.

      2.   Central Planning District: The width of the front facade of new
buildings must be no more than forty feet (40'). Buildings may exceed this
limitation if the horizontal plane of any street- facing facade of the building
is broken into modules that give the appearance of smaller, individual
buildings. (See
 figure 2B.8 of this section.) Each module must meet the following standards:
         a.   Each module must be no greater than thirty feet (30') and no less
than ten feet (10') in width and must be distinguished from adjacent modules by
a variation in the wall plane of at least sixteen inches (16") in depth. For
buildings that are three (3) or more stories in height, the width of the module
may be increased to forty feet (40').
         b.   Each module must have a corresponding change in the roofline.
         c.   Each module must be distinguished from the adjacent module by at
least one of the following means:
            (1)   Variation in material colors, types or textures;
            (2)   Variation in the building and/or parapet height;
            (3)   Variation in the architectural details such as decorative
banding, reveals, stone, or tile accents;
            (4)   Variation in window pattern;
            (5)   Variation in the use of balconies and recesses.

   F.   Balconies And Exterior Stairways, Corridors, And Lifts: For purposes of
this subsection the term, "exterior stairways", refers to stairways that lead
to floors of a building that are above the first or ground level floor of a
building. "Exterior corridors" refers to unenclosed corridors located above the
first or ground level floor of a building. Balconies and exterior stairways,
exterior corridors and exterior lifts must comply with the following standards:
      1.   Exterior stairways, exterior corridors, and exterior lifts are
prohibited in the PRM zone; however, the city may allow exterior fire egress
structures on existing buildings that cannot otherwise reasonably meet code
requirements, provided the fire egress structure is not located on a wall of a
building that faces a street. In other zones, exterior stairways, exterior
corridors, and exterior lifts must be covered with a roof similar in design and
materials to the roof over the rest of the structure. Said roof should be
incorporated into the overall roof plan of the structure. Alternatively, such
features may be recessed into the facade of the building. Exterior corridors
may not be located on a street facing wall of the building or within twenty
feet (20') of a street facing wall.
      2.   Unenclosed or partially enclosed stairways may not be used as the
primary means of access to dwelling units located above the ground level floor
of the building (see subsection
14-2B-6D6 of this section).
      3.   Balconies, exterior stairways, exterior lifts and exterior corridors
may not be located on any side of a building that is adjacent to a property
that is zoned single-family residential or that contains an existing single-
family use. Buildings that are set back at least forty feet (40') from any such
property are exempt from this standard.
      4.   The design of any balcony, exterior stairway, exterior lift and
exterior corridor must utilize columns, piers, supports, walls, and railings
that are designed and constructed of materials that are similar or
complementary to the design and materials used for the rest of the building.

   G.   Building Materials:
      1.   In the central planning district, the exterior wall material of a
building must consist of clapboard style siding, wall shingles, brick, stone,
or stucco.
      2.   In the PRM zone, the exterior walls of the ground level floor of a
building must be constructed with a masonry finish, such as fired brick, stone,
or similar material, not including concrete blocks and undressed poured
concrete. Masonry may include stucco or like material when used in combination
with other masonry finish.
      3.   In the central planning district and in the PRM zone, buildings not
constructed of masonry or stucco must have the following trim elements
incorporated into the exterior design and construction of the building:
         a.   Window and door trim that is not less than three inches (3")
wide.
         b.   Corner boards that are not less than three inches (3") wide,
unless wood clapboards are used and mitered at the corners.
         c.   Frieze boards, not less than five inches (5") wide, located below
the eaves.

      4.   Any portion of a building that is clearly visible from the street
must be constructed using similar materials and design as the front facade.
      5.   Exposed, unpainted or unstained lumber may not be used along any
facade that faces a street side lot line.
      6.   Where an exterior wall material changes along the horizontal plane
of a building, the change must occur on an inside corner of the building.
      7.   Where an exterior wall material changes along the vertical plane of
the building, the materials must be separated by a horizontal band, such as a
belt course, soldier course, band board or other trim to provide a transition
from one material to the other.

   H.   Mechanical Equipment/Utility Meters: In no case shall mechanical
equipment or utility meters be located along the street side of a building.
Mechanical structures must be set back and screened according to the applicable
provisions set forth in chapter 4, article C, "Accessory Uses And Buildings",
of this title.
   I.   Additional Standards In Central Planning District:
      1.   Front Setbacks: The front setback for new buildings must not deviate
more than five feet (5') from the average setback of existing principal
buildings along the same frontage. Alternatively, for frontages that contain
more than six (6) lots, the average may be calculated based on the principal
building setbacks on the four (4) closest lots along the same frontage to the
lot containing the new building. However, a new building shall not be located
closer to the street than the existing principal building that is closest to
the street along the same frontage. This setback standard supersedes the
setback standards of the base zone. Frontages that contain three (3) or fewer
lots are exempt from the provisions of this paragraph.
      2.   Windows And Fenestration: Individual window units that are visible
from a public or private street and that are located in primary living spaces,
such as living rooms, dining areas, and bedrooms, must have a height that is at
least one and one-half (1.5) times greater than the width of the window unit.
Individual window units may be located side by side in a wider window opening.
Bathroom, kitchen, skylights, and decorative windows, such as stained glass and
ocular windows, are not required to meet this standard.

      3.   Architectural Style: The purpose of requiring an architectural style
is to ensure that the mass, roof form, window style and configuration, and the
basic architectural details of a building are generally compatible with the
historic character of the central planning district. New buildings should
appear similar to a large house or a small historic apartment building.
         a.   Any building elevation that is within public view (see definition
of "public view, within" in section
14-9A-1 of this title), must be designed in a manner that is consistent with a
historic architectural style typical of residential buildings in the central
planning district. However, building facades that are visible only from public
alleys are not subject to these standards. The applicable architectural styles
are as follows: Italianate; Queen Anne; colonial revival; craftsman; craftsman
bungalow; American foursquare; prairie school; period revival; and eclectic.
The applicant must indicate in detail how each of the following architectural
elements in the proposed building are consistent with one of these
architectural styles as described in the "Iowa City Historic Preservation
Handbook", as amended:
            (1)   Form and mass of the building;
            (2)   Roof configuration and pitch;
            (3)   Style and placement of windows and doors;
            (4)   Window and door trim, eave boards, frieze boards, and other
trim;
            (5)   Porch and entrance features;
            (6)   Building details and ornamentation.
         b.   Detailed information regarding historic residential building
styles is available in the "Iowa City Historic Preservation Handbook". The
design review committee and the historic preservation commission will use this
information as a means to evaluate new buildings in the central planning
district.
         c.   Alternative designs that have been prepared by a licensed
architect may be acceptable and will be reviewed on a case by case basis.
   J.   Minor Modifications: A minor modification to adjust specific provisions
of this section may be requested in either of the qualifying situations listed
below. Such requests will be reviewed by the design review committee, the
director of planning and community development, and the building official
according to the procedures for minor modifications as set forth in chapter 8,
article B of this title and must meet the following approval criteria. The
following approval criteria are to be applied in lieu of the general approval
criteria listed in section
14-4B-1, "Minor Modifications", of this title:
      1.   Qualifying Situation: The configuration of the lot or other existing
physical condition of the lot makes the application of a specific standard
impractical. In such a case, the applicant must demonstrate that the following
approval criteria are met:
         a.   The applicant must provide evidence that the configuration of the
lot, the topography, or other physical characteristic of the property makes the

14-2B-7: PRM ZONE BONUS AND MINOR ADJUSTMENT PROVISIONS:
   A.   Purpose: The PRM zone bonus provisions provide an incentive for
developments to incorporate features that provide a public benefit and
encourage excellence in architectural design. The PRM zone minor adjustment
provisions allow flexibility to a project in a PRM zone which involves new
construction in conjunction with the preservation of adjacent historic
properties.
   B.   Application: The bonus and minor adjustment provisions will be
administered through the design review process as set forth in chapter 8,
article B, “Administrative Approval Procedures”, of this title. Decisions of
the Design Review Committee may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment. A
project may use either the provisions in C. “Bonus Provisions” or the
provisions in D. “Minor Adjustments” below, but not both.
      1.   Bonus Provisions include allowance of dwelling units in excess of
the density otherwise achievable under the provisions of the base zone,
additional building bulk, and/or reductions of the required setback area.
Bonuses are based on a point system. Points may be awarded for public benefit
features that the design review committee determines are appropriate in design
and location. Bonuses will not be granted for site development features or
standards already required by this title. The number of points allowed for
public benefit features and the number of points required per bonus item are
set forth in C. “Bonus Provisions” below.
      2.   Minor adjustments to dimensional and site development standards may
be allowed for a newly constructed building where the project also preserves a
historic property as set forth in D. “Minor Adjustments” below.

14-2C-1: ESTABLISHMENT AND INTENT OF COMMERCIAL ZONES:
The full names, short names, and map symbols of the established commercial
zones are listed below. When this title refers to the commercial zones, it is
referring to the zones listed below:
   A.   Mixed Use Zone (MU): The purpose of the mixed use zone (MU) is to
provide a transition from commercial and employment centers to less intensive
residential zones. The MU zone permits a mix of uses, including lower scale
retail and office uses, and a variety of residential uses. This mix of uses
requires special consideration of building and site design.
   B.   Commercial Office Zone (CO-1): The purpose of the commercial office
zone (CO-1) is to provide specific areas where office functions, compatible
businesses, apartments and certain public and semipublic uses may be developed
in accordance with the comprehensive plan. The CO-1 zone can serve as a buffer
between residential and more intensive commercial or industrial areas.
   C.   Neighborhood Commercial Zone (CN-1): The purpose of the neighborhood
commercial zone (CN-1) is to promote a unified grouping of small scale retail
sales and personal service uses in a neighborhood shopping area; encourage
neighborhood shopping areas that are conveniently located and that primarily
serve nearby residential neighborhoods; promote pedestrian oriented development
at an intensity level that is compatible with surrounding residential areas;
and promote principles of site design, building articulation, scale and
proportion that are typical of traditional main street design. Allowed uses are
restricted in size to promote smaller, neighborhood serving businesses and to
limit adverse impacts on nearby residential areas. CN-1 zones are generally
located with direct access to an arterial street.
   D.   Highway Commercial Zone (CH-1): The purpose of the highway commercial
zone (CH-1) is to permit development of service uses relating to expressways or
along arterial roadways. At certain access points, food, lodging, motor vehicle
service and fuel can be made conveniently available to the thoroughfare user.
   E.   Intensive Commercial Zone (CI-1): The purpose of the intensive
commercial zone (CI-1) is to provide areas for those sales and service
functions and businesses whose operations are typically characterized by
outdoor display and storage of merchandise, by repair and sales of large
equipment or motor vehicles, by outdoor commercial amusement and recreational
activities or by activities or operations conducted in buildings or structures
not completely enclosed. The types of retail trade in this zone are limited in
order to provide opportunities for more land intensive commercial operations
and also to prevent conflicts between retail and industrial truck traffic.
Special attention must be directed toward buffering the negative aspects of
allowed uses from adjacent residential zones.
   F.   Community Commercial Zone (CC-2): The purpose of the community
commercial zone (CC-2) is to provide for major business districts to serve a
significant segment of the total community population. In addition to a variety
of retail goods and services, these centers may typically feature a number of
large traffic generators requiring access from major thoroughfares. While these
centers are usually characterized by indoor operations, uses may have limited
outdoor activities; provided, that outdoor operations are screened or buffered
to remain compatible with surrounding uses.
   G.   Central Business Service Zone (CB-2): The central business service zone
(CB-2) is intended to allow for the orderly expansion of the central business
district of Iowa City, to serve as a transition between the intense land uses
located in the central business district and adjoining areas, to enhance the
pedestrian orientation of the central area of the city, and to provide
suitable, peripheral locations for auto oriented commercial and service uses.
This zone is intended to accommodate mixed land uses but at a lower intensity
than permitted in the other central business zones.
   H.   Central Business Support Zone (CB-5): The purpose of the central
business support zone (CB-5) is to allow for the orderly expansion of the
central business district in accordance with the comprehensive plan; to serve
as a transition between the intense land uses located in the central business
district and adjoining areas; and to enhance the pedestrian orientation of the
central area of the city. This zone is intended to accommodate mixed land uses,
but at a lower intensity than permitted in the CB-10 district. The mixture of
land uses permitted in this zone requires special consideration of building and
site design. To control traffic and provide for the most efficient use of land
and parking facilities, special consideration of the amount and location of
parking areas is also required. To encourage developments that contain features
providing a public benefit, a bonus in floor area ratio or dwelling unit
density may be granted. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
   I.   Central Business Zone (CB-10): The purpose of the central business zone
(CB-10) is to be the high density, compact, pedestrian oriented shopping,
office, service and entertainment area in Iowa City. Development and
redevelopment in this zone should occur in compact groupings, in order to
intensify the density of usable commercial spaces, while increasing the
availability of open spaces, plazas or pedestrianways. This zone is intended to
accommodate a wide range of retail, service, office and residential uses. Auto
oriented uses are not permitted, except as specifically provided. Consolidated
off street loading and service facilities should be provided wherever practical
with access provided from public service alleys or courts. Private, off street
parking is strictly regulated in order to preserve valuable land for active
building uses and to maintain a pedestrian oriented streetscape. To support a
healthy and vibrant commercial core, development of mixed use buildings with
residential uses located above storefront commercial uses is encouraged. (Ord.
08-4326, 12-22-2008)
14-2C-2: LAND USES ALLOWED:
   A.   Determining Principal Uses Allowed:
      1.   
Table 2C-1, located at the end of this section, indicates whether a principal
land use is permitted (P), allowed with provisions (PR), or allowed by special
exception (S) in a particular commercial zone. A number in superscript
indicates that a special provision applies. See table notes for more
information.
      2.   Specific land uses are grouped into the categories and subgroups
listed in the table. For example, a florist shop is classified as a sales
oriented retail use. To find out how a specific land use is categorized, see
chapter 4, article A, "Use Categories", of this title.
      3.   Provisional uses are allowed, subject to the additional requirements
contained in chapter 4, article B, "Minor Modifications, Variances, Special
Exceptions, And Provisional Uses", of this title.
      4.   Uses listed as special exceptions are allowed only after approval
from the Iowa City board of adjustment. The general approval criteria for
special exceptions are stated in chapter 4, article B of this title, along with
specific approval criteria for most special exception uses.
   B.   Accessory Uses Allowed: Regulations pertaining to accessory uses are
stated in chapter 4, article C, "Accessory Uses And Buildings", of this title.

14-2C-4: DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
The dimensional requirements for the commercial zones are stated in tables 2C-2
(a) and 2C-2(b) of this section. The following subsections describe in more
detail the regulations for each of the dimensional requirements listed in the
tables. Provisional uses and uses allowed by special exception may have
specific dimensional requirements not specified in
tables 2C-2(a) and
2C-2(b) of this section. Approval criteria for these uses are addressed in
chapter 4, article B of this title. Dimensional requirements may be waived or
modified for developments approved through the planned development process (see
chapter 3, article A, “Planned Development Overlay Zone (OPD)”, of this title)
or through the commercial reuse or historic preservation exception as outlined
in section
14-2C-11, “Special Provisions”, of this article.
   A.   Minimum Lot Requirements:
      1.   Purpose: The minimum lot area and width requirements are intended to
ensure that a lot is of a size, width, and frontage that is appropriate for the
uses permitted in the subject zone and will ensure, in most cases, that the
other site development standards of this title can be met. The lot area per
dwelling unit standards control the intensity of use on a lot to ensure
consistency and compatibility of new dwellings with the surrounding
development.
      2.   Standards: Generally, the minimum lot area and width standards for
the various commercial zones are stated in
tables 2C-2(a) and
2C-2(b) of this section. Most commercial zones do not have minimum lot size or
width requirements. However, for mixed commercial/residential buildings, the
number of dwelling units allowed is based on the residential density formulas
as stated in
 table 2C-2(c) of this section.
      3.   Minimum Lot Sizes For Specific Land Uses:
         a.   Provisional uses and uses allowed by special exception may have
specific lot size requirements not specified in
tables 2C-2(a) and
2C-2(b) of this section. Approval criteria for these uses are addressed in
chapter 4, article B, "Minor Modifications, Variances, Special Exceptions, And
Provisional Uses", of this title.
         b.   If a minimum lot size is specified within a zone for a particular
land use or dwelling type, whether permitted, provisional or a special
exception, that use or dwelling type may not be established on a smaller lot,
even if smaller lots are permitted in the subject base zone, except as
permitted under chapter 4, article E, "Nonconforming Situations", of this
title.
   B.   Minimum Setback Requirements For Principal Buildings:
      1.   Purpose: The minimum setback requirements are intended to:
         a.   Maintain light, air, separation for fire protection, and access
for firefighting;
         b.   Provide opportunities for privacy between dwellings;
         c.   Reflect the general building scale and placement of structures in
the city's neighborhoods and commercial areas;
         d.   Promote a reasonable physical relationship between buildings and
between residences; and
         e.   Provide flexibility to site a building so that it is compatible
with buildings in the vicinity.
      2.   General Setback Requirements: Generally, the minimum required
setbacks for principal buildings in commercial zones are stated in tables 2C-2
(a) and 2C-2(b) of this section. The minimum setbacks for principal buildings
create required setback areas within which principal buildings are not allowed,
except for certain building features as specified in this subsection.
      3.   Specific Setback Requirements: The following provisions contain
setback requirements that apply in specific situations:
         a.   Side And Rear Setbacks: (Rep. by Ord. 11-4449, 10-18-2011)
         b.   Lots With Multiple Frontages:
            (1)   On corner lots, no building, structure or planting, unless
specifically exempted, may be located within the vision triangle, as set forth
in chapter 5, article D, "Intersection Visibility Standards", of this title.
            (2)   If a lot fronting on two (2) or more streets is required to
have a front setback, a minimum setback equal to the required front setback
must be provided along all streets, and such setback will be considered a front
setback for purposes of this title.
         c.   Lots With Multiple Buildings: The principal buildings on a lot
must be separated by a horizontal distance of at least ten feet (10').
Buildings containing residential uses must be designed to preserve privacy.
This can be achieved by placement of windows to prevent direct views into the
windows of adjacent residential dwelling units. In addition, balconies and air
conditioning units may not be located along a building wall that is within
twenty feet (20') of a building wall of an adjacent principal building on the
same lot, if the wall of the adjacent building contains window or door openings
into dwelling units. Proximity of building walls will be subject to all current
building code fire protection requirements.
         d.   Lots Adjacent To Residential Zone: Where a side or rear lot line
for a lot in a commercial zone abuts a residential zone, a setback at least
equal to the required setback in the abutting residential zone must be provided
along the residential zone boundary.
         e.   Overlay Zones And Special Districts: If specific setbacks have
been established in a historic or conservation district, a planned development,
or in the central planning district, those setbacks supersede the setback
requirements of the base zone. For properties located in a historic or
conservation district, refer to chapter 3, article B of this title and also the
applicable setback provisions in the Iowa City historic preservation handbook.
For a property located in a planned development overlay zone, refer to the
approved planned development overlay plan for the subject property. For two-
family uses, multi-family uses, group living uses, and institutional/civic uses
located on property in the central planning district, refer to the applicable
setback provisions in section
14-2B-6, "Multi-Family Site Development Standards", of this chapter.
         f.   Setback Averaging: Where at least fifty percent (50%) of the lots
along a frontage are occupied by principal buildings that are located at least
five feet (5') closer to the street than the required front setback, the front
setback may be reduced to the average of the respective setbacks on the
abutting lots. Only the setbacks on the lots that abut each side of the subject
property along the same street may be used to calculate the average. Setbacks
across the street or along a different street frontage may not be used. When
one abutting lot is vacant or if the lot is a corner lot, then the average is
based on the setback of the principal building on the nonvacant lot and the
required front setback for the zone in which the lot is located. (See
figure 2C.1 of this section.)

      4.   Building Features Permitted Within Required Setback Area: The
following building features may extend into the required principal building
setback area, subject to the conditions indicated and provided that location of
such a feature does not violate the provisions of chapter 5, article D,
"Intersection Visibility Standards", of this title. The setback regulations for
detached accessory structures and structures not considered part of the
principal building are addressed in chapter 4, article C, "Accessory Uses And
Buildings", of this title.
         a.   Awnings, uncovered balconies, bay windows, belt courses,
buttresses, canopies, chimneys, cornices, sills, and other similar features
that extend beyond the wall of a principal building may project up to six feet
(6') into the required front or rear setbacks. Except for balconies, bay
windows, and chimneys, all such projecting building features may extend up to
three feet (3') into the required side setback. Balconies and bay windows may
not extend into the required side setback. Chimneys may extend up to two feet
(2') into the required side setback. Projections from the principal building
must in all cases be at least two feet (2') from any side lot line.
         b.   Enclosed porches, covered decks, and covered patios that are
attached to the principal building must comply with the principal building
setbacks of the base zone and may not extend into the required setback area.
Unenclosed and screened-in porches (non-habitable space) may extend up to
fifteen feet (15') into the rear setback, provided they are set back at least
twenty feet (20') from the rear lot line. The standards for uncovered decks and
patios are specified in chapter 4, article C, "Accessory Uses And Buildings",
of this title. Enclosed porches, covered decks, and covered patios that are
attached to an accessory building must comply with the standards for accessory
buildings as specified in chapter 4, article C, "Accessory Uses And Buildings",
of this title.
         c.   Fire escapes may extend into any setback, provided they do not
extend more than three and one-half feet (31/2') into any side setback.
         d.   Stairways that function as the principal means of access to
dwelling units located above the ground or first floor of a building may not
extend into any required setback.
         e.   Stoops and wheelchair ramps that function as a means of access to
the ground or first floor of a building may extend into the rear setback, up to
eight feet (8') into the required front setback, and into the side setback,
provided they are set back at least three feet (3') from any side lot line. In
cases where, due to topography or other site characteristics, a wheelchair ramp
cannot meet this standard, a minor modification may be requested according to
the approval criteria and procedures for minor modifications contained in
chapter 4, article B of this title.
      5.   Adjustments To Principal Building Setback Requirements:
         a.   A minor modification to reduce principal building setback
requirements may be requested according to the approval criteria and procedures
for minor modifications contained in chapter 4, article B of this title.
         b.   A special exception may be requested to reduce principal building
setback requirements beyond what is allowed by minor modification. The Board of
Adjustment may adjust setback requirements if the owner or lawful occupant of a
property demonstrates that the general special exception approval criteria and
the following specific approval criteria have been satisfied:
            (1)   The situation is peculiar to the property in question;
            (2)   There is practical difficulty in complying with the setback
requirements;
            (3)   Granting the exception will not be contrary to the purpose of
the setback regulations; and
            (4)   Any potential negative effects resulting from the setback
exception are mitigated to the extent practical.
            (5)   The subject building will be located no closer than three
feet (3') to a side or rear property line, unless the side or rear property
line abuts a public right of way or permanent open space.
   C.   Building Bulk Standards:
      1.   Height Standards:
         a.   Purpose: The height regulations are intended to promote a
reasonable building scale and relationship between buildings; provide options
for light, air, and privacy; and discourage buildings that visually dominate
other buildings in the vicinity. In the central business zones, there is a
minimum height standard that ensures that buildings are compatible in scale and
that land is used efficiently.
         b.   Standards: Generally, the maximum and minimum height standards
for principal structures in commercial zones are stated in tables 2C-2(a) and
2C-2(b), located at the end of this section. Height standards for accessory
buildings are addressed in chapter 4, article C, "Accessory Uses And
Buildings", of this title.
         c.   Exemptions: If allowed in the subject zone, the following
structures or parts thereof are exempt from the maximum height standards,
provided an increase in height does not conflict with chapter 6, "Airport
Zoning", of this title:
            (1)   Chimneys or flues.
            (2)   Spires on religious or other institutional buildings.
            (3)   Cupolas, domes, skylights and other similar roof protrusions
not used for the purpose of obtaining habitable floor space.
            (4)   Farm structures, including barns, silos, storage bins and
similar structures when accessory to an allowed agriculture use.
            (5)   Flagpoles that extend not more than ten feet (10') above the
height limit or not more than five feet (5') above the highest point of the
roof, whichever is less.
            (6)   Grain elevators.
            (7)   Parapet or fire walls.
            (8)   Poles, towers and other structures accessory to a basic
utility use, such as streetlights and utility poles.
            (9)   If allowed in the subject zone, basic utilities and
communication transmission facilities are exempt from the base zone height
standards, but are subject to any limitations set forth in chapter 4, article
B, "Minor Modifications, Variances, Special Exceptions, And Provisional Uses",
of this title.
            (10)   Roof structures, including solar energy systems, elevator
bulkheads, stairways, ventilating fans, cooling towers and similar necessary
mechanical and electrical appurtenances required to operate and maintain the
building.
            (11)   Stacks.
            (12)   Storage tanks and water towers.
            (13)   Television antennas and similar apparatus.
         d.   Adjustment Of Maximum Height Standards:
            (1)   The maximum height for a principal building may be increased;
provided, that for each foot of height increase above the height standard, the
front, side, and rear setbacks are each increased by an additional two feet
(2'); and provided, that an increase in height does not conflict with the
provisions of chapter 6, "Airport Zoning", of this title.
            (2)   In the CO-1 zone, principal buildings on lots across the
street from RM, C, or I zones may be increased in height according to
subsection C1d(1) of this section; except, that an additional front setback
need not be provided. The requirement for additional side and rear setbacks
apply. However, the minimum separation between the building and the front lot
line of the lot across the street must be two feet (2') for each foot of
height.
            (3)   A minor modification may also be requested to adjust the
maximum height for a particular building or property according to the
procedures and approval criteria for minor modifications contained in chapter
4, article B of this title.
            (4)   In the CO-1 zone, hospitals are exempt from the FAR limit and
may exceed the height limit up to a maximum of sixty five feet (65'), provided
that along lot lines that abut or are across the street from a single-family
residential zone, building facades above the third story shall be stepped back
at least twenty feet (20') from the third story facade. This required upper
story facade stepback may be established at a lower story, provided that it is
established at least twenty five feet (25') in height above grade.
      2.   Maximum Floor Area Ratio:
         a.   Purpose: The floor area ratio or FAR regulates how intensely a
site may be used. The FAR provides a means to match the potential amount of use
with the desired character of the area and the provision of public services.
The FAR, along with the height and setback standards, control the overall bulk
of development on a site.
         b.   Standards: The floor area ratio or FAR listed in
 table 2C-2(a) of this section, is the amount of floor area within the building
or buildings on a lot in relation to the amount of lot area, expressed in
square feet. For example, if the maximum FAR is 2, then a lot may contain up to
two (2) square feet of building floor area for every one square foot of lot
area. Basement and cellar floor area is not included in this calculation.
   D.   Maximum Lot Coverage Standards:
      1.   Total Building Coverage:
         a.   Purpose: The total building coverage standard helps to define the
character of the mixed use zone by limiting the land area that can be covered
by buildings. These standards work in conjunction with the minimum lot
requirements and building bulk standards to determine how built up a
neighborhood appears.
         b.   Standard: The total building coverage standard for the MU zone is
stated in
 table 2C-2(b) of this section. The maximum building coverage standard
establishes the percentage of the total area of a lot that can be covered by
buildings. The total building area of all buildings on the property, including
both principal and accessory buildings, is used to calculate the building
coverage.
      2.   Front Setback Coverage:
         a.   Purpose: The front setback coverage standard ensures that a
certain portion of the front setback remains free of impervious surface, which
helps to maintain a consistent and pleasant environment along neighborhood
streets. These standards increase public safety by preventing excessive front
yard paving and vehicular storage that may obscure the principal dwelling and
the main entrance from view of the street. In addition, this standard helps to
prevent neighborhood streets that are dominated by front yard pavement,
particularly along frontages with narrow residential lots.
         b.   Standard: The maximum front setback coverage standard for the
mixed use zone is stated in
 table 2C-2(b) of this section. The standard applies only to residential uses
in the MU zone. The table lists the maximum percentage of the required front
setback that may be covered by impervious surface, including driveways, patios,
decks, and other paved areas. Front setback coverage may not exceed the
percentage indicated in
table 2C-2(b) of this section.
         c.   Exception: A special exception may be requested to increase the
allowed front setback coverage. The board of adjustment may adjust the front
setback coverage standard if the owner or lawful occupant of a property
demonstrates that the general special exception approval criteria and the
following specific approval criteria have been satisfied:
            (1)   The lot is of an irregular shape or contains severe
topography, such that there is practical difficulty meeting the front setback
coverage standard.
            (2)   The applicant has demonstrated that every effort has been
made to design buildings, paved areas, and vehicular use areas to meet the
front setback coverage standard. Such efforts include reducing the width of
driveways, reducing paved areas and size of garages and providing alternative
means of vehicular access to the property. If vehicular access to an alley or
private rear lane is available, the front setback coverage standard may not be
increased.
            (3)   Granting the exception will not be contrary to the purpose of
the front setback coverage regulations.
            (4)   Any potential negative effects resulting from the exception
are mitigated to the extent practical.
   E.   Minimum Open Space Requirements:
      1.   Purpose: The minimum open space requirements are intended to ensure
a minimum amount of private, usable open space is provided to support the
health, well-being and enjoyment of the residents of the dwelling. The intent
of the open space is to support passive recreation, leisure activities,
informal gathering, and opportunities for interaction with nature.
      2.   Minimum Requirements:
         a.   On lots that contain multi-family uses or group living uses,
usable open space shall be provided on each lot at a ratio of ten (10) square
feet per bedroom, but not less than four hundred (400) square feet, located in
one or more clearly defined, compact areas, with each area not less than two
hundred twenty five (225) square feet with no dimension less than fifteen feet
(15').
         b.   On lots that contain detached single family uses, a minimum of
five hundred (500) square feet of usable open space shall be provided, located
in the rear yard with no dimension less than twenty feet (20').
         c.   On lots that contain attached single family uses, a minimum of
one hundred fifty (150) square feet of usable open space shall be provided,
located in the rear yard with no dimension less than ten feet (10').
         d.   On lots that contain two family uses, a minimum of three hundred
(300) square feet of usable open space per dwelling unit shall be provided,
located in one or more clearly defined, compact areas, with each area not less
than three hundred (300) square feet with no dimension less than twelve feet
(12').
      3.   Standards:
         a.   For multi-family uses and group living uses, open space shall
meet the standards as set forth in subsections
14-2G-7E1 through E7 of this chapter.
         b.   For single family uses and two family uses open space shall be
located behind the principal dwelling in an area visible and easily accessible
from the principal dwelling and shall consist of open planted green space,
which may include trees, planters, gardens, and other amenities that support
passive recreation or leisure activities. Paved areas shall not be counted
toward usable open space. For attached single family uses, rooftop or upper
floor open air terraces or rear yard-facing porches, including screened-in
porches (non-habitable space only) may count toward the open space requirement.
      4.   Minor Modification: A minor modification may be requested according
to the provisions and approval criteria of section
14-4B-1, "Minor Modifications", of this title, to reduce the required open
space for single family and two family uses in the following circumstances,
provided the additional approval criteria stated in subsection E4e of this
section, are satisfied. Note that reducing the open space may reduce the
allowed occupancy of a rental property (see title 17, chapter 5, "Housing
Code", of this Code):
         a.   In order to establish up to two (2) off-street parking spaces
(surface parking or in a garage) on a lot that currently has fewer than two (2)
off-street parking spaces; or
         b.   If the lot is a corner lot, is irregular in shape, substandard in
size, or contains severe topography, or other unique circumstance, such that
there is practical difficulty meeting the standard; or
         c.   The lot contains a manufactured home, where due to the shape/
dimensions of the home there is practical difficulty meeting the standard; or
         d.   The lot contains a detached zero lot line dwelling, where the
side yard is designed to serve as usable open space for the dwelling;
         e.   Approval criteria:
            (1)   The applicant has demonstrated that every effort has been
made to design buildings, paved areas, and vehicular use areas to meet the open
space requirement. Such efforts may include but are not limited to reducing the
width of driveways, reducing paved areas and size of new buildings or
additions, and providing alternative means of vehicular access to the property;
and
            (2)   The open space requirement will be satisfied to the extent
possible in another location on the lot, such as a side yard; and
            (3)   Any potential negative effects resulting from the exception
are mitigated to the extent possible.

Notes:
   1.    A side setback or rear setback is not required where the side lot line
or rear lot line abuts a nonresidential zone. However, where a side lot line or
rear lot line abuts a residential zone, a setback at least equal to the
required setback in the abutting residential zone must be provided along the
residential zone boundary.
   2.    Maximum height is 22 feet for one-story buildings, with the following
exception: One-story buildings may exceed 22 feet in height if there are
clerestory windows facing the street that give the appearance of second floor
space. The maximum height for all other buildings is 35 feet.
   3.    Maximum FAR is 3, except for lots that abut or are across the street
from a single-family residential zone, in which case the maximum FAR is 1.
Hospitals are exempt from the FAR limit in the CO-1 Zone.
   4.    A front setback is not required, except for buildings that front on
Burlington Street. Buildings must be set back at least 10 feet from the
Burlington Street right- of-way. Building columns supporting upper stories may
be located within this 10 foot setback, provided an adequate pedestrian
passageway is maintained.
   5.    Maximum FAR is 3, except for lots with an approved FAR bonus. For lots
with approved FAR bonuses, the FAR may be increased up to a maximum of 5.
   6.    Maximum FAR is 10, except for lots with an approved FAR bonus. For
lots with approved FAR bonuses, the FAR may be increased up to a maximum of 15.
   7.    Maximum FAR is 2, except for lots with an approved FAR bonus. For lots
with approved FAR bonuses, the FAR may be increased up to a maximum of 3.
   8.    Additional height is allowed under certain circumstances. See
subsection C1d(2) of this section.
   9.    Open space must comply with standards set forth in subsection
14-2C-4E of this section.
   10.   Outside of the University Impact Area (see map 2B.1 in Section
14-2B-6), the maximum number of bedrooms may be increased by one (1). Any
bedroom within a multi-family, attached single family, or duplex that exceeds
225 square feet in size or has any horizontal dimension greater than 16 feet
shall count as 2 or more bedrooms, as determined by the City. The maximum
number of bedrooms may be further constrained by the provisions of the title
17, chapter 5, "Housing Code", of this Code.

Notes:
   1.    Nonresidential uses must comply with the standards listed in this
table unless specified otherwise in chapter 4, article B, "Minor Modifications,
Variances, Special Exceptions, And Provisional Uses", of this title.
   2.    Minimum side setback is 5 feet for the first 2 stories, plus 2 feet
for each additional story. For detached zero lot line dwellings, see applicable
setback regulations in chapter 4, article B of this title.
   3.    See applicable setback requirements in chapter 4, article B, "Minor
Modifications, Variances, Special Exceptions, And Provisional Uses", of this
title.
   4.    Minimum lot width is 20 feet for attached units on interior lots and
28 feet for end lots in a row of attached units. When only 2 units are
attached, lots must be 28 feet wide.
   5.    Maximum height is 35 feet. However, if any portion of a two-family
use, multi-family use, group living use, or a nonresidential use is located
within 15 feet of a property that contains an existing single-family use or
within 15 feet of a single-family zone boundary, then the portion of the
building located within 15 feet of said property or boundary may not exceed 21/
2 stories in height.
   6.    Minimum principal building setback is 5 feet. Maximum principal
building setback is 15 feet. See subsection
14-2C-9D, "Maximum Setback", of this article.
   7.    Open space must comply with standards set forth in subsection
14-2C-4E of this section.
   8.   Outside of the University Impact Area (see map 2B.1 in Section
14-2B-6), the maximum number of bedrooms may be increased by one (1). Any
bedroom within a multi-family, attached single family, or duplex that exceeds

         a.   Drives that are internal to a parking area, including drives that
provide circulation around the perimeter of a parking area, are considered part
of the parking area and must meet the setback standards as specified above.
Drives that are external to a parking area must be set back at least three feet
(3') from any abutting property that is zoned nonresidential, unless the drive
is pitched or curbed and drained to prevent the flow of water onto adjoining
property or unless a drainage course has been established along lot lines to
handle stormwater runoff. Any specific locations along a side or rear lot line
where a drive is shared with an abutting lot may be exempted from these
standards.
         b.   Drives that are external to a parking area must be set back at
least ten feet (10') from any abutting property that is zoned residential.
   E.   Drive-Through Facilities: Drive-through facilities are regulated as an
accessory use and are only allowed in certain zones according to the provisions
specified for drive-through facilities in chapter 4, article C, "Accessory Uses
And Buildings", of this title.
   F.   Pedestrian, Bicycle, And Vehicular Circulation: The site must be
designed to promote safe and convenient pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicular

from view of public rights of way to at least the S2 standard. (See chapter 5,
article F, "Screening And Buffering Standards", of this title.)
      3.   Surface parking areas, loading areas, and drives must be screened
from view of abutting properties to at least the S2 standard. Additional
screening is required for properties that abut properties zoned residential.
Parking areas, loading areas, and drives must be screened from view of any
abutting property zoned residential to at least the S3 standard. The city may
exempt from this landscaping requirement any specific locations along a side or
rear lot line where a parking or loading area, aisle or drive is shared with an
abutting lot.
      4.   Where a lot occupied by a commercial or industrial use abuts or is
across a street or railroad right of way from a residential zone, daycare use,
educational facility, parks and open space use, or the Iowa River, any parking
and loading areas and outdoor work and storage areas must be located behind
buildings or screened from view of said uses and zones to at least the S3
standard. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
      5.   Screening may be waived by the building official where the view is
or will be blocked by a significant change in grade or by natural or humanmade
features, such that the screening is effectively provided and the intent of the
standard is met, as determined by the building official. (Ord. 06-4245, 12-12-
2006)
   H.   Mechanical Structures: All mechanical structures must be set back and
screened from public view according to the applicable provisions set forth in

permitted in the CO-1 or CC-2 zone, except for the following: (Ord. 11-4450,
10-18-2011)
         a.   Outdoor display of merchandise for immediate sale is permitted in
areas immediately adjacent to a principal building. However, the display area
may not be located along any building wall that is within twenty feet (20') of
a public street and may not be located in a manner that obstructs building
entrances and exits, sidewalks, bicycle parking areas, pedestrian routes, or
vehicular use areas.
         b.   An approved temporary use. A temporary use permit is required.
(See chapter 4, article D of this title.)
         c.   In the CC-2 zone, an approved outdoor storage and display
oriented retail use.
      2.   CH-1 And CI-1 Zones:
         a.   Outdoor storage of materials in the CH-1 and CI-1 zones is
permitted, provided it is concealed from public view to the extent possible. If
it is not feasible to conceal the storage areas behind buildings, the storage
areas must be set back at least twenty feet (20') from any public right of way,
including public trails and open space, and screened from view to at least the
S3 standard. (See chapter 5, article F, "Screening And Buffering Standards", of
this title.) If a fence is built around the storage area, the required
screening must be located between the fence and the public right of way.
         b.   All outdoor storage areas that are located along a side or rear
lot line that does not abut a public right of way must be set back at least ten

to at least the S3 standard. If a fence is built around the storage area, the
required screening must be located between the fence and the adjacent property.
         c.   The landscape screening requirement for outdoor storage areas may
be waived by the building official upon presentation of convincing evidence
that a planting screen cannot be expected to thrive because of intense shade,
soil conditions, or other site characteristics. The presence of existing
pavement, by itself, shall not constitute convincing evidence. If the landscape
screening requirement is waived by the building official, a fence built to the
S5 standard must be substituted for the landscape screening.
         d.   Outdoor display of merchandise for immediate sale is permitted in
the CH-1 and CI-1 zones, provided it is set back at least ten feet (10') from
public rights of way and landscaped to at least the S1 standard.
         e.   Any outdoor display area located along a side or rear lot line
that does not abut a public right of way must be set back at least ten feet
(10') from said lot line and screened from view of abutting properties to at
least the S2 standard. If the display area is adjacent to a residential zone
boundary, it has to be screened to the S3 standard.
         f.   The landscape screening requirement for outdoor display may be
waived by the building official upon presentation of convincing evidence that a
planting screen cannot be expected to thrive because of intense shade, soil
conditions, or other site characteristics. The presence of existing pavement,
by itself, shall not constitute convincing evidence. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
         g.   Screening for outdoor storage and display areas may be waived by
the building official where the view is or will be blocked by a significant
change in grade or by natural or humanmade features, such that screening is
effectively provided and the intent of the standard is met, as determined by
the building official. (Ord. 06-4245, 12-12-2006)
      3.   All Commercial Zones: The storage of combustible or flammable

from a side lot line.
      3.   The design of any balcony must utilize columns, piers, supports,
walls, and railings that are designed and constructed of materials that are
similar or complementary to the design and materials used for the rest of the
building. Unpainted and unstained lumber is not permitted.
   K.   Standards For Large Retail Uses:
      1.   Applicability: The provisions of this subsection apply to retail
uses over fifty thousand (50,000) square feet in size. The intent of these
standards is to facilitate adaptive reuse of large retail commercial
structures, to moderate scale of large buildings, and to ensure consistent
appearance with other shopping center developments.
      2.   Facades And Exterior Walls:
         a.   Facades over one hundred feet (100') in length that are visible
from public streets and/or include public entrances shall incorporate wall
projections or recesses a minimum of three feet (3') in depth for a minimum of
twenty (20) contiguous feet within each one hundred feet (100') of facade
length. Such recesses and/or projections shall extend over a minimum of twenty
percent (20%) of the length of the facade, and no uninterrupted facade may
exceed one hundred feet (100') in length.
         b.   For facades that face public streets or include public entrances,
features that provide visual interest such as arcades, storefront windows that
allow views into the interior of the building, display windows that are set
into the building wall, entry areas, awnings or similar features must be
incorporated along at least sixty percent (60%) of the facade. (Ord. 05-4186,
12-15-2005)
      3.   Building Details: Buildings must include details and features that

provide a cohesive pattern to the building. Any building facade that faces a
public street or includes a public entrance shall include no less than three
(3) of the elements listed below. At least one of these elements shall occur
along the vertical plane of the building. An example of a change that occurs on
the vertical plane would be a change from stone on the lower portion of the
building to stucco on the upper portion. All elements that occur along the
horizontal plane of the building shall repeat at intervals of no more than
fifty feet (50'). These visual patterns must be cohesive with the articulation
of the facade.
         a.   Color change.
         b.   Texture change.
         c.   Material module change.
         d.   Expression of an architectural or structural bay through a change
in plane no less than twelve inches (12") in width, such as an offset, reveal

      4.   Roof Details:
         a.   Flat roofs must incorporate parapets that conceal rooftop
equipment such as HVAC units from public view. The average height of such
parapets shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the height of the supporting
wall and at no point shall exceed one- third (1/3) of the height of the
supporting wall. Such parapets shall feature a three-dimensional cornice
treatment.
         b.   Sloping roofs must not exceed the average height of the
supporting walls and must include overhanging eaves that extend no less than
three feet (3') past the supporting walls.
         c.   The roof of the building must be designed with three (3) or more
roof slope planes. It is encouraged that changes in the roof correspond with
articulation of the building facade. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
      5.   Building Materials:
         a.   The building materials shall be predominantly quality exterior
building materials, including brick, masonry, stone, stucco, or textured
concrete masonry units. Concrete panels with a veneer of brick or masonry may
be approved provided the material gives the appearance of one or more of the
high quality building materials listed above. Stamped concrete panels will only
be considered if they are finished with patterns and colors such that they
appear to be brick or masonry. "Predominantly" is defined as at least seventy
five percent (75%) of the exterior of the entire building, but not necessarily
of each building wall. For example, use of such materials should be
concentrated along building walls that are visible from public streets or that
contain public entrances.
         b.   Use of smooth faced concrete block, unadorned tilt-up concrete
panels, prefabricated steel or vinyl panels or sheets should be minimized. If
used, these materials may cover no more than twenty five percent (25%) of the
exterior of the entire building and should be reserved for building walls that
are less visible to the public. (Ord. 06-4220, 7-18-2006)

and/or places for sitting. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-2C-7: CN-1 ZONE SITE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Purpose: The CN-1 zone site development standards ensure that
commercial development is compatible in scale and intensity to the surrounding
residential neighborhoods. These standards also ensure that neighborhood
commercial areas are carefully designed to be inviting for pedestrians by
requiring buildings to be located close to and oriented toward streets or
pedestrian plazas; ensuring that pedestrian routes are clearly separated from
driveways and parking areas; requiring that buildings be constructed with
street level storefront windows and clearly demarcated pedestrian entrances;
and by requiring that parking be located away from the street in well
landscaped areas.
   B.   Applicability:
      1.   The standards of this section apply to all new development in a CN-
1 zone.
      2.   Exceptions to the standards and requirements of this section may be
approved during the site plan review process in CN-1 zones that were in
existence and at least partially developed by June 7, 2002, if the city
determines that compliance with the subject standard or requirement is not
feasible. However, all proposed development must meet the standards of this
section to the extent possible.
      3.   Alternative design solutions may be approved during the site plan
review process if it is demonstrated that the alternative design solution meets
the intent of this section.
   C.   CN-1 Site Plan Review Procedure:

must participate in a preapplication conference with the director of planning
and community development or designee to discuss the application of the CN-
1 zone site development standards to the subject property.
      2.   Review for compliance with the standards and requirements of this
section will occur concurrently and as a part of the site plan review process.
   D.   Rezoning To CN-1:
      1.   A CN-1 zoning district may not exceed ten (10) acres in size.
      2.   A plan showing the general design of the proposed development must
be submitted with any CN-1 rezoning application. The plan must include
provisions for landscaping, screening and buffering between the proposed
commercial development and adjacent residential zones.
   E.   Build-To Line: The required build-to line in the CN-1 zone is an
imaginary line running parallel to and located five feet (5') back from the
street-side lot line along the subject lot's primary street frontage. The
primary street frontage is the frontage to which the street address is
assigned.
      1.   Requirement: All new buildings must be located such that at least
sixty five percent (65%) of the primary street frontage of the subject lot
contains buildings set back no further than the build-to line.
      2.   Exceptions: Exceptions to the build-to line requirement may be
approved during the site plan review process for the following site elements:
         a.   Building facades that are recessed in accordance with the
articulation standard in subsection M of this section.
         b.   Building entrances, including stoops, stairways, and ramps.
         c.   Trees and landscaping.

      1.   No more than thirty five percent (35%) of the street frontage of a
lot may be comprised of off street parking spaces, drives, and aisles located
in front of a building. Loading areas are not permitted in front of the
building. For purposes of this provision, "in front of the building" means
between the street right of way line and the building.
      2.   On corner lots, no off street parking spaces may be located in front
of a building within one hundred feet (100') of the point of intersection of
street right of way lines.
      3.   Parking and loading areas must be set back at least twenty feet
(20') from any street-side lot line and at least five feet (5') from any
nonstreet-side or rear lot line, unless the lot abuts a residential zone.
Parking areas must be set back at least twenty feet (20') from any rear or side
lot line that abuts a residential zone.
      4.   Loading spaces must be located so that trucks or vans loading or
unloading do not back onto or out of a street.
      5.   Drives that are internal to a parking area, including drives that
provide circulation around the perimeter of a parking area, are considered part
of the parking area and must meet the setback standards as specified above.
Drives that are external to a parking area must be set back at least three feet
(3') from any abutting property that is zoned nonresidential, unless the drive
is pitched or curbed and drained to prevent the flow of water onto adjoining
property or unless a drainage course has been established along lot lines to
handle storm water runoff. Any specific locations along a side or rear lot line
where a drive is shared with an abutting lot may be exempted from these
standards.
      6.   Drives that are external to a parking area must be set back at least
twenty feet (20') from any abutting property that is zoned residential.

      1.   Pedestrian access must be provided to adjacent residential areas and
to abutting rights of way. The sidewalks provided on site must connect to
adjacent public sidewalks and trails.
      2.   Each commercial tenant space must be accessible from other tenant
spaces by sidewalks or other approved pedestrian routes. Pedestrian routes must
be continuous, clear of obstructions, and easily identifiable as a protected
pedestrian route.
      3.   Pedestrian routes must be separated from parking and vehicular use
areas by curbs, landscaping or other physical barriers. When pedestrian paths
cross drives, aisles, and vehicle travel lanes, they must be clearly identified
with materials such as textured or brick paving, and must be integrated into
the wider network of pedestrian walkways. Pavement textures are encouraged
elsewhere in the parking lot as surface materials or as accents.
      4.   Parking lot layout and design must promote safe and convenient
pedestrian and vehicular circulation. Protected pedestrian walkways, leading to
sidewalks that abut store entrances, must be provided within parking lots.
      5.   Bicycle parking facilities must be located in convenient areas of
the development and must be located so as not to impede pedestrian or vehicular
traffic.
   I.   Landscaping And Screening:
      1.   All areas of the site that are not used for buildings, parking,
vehicular and pedestrian access, sidewalk cafes and plazas must be landscaped
with trees and plant materials. A landscaping plan must be submitted for site
plan review.
      2.   Parking areas, loading areas, and drives must be screened from
public rights of way to at least the S2 standard. (See chapter 5, article F,
"Screening And Buffering Standards", of this title.)

landscaping requirement any specific locations along a side or rear lot line
where a parking area, aisle or drive is shared with an abutting lot. (Ord. 05-
4186, 12-15-2005)
      4.   Screening may be waived by the building official where the view is
or will be blocked by a significant change in grade or by natural or humanmade
features, such that screening is effectively provided and the intent of the
standard is met, as determined by the building official. (Ord. 06-4245, 12-12-
2006)
   J.   Mechanical Structures: All mechanical structures must be set back and
screened from public view according to the applicable provisions set forth in

14-2C-8: CENTRAL BUSINESS SITE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Purpose: The following site development standards are intended to help
ensure that the city's central business district develops as an attractive,
compact urban area. The standards ensure that parking facilities are integrated
into the design of developments so that streets are safe and attractive for
pedestrians. Particular attention is focused on street level building facades
in order to prevent fortresslike facades, monotonous streetscapes, and to
enhance public safety by providing opportunities for surveillance of the street
from the interior of buildings. Excellence in design is encouraged in order to
enhance and maintain economic development opportunities in the downtown area.
(Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
   B.   Applicability And Procedure: The standards of this section apply to all
development in the CB-2, CB-5, and CB-10 zones, unless otherwise noted herein.
   C.   Site Plan Review Procedure:
      1.   Prior to submitting a request for site plan review, the developer
must participate in a preapplication conference with the director of planning
and community development or designee to discuss the application of the central
business site development standards to the subject property. (Ord. 11-4450, 10-
18-2011)
      2.   Review for compliance with the standards and requirements of this
section will occur concurrently and as a part of the site plan review process.
      3.   Alternative design solutions may be approved if it is demonstrated
that the alternatives meet the intent of this section.
   D.   Minimum Setback:
      1.   A setback is not required, except for buildings that abut Burlington
Street.
      2.   The first story of buildings that abut Burlington Street must be set
back ten feet (10') from the right of way line. Building columns supporting
upper stories may be located within this ten foot (10') setback; provided, that
an adequate pedestrian passageway is maintained.
      3.   Doorways adjacent to a right of way must be set back so that doors
do not swing into a right of way. Similarly, stairways and ramps must not be
located in a right of way. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
   E.   Maximum Setback:
      1.   No portion of the first story of a building shall be set back more
than twelve feet (12') from a front or street-side lot line, or a lot line that

18-2011)
      2.   In the CB-10 zone, to prevent unsafe, unkempt spaces between
buildings, the first two (2) stories of a building must be built to the side
lot line, unless the subject building wall abuts an alley or usable outdoor
space, such as a plaza, green, courtyard, or midblock pedestrian passage. Minor
adjustments to this standard may be approved by the building official to
account for irregular lot lines or to accommodate structural requirements, such
as installing footings or foundations, or to maintain the structural integrity
of an adjacent building, as long as the intent of this standard is achieved.
(Ord. 11-4450, 10-18-2011)
   F.   Parking In CB-10 Zone: Off street parking is strictly regulated in the
CB-10 zone according to the procedures and standards listed in chapter 5,

         c.   Parking and loading areas must be set back at least ten feet
(10') from any rear or side lot line that abuts a residential zone. (Ord. 05-
4186, 12-15-2005)
      2.   Drives:
         a.   Vehicular access to parking should be located and designed to
minimize traffic congestion and hazards to pedestrians and to preserve street
frontages for active building uses. If available, alley or rear lane access is
preferred. If alley access is not feasible due to topographical limitations or
other unique circumstances, driveway access from a street may be allowed, but
must be designed in a manner that will best meet the objectives listed in this
subsection G2a. (Ord. 06-4220, 7-18-2006)
         b.   Drives that are internal to a parking area, including drives that
provide circulation around the perimeter of a parking area are considered part
of the parking area and must meet the location standards for parking areas as
specified above. Drives that are external to a parking area must be set back at
least three feet (3') from any abutting property that is zoned nonresidential,
unless the drive is pitched or curbed and drained to prevent the flow of water
onto adjoining property or unless a drainage course has been established along
lot lines to handle stormwater runoff. Any specific locations along a side or
rear lot line where a drive is shared with an abutting lot may be exempted from
these standards.
         c.   Drives that are external to a parking area must be set back at
least ten feet (10') from any abutting property that is zoned residential.
(Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)

chapter 5, article F, "Screening And Buffering Standards", of this title.)
Parking areas, loading areas, and drives must be screened from view of abutting
properties to at least the S2 standard. Additional screening is required for
properties that abut properties zoned residential. Parking areas, loading
areas, and drives must be screened from view of any abutting property zoned
residential to at least the S3 standard. The city may exempt from this
landscaping requirement any specific locations along a side or rear lot line
where a parking area, aisle or drive is shared with an abutting lot. (Ord. 05-
4186, 12-15-2005; amd. Ord. 11-4450, 10-18-2011)
         b.   Screening may be waived by the building official where the view
is or will be blocked by a significant change in grade or by natural or
humanmade features, such that screening is effectively provided and the intent
of the standard is met, as determined by the building official. (Ord. 06-4245,
12-12-2006; amd. Ord. 11-4450, 10-18-2011)
   H.   Landscaping: All areas of the site that are not used for buildings,

      2.   To encourage commercial activity at the street level, entrances to
storefronts must be at grade and the ground level floor height should be no
more than one foot (1') above the level of the abutting sidewalk or pedestrian
plaza. On sloping building sites and for existing buildings, the city may
adjust this requirement. However, on sloping sites at least a portion of the
ground level floor height of any new building must be located no more than one
foot (1') above the level of the abutting sidewalk or pedestrian plaza; and the
floor height of the ground level floor of the building must be no more than
three feet (3') above the level of the abutting public sidewalk or pedestrian
plaza at any point along a street-facing building facade.
      3.   To provide safe access for residents within a mixed use building,
any building containing a residential use must have at least one door located
on the exterior of the building that provides pedestrian access to the dwelling
units within the building. Said entrance must be located on a building wall
that faces a street, public sidewalk, or pedestrian plaza and is visible from

14-2C-9: SITE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS IN MU ZONE:
   A.   Purpose: The following site development standards help commercial and
residential uses coexist in a mixed use zone by ensuring that buildings are
similar in scale and are designed in a manner that will allow buildings to be
used for a variety of land uses over time. These standards ensure that building
sites are designed to be inviting for pedestrians by requiring buildings to be
located close to and oriented toward streets or pedestrian plazas; requiring
that buildings be constructed with street level storefront windows and clearly
demarcated pedestrian entrances; and by requiring that parking be located away
from the street and screened by landscaping.
   B.   Applicability And Procedure: The standards of this section apply to all
development in the mixed use zone.
   C.   MU Zone Site Plan Review Procedure:
      1.   Prior to submitting a request for site plan review, the developer
must participate in a preapplication conference with the director of planning
and community development or designee to discuss the application of the MU site
development standards to the subject property.
      2.   Review for compliance with the standards and requirements of this
section will occur concurrently and as a part of the site plan review process.
      3.   Alternative design solutions may be approved if it is demonstrated
that the alternatives meet the intent of this section.
   D.   Maximum Setback: For new multi-family, group living, commercial, and
civic/institutional buildings, no portion of the first story of a principal
building shall be set back more than fifteen feet (15') from the front lot
line. Buildings constructed prior to December 28, 2005, are exempt from this
maximum. The setback area must be used for one or more of the following
purposes:
      1.   Building facades that are recessed in accordance with the building
standard in subsection G of this section.
      2.   Building entrances, including stoops, stairways and ramps.
      3.   Trees and landscaping.

      2.   Aisles And Drives: Drives that are internal to a parking area,
including drives that provide circulation around the perimeter of the parking
area are considered part of the parking area and must meet the location
standards for parking areas as stated in subsection E1 of this section, and the
landscape buffering standard as stated in subsection E3 of this section. A
nonhard surfaced drive or aisle that is external to a parking area may not be
located closer than three feet (3') to a lot line, except at the point of
access with a street, alley, or private rear lane. Hard surfaced drives that
are external to a parking area must be set back at least three feet (3') from
any side or rear lot line, except under the following circumstances:
         a.   The drives and aisles are pitched or curbed and drained to
prevent the flow of water onto adjoining property; or
         b.   A drainage course has been established along lot lines to handle
storm water runoff; or
         c.   Any specific location along a side or rear lot line where a drive
is shared with an abutting lot; or
         d.   At the point of access with an alley or private rear lane.
      3.   Landscape Buffering:
         a.   A buffer area at least ten feet (10') in width and landscaped to
at least the S2 standard must be provided between any parking area and adjacent
properties and between any parking area and street rights of way. (See chapter
5, article F, "Screening And Buffering Standards", of this title.) The city may
exempt from this landscaping requirement any specific locations along a side or
rear lot line where a parking area, aisle or drive is shared with an abutting
lot.
         b.   A buffer area at least five feet (5') in width and landscaped to
the S1 standard must be provided between any parking area containing more than
eight (8) parking spaces and an adjacent alley.
         c.   No parking area or drive shall be closer than ten feet (10') to
any portion of a building other than a garage entrance or loading area apron.
This ten foot (10') area must be used for walkways and landscaping consisting
of at least fifty percent (50%) vegetative coverage. If parking spaces are
located where headlights of vehicles shine onto a wall containing ground level
windows, said parking spaces must be screened from view of the windows to at
least the S2 standard.
         d.   Screening may be waived by the building official where the view
is or will be blocked by a significant change in grade or by natural or
humanmade features, such that screening is effectively provided and the intent
of the standard is met, as determined by the building official.
   F.   Building Entrances For Multi-Family, Group Living, Commercial, And
Civic/Institutional Buildings:
      1.   For residential uses, buildings must have at least one door on the
exterior of the building that provides pedestrian access to dwelling units
within the building. Access to dwelling units must not be solely through a
parking garage.
      2.   When a lot contains one principal building, the building must be
oriented such that at least one facade faces a public or private street. The
street-facing facade must have at least one main entrance to the building, or
may contain separate main entrances to ground level dwelling units. If the
building is located on a corner lot, only one wall must meet this requirement.
      3.   When a lot contains two (2) or more principal buildings, the
buildings must be oriented towards a public street, private street, or interior
courtyard. Any building with a street-facing facade must have at least one main
entrance oriented toward the street. Buildings located interior to a lot must
have main entrances that are clearly visible from interior private streets/
drives or surface parking areas.
      4.   Main entrances to a building, including main entrances to ground
level individual dwelling units, must be clearly demarcated by at least one of
the following means:
         a.   Recesses.
         b.   Raised cornice or similar architectural features.
         c.   Covered porch, canopy, or awning.
         d.   Transom and sidelight windows.
         e.   Pilasters and pediment.
         f.   Other significant architectural treatment that emphasizes main
entrances. Simple trim around the doorway does not meet this standard.
      5.   Patio style doors, such as sliding glass doors, may not be used for
main entrance doors.
      6.   To provide for the safety of residents, access to entrance doors of
any individual dwelling units located above the ground level floor of a
building must be provided from an enclosed lobby or corridor and stairway.
Unenclosed or partially enclosed exterior stairways may not be used as the
primary means of access to upper level units. This provision does not preclude
the use of fire egress structures.
      7.   A pedestrian circulation system must be provided that connects
residential entrances to adjacent public rights of way, and to parking areas
and other on site facilities.
   G.   Building Scale For Multi-Family, Group Living, Commercial, And Civic/
Institutional Buildings: The width of the front facade of new buildings must be
no more than forty feet (40'). Buildings may exceed this limitation if the
horizontal plane of any street- facing facade of the building is broken into
modules that give the appearance of smaller, individual buildings. Each module
must meet the following standards:
      1.   Each module must be no greater than thirty feet (30') and no less
than ten feet (10') in width and must be distinguished from adjacent modules by
a variation in the wall plane of at least sixteen inches (16") in depth. For
buildings that are three (3) or more stories in height, the width of the module
may be increased to forty feet (40').
      2.   Each module must have a corresponding change in the roofline.
      3.   Each module must be distinguished from the adjacent module by at
least one of the following means:
         a.   Variation in material colors, types or textures;
         b.   Variation in the building and/or parapet height;
         c.   Variation in the architectural details such as decorative
banding, reveals, stone, or tile accents;
         d.   Variation in window pattern;
         e.   Variation in the use of balconies and recesses.
   H.   Balconies And Exterior Stairways, Corridors And Lifts For Multi-Family,
Group Living, Commercial, And Civic/Institutional Buildings: For purposes of
this subsection the term, "exterior stairways", refers to stairways that lead
to floors of a building that are above the first or ground level floor of a
building. "Exterior corridors" refers to unenclosed corridors located above the
first or ground level floor of a building. Balconies and exterior stairways,
exterior corridors and exterior lifts must comply with the following standards:
      1.   Exterior stairways, exterior corridors, and exterior lifts are
prohibited, with the following exceptions: The city will allow exterior lifts
on existing buildings that cannot otherwise reasonably meet accessibility
requirements, provided the lift is not located on a wall of a building that
faces a street. The city may allow exterior fire egress structures on existing
buildings that cannot otherwise reasonably meet code requirements, provided the
fire egress structure is not located on a wall of a building that faces a
street.
      2.   Balconies may not be located on any side of a building that is
adjacent to a property that is zoned single-family residential or that contains
an existing single-family use. Buildings that are set back at least forty feet
(40') from any such property are exempt from this standard.
      3.   The outer edge of a balcony shall not be closer than four feet (4')
from a side lot line.
      4.   The design of any balcony must utilize columns, piers, supports,
walls, and railings that are designed and constructed of materials that are
similar or complementary to the design and materials used for the rest of the
building. Unpainted and unstained lumber is not permitted.
   I.   Building Materials For Multi-Family, Group Living, Commercial, And
Civic/Institutional Buildings:
      1.   Buildings not constructed of masonry or stucco must have the
following trim elements incorporated into the exterior design and construction
of the building:
         a.   Window and door trim that is not less than three inches (3")
wide.
         b.   Corner boards that are not less than three inches (3") wide,
unless wood clapboards are used and mitered at the corners.
         c.   Frieze boards, not less than five inches (5") wide, located below
the eaves.

      2.   Any portion of a building that is clearly visible from the street
must be constructed using similar materials and design as the front facade.
      3.   Exposed, unpainted or unstained lumber may not be used along any
facade that faces a street-side lot line.
      4.   Where an exterior wall material changes along the horizontal plane
of a building, the change must occur on an inside corner of the building.
      5.   Where an exterior wall material changes along the vertical plane of
the building, the materials must be separated by a horizontal band, such as a
belt course, soldier course, band board or other trim, to provide a transition
from one material to the other.

   J.   Mechanical Equipment/Utility Meters:
      1.   In no case shall mechanical equipment or utility meters be located
along the street side of a building. Mechanical structures must be set back and
screened according to the applicable provisions set forth in chapter 4, article
C, "Accessory Uses And Buildings", of this title.
      2.   Dumpsters and recycling bins must be located in areas that are not
visible from public streets and may not be located in a right of way.
   K.   Ground Floor Commercial Space: The following provisions apply to new
buildings constructed for multi-family, group living, or commercial uses. These
provisions provide the opportunity for ground level commercial uses by
requiring buildings to be constructed in a way that is conducive for commercial
uses. These provisions do not apply to buildings that are constructed for
single-family and two-family uses and are not intended to prevent buildings
constructed originally for single-family and two-family uses from being
converted over time to other uses allowed in the MU zone.
      1.   On the ground level floor, the floor to ceiling height must be at
least fourteen feet (14').
      2.   For the ground level floor of the building, construction must meet
the building code specifications for commercial uses.
      3.   A minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the building facade between two
(2) and ten feet (10') in height from the adjacent exterior grade must be
comprised of clear and highly transparent windows and doors. Reflective
(mirrored) or colored glass is not permitted. Such windows must allow views
into the interior space or be storefront display windows that are set into the
wall. Display cases attached to the outside building wall do not qualify. The
bottom of such windows must be no more than four feet (4') above the level of
the adjacent sidewalk (see section
14-2C-7,
 figure 2C.2 of this article).
      4.   To encourage commercial activity at the street level, entrances to
the ground level floor of a building that fronts on a public street or
pedestrian plaza should be no more than one foot (1') above the level of the
abutting sidewalk or pedestrian plaza. In addition, the ground level floor
height for buildings that front on a street should be no more than one foot
(1') above the level of the abutting sidewalk or pedestrian plaza. On sloping
building sites and for existing buildings, the city may adjust these
requirements. However, on sloping sites at least a portion of the ground level
floor height of any new building must be located no more than one foot (1')
above the level of the abutting sidewalk or pedestrian plaza; and the floor
height of the ground level floor of the building must be no more than three
feet (3') above the level of the abutting public sidewalk or pedestrian plaza
at any point along a street-facing building facade.
   L.   Drive-Through Facilities: Drive-through facilities are not permitted in
the MU zone.
   M.   Outdoor Storage And Display:
      1.   Outdoor storage and display areas are not permitted in the MU zone,
except for approved temporary uses. (See chapter 4, article D of this title.)
      2.   The storage of combustible or flammable materials or liquids is
strictly regulated according to the provisions of chapter 5, article H,
"Performance Standards", of this title, and according to the international fire
code, as amended.
   N.   Single-Family And Two-Family Uses In MU Zone: The following provisions
apply to single-family uses and two-family uses in the MU zone. Two-family uses
and attached single-family dwellings are also subject to the applicable
provisions contained in chapter 4, article B, "Minor Modifications, Variances,
Special Exceptions, And Provisional Uses", of this title. If provisions of this
subsection conflict with provisions in chapter 4, article B of this title, the
provisions of this subsection will apply.
      1.   Garage entrances and/or off street parking must be oriented toward
and accessed from a rear alley or private rear lane, if available. If an alley
or private rear lane is not available, then driveway access is permitted from
the street, provided the driveway does not exceed twelve feet (12') in width
and any street-facing garage entrance is set back at least twenty feet (20')
further than the street-facing facade of the dwelling. The length of any
street-facing garage wall that is visible from the street may not exceed fifty
percent (50%) of the length of the street-facing building facade, as measured
along the same street frontage. On corner lots, only one street-facing garage
wall must meet this standard. (See
figure 2C.7 of this section for some examples of acceptable garage placement.)
Figure 2C.7 - Examples Of Garage Placement In The MU Zone

IMAGES/0-0-0-2588.png]
 
      2.   Each dwelling unit must have a main entrance that is visible from
and oriented toward the street. To meet this standard, the main entrance must
face the street, be at an angle of up to forty five degrees (45°) from the
street, or open onto a porch. The main entrance may not face an alley.
      3.   At least fifteen percent (15%) of any street-facing facade must be
windows or pedestrian entryway doors. Windows in garage doors do not count
toward meeting this standard, but windows in a garage wall do count toward
meeting this standard. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; Ord. 06-4220, 7-18-2006; Ord.
06-4245, 12-12-2006; Ord. 14-4586, 6-3-2014; Ord. 23-4914, 11-6-2023)

   D.   Commercial Reuse Exception
      1.   Purpose. The commercial reuse exception allows the alteration of
existing buildings for which the constraints of the building and/or site make
it difficult to meet certain zoning code standards. It is intended primarily
for use in less intense commercial areas in or near developed residential
neighborhoods.
      2.   Applicability. The exception provides flexibility in the design and
use of existing structures provided the following circumstances are met:
         a.   The exception is requested for an alteration or expansion of an
existing building;
         b.   The project does not result in the demolition of any existing
principal structures;
         c.   The property is not designated as an Iowa City landmark or
registered in the National Register of Historic Places; and
         d.   The property is not in a CI-1, CH-1, or CB-10 zone.
      3.   Waivers. The Board of Adjustment may grant a special exception to
waive or modify any approval criteria listed in
14-4B-4 “Specific Approval Criteria for Provisional Uses and Special
Exceptions” or
14-4C-2 “Specific Approval Criteria,” or any standard in
14-2C-4 “Dimensional Requirements”,
14-2C-6 “Commercial Site Development Standards”,
14-2C-7 “Central Business Site Development Standards”,
14-2C-8 “CN-1 Zone Site Development Standards”,
14-2C-9 “Site Development Standards in MU Zone”, or 14-5 “Site Development
Standards. However, waivers and modifications cannot be requested for required
minimum distances separating land uses or standards in 14-5I “Sensitive Lands
and Features” and 14-5J “Floodplain Management Standards”.
      4.   Approval Criteria. In addition to the general special exception
approval criteria set forth in chapter 4, article B of this title, the
following approval criteria must be met:
         a.   The exception is necessary due to existing building or site
constraints that make it difficult to meet that standard.
         b.   The exception will be compatible with and/or complementary to
adjacent development in terms of building mass and scale, relative amount of
open space, traffic circulation, general layout, and lighting.
         c.   The exception will not adversely affect views, noise, stormwater
runoff, light and air, and privacy of neighboring properties any more than
would a development that satisfies the applicable standard.
         d.   The exception is not contrary to the intent of the standard.
         e.   The exception will be in the public interest.
   E.   Sustainability Density Bonus: The minimum lot size or minimum lot area
per unit may be reduced by ten percent (10%) of the applicable requirement for
each of the following provisions that is met, up to a maximum of twenty-five
percent (25%). This bonus may be used in conjunction with subsection
14-5A-4F10 (Sustainability Parking Reduction).
      1.   A solar energy system is installed onsite where the size is equal to
forty percent (40%) of the surface area of the roofs of all buildings.

14-2D-1: ESTABLISHMENT AND INTENT OF INDUSTRIAL AND RESEARCH ZONES:
The full names, short names, and map symbols of the established industrial and
research zones are listed below. When this title refers to industrial zones it
is referring to the general industrial zone (I-1) and the heavy industrial zone
(I-2) listed below. When this title refers to the research zones, it is
referring to the research development park zone (RDP) and the office research
park zone (ORP) listed below.
   A.   General Industrial Zone (I-1): The purpose of the general industrial
zone (I-1) is to provide the opportunity for the development of most types of
industrial firms. Regulations are designed to protect adjacent development.
   B.   Heavy Industrial Zone (I-2): The purpose of the heavy industrial zone
(I-2) is to provide for heavy or intense industries. The zone is designed
primarily for manufacturing and fabrication activities, including large scale
or specialized operations having external effects that could impact adjacent
less intense commercial or industrial uses.
   C.   Research Development Park Zone (RDP): The purpose of the research
development park zone (RDP) is to provide areas for the development of office,
research, production or assembly firms and other complementary uses. Office and
research uses should predominate in the zone. The requirements of this zone
protect uses in this zone from adverse impacts of uses on adjacent land.
Hotels, motels and similar uses should be located along the periphery of the
zone or in locations that do not adversely affect the setting and quality of
other development for the uses permitted in the zone.
   D.   Office Research Park Zone (ORP): The purpose of the office and research
park zone (ORP) is to provide areas for the development of large office and
research firms and other complementary uses. The requirements of this zone
protect uses in the zone from adverse impact of uses on adjacent land and
protect adjacent more restrictive uses. Hotels, motels and similar uses should
be located along the periphery of the zone or in such other locations that do
not adversely affect the setting and quality of development for the permitted
uses of this zone. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-2D-2: LAND USES ALLOWED:
   A.   Determining Principal Uses Allowed:
      1.   
Table 2D-1, located at the end of this section, indicates whether a principal
land use is permitted (P), allowed with provisions (PR), or allowed by special
exception (S) in a particular industrial or research park zone. A number in
superscript indicates that a special provision applies. See table notes for
more information.
      2.   Specific land uses are grouped into the categories and subgroups
listed in the table. For example, a firm that specializes in developing
computer software is classified as technical/light manufacturing. To find out
how a specific land use is categorized, see chapter 4, article A, "Use
Categories", of this title.
      3.   Provisional uses are allowed, subject to the additional requirements
contained in chapter 4, article B, "Minor Modifications, Variances, Special
Exceptions, And Provisional Uses", of this title.
      4.   Uses listed as special exceptions are allowed only after approval
from the Iowa City board of adjustment. The general approval criteria for
special exceptions are stated in chapter 4, article B of this title along with
specific approval criteria for most special exception uses.
   B.   Accessory Uses Allowed: Regulations pertaining to accessory uses are
stated in chapter 4, article C, "Accessory Uses And Buildings", of this title.

14-2D-4: DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
The dimensional requirements for the industrial and research zones are stated
in
table 2D-2, located at the end of this section. The following subsections
describe in more detail the regulations for each of the dimensional
requirements listed in the table. Provisional uses and uses allowed by special
exception may have specific dimensional requirements not specified in
 table 2D-2, located at the end of this section.
   A.   Minimum Lot Requirements:
      1.   Purpose: The minimum lot area and width requirements are intended to
ensure that a lot is of a size, width, and frontage that is appropriate for the
uses permitted in the subject zone and will ensure, in most cases, that the
other site development standards of this title can be met.
      2.   Standards: Generally, the minimum lot area and width standards for
the various industrial and research zones are stated in
table 2D-2, located at the end of this section. The industrial zones do not
have minimum lot size, width, or frontage requirements in order to provide
opportunities for industrial businesses of all types and sizes to find
appropriate locations within the city. The research zones have large minimum
lot sizes in order to provide the opportunity for land intensive industrial/
research firms to locate within the city, and, in the case of the ORP zone, to
preserve a campus like setting.
      3.   Minimum Lot Sizes For Specific Land Uses:
         a.   Provisional uses and uses allowed by special exception may have
specific lot size requirements not specified in
table 2D-2, located at the end of this section. Approval criteria for these
uses are addressed in chapter 4, article B, "Minor Modifications, Variances,
Special Exceptions, And Provisional Uses", of this title.
         b.   If a minimum lot size is specified within a zone for a particular
land use, whether permitted, provisional or a special exception, that use may
not be established on a smaller lot, even if smaller lots are permitted in the
subject base zone, except as permitted under chapter 4, article E,
"Nonconforming Situations", of this title.
   B.   Minimum Setback Requirements:
      1.   Purpose: The minimum setback requirements are intended to:
         a.   Maintain light, air, separation for fire protection, and access
for firefighting;
         b.   Provide opportunities for privacy between buildings;
         c.   Promote a reasonable physical relationship between buildings; and
         d.   Provide flexibility to site a building so that it is compatible
with buildings in the vicinity.
      2.   General Setback Requirements: Generally, the minimum required
setbacks for principal buildings in the industrial and research zones are
stated in
table 2D-2, located at the end of this section. The minimum setbacks for
principal buildings create required setback areas within which principal
buildings are not allowed, except for certain building features as specified in
this subsection.
      3.   Specific Setback Requirements: The following provisions contain
setback requirements for the industrial and research zones that apply in
specific situations:
         a.   Side And Rear Setbacks: If a side or rear setback is provided
where not required, the side or rear setback must be at least five feet (5').
Additional setbacks may apply if the property is in proximity to a residential
zone. See subsection B3d of this section.
         b.   Lots With Multiple Frontages:
            (1)   On corner lots, no building, structure or planting, unless
specifically exempted, may be located within the vision triangle, as set forth
in chapter 5, article D, "Intersection Visibility Standards", of this title.
            (2)   If a lot fronting on two (2) or more streets is required to
have a front setback, a minimum setback equal to the required front setback
must be provided along all streets, and such setback will be considered a front
setback for purposes of this title.
         c.   Lots With Multiple Buildings: The principal buildings on a lot
must be separated by a horizontal distance of at least ten feet (10').
Proximity of building walls will be subject to all current building code fire
protection requirements.
         d.   Lots In Proximity To Residential Zone: Where a side or rear lot
line for a lot in an industrial zone abuts a residential zone, a setback at
least equal to the required setback in the abutting residential zone must be
provided along the residential zone boundary. In addition, any building
containing an industrial use must be set back at least one hundred feet (100')
from any residential zone boundary.
      4.   Building Features Permitted Within Required Setback Area: The
following building features may extend into the required principal building
setback area specified, subject to the conditions indicated, and provided that
location of such a feature does not violate the provisions of chapter 5,
article D, "Intersection Visibility Standards", of this title. The setback
regulations for detached accessory structures and structures not considered
part of the principal building are addressed in chapter 4, article C,
"Accessory Uses And Buildings", of this title.
         a.   Awnings, uncovered balconies, bay windows, belt courses,
buttresses, canopies, chimneys, cornices, sills, and other similar features
that extend beyond the wall of a principal building may project up to six feet
(6') into the required front or rear setbacks. Except for balconies, bay
windows, and chimneys, all such projecting building features may extend up to
three feet (3') into the required side setback. Balconies and bay windows may
not extend into the required side setback. Chimneys may extend up to two feet
(2') into the required side setback. Projections from the principal building
must in all cases be at least two feet (2') from any side lot line.
         b.   Covered porches, covered decks, and covered patios that are
attached to the principal building must comply with the principal building
setbacks of the base zone. The standards for uncovered decks and patios are
specified in chapter 4, article C, "Accessory Uses And Buildings", of this
title. Covered porches, covered decks, and covered patios that are attached to
an accessory building must comply with the standards for accessory buildings as
specified in chapter 4, article C, "Accessory Uses And Buildings", of this
title.
         c.   Fire escapes may extend into any setback, provided they do not
extend more than three and one-half feet (31/2') into any side setback.
         d.   Stoops and wheelchair ramps that function as a means of access to
the ground or first floor of a building may extend into the rear setback, up to
eight feet (8') into the required front setback, and into the side setback,
provided they are set back at least three feet (3') from any side lot line. In
cases where, due to topography or other site characteristics, a wheelchair ramp
cannot meet this standard, a minor modification may be requested according to
the approval criteria and procedures for minor modifications contained in
chapter 4, article B of this title.
      5.   Adjustments To Principal Building Setback Requirements:
         a.   A minor modification to reduce principal building setback
requirements may be requested according to the approval criteria and procedures
for minor modifications contained in chapter 4, article B of this title.
         b.   A special exception may be requested to reduce principal building
setback requirements beyond what is allowed by minor modification. The board of
adjustment may adjust setback requirements if the owner or lawful occupant of a
property demonstrates that the general special exception approval criteria and
the following specific approval criteria have been satisfied:
            (1)   The situation is peculiar to the property in question;
            (2)   There is practical difficulty in complying with the setback
requirements;
            (3)   Granting the exception will not be contrary to the purpose of
the setback regulations; and
            (4)   Any potential negative effects resulting from the setback
exception are mitigated to the extent practical.
            (5)   The subject building will be located no closer than three
feet (3') to a side or rear property line, unless the side or rear property
line abuts a public right of way or permanent open space.
   C.   Height Standards:
      1.   Purpose: The height regulations are intended to promote a reasonable
building scale and relationship between buildings; provide options for light,
air, and privacy; and discourage buildings that visually dominate other
buildings in the vicinity.
      2.   Standards: Generally, the maximum height standards for principal
structures in the industrial and research zones are stated in
table 2D-2, located at the end of this section. Height standards for accessory
buildings are addressed in chapter 4, article C, "Accessory Uses And
Buildings", of this title.
      3.   Exemptions: If allowed in the subject zone, the following structures
or parts thereof are exempt from the maximum height standards, provided an
increase in height does not conflict with chapter 6, "Airport Zoning", of this
title:
         a.   Chimneys or flues.
         b.   Spires on religious or other institutional buildings.
         c.   Cupolas, domes, skylights and other similar roof protrusions not
used for the purpose of obtaining habitable floor space.
         d.   Farm structures, including barns, silos, storage bins and similar
structures when accessory to an allowed agriculture use.
         e.   Flagpoles that extend not more than ten feet (10') above the
height limit or not more than five feet (5') above the highest point of the
roof, whichever is less.
         f.   Grain elevators.
         g.   Parapet or fire walls.
         h.   Poles, towers and other structures accessory to a basic utility
use, such as streetlights and utility poles.
         i.   If allowed in the subject zone, basic utilities and communication
transmission facilities are exempt from the base zone height standards, but are
subject to any limitations set forth in chapter 4, article B of this title.
         j.   Roof structures, including solar energy systems, elevator
bulkheads, stairways, ventilating fans, cooling towers and similar necessary
mechanical and electrical appurtenances required to operate and maintain the
building.
         k.   Stacks.
         l.   Storage tanks and water towers.
         m.   Television antennas and similar apparatus.
      4.   Adjustment Of Maximum Height Standards:
         a.   The maximum height for a principal building may be increased;
provided, that for each foot of height increase above the height standard, the
front, side, and rear setbacks are each increased by an additional two feet
(2'); and provided, that an increase in height does not conflict with the
provisions of chapter 6, "Airport Zoning", of this title.
         b.   A minor modification may also be requested to adjust the maximum
height for a particular building or property according to the procedures and
approval criteria for minor modifications contained in chapter 4, article B of
this title.
   D.   Maximum Lot Coverage Standards:
      1.   Purpose: The maximum lot coverage standard helps to define the
character of zone by limiting the land area that can be covered by buildings.
These standards work in conjunction with the minimum lot requirements and
height standards to determine how built up an area appears.
      2.   Standards: The maximum lot coverage standards for the industrial and
research zones are stated in
table 2D-2, located at the end of this section. The maximum lot coverage
standard establishes the percentage of the total area of a lot that can be
covered by buildings. The total footprint of all buildings on the property,
including both principal and accessory buildings, is used to calculate the lot
coverage.

Note to
table 2D-2:
   1.   A setback is not required where a side or rear lot line abuts a
nonresidential zone. However, where a side or rear lot line abuts a residential
zone, a setback at least equal to the required setback in the abutting
residential zone must be provided along the residential zone boundary. In
addition, any building containing an industrial use must be set back at least
100 feet from any residential zone boundary.
(Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd. Ord. 09-4365, 12-1-2009; Ord. 23-4893, 1-24-
2023)
14-2D-5: INDUSTRIAL AND RESEARCH ZONE SITE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Purpose: The industrial and research zone site development standards
ensure that industrial uses and parking areas are set back and screened from
view of dissimilar uses and that on site storage of materials is handled in a
safe manner.
   B.   Applicability: The standards of this section apply to all development
in the I-1, I-2, RDP, and ORP zones, unless specifically exempted.
   C.   Site Plan Review Procedure: Review for compliance with the standards
and requirements of this section will occur as a part of the site plan review
process.
   D.   Setback Standards For Parking And Loading Areas:
      1.   Front Setback Requirements:
         a.   In the ORP zone, parking and loading areas must be set back at
least one hundred fifty feet (150') from any front or street-side lot line.
However, up to ten percent (10%) of the required parking spaces may encroach
within that setback, but may be located no closer than fifty feet (50') to a
street.
         b.   In the I-1, I-2, and RDP zones, parking and loading areas must be
set back at least ten feet (10') from any front and street- side lot lines.
However, any parking spaces and aisles located within fifty feet (50') of a
residential zone boundary must be set back at least twenty feet (20') from any
front and street- side lot lines.
      2.   Side And Rear Setback Requirements: Parking areas and loading areas
must be set back at least five feet (5') from any (nonstreet-side) side or rear
lot line. However, parking areas, loading areas, aisles and drives must be set
back at least ten feet (10') from any side or rear lot line that abuts a
property zoned residential. The city may exempt from these setback regulations
any specific locations along a lot line where a parking area, aisle or drive is
shared with an abutting lot.
      3.   Drives:
         a.   Drives that are internal to a parking area, including drives that
provide circulation around the perimeter of a parking area are considered part
of the parking area and must meet the setback standards as specified above.
Drives that are external to a parking area must be set back at least three feet
(3') from any abutting property that is zoned nonresidential, unless the drive
is pitched or curbed and drained to prevent the flow of water onto adjoining
property or unless a drainage course has been established along lot lines to
handle storm water runoff. Any specific locations along a side or rear lot line
where a drive is shared with an abutting lot may be exempted from these
standards.
         b.   Drives must be set back at least ten feet (10') from any abutting
property that is zoned residential.
   E.   Screening Requirements:
      1.   Parking areas, loading areas, and drives must be screened from view
along arterial street rights of way to at least the S2 standard. (See chapter
5, article F, "Screening And Buffering Standards", of this title.)
      2.   Where a lot occupied by a commercial or industrial use abuts or is
across a street or railroad right of way from a residential zone, daycare use,
educational facility, parks and open space use, or the Iowa River, any parking
and loading areas and outdoor work and storage areas must be located behind
buildings or screened from view of said uses and zones to at least the S3
standard.
      3.   Any aboveground storage tanks must be screened from public view to
at least the S3 standard.
      4.   Screening may be waived by the building official where the view is
or will be blocked by a change in grade or by the natural or humanmade features
as determined by the building official.
      5.   Screening requirements may be waived by the building official upon
presentation of convincing evidence that a planting screen cannot be expected
to thrive in a particular location because of intense shade, soil conditions,
or other site characteristics. The presence of existing pavement, by itself,
shall not constitute convincing evidence. If a landscape screening requirement
is waived by the building official because plantings cannot be expected to
survive, a fence or wall built to the S5 standard must be substituted for the
landscape screening.
   F.   Outdoor Storage:
      1.   Outdoor storage of materials and equipment is allowed in all
industrial and research zones, provided it is concealed from public view to the
extent possible. If it is not feasible to conceal the storage areas behind
buildings, the storage areas must be set back at least twenty feet (20') from
any public right of way, including public trails and open space, and screened
from view to at least the S3 standard. (See chapter 5, article F, "Screening
And Buffering Standards", of this title.) If a fence is built around the
storage area, the required screening must be located between the fence and the
public right of way. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
      2.   Screening may be waived by the building official where the view is
or will be blocked by a significant change in grade or by natural or humanmade
features, such that screening is effectively provided and the intent of the
standard is met, as determined by the building official. (Ord. 06-4245, 12-12-
2006)
      3.   The landscape screening requirement for outdoor storage areas may be
waived by the building official upon presentation of convincing evidence that a
planting screen cannot be expected to thrive because of intense shade, soil
conditions, or other site characteristics. The presence of existing pavement,
by itself, shall not constitute convincing evidence. If the landscape screening
requirement is waived by the building official, a fence built to the S5
standard must be substituted for the landscape screening.
      4.   The storage of combustible or flammable materials or liquids is
strictly regulated according to the provisions of chapter 4, article H,
"Performance Standards", of this title, and according to the international fire
code, as amended. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
   G.   Minor Modifications To Site Development Standards: A minor modification
to adjust specific provisions of this section may be requested in either of the
qualifying situations listed below. Such requests will be reviewed by the
director of planning and community development and the building official
according to the procedures for minor modifications as set forth in chapter 8,
article B of this title and must meet the following approval criteria. The
following approval criteria are to be applied in lieu of the general approval
criteria listed in section
14-4B-1, "Minor Modifications", of this title:
      1.   Qualifying Situation: The configuration of the lot or other existing
physical condition of the lot makes the application of a specific standard
impractical. In such a case, the applicant must demonstrate that the following
approval criteria are met:
         a.   The applicant must provide evidence that the configuration of the
lot, the topography, or other physical characteristic of the property makes the
application of a specific standard impractical. Examples of situations that may
qualify include double fronting lots, triangular shaped lots, and steeply
sloping lots.
         b.   The applicant must demonstrate that the proposed alternative
design is not contrary to the intent of the site development standards.
         c.   The applicant must propose an alternative site or building design
that best meets the intent of the specific standard being modified.
         d.   The requested modification will not be detrimental to the public
health, safety, or welfare or be injurious to other property or improvements in
the vicinity and in the zone in which the property is located.
         e.   The requested modification does not allow a use or activity not
otherwise expressly authorized by the regulations governing the subject
property.
         f.   The requested modification complies with other applicable
statutes, ordinances, laws and regulations.
      2.   Qualifying Situation: The proposed site or building is uniquely
designed to fit the site and the surrounding area. In such a situation, the
applicant must demonstrate that the following approval criteria are met:
         a.   The applicant proposes an alternative design solution that
equally or better meets the intent of the specific standard being modified.
         b.   The proposed site or building design is uniquely designed to fit
the characteristics of the site and the surrounding area such that it equally

The full names, short names, and map symbols of the established interim
development zones are listed below. When this title refers to interim
development zones, it is referring the zones listed below.
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of the interim development zone (ID) is to provide
for areas of managed growth in which agricultural and other nonurban uses of
land may continue until such time as the city is able to provide city services
and urban development can occur. The interim development zone is the default
zoning district to which all undeveloped areas should be classified until city
services are provided. Upon provision of city services, the city or the
property owner may initiate rezoning to zones consistent with the comprehensive
plan, as amended.
   B.   Zone Designations: ID designations consist of interim development
single-family residential (ID-RS), interim development multi-family residential
(ID-RM), interim development commercial (ID-C), interim development industrial
(ID-I) and interim development research park (ID-RP), to reflect the intended
future use of the property according to the comprehensive plan, as amended.
(Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)

14-2E-4: DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
The dimensional requirements for the interim development zones are stated in
table 2E-2, located at the end of this section. The following subsections
describe in more detail the regulations for each of the dimensional
requirements listed in the table. Provisional uses and uses allowed by special
exception may have specific dimensional requirements not specified in
table 2E-2, located at the end of this section. Approval criteria for these
uses are addressed in chapter 4, article B of this title. Dimensional
requirements may be waived or modified for developments approved through the
planned development process (see chapter 3, article A, "Planned Development
Overlay Zone (OPD)", of this title) or through the historic preservation
exception as outlined in section
14-2E-6, "Special Provisions", of this article.
   A.   Minimum Lot Requirements:
      1.   Purpose: The minimum lot area and width requirements are intended to
ensure that a lot is of a size, width, and frontage that is appropriate for the
uses permitted in the subject zone and will ensure, in most cases, that the
other site development standards of this title can be met.
      2.   Standards: Generally, the minimum lot area and width standards for
the interim development zones are stated in
table 2E-2, located at the end of this section.
      3.   Minimum Lot Sizes For Specific Land Uses: Provisional uses and uses
allowed by special exception may have specific lot size requirements not
specified in
table 2E-2, located at the end of this section. Approval criteria for these
uses are addressed in chapter 4, article B, "Minor Modifications, Variances,
Special Exceptions, And Provisional Uses", of this title.
   B.   Minimum Setback Requirements:
      1.   Purpose: The minimum setback requirements in the interim development
zones are intended to ensure that any development that occurs in the interim
will be compatible with the setbacks for future development of the property
once city services are provided and the property is rezoned according to the
comprehensive plan. The setback requirements also promote a reasonable physical
relationship between development in the interim development zone and other
adjacent zones.
      2.   General Setback Requirements: Generally, the minimum required
setbacks for principal buildings in interim development zones are stated in
table 2E-2, located at the end of this section. The minimum setbacks for
principal buildings create required setback areas within which principal
buildings are not allowed, except for certain building features as specified in
this subsection.
      3.   Specific Setback Requirements: The following provisions contain
setback requirements that apply in specific situations:
         a.   Setbacks Along Arterial Streets:
            (1)   On lots platted after December 31, 1983, a minimum forty foot
(40') front setback is required along any lot line that abuts an arterial
street or future arterial street as shown on the Iowa City arterial street map,
located in chapter 5, article C, "Access Management Standards", of this title.
            (2)   If a lot is located along an arterial street that is
substandard with regard to the width of the public right of way, as specified
in title 15 of this code, then the minimum forty foot (40') front setback along
said street is increased by the number of additional feet that will be required
for future upgrade of said street to city standards. Lots platted prior to
December 31, 1983, are exempt from this requirement.
         b.   Side And Rear Setbacks In All Zones: In all interim development
zones, if a side or rear setback is provided where not required, the side or
rear setback must be at least five feet (5').
         c.   Lots With Multiple Frontages:
            (1)   On corner lots, no building, structure or planting, unless
specifically exempted, may be located within the vision triangle, as set forth
in chapter 5, article D, "Intersection Visibility Standards", of this title.
            (2)   If a lot fronting on two (2) or more streets is required to
have a front setback, a minimum setback equal to the required front setback
must be provided along all streets, and such setback will be considered a front
setback for purposes of this title.
         d.   Lots With Multiple Buildings: The principal buildings on the lot
must be separated by a horizontal distance that is equal to the height of the
highest building. Proximity of building walls will be subject to all current
building code fire protection requirements.
         e.   Lots Adjacent To Residential Zone: Where a side or rear lot line
for a lot in an interim development zone abuts a residential zone, a setback at
least equal to the required setback in the abutting residential zone must be
provided along the residential zone boundary.
      4.   Building Features Permitted Within Required Setback Area: The
following building features may extend into the required principal building
setback area specified, subject to the conditions indicated, and provided, that
location of such a feature does not violate the provisions of chapter 5,
article D, "Intersection Visibility Standards", of this title. The setback
regulations for detached accessory structures and structures not considered
part of the principal building are addressed in chapter 4, article C,
"Accessory Uses And Buildings", of this title.
         a.   Awnings, uncovered balconies, bay windows, belt courses,
buttresses, canopies, chimneys, cornices, sills, and other similar features
that extend beyond the wall of a principal building may project up to six feet
(6') into the required front or rear setbacks. Except for balconies, bay
windows, and chimneys, all such projecting building features may extend up to
three feet (3') into the required side setback. Balconies and bay windows may
not extend into the required side setback. Chimneys may extend up to two feet
(2') into the required side setback. Projections from the principal building
must in all cases be at least two feet (2') from any side lot line.
         b.   Covered porches, covered decks, and covered patios that are
attached to the principal building must comply with the principal building
setbacks of the base zone. The standards for uncovered decks and patios are
specified in chapter 4, article C, "Accessory Uses And Buildings", of this
title. Covered porches, covered decks, and covered patios that are attached to
an accessory building must comply with the standards for accessory buildings as
specified in chapter 4, article C, "Accessory Uses And Buildings", of this
title.
         c.   Fire escapes may extend into any setback, provided they do not
extend more than three and one-half feet (31/2') into any side setback.
         d.   Stairways that function as the principal means of access to
dwelling units located above the ground or first floor of a building may not
extend into any required setback. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
         e.   Stoops and wheelchair ramps that function as a means of access to
the ground or first floor of a building may extend into the rear setback, up to
eight feet (8') into the required front setback, and into the side setback,
provided they are set back at least three feet (3') from any side lot line. In
cases where, due to topography or other site characteristics, a wheelchair ramp
cannot meet this standard, a minor modification may be requested according to
the approval criteria and procedures for minor modifications contained in
chapter 4, article B of this title. (Ord. 09-4365, 12-1-2009)
      5.   Adjustments To Principal Building Setback Requirements:
         a.   A minor modification to reduce principal building setback
requirements may be requested according to the approval criteria and procedures
for minor modifications contained in chapter 4, article B of this title.
         b.   A special exception may be requested to reduce principal building
setback requirements beyond what is allowed by minor modification. The board of
adjustment may adjust setback requirements if the owner or lawful occupant of a
property demonstrates that the general special exception approval criteria and
the following specific approval criteria have been satisfied:
            (1)   The situation is peculiar to the property in question;
            (2)   There is practical difficulty in complying with the setback
requirements;
            (3)   Granting the exception will not be contrary to the purpose of
the setback regulations; and
            (4)   Any potential negative effects resulting from the setback
exception are mitigated to the extent practical.
            (5)   The subject building will be located no closer than three
feet (3') to a side or rear property line, unless the side or rear property
line abuts a public right-of-way or permanent open space.
   C.   Minimum Building Width:
      1.   Purpose: The minimum building width requirements promote a
reasonable building scale and relationship between dwellings in a neighborhood.
      2.   Standards: The minimum building width requirements for residential
structures in the interim development zones are stated in
table 2E-2 below. A building must be in compliance with the specified minimum
building width for at least seventy five percent (75%) of the building's
length.

(2'); and provided, that an increase in height does not conflict with the
provisions of chapter 6, "Airport Zoning", of this title.
         b.   A minor modification may also be requested to adjust the maximum
height for a particular building or property according to the procedures and
approval criteria for minor modifications contained in chapter 4, article B of
this title. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd. Ord. 23-4893, 1-24-2023)
14-2F-5: PUBLIC ZONE SITE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Surface Parking Lot Setback Requirements:
      1.   Front Setback Requirements: Parking and loading areas must be set
back at least ten feet (10') from any front and street side lot line. However,
any loading area, parking spaces or aisles located within fifty feet (50') of a
residential zone boundary must be set back at least twenty feet (20') from any
front and street side lot line.
      2.   Side And Rear Setback Requirements: Parking and loading areas must
be set back at least five feet (5') from any (nonstreet side) side or rear lot
line. However, parking and loading areas must be set back at least ten feet
(10') from any side or rear lot line that abuts a property zoned residential.
The city may exempt from these setback regulations any specific locations along
a lot line where a parking area, aisle or drive is shared with an abutting lot.
      3.   Drives:
         a.   Drives that are internal to a parking area, including drives that
provide circulation around the perimeter of a parking area, are considered part
of the parking area and must meet the setback standards as specified above.
Drives that are external to a parking area must be set back at least three feet
(3') from any abutting property that is zoned nonresidential, unless the drive
is pitched or curbed and drained to prevent the flow of water onto adjoining
property or unless a drainage course has been established along lot lines to
handle stormwater runoff. Any specific locations along a side or rear lot line
where a drive is shared with an abutting lot may be exempted from these
standards.
         b.   Drives that are external to a parking area must be set back at
least ten feet (10') from any abutting property that is zoned residential.
   B.   Landscaping And Tree Requirements For Parking Areas: Parking areas that
contain more than eighteen (18) parking spaces must be designed to include
trees and planting areas according to the provisions of chapter 5, article A,
"Off Street Parking And Loading Standards", of this title.
   C.   Screening Requirements:
      1.   Surface parking areas, loading areas, and drives must be screened
from public rights of way to at least the S2 standard. (See chapter 5, article
F, "Screening And Buffering Standards", of this title.)
      2.   Surface parking areas, loading areas, and drives must be screened
from view of abutting properties to at least the S2 standard. Additional
screening is required for properties that abut properties zoned residential.
Parking areas, loading areas, and drives must be screened from view of any
abutting property zoned residential to at least the S3 standard. The city may
exempt from this landscaping requirement any specific locations along a side or
rear lot line where a parking area, loading area, aisle or drive is shared with
an abutting lot.
      3.   Where a lot in a public zone abuts or is across a street or railroad
right of way from a residential zone, daycare use, educational facility, parks
and open space use, or the Iowa River, any parking and loading areas and
outdoor work and storage areas must be located behind buildings or screened
from view of said uses and zones to at least the S3 standard.
      4.   All ground level mechanical and utility equipment, such as heat
pumps, air conditioners, emergency generators, and water pumps, must be
screened from public view to at least the S2 standard. If it is not feasible to
use landscape screening, the mechanical equipment must be screened using wall
or fencing materials complementary to the principal structure.
      5.   Screening requirements may be waived by the building official upon
presentation of convincing evidence that a planting screen cannot be expected
to thrive in a particular location because of intense shade, soil conditions,
or other site characteristics. The presence of existing pavement, by itself,
shall not constitute convincing evidence. If a landscape screening requirement
is waived by the building official because plantings cannot be expected to
survive, a fence or wall built to the S5 standard must be substituted for the
landscape screening. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
      6.   Screening may be waived by the building official where the view is
or will be blocked by a change in grade or by natural or humanmade features,
such that screening is effectively provided and the intent of the standard is
met, as determined by the building official. (Ord. 06-4245, 12-12-2006)
   D.   Storage Of Materials And Equipment:
      1.   Outdoor storage of materials and equipment is allowed in all public
zones, provided it is concealed from public view to the extent possible. If it
is not feasible to conceal the storage areas behind buildings, the storage
areas must be set back at least twenty feet (20') from any public right of way,
including public trails and open space, and screened from view to at least the
S3 standard. (See chapter 5, article F, "Screening And Buffering Standards", of
this title.) If a fence is built around the storage area, the required
screening must be located between the fence and the public right of way.
      2.   All outdoor storage areas that are located along a side or rear lot
line that does not abut a public right of way must be set back at least ten
feet (10') from said lot line and screened from view of the adjacent property
to at least the S3 standard. If a fence is built around the storage area, the
required screening must be located between the fence and the adjacent property.
      3.   The landscape screening requirement for outdoor storage areas may be
waived by the building official upon presentation of convincing evidence that a
planting screen cannot be expected to thrive because of intense shade, soil
conditions, or other site characteristics. The presence of existing pavement,
by itself, shall not constitute convincing evidence. If the landscape screening
requirement is waived by the building official, a fence built to the S5
standard must be substituted for the landscape screening.
      4.   The storage of combustible or flammable materials or liquids is
strictly regulated according to the provisions of chapter 5, article H,
"Performance Standards", of this title, and according to the international fire
code, as amended. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
   E.   Minor Modifications To Site Development Standards: A minor modification
to adjust specific provisions of this section may be requested in either of the
qualifying situations listed in the subsections below. Such requests will be
reviewed by the director of planning and community development and the building
official according to the procedures for minor modifications as set forth in
chapter 8, article B of this title and must meet the following approval
criteria. The following approval criteria are to be applied in lieu of the
general approval criteria listed in section
14-4B-1, "Minor Modifications", of this title.
      1.   Qualifying situation one: The configuration of the lot or other
existing physical condition of the lot makes the application of a specific
standard impractical. In such a case, the applicant must demonstrate that the
following approval criteria are met:
         a.   The applicant must provide evidence that the configuration of the
lot, the topography, or other physical characteristic of the property makes the
application of a specific standard impractical. Examples of situations that may
qualify include double fronting lots, triangular shaped lots, and steeply
sloping lots.
         b.   The applicant must demonstrate that the proposed alternative
design is not contrary to the intent of the site development standards.
         c.   The applicant must propose an alternative site or building design
that best meets the intent of the specific standard being modified.
         d.   The requested modification will not be detrimental to the public
health, safety, or welfare or be injurious to other property or improvements in
the vicinity and in the zone in which the property is located.
         e.   The requested modification does not allow a use or activity not
otherwise expressly authorized by the regulations governing the subject
property.
         f.   The requested modification complies with other applicable
statutes, ordinances, laws and regulations.
      2.   Qualifying situation two: The proposed site or building is uniquely
designed to fit the site and the surrounding area. In such a situation, the
applicant must demonstrate that the following approval criteria are met:
         a.   The applicant proposes an alternative design solution that
equally or better meets the intent of the specific standard being modified.
         b.   The proposed site and building design is uniquely designed to fit
the characteristics of the site and the surrounding area such that it equally
or better meets the purpose of the site development standards.
         c.   The requested modification will not be detrimental to the public
health, safety, or welfare or be injurious to other property or improvements in
the vicinity and in the zone in which the property is located.
         d.   The requested modification does not allow a use or activity not
otherwise expressly authorized by the regulations governing the subject
property.
         e.   The requested modification complies with other applicable
statutes, ordinances, laws, and regulations. (Ord. 09-4352, 7-6-2009)
14-2F-6: SPECIAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   If the federal, state, or local government, or political subdivisions
thereof, or the Iowa City Community School District, conveys a leasehold
interest in any land zoned public for a use other than those allowed in the
public zone, the land must be zoned to an appropriate zone in which the use is
allowed. The use shall be subject to all requirements of the new zone. Further,
the zone may be established as a dual zone, retaining the public zone
designation. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd. Ord. 22-4880, 6-6-2022)

14-2G-1: INTENT, APPLICABILITY, AND ADMINISTRATION:
   A.   Regulating Plan: The form based development standards in the following
sections are intended to shape development and redevelopment in certain
districts of the City. The standards are designed to promote the creation of
economically vital, mixed use, pedestrian friendly districts. The form based
standards describe required development patterns, building and frontage types,
and parking locations and treatments. The standards are organized in sections
with each section defining building and site development conditions affecting
the quality of the built environment and ensuring projects are consistent with
the goals, objectives, and guidelines in the downtown and riverfront crossings
master plan and the central district plan.
   B.   Subdistricts:
      1.   The Riverfront Crossings District is divided into subdistricts,
which are listed below with the corresponding zoning map symbol.
         a.   South Downtown Subdistrict (RFC-SD).
         b.   University Subdistrict (RFC-U).
         c.   Central Crossings Subdistrict (RFC-CX).
         d.   Gilbert Subdistrict (RFC-G).
         e.   Park Subdistrict (RFC-P).
         f.   South Gilbert Subdistrict (RFC-SG).
         g.   West Riverfront Subdistrict (RFC-WR). (Ord. 16-4675, 9-20-2016)
         h.   Orchard Subdistrict (RFC-O). (Ord. 17-4705, 5-16-2017)
      2.   The Eastside Mixed Use District, which is located in the Central
Planning District is designated with the following zoning map symbol:
         a.   Eastside Mixed Use District (EMU).
   C.   Applicability: All development within the Riverfront Crossings District
and Eastside Mixed Use District as designated on the zoning map shall be
subject to the provisions of this article and to the use regulations and site
development standards contained in chapters 4 and 5 of this title and, if
applicable, the overlay zone provision of chapter 3 of this title. In the case
of any inconsistency or conflict between the provisions of this article, the
provision that is more specific to the situation will control. When regulations
are equally specific or when it is unclear which regulation to apply, the more
restrictive provision will control.
For purposes of this article, "grade" shall be defined as the average point of
elevation of the finished surface of the ground, paving, or sidewalk within the
area between the building and the streetside property line(s), or when the
streetside property line is more than five feet (5') from the building, between
the building and a line five feet (5') from the building. Grade shall be
calculated measuring the level of the surface of the ground at least every
twenty feet (20') along the entire frontage of the property. If due to
unavoidable site conditions, the finished surface of the ground has been or is
proposed to be raised by adding fill, the slope of the fill within twenty feet
(20') of the building shall not exceed four horizontal to one vertical (4:1) or
twenty five percent (25%). Any story that has more than three feet (3') of its
floor to ceiling height above grade along one (1) or more frontages shall be
counted as a story for purposes of measuring height. Streetside property lines
shall include those abutting approved pedestrian streets. (Ord. 16-4675, 9-20-
2016)
   D.   Design Review: Any exterior alterations to, additions to, or new
construction of buildings and structures, or alterations or additions to site
development, including, but not limited to, parking areas, landscaping,
screening, lighting, and access on property zoned to a Riverfront Crossings or
Eastside Mixed Use designation shall be subject to design review. Design review
shall be conducted by the Form Based Code Committee (FBC Committee), as
designated by the City Manager. The FBC Committee shall review the proposed
development for compliance with the applicable provisions of this article and
the goals and objectives of the adopted downtown and riverfront crossings
master plan and central district plan. (Ord. 16-4675, 9-20-2016; amd. Ord. 16-
4685, 11-15-2016)
14-2G-2: REGULATING PLAN:
   A.   Regulating Plan: The Riverfront Crossings District regulating plan (see
 figure 2G-1 of this section) and Eastside Mixed Use District regulating plan
(see
 figure 2G-1B of this section) indicate the location and extent of any
subdistricts, primary street designations, required retail storefront
locations, and required Ralston Creek frontage locations. The regulating plan
identifies public parks and open spaces as well as proposed green space within
subdistricts, which includes publicly accessible parks, plazas, and trails and
open spaces along the Iowa River and Ralston Creek. Reference to the regulating
plan is required to determine the applicability of standards included in the
subdistrict standards, frontage types, building types, parking types, and
general requirements. (Ord. 16-4675, 9-20-2016)

building facade that faces Highway 6 may be aligned along a minimum ten foot
(10') wide pedestrianway with abutting perpendicular parking spaces aligned
along an east-west drive aisle located between the building and Highway 6.
Therefore, the maximum setback along the Highway 6 frontage may be adjusted
accordingly. (Ord. 17-4696, 3-7-2017)
               (F)   Side Setback (C): Ten feet (10') minimum or zero feet (0')
if building abuts or will abut the adjacent building, except for apartment
buildings and multi-dwelling buildings where the minimum is always ten feet
(10'). For mixed use buildings, facades on residential floors must be set back
at least ten feet (10') from the side lot line.
               (G)   Rear Setback (D): Ten feet (10') minimum or five feet (5')
minimum if set back along public alley or private rear lane.
               (H)   Above Third Floor: Above the third floor (or above the
second floor if the height of the first 2 stories is at least 30 feet above
grade) the maximum setback does not apply.
               (I)   Forecourts: Approved forecourt frontages may exceed the
maximum setbacks stated above. (Ord. 16-4675, 9-20-2016; amd. Ord. 17-4696, 3-

buildings shall be two (2) stories minimum and six (6) stories maximum in
height above grade. Single-story buildings may be permitted in midblock
locations in the south Gilbert subdistrict.
               (C)   Additional building height may be granted through transfer
of development rights or through bonus height provisions as set forth in
subsection
14-2G-7G, "Building Height Bonus Provisions", of this article.
               (D)   Building heights may be further restricted by FAA
regulations.
            (2)   Upper floor building facades facing and visible from streets,
plazas, or parks shall step back ten feet (10') minimum from the lower floor
facade as follows:
               (A)   In the south downtown subdistrict above the fifth floor.
               (B)   In the park, south Gilbert, and university subdistricts
above the fourth floor.
               (C)   At street corners, tower elements or similar corner
emphasis treatments may be exempt from the step back requirement for up to one
facade bay (maximum 35 feet) as approved by the FBC committee.
               (D)   The required facade step back may be established at a
lower floor than stated above, provided it is established at least thirty feet

District:
      1.   Intent: The Central Crossings Subdistrict is intended for moderate
intensity mixed use development in buildings with entries opening onto
pedestrian friendly public streets and streetscapes. The Eastside Mixed Use
District is intended for lower intensity mixed use and residential development
in buildings with street-facing entries opening onto pedestrian friendly
streetscapes that provide a transition between higher intensity mixed use areas
in downtown Iowa City and residential neighborhoods to the east. The Orchard
Subdistrict is intended for lower intensity residential development in
buildings with street-facing entries opening onto pedestrian-friendly
streetscapes that provide a transition between higher intensity mixed-use areas
along Riverside Drive and low-scale residential neighborhoods to the west.
Buildings are designed with facades aligned along primary streets and parking
located within buildings behind active uses and in mid-block parking lots and
structures.
      2.   Uses: The principal uses allowed in the Central Crossings
Subdistrict, Orchard Subdistrict and Eastside Mixed Use District are the same
as allowed in the CB-5 Zone, as specified in section

4840, 12-15-2020)
14-2G-4: FRONTAGE TYPE STANDARDS:
   A.   Generally: A building's frontage condition, the transition from public
to private space, from indoor to outdoor at the main entrance, the design
treatment of ground floor building facades, the configuration of facade
projections, and the disposition of improvements within required setbacks,
strongly influences the quality and character of public streets and spaces.
All principal buildings in the form based zoning districts shall be designed
with frontage types meeting the requirements of this section. The standards
recognize that different types of buildings, as defined in the building type
standards in section
14-2G-5 of this article, may call for different frontage conditions.
Illustrations within this section are intended to demonstrate basic frontage
type standards and are not intended to promote a particular architectural style
or represent the architectural detail necessary for high quality buildings.
Table 2G-5 of this section identifies which of the frontage types are permitted
in conjunction with each of the building types: (Ord. 16-4675, 9-20-2016)

Notes:
   1.    Subordinate frontage type, to be used in conjunction with other
permitted frontage type(s).
   2.    Frontage type may be allowed by the FBC for appropriate horizontal
mixing of uses, e.g., for large mixed use buildings with multiple street
frontages.
   3.   Allowed for access to individual dwelling units or live-work units.
(Ord. 16-4675, 9-20-2016; amd. Ord. 17-4705, 5-16-2017)
   B.   Storefront:
      1.   Description: The storefront frontage is the primary frontage type
for buildings with active commercial ground floor uses, such as retail,
personal services, and restaurants; see
table 2G-5 of this section to determine appropriate building types. The
frontage provides storefront facades that are typically aligned close to the
streetside property line, with large transparent windows and multiple building
entries at the grade of the fronting sidewalk. The regulating plan indicates
locations where this frontage type is required.
FIGURE 2G-15
STOREFRONT

IMAGES/0-0-0-2622.png]
 
      2.   Standards:
         a.   The private frontage area between the public sidewalk and the
building facade shall be designed for additional sidewalk width and other
pedestrian oriented uses, such as plaza space, outdoor patio space for
restaurant and cafe seating, landscaping, public art, or recessed entryways.
         b.   To encourage commercial activity at the street level, private
frontage areas should be seamlessly integrated with and at the same level as
the public sidewalk to the extent possible. With approval of the FBC committee,
on sloping sites in specific locations where there is a desire to provide
usable outdoor space the private frontage area may be slightly raised above
sidewalk grade to create a level plaza or patio area. The elevation of the
raised area shall not exceed the elevation of the ground floor finished floor
(see subsection B2d of this section). A transparent, decorative wrought iron or
similar metal railing may be located at the edge of the raised area if required
for safety, but shall be limited to forty two inches (42") maximum in height.
Opaque railings, fences or walls shall not be permitted. Access to raised areas
shall be provided directly from the sidewalk through steps and/or ramps. The
use of ramps and railings shall be minimized to maintain a seamless transition
from sidewalk to storefront. Transparent, decorative wrought iron or similar
metal fencing/railings not to exceed forty two inches (42") are allowed for
outdoor service areas and sidewalk cafes for eating and drinking
establishments, as approved by the city. Any such fencing/railings for outdoor
service areas and sidewalk cafes must include landscaped planters or planter
boxes along at least fifty percent (50%) of its length.
         c.   A minimum seventy percent (70%) of the area of the ground floor
facade between two (2) and ten feet (10') in height above adjacent ground level
shall consist of storefront windows and doors. Glazing shall be clear and
highly transparent and individual lites for display windows should be as large
as possible to invite views into the interior space. Transom windows are
encouraged above storefront display windows. Residential window types, closely
spaced mullions, and punched windows are not allowed for storefront frontages.
Reflective (mirrored) or colored glass is not permitted. Low-E glazing will
reduce transparency, so is discouraged for storefront windows, but if used, the
glass chosen should have a high visible light transmittance and low
reflectivity. Such windows must allow views into the interior space. The bottom
of storefront windows shall be no more than two feet (2') above the adjacent
ground level, except along sloping sites, where this standard shall be met to
the extent possible so that views into the interior are maximized and blank
walls are avoided.
         d.   The ground floor finished floor elevation shall match the
elevation of the abutting public sidewalk or publicly accessible plaza. On
sloping sites the FBC committee may adjust this requirement, provided that the
height of the ground floor of the building is no more than three feet (3')
above the level of the abutting public sidewalk or public pedestrian plaza at
any point along a street-facing facade.
         e.   The ground floor floor-to-structural ceiling height shall be
fourteen feet (14') minimum.
         f.   Ground floor building space shall be designed to meet building
code requirements for commercial uses.
         g.   Entries to individual ground floor tenant spaces and entries to
common lobbies accessing upper floor space shall open directly onto public
sidewalks or publicly accessible outdoor plazas. Thresholds at building entries
shall match the grade of the adjacent sidewalk or plaza area.
         h.   Storefront entries shall be recessed a minimum of eighteen inches
(18") and sheltered by awnings or canopies that project a minimum of six feet
(6') from the building facade. Entries must also be distinguished by facade
design, materials, articulation, or other architectural details that provide
relief to the building facade and draw attention to the entrance.
         i.   Awnings or canopies designed to provide weather protection are
required along at least sixty percent (60%) of the street-facing facade and
shall project four feet (4') minimum, eight feet (8') maximum from the front
facade and shall be located eight feet (8') minimum above the adjacent
sidewalk.
   C.   Urban Flex:
      1.   Description: The urban flex frontage is a frontage type appropriate
for buildings with ground floor commercial uses where more flexibility is
desired for nonretail uses, such as offices, institutional uses, building trade
uses, and live-work uses, or along secondary frontages where views into the
interior of the building are not as critical, but where architecturally
finished facades with elements that provide visual interest and comfort to
pedestrians are important. See
table 2G-5 of this section to determine appropriate building types. The
frontage provides ground floor storefront conditions with high proportions of
transparency, but to a lesser degree than the storefront frontage.
FIGURE 2G-16

      2.   Standards:
         a.   The private frontage area between the public sidewalk and the
building facade shall be designed for pedestrian oriented uses, such as plaza
space, outdoor patio space for restaurant and cafe seating, landscaping, public
art, or recessed entryways.
         b.   To encourage commercial activity at the street level, private
frontage areas should be seamlessly integrated with and at the same level as
the public sidewalk to the extent possible. With approval of the FBC committee,
on sloping sites in specific locations where there is a desire to provide
usable outdoor space the private frontage area may be slightly raised above
sidewalk grade to create a level plaza or patio area. The elevation of the
raised area shall not exceed the elevation of the ground floor finished floor
(see subsection C2d of this section). A transparent, decorative wrought iron or
similar metal railing may be located at the edge of the raised area if required
for safety, but shall be limited to forty two inches (42") maximum in height.
Opaque railings, fences or walls shall not be permitted. Access to raised areas
shall be provided directly from the sidewalk through steps and/or ramps. The
use of ramps and railings shall be minimized to maintain a seamless transition
from sidewalk to storefront. Transparent, decorative wrought iron or similar
metal fencing/railings not to exceed forty two inches (42") are allowed for
outdoor service areas and sidewalk cafes for eating and drinking
establishments, as approved by the city. Any such fencing/railings for outdoor
service areas and sidewalk cafes must include landscaped planters and/or
planter boxes along at least fifty percent (50%) of its length.
         c.   A minimum fifty percent (50%) of the area of the ground floor
facade between two (2) and ten feet (10') in height above adjacent ground level
shall consist of storefront windows and doors. Glazing shall be clear and
highly transparent. Residential window types, closely spaced mullions, and
punched windows are not allowed for urban flex frontages. Reflective (mirrored)
or colored glass is not permitted. Low-E glazing will reduce transparency, so
is discouraged for storefront windows, but if used, the glass chosen should
have a high visible light transmittance and low reflectivity. Such windows must
allow views into the interior space. The bottom of storefront windows shall be
no more than three feet (3') above the adjacent ground level, except along
sloping sites, where this standard shall be met to the extent possible so that
views into the interior are maximized and blank walls are avoided.
         d.   The ground floor finished floor elevation shall not exceed twelve
inches (12") maximum above the elevation of the abutting public sidewalk or
publicly accessible plaza. On sloping sites the FBC committee may adjust this
requirement, provided that at least a portion of the ground floor finished
floor elevation is located within twelve inches (12") of the elevation of the
abutting public sidewalk or publicly accessible plaza, views into storefronts
are maximized to the extent possible, and blank walls are avoided.
         e.   The ground floor floor-to-structural ceiling height shall be
fourteen feet (14') minimum.
         f.   Ground floor building space shall be designed to meet building
code requirements for commercial uses.
         g.   Entries to ground floor building space and common lobbies
accessing upper floor space shall open directly onto public sidewalks or
publicly accessible outdoor plazas where present, or shall be directly
connected to sidewalks by a paved walkway.
         h.   Thresholds at building entries shall match the grade of adjacent
sidewalks, plaza areas, or paved walkways.
         i.   Building entries shall be recessed a minimum of eighteen inches
(18") and sheltered by awnings or canopies that project a minimum of six feet
(6') from the building facade. Entries must also be distinguished by facade
design, materials, articulation, or other architectural details that provide
relief to the building facade and draw attention to the entrance.
         j.   Awnings and canopies designed to provide weather protection along
frontages are encouraged and may project eight feet (8') maximum from the front
facade and shall be located eight feet (8') minimum above the adjacent
sidewalk.
   D.   Terrace:
      1.   Description: The terrace frontage provides for vertical separation
of building space from sidewalk grade and creates semiprivate outdoor space for
individual dwelling units by elevating and partially enclosing a portion of the
private frontage area. The terrace frontage is suited for ground floor
residential uses in urban settings and may be appropriate for live-work and
institutional uses. See
table 2G-5 of this section to determine appropriate building types.
FIGURE 2G-17
TERRACE

IMAGES/0-0-0-3289.png]
      2.   Standards:
         a.   The private frontage area between the sidewalk and the building
facade shall be designed as a raised terrace, which is elevated up to thirty
six inches (36") maximum above grade by a garden wall to provide a semiprivate
outdoor space. The terrace may also be suitable for outdoor seating for live-
work uses.
         b.   A terrace shall project six feet (6') minimum, ten feet (10')
maximum beyond the front facade. A terrace may extend along the front facade
for the width of the dwelling unit. The terrace frontage is only allowed for
access to individual dwelling units, individual live-work units, or for
institutional uses. To enhance privacy, adjacent terrace frontages shall be
separated by walls and/or railings, or by a minimum six feet (6') wide
landscaped area.
         c.   Terraces may be hardscaped or landscaped, or a combination of
both. Wood or composite decking shall not be permitted. Where present, any
private frontage area between the terrace and the edge of sidewalk shall be
landscaped, except for walkways leading to the terrace.
         d.   Terraces shall be enclosed by garden walls up to forty two inches
(42") maximum in height above grade. The garden wall's design and materials
shall be of high quality and compatible with the building's architecture. A
decorative, transparent railing or fence, constructed of metal and glass,
wrought iron, or metal faithfully imitating wrought iron, may be affixed atop
the garden walls if additional height is necessary for safety. The railing
height shall not exceed forty two inches (42") maximum above the terrace grade.
Steps or a ramp shall be provided for access to the terrace. Steps and/or ramps
may be perpendicular or parallel to the sidewalk.
         e.   To provide vertical separation and enhance privacy, the finished
floor elevation of ground floor residential building space shall be elevated
eighteen inches (18") minimum above the elevation of the abutting public
sidewalk, and thirty six inches (36") maximum above grade and may be flush with
or slightly elevated above the terrace level.
         f.   Building entries shall be accessed directly from the terrace.
         g.   Landscaping of the terrace may include ground covers, grasses,
garden plants, low shrubs, and ornamental trees. All plant material shall be of
a variety that will not exceed forty two inches (42") in height at maturity
(except trees) so as not to obstruct ground floor windows. Plant material shall
be selected to prevent encroachment of the public sidewalk. Thorny plants are
not permitted.
   E.   Stoop:
      1.   Description: The stoop frontage is a frontage type appropriate for
certain buildings with ground floor residential or institutional use. See
table 2G-5 of this section to determine appropriate building types. The stoop
frontage provides for vertical separation of building space from sidewalk grade
and modest projections of stoops and covered entries for individual dwelling
units beyond building facades. The stoop frontage typically is used in
conjunction with shallow setbacks.
FIGURE 2G-18

      2.   Standards:
         a.   The private frontage area between the sidewalk and the building
facade shall be landscaped with the intent to provide privacy for residents and
attractive landscape for pedestrians. The private frontage area is not intended
as outdoor gathering space (such as patios) and hardscaped areas other than
stoop, stair, accessible ramp, and paved walkway are not permitted.
         b.   To provide vertical separation and enhance privacy, the finished
floor elevation of ground floor residential space shall be elevated eighteen
inches (18") minimum above the elevation of the abutting public sidewalk, and
thirty six inches (36") maximum above grade.
         c.   Stoops shall be provided at the entries of individual units along
front building facades and shall consist of an exterior floor area raised
eighteen inches (18") minimum above the elevation of the abutting public
sidewalk, and thirty six inches (36") maximum above grade to generally match
the interior ground floor finished floor elevation. For buildings with multiple
stoops, or a combination of stoops, porches, and porticoes, a six foot (6')
minimum landscaped area shall be provided between adjacent frontages.
         d.   Stoops shall project four feet (4') minimum, six feet (6')
maximum beyond the front facade and extend five feet (5') minimum, eight feet
(8') maximum along the front facade.
         e.   The exterior stair of a stoop may be perpendicular or parallel to
the sidewalk.
         f.   Landscaping on both sides of the stoop is required. Landscaping
may be at grade or elevated, and may be demarcated by a garden wall up to
twenty four inches (24") in height or a maximum forty two inches (42")
decorative, transparent fence constructed of wrought iron or metal that
faithfully imitates wrought iron. Plants may include ground covers, grasses,
garden plants, low shrubs, and ornamental trees. All plant material (except
trees) shall be of a variety whose height at maturity will not obstruct ground
floor windows. Plant material shall be selected to prevent encroachment of the
public sidewalk. Thorny plants are not permitted within three feet (3') of the
public sidewalk.
   F.   Porch And Yard:
      1.   Description: The porch and yard frontage is a frontage type
appropriate for certain residential buildings. See
table 2G-5 of this section to determine appropriate building types. The porch
and yard frontage provides for vertical separation of building space from
sidewalk grade, projections of usable porches beyond building facades, and is
typically set back from the streetside property line to provide a front yard
area. An optional fence may be built at or close to the property line to
delineate the front yard.

      2.   Standards:
         a.   The private frontage area between the sidewalk and the building
facade shall be landscaped with the intent to provide privacy for residents and
attractive landscape for pedestrians. The private frontage area is not intended
as outdoor gathering space (such as patios) and hardscaped areas other than
porch, stair, accessible ramps, and paved walkway are not permitted.
         b.   To provide vertical separation and enhance privacy, the finished
floor elevation of ground floor residential space shall be elevated eighteen
inches (18") minimum above the elevation of the abutting public sidewalk, and
thirty six inches (36") maximum above grade.
         c.   Porches shall be provided at the entries of single- or two-
family dwellings along front building facades and shall consist of an exterior
floor area raised eighteen inches (18") minimum above the elevation of the
abutting public sidewalk, and thirty six inches (36") maximum above grade to
generally match the interior ground floor finished floor elevation. For
buildings with multiple porches, or a combination of porches and stoops, a six
foot (6') minimum landscaped area shall be provided between adjacent frontages.
         d.   Porches shall project six feet (6') minimum, ten feet (10')
maximum beyond the front facade and extend at least fifty percent (50%) of the
facade width along the front facade.
         e.   An optional fence enclosing the front yard shall not exceed forty
eight inches (48") maximum in height. Fences shall be made of high quality
materials and construction compatible with the building's architecture.
Permitted materials include vertical wood pickets, wood lattice, wrought iron,
and metal that faithfully imitates wrought iron. Fences shall be
semitransparent with maximum fifty percent (50%) opacity. Chainlink or wire
mesh fences are prohibited.
         f.   Front yard landscaping may include ground covers, grasses, garden
plants, low shrubs, and ornamental trees. All plant material (except trees)
shall be of a variety whose height at maturity will not obstruct ground floor
windows. Plant material shall be selected to prevent encroachment of the public
sidewalk. Thorny plants are not permitted within three feet (3') of the public
sidewalk.
   G.   Portico:
      1.   Description: The portico frontage is a frontage type appropriate for
certain buildings with ground floor residential use as well as institutional
uses. See

      2.   Standards:
         a.   The private frontage area between the sidewalk and the building
facade shall be landscaped with the intent to provide privacy for residents and
attractive landscape for pedestrians. The private frontage area is not intended
as outdoor gathering space (such as patios) and hardscaped areas other than
portico, stair, accessible ramp, and paved walkway are not permitted.
         b.   To provide vertical separation and enhance privacy, the finished
floor elevation of ground floor residential space shall be elevated eighteen
inches (18") minimum above the elevation of the abutting public sidewalk, and
thirty six inches (36") maximum above grade.
         c.   Porticoes shall be provided at building entries along front
building facades and shall consist of an exterior floor area raised eighteen
inches (18") minimum above the elevation of the abutting public sidewalk, and
thirty six inches (36") maximum above grade to generally match the interior

building or may provide access to multiple uses through individual entrances.
Depending on ground floor uses, forecourts may be appropriate for either
semiprivate or public uses, such as outdoor cafes, gardens, public art, or
fountains.
         c.   The forecourt may be hardscaped or landscaped, or a combination
thereof, and may be elevated twenty four inches (24") maximum above the
elevation of the public sidewalk to maintain visual connectivity between the
forecourt and the public sidewalk. If elevated, steps and/or ramps shall be
provided to directly connect the forecourt with the adjacent sidewalk.
         d.   Garden walls twenty four inches (24") maximum in height may be
used to separate the forecourt from the public sidewalk while maintaining
visual connectivity. The garden wall's design and materials shall be high
quality and compatible with the building's architecture.
         e.   Where landscaped areas are provided, plants may include ground
covers, grasses, garden plants, low shrubs, and ornamental trees. All plant
material (except trees) shall be of a variety whose height at maturity will not
obstruct ground floor windows. Plant material shall be selected to prevent
encroachment of the public sidewalk or walkways necessary to gain access to the
building. Thorny plants are not permitted within three feet (3') of public
sidewalks or walkways necessary to gain access to the building.
         f.   Other design standards required for the primary frontage types
shall apply. (Ord. 16-4675, 9-20-2016)
14-2G-5: BUILDING TYPE STANDARDS:
   A.   Generally: The building type standards differentiate and define a range
of principal building typologies deemed appropriate for the Riverfront
Crossings District and the Eastside Mixed Use District. The building types
describe basic building configuration and massing, pedestrian access, vehicle
access, and parking specific to each typology. The standards are intended to
complement the subdistrict standards and frontage type standards set forth in
previous sections. Illustrations are intended to demonstrate basic building
type standards, and are not intended to promote a particular architectural
style or represent the architectural detail necessary for high quality
buildings. In the event of conflicting requirements the more stringent
requirement shall control.

(Ord. 16-4675, 9-20-2016)
14-2G-7: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Streetscape And Frontage Area Improvements:
      1.   The area within the public right of way between existing or planned
curb lines and the streetside property line shall be improved for pedestrian
circulation, streetscape amenities, and landscape space consistent with
provisions of the riverfront crossings district master plan and the city's
sidewalk standards and tree requirements. In the riverfront crossings and
eastside mixed use districts, street trees shall be planted in the public right
of way between the public sidewalk and street curb, according to the tree
species and planting specifications of the city forester. One overstory tree is
required for every thirty feet (30') of lot frontage, but not less than one
tree per lot. Smaller trees may be approved by the FBC committee in locations
where overstory trees would interfere with overhead utilities. If any of these
provisions conflict, the more specific standard shall apply.
      2.   The private frontage area, which is the area between the property
line and the plane of any street-facing building facade, shall be improved
consistent with section
14-2G-4, "Frontage Type Standards", of this article. Within the private
frontage area, outdoor storage and work areas, mechanical equipment, accessory
buildings, or other improvements that detract from the quality of the
pedestrian environment are prohibited. The placement of walls and fencing shall
comply with the applicable frontage type standards. In the west riverfront
subdistrict the private frontage area may differ as described in the
subdistrict standards.
      3.   All areas of the site that are not used for buildings, parking,
vehicular and pedestrian use areas shall be landscaped with trees and/or plant
materials. A landscaping plan for such areas must be submitted at the time of
site plan review.

   B.   Pedestrian Streets:
      1.   Buildings may front on a pedestrian street, where provided, in
compliance with the requirements in sections
14-2G-3, "Subdistrict Standards", and 14-2G-4, "Frontage Type Standards", of
this article. In such a case, the pedestrian street is considered a primary
street, and as such, all provisions of this article that apply to primary
streets shall also apply to pedestrian streets. In cases where a pedestrian
street is illustrated on the regulating plan as a primary street and for
Ralston Creek frontages illustrated on the regulating plan, a pedestrian street
is required, and must be designed according to the following standards. In the
case of a Ralston Creek frontage, the required stream corridor buffer may be
included in the required pedestrian street right of way or public access
easement.
      2.   Pedestrian streets shall be designed to meet the following
standards:
         a.   Public Pedestrian Street:
            (1)   Public pedestrian streets shall be located within a public
right of way and function like a street, but be limited to nonmotorized
traffic.
            (2)   Buildings shall front on and be accessed from the public
pedestrian street through an allowed frontage type.
            (3)   Public pedestrian streets shall be at least forty feet (40')
in width and intersect with, be perpendicular to and visible from a public
street right of way and be owned by a government entity. Additional right of
way width may be required beyond the minimum based on location and the amount
of pedestrian traffic anticipated.
            (4)   Public pedestrian streets may provide for pedestrian travel
through a block to other neighborhood destinations, such as parks, riverfront
areas, trails, schools, and neighborhood commercial areas.
         b.   Private Pedestrian Street:
            (1)   Private pedestrian streets shall be designed as publicly
accessible thoroughfares that function like residential streets but are limited
to nonmotorized traffic.
            (2)   Residential buildings shall front on and be accessed from the
private pedestrian street through an allowed frontage type.
            (3)   A private pedestrian street shall be established through a
shared public access easement that shall be at minimum thirty feet (30') wide
and intersect with, be perpendicular to and visible from a public street right
of way.
         c.   Ralston Creek Frontages:
            (1)   The required thirty foot (30') stream corridor buffer shall
serve as the pedestrian street right of way or public access easement and shall
function like a street, but is limited to nonmotorized traffic.
            (2)   Buildings shall front on and be accessed from the pedestrian
street through an allowed frontage type.
            (3)   The required public trail may serve as a sidewalk that
provides access to building frontages. In addition, a separate sidewalk may be
constructed on a raised terrace along the building frontages to provide better
access to residential units that are elevated above the flood hazard level.
         d.   General Standards: A creative and unique streetscape along the
pedestrian street is encouraged based on the type and scale of the buildings
along the frontage and the amount of pedestrian traffic anticipated.
Streetscape design shall be approved by the FBC committee and must meet the
following minimum standards:
            (1)   To ensure public safety, pedestrian scale lighting is
required along any pedestrian street per city requirements as determined by the
FBC committee.
            (2)   Depending on the location and the design of the development,
provision for emergency vehicle access may be required. If required, a central
paved pathway must be provided that is at least twenty feet (20') wide and
remains free of obstructions.
            (3)   Each pedestrian street, except for Ralston Creek frontages
and pedestrian streets that require a central twenty foot (20') fire lane,
shall include at least two (2), minimum six foot (6') wide public sidewalks
separated by a central green space. For pedestrian streets that exclusively
serve residential building types, one centrally located minimum ten foot (10')
sidewalk flanked by green space may be approved by the FBC committee. See
subsection B2c of this section for sidewalk requirements for Ralston Creek
frontages.
            (4)   Street trees must be planted at the same ratio as required
for a regular street right of way, although trees may be clustered or spaced
according to the streetscape design plan approved by the FBC committee.
            (5)   Any areas that are not intended for pedestrian pathways shall
be landscaped or used for pedestrian amenities, bicycle parking, seating areas,
public art, sidewalk cafe seating, and similar. Landscaped areas may be
designed to provide stormwater conveyance.
   C.   Pedestrian Passageways:
      1.   For buildings with nonresidential uses and facades longer than two
hundred feet (200') along a primary street, publicly accessible pedestrian
passageways from primary streets to and through the interior of the block are
required to provide pedestrian access from parking areas at the rear of
buildings to street frontages.
      2.   Passageways shall be designed to meet the following standards:
         a.   Passageways shall be twenty feet (20') minimum in width and
twelve feet (12') minimum in height;
         b.   Upper floors may continue over the passageway. Open air
passageways are also allowed;
         c.   Passageways should be designed to preclude normal vehicular
access and preferably be separate from other emergency vehicle accessways to
the interior of the block;
         d.   If a pedestrian passageway is provided in conjunction with a
midblock driveway, the pedestrian walkway shall be separated from vehicular
traffic by raising and curbing the walkway. Bollards and/or landscaping may
also be required to improve safety in high traffic volume situations;
         e.   Pedestrian passageways serving projects with ground floor
residential use may be for the sole use of building tenants and secured with
gates;
         f.   To ensure safe and secure use, passageways shall be designed to
provide clear lines of sight, little or no variation in enclosing wall planes,
adequate light levels, and shall be kept clean and clear of debris.
   D.   Street Screens:
      1.   Where street screens are required in section
14-2G-3, "Subdistrict Standards", of this article, a wall that meets the
following standards shall be built for the purpose of enhancing security or for
screening a parking lot or side yard area from public view.
      2.   Street screens shall be designed to meet the following standards:
         a.   Street screens shall be constructed coplanar with or recessed
maximum two feet (2') from the street-facing facade.
         b.   Street screens shall be a minimum of five feet (5') in height but
shall not exceed the height of the ground floor facade.
         c.   Street screens shall be constructed of masonry or other high
quality wall material complementary to the adjacent building facade. A
decorative wrought iron or metal fence that faithfully imitates wrought iron
may be approved by the FBC committee, provided the intended purpose of the
street screen is achieved.
         d.   Street screens may have openings for approved driveways and
pedestrian passageways.
         e.   Street screens over fifteen feet (15') in length shall be
articulated and/or be enhanced by landscaping to provide visual interest along

and/or mixed use buildings that contain multi-family or group living uses,
usable open space shall be provided on each lot at a ratio of ten (10) square
feet per bedroom, but not less than four hundred (400) square feet, according
to the standards set forth in this subsection.
      2.   For the purpose of this section, "open space" is defined as having
the following characteristics:
         a.   Open air, outdoor space accessible for shared use by occupants of
residential units on the property, except as allowed for indoor activity space,
as noted below;
         b.   Designed to preserve privacy for individual dwelling units;
         c.   Improved to support passive recreation, leisure activities and
informal gathering;
         d.   Includes amenities such as seating, shade trees, planters,
gardens, and/or other improvements to support passive recreation or leisure
activities;
         e.   Located in one or more clearly defined, compact areas, with each
area not less than four hundred (400) square feet, with no dimension less than
twenty feet (20') and no slope greater than ten percent (10%);
         f.   Separated and buffered from vehicular use areas through the use
of landscaping and/or garden walls or fencing.
      3.   Paved areas and bicycle parking areas shall not be counted toward
usable open space, except that paved paths no wider than five feet (5') and
pervious pavement designed exclusively for passive outdoor recreation may be
included within the defined open space area.
      4.   Private frontage areas may not count toward the open space
requirement, except for forecourts, as noted below.
      5.   Shared garden and patio space located on upper floor terraces,
rooftops or podiums (on the top level of a parking garage) shall count toward
the open space requirement, provided these areas are designed with green
features, such as planters or functional green roofs, contain outdoor seating
and other appropriate amenities, are free of any obstructions, screened from
rooftop mechanical equipment, and are improved and available for safe and
convenient access to all residential occupants of the building. Security and
close monitoring of any such space is required to ensure the safety of
residents and the public. The city reserves the right to restrict or close such
a space and require the owner to pay a fee in lieu if such space is deemed a
public hazard or nuisance.
      6.   A forecourt meeting the standards above shall count toward the open
space requirements, provided:
         a.   It complies with the forecourt frontage type standards in section
14-2G-4 of this article;
         b.   It is square or rectangular in form with a minimum side dimension
of twenty feet (20') and no side greater than 1.5 times the dimension of

         d.   Its elevation is not lower than grade or higher than the ground
floor finished floor elevation.
      7.   Indoor activity space may count for up to fifty percent (50%) of the
required open space, provided the indoor activity space meets the following
requirements:
         a.   The space is accessible for shared use by occupants of
residential units on the property;
         b.   It is designed to preserve privacy for individual dwelling units;
         c.   It is improved to support recreation and leisure activities and
informal gathering and as such is separate and distinguishable from entry
areas, storage areas, mailroom, and other areas not devoted to recreation and
leisure activities;
         d.   Each indoor activity area is not less than two hundred twenty
five (225) square feet, with no dimension less than fifteen feet (15');
         e.   A minimum of forty percent (40%) of the combined surface area of
all the walls is transparent and at least one wall is an exterior wall with
minimum forty percent (40%) window coverage. If located on the top floor,
transparent skylights may be counted toward the transparency requirement.
      8.   The payment of a fee in lieu of providing the required usable open
space may be requested by the developer in cases where there is practical
difficulty meeting the standards. A fee in lieu of the open space requirement
may be requested according to the following procedures and requirements:
         a.   At least fifty percent (50%) of the open space requirement must
be met on site, either as usable outdoor space and/or as indoor activity area
meeting the minimum dimensional requirements as stated above, unless the lot
contains residential development of twenty (20) or fewer bedrooms. In such a
case, up to one hundred percent (100%) of the open space requirement may be
satisfied with a payment in lieu;
         b.   The developer must request payment in lieu of open space at the
time of site plan review;
         c.   The fee must be paid in full prior to the issuance of an
occupancy permit;
         d.   The fee shall be equal to the fair market value of the land that
otherwise would have been required for the open space. The fair market value of
the land shall be determined by a qualified real estate appraiser who is
acceptable to both the city and the developer. The appraisal cost shall be
borne by the developer.
         e.   All such fees shall be deposited in either the riverfront
crossings district east (for properties located east of the Iowa River), the
riverfront crossings district west (for properties located west of the Iowa
River), or the eastside mixed use open space account. All payments will be used
to acquire or develop public open spaces, parks, recreation facilities and
greenways/trails that are located within the applicable riverfront crossings
open space district. For the eastside mixed use district funds shall be used
within the central planning district - subarea A.
   F.   Building Design Standards:
      1.   Facade Composition:
         a.   Building facades shall be designed with a base, middle, and top,
as illustrated in
 figure 2G-42 of this section. The ground floor facade, or in the case of
taller buildings the facade of the first few stories, composes the base. The
building elements and features above or including the uppermost occupied floor,
including parapet walls and eaves, compose the top. The top of buildings shall
be delineated with some form of cornice expression, either with trim material,
brackets and panels, eave details, or accentuated masonry. The base of a
building shall be distinguished from the middle through the use of string
courses, cornice expression, or installation of awnings or canopies. Where the
exterior wall material changes along the vertical plane of the building, the
materials must be separated by a horizontal band, such as a belt course,
soldier course, band board or other trim appropriate to the building materials
being used.
         b.   To break up building facades along street frontages, facades
shall be divided vertically into bays, as illustrated in
 figure 2G-42 of this section. Facade bays shall be twenty feet (20') minimum
and thirty five feet (35') maximum in width and establish a rhythm of vertical
modules unified by a complementary rhythm of windows and window groupings.
Facade bays shall be distinguished by varying fenestration patterns, recessing
wall planes, varying building materials, or establishing a rhythm of
architectural elements such as pilasters or window bays. Where the exterior
wall material changes along the horizontal plane of a building, the change must
occur on an inside corner of the building wall. In the eastside mixed use
district, the standard in subsection F1d of this section applies instead of
this standard.
         c.   To avoid flat, continuous, and overly long upper floor facades,
the maximum length of an upper floor facade shall be fifty feet (50').
Articulation between continuous upper floor facade sections shall be
accomplished by recessing the facade two feet (2') minimum for a distance of at
least ten feet (10') along rear and side facades and three feet (3') minimum
for a distance of at least ten feet (10') along front facades, as illustrated
in
figure 2G-42 of this section. If an upper story facade is recessed more than
five feet (5'), said distance shall be increased to at least twenty feet (20').
If balconies are constructed within the recessed area, the distance between the
outside edges of any balconies that face each other across the recessed area
shall be a minimum of eighteen feet (18'). In the eastside mixed use district,
the standard in subsection F1d of this section applies instead of this
standard.
         d.   In the eastside mixed use district, building facades greater than
forty feet (40') in width must be broken into modules that give the appearance
of smaller, individual buildings, as illustrated in
 figure 2G-42B of this section. Each module must meet the following standards.
In no case shall a mixed use building, commercial building, multi-dwelling
building or apartment building be greater than sixty feet (60') in width along
primary street frontages unless designed as a building with a landscaped
forecourt frontage and building wings that do not exceed sixty feet (60') in
width along primary street frontages, as approved by the FBC committee.
            (1)   Each module must be no greater than thirty feet (30') and no
less than ten feet (10') in width and must be distinguished from adjacent
modules by a variation in the wall plane of at least two feet (2') in depth
along rear and side facades and at least three feet (3') in depth along front
facades.
            (2)   Each module must have a corresponding change in the roofline.
            (3)   As appropriate to the chosen architectural style of the
building, each module must be distinguished from the adjacent module by at
least one of the following means: variation in material colors, types, or
textures; variation in the building and/or parapet height; variation in the
architectural details such as decorative banding, reveals, stone, or tile
accents; variation in window pattern; variation in the use of balconies,
recesses, or bay windows.
         e.   Architectural style in the eastside mixed use district: Buildings
must be designed in a manner that is consistent with a historic architectural
style typical of residential buildings in the central planning district.
However, building facades that are visible only from public alleys are not
subject to these standards. The applicable architectural styles are as follows:
Italianate; Queen Anne; colonial revival; craftsman; craftsman bungalow;
American foursquare; prairie style; period revival; and eclectic. The applicant
must indicate in detail how each of the following architectural elements in the
proposed building are consistent with one of these architectural styles:
            (1)   Form and mass of the building;
            (2)   Roof configuration and pitch;
            (3)   Style and placement of windows and doors;
            (4)   Window and door trim, eave boards, frieze boards, and other
trim;
            (5)   Porch and entrance features;
            (6)   Building details and ornamentation.
         f.   To create a seamless transition between the facades of a building
at a street corner, both street-facing facades shall be designed with equal
architectural quality and detail as illustrated in
figure 2G-43 of this section. Buildings shall reinforce street corners by
repeating facade elements such as signs, awnings and window and wall treatments
on both sides of the building facing the corner. Additional corner emphasis
with chamfered or rounded facades, corner entries accentuated through changes
in design treatments, materials, canopy projections, roof or parapet forms, or
through other architectural method is encouraged on street corners. Where
additional corner emphasis is provided that extends vertically to the top of
the building, the upper floor step back requirement may be waived or adjusted
by the FBC committee.
         g.   For any exterior building wall that faces a street, park,
forecourt, plaza, public trail, the Iowa River or Ralston Creek, a minimum of
twenty five percent (25%) of said wall between the ground floor and the top of
the wall shall be comprised of doors and transparent windows, with the
following exceptions:
            (1)   For buildings with storefront and urban flex frontages, this
standard applies only to upper floors with the ground floor meeting
fenestration requirements for these frontage types.
            (2)   Side facades built to the property line that will abut an
adjacent building, but that are temporarily within public view, are exempt from
this requirement.
         h.   Along street-facing facades and facades that face the Iowa River,
Ralston Creek, plazas, open space or trails, blank walls greater than fifteen
feet (15') in length are not allowed. Elements such as windows, doors, columns,
pilasters, changes in material, artwork, or other architectural details that

Notes:
   1.    Any brick or stone veneer must be of a quality, thickness, durability,
and design that faithfully imitates full wythe masonry and allows windows and
entryways to be recessed to meet the standards.
   2.    Shall be used in conjunction with a palette of materials and shall not
comprise more than 33 percent of any facade within public view of a street,
pedestrian street, plaza, park, public trail, Ralston Creek frontage, parking
area, or the Iowa River. Except for burnished/polished or glazed units, CMU is
not generally allowed for storefront and urban flex frontages. However, if
approved by the FBC, architectural CMU, such as split face, ground face, and
rock face, may be used as an accent material on the storefront/urban flex
frontage level.
   3.    For buildings that exceed 3 stories in height, these materials shall
only be used in conjunction with a palette of materials and shall not comprise
more than 33 percent of any facade within public view of a street, pedestrian
street, plaza, park, public trail, Ralston Creek frontage, parking area, or the
Iowa River. Not generally allowed for storefront/urban flex front applications;
however, high quality, smooth faced versions may be approved by the FBC as
accent materials.
   4.    Shall be used in conjunction with a palette of materials; shall be a
heavy gauge, nonreflective metal. Durability and maintenance of the material
shall be carefully considered if used on the ground level floor or in high use
areas.
   5.    Shall incorporate horizontal and vertical articulation and modulation,
including, but not limited to, changes in color and texture, or as part of a
palette of materials. This category does not include tilt-up concrete wall
construction, which is not allowed.
   6.    May only be used for architectural detailing above the ground floor.
   7.    Shall be used in limited quantities as an accent material or as a
means of visual screening. Shall not count toward minimum fenestration
requirements.
   8.    May be used for architectural detailing and signage. Other than for
decoration and signage, use of these materials on a storefront level is
discouraged. For storefront and urban flex frontages, if use of these materials
on ground floor windows reduces the transparency and blocks views into the
interior of a building, said windows shall not count toward the minimum
fenestration requirements of the ground floor of the building. Window film
shall not be applied to required storefront windows in a manner that reduces
transparency and blocks views into the interior of the storefront.
   9.    Glass used for storefronts or urban flex frontages should be as clear
and transparent as possible and individual lites for display windows should be
as large as possible to invite views into the interior of the commercial space.
Transom windows are encouraged above storefront display windows. Residential
window types, closely spaced mullions, and punched windows are not allowed for
storefront or urban flex frontages. Low-E glazing will reduce transparency, so
is discouraged for storefronts or urban flex fronts, but if used, the glass
chosen should have a high visible light transmittance and low reflectivity.
      6.   Roof Design:
         a.   The following building types may have flat or pitched roofs;
however, mansard roofs are discouraged and shall not be permitted on single-
story buildings. Buildings over three (3) stories in height shall have flat
roofs.
            (1)   Townhouse.
            (2)   Apartment building.
            (3)   Multi-dwelling building.
            (4)   Live-work townhouse.
            (5)   Commercial building.
            (6)   Mixed use building.
            (7)   Liner building.
            (8)   Civic or institutional building.
         b.   The following building types shall have pitched roofs. Mansard
roofs are not permitted.
            (1)   Cottage home.
            (2)   Row house.
         c.   All roof edges shall be accentuated with eaves in a manner
proportionate to the size of the building and length of the wall. Buildings
with flat roofs shall be enclosed by a parapet wall and decorative cornice.
      7.   Awnings And Canopies:
         a.   Awnings and canopies may project over the public sidewalk with a
minimum eight foot (8') clearance above the sidewalk, but shall not project in
a manner that will interfere with utilities, street trees, or other important
right-of-way features.
         b.   Awnings shall be constructed of a durable material such as canvas
or metal that will not fade or tear easily. Plasticized, rigid, or curved
awnings or mansard style canopies are prohibited. On storefront frontages,
awnings must be open ended to allow views along the frontage.
         c.   Awnings shall not be internally illuminated and any signs shall
be illuminated by fixtures located above the awning and directed downward.
      8.   Mechanical Equipment:
         a.   Outdoor mechanical, electrical, and communication equipment,
including heating, air conditioning, and ventilation equipment; venting and
vent terminations for commercial hoods; electric meters; electrical and
communications equipment and panels; and similar features shall be placed on
the roof or to the rear of buildings. Such equipment shall not be placed in
private frontage areas. Except for venting and vent terminations for commercial
hoods, said equipment may be located along the nonstreet side of buildings, if
it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the FBC Committee that it is
impractical to locate such equipment on the roof or to the rear of the
building. Venting for commercial hoods shall be internal to the building and
terminations shall be located on the roof or may terminate through an exterior
wall that abuts an alley right-of-way. If there is practical difficulty
locating horizontal vent terminations for kitchen fans, bathroom fans, and gas
fireplaces for individual residential dwelling units on the roof or to the rear
or side facades, they may be allowed on front facades as long as they are
designed to blend with the exterior building facade, as approved by the FBC
Committee.
         b.   All such equipment must be screened from public view by
architectural finished screen walls and enclosures consistent and complementary
to the exterior facade of the building.
         c.   If within public view, rooftop mechanical penthouses shall be
designed to complement the design of street-facing building facades and shall
be clad on all sides in the same materials as used on street-facing facades.
         d.   Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) units and other similar
mechanical units that are integrated into and behind the wall plane of a
building and covered and screened from view with a decorative guard that is
integrated into the design of the building wall are allowed on any side of a
building.
         e.   Dumpsters and recycling bins must be located in areas that are
not visible from public streets and may not be located in a right-of-way.
   G.   Building Height Bonus Provisions: The building height bonus provisions
provide an incentive for developments to incorporate features that provide a
public benefit or that further important goals and objective of the downtown
and riverfront crossings master plan according to the eligible bonuses set
forth in this section.
      1.   Review Process: Request for building height bonuses will be reviewed

applicable subdistrict height standard may be approved through a Level I design
review.
         b.   A Level II design review is required for a height bonus that
exceeds two (2) stories above the maximum height established for the applicable
subdistrict.
         c.   A Level II design review is required for open space height
transfers, historic preservation height transfers and public right-of-way
height transfers.
         d.   Multiple height bonuses or transfers may be applied to one (1)
site, however, the resulting height may not exceed the following maximums:
            (1)   Fifteen (15) stories maximum for properties within the South
Downtown, University, and Park Subdistricts.
            (2)   Twelve (12) stories maximum for properties within the West
Riverfront Subdistrict that have frontage along the Iowa River.
            (3)   Eight (8) stories maximum for properties within the Central
Crossings and South Gilbert Subdistricts.
            (4)   Five (5) stories maximum for properties within the Gilbert
Subdistrict and properties within the West Riverfront Subdistrict that do not

            (6)   In no case shall the building height exceed the maximum
height allowed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
         e.   All requests for bonus height shall meet the applicable approval
criteria. All proposals shall demonstrate excellence in building and site
design, use high quality building materials, and be designed in a manner that
contributes to the quality and character of the neighborhood. The resulting
development must meet all other applicable zoning standards. Bonus height is
granted solely at the discretion of the City based on the quality of the
proposal. For buildings receiving height transfers or granted bonus height,
additional upper floor stepbacks may be required to help reduce the mass and
scale of the building as it relates to surrounding development and public open
space.
      2.   Open Space Height Transfers: The following transfer of development
rights and corresponding height bonus provides an incentive for the development

         d.   Prior to issuance of the building permit, the owner must submit
an affidavit to the City that all designated dwelling units will be reserved
for and occupied by elders and/or persons with disabilities;
         e.   The units may be renter or owner occupied. If rented, the owner
shall maintain a valid rental permit, unless the use is licensed by the State
of Iowa; and
         f.   The City reserves the right to inspect the property to verify
compliance with these provisions. (Ord. 16-4675, 9-20-2016)
   H.   Minor Adjustments:
      1.   The FBC Committee may approve deviations from the building placement
and parking, loading, and service area placement standards set forth in section
14-2G-3, "Subdistrict Standards", of this article. Standards greater or lesser
than the ranges allowed may be approved in the following circumstances,
provided the approval criteria listed below are met: (Ord. 17-4731, 11-21-2017)
         a.   For publicly accessible outdoor plazas;
         b.   For irregular lots that make meeting the requirements impractical
or infeasible;
         c.   For buildings along Ralston Creek;
         d.   For liner buildings, civic, or institutional buildings where
unique building needs or site constraints make it difficult to fully comply
with the standards;
         e.   For buildings along pedestrian streets designed to maximize
access to and views of the Iowa River; or
         f.   For other special circumstances, provided that the intent of the
standard and the Downtown and Riverfront Crossings Master Plan or Central
District plan, whichever is applicable, is met. (Ord. 16-4675, 9-20-2016)
         g.   Approval criteria:
            (1)   There are unique characteristics of the site or neighboring
properties that lend to alternative design approaches or that make it difficult
or infeasible to meet the requirements; and
            (2)   The proposed placement of the building, parking, and service
areas fit the characteristics of the site and the surrounding neighborhood, are
consistent with the intent of the standard being modified and the goals of the
Downtown and Riverfront Crossings Master Plan or Central District plan, as
applicable, and will not detract from or be injurious to other property or
improvements in the vicinity. (Ord. 17-4731, 11-21-2017)
      2.   The FBC Committee may approve deviations from the facade continuity
requirements set forth in section
14-2G-3, "Subdistrict Standards", of this article, for buildings with
forecourts at primary building entries, open air pedestrian passageways
connecting public sidewalks to rear yard parking, or driveways on sites without
secondary street, cross parcel, or alley access to parking and service areas,
or for small or irregularly shaped lots where there is practical difficulty
meeting the standard. In such cases, additional and/or enhanced screening and
landscaping may be required to ensure a pleasant and comfortable pedestrian
environment along street frontages.
      3.   The FBC Committee may approve deviations from the requirements set
forth in section
14-2G-4, "Frontage Type Standards", of this article, to accommodate buildings
located on steeply sloped sites or within flood hazard zones, where meeting the
requirements is impractical or infeasible, or to make minor adjustments to
elements of a frontage to ensure they are proportional to the scale of a
building. If warranted and approved, deviations may include the following:
         a.   Floor height of stoops, porticoes, porches or terraces may exceed
the maximum;
         b.   The finished ground floor elevation of the building may exceed
the maximum;
         c.   Garden walls enclosing terraces or forecourts may exceed the
maximum height;
         d.   The terrace frontage may be configured as a stepped terrace with
two (2) levels above grade;
         e.   Allow additional width and depth for portico frontages in order
to create proportional entryways for large multi-dwelling or civic/
institutional buildings; or
         f.   Minor deviations from window coverage standards for storefront
frontages on small buildings located on corner lots, where full compliance on
both frontages may not be feasible.
      4.   Where accessibility standards cannot be met using the standards
herein, the FBC Committee may approve deviations to allow adherence to
Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) standards. Deviations may include
lowering the height requirements of frontages and finished ground floor
elevations, and accommodating wheelchair accessible ramps. (Ord. 16-4675, 9-20-
2016)
      5.   The FBC Committee may approve deviations from the facade stepback
requirements set forth in section
14-2G-3, "Subdistrict Standards", of this article or building design standards
set forth in subsection F of this section, provided the following approval
criteria are met:
         a.   The building includes an alternative design solution that equally
or better meets the intent of the specific standard being modified; and
         b.   The building is uniquely designed to fit the characteristics of
the site and the surrounding neighborhood, is consistent with the goals of the
Downtown and Riverfront Crossings Master Plan or Central District plan, as
applicable, and will not detract from or be injurious to other property or
improvements in the vicinity; and
         c.   The building demonstrates excellence in architectural design and
use of durable materials; and
         d.   There are unique characteristics of the site or neighboring
properties that lend to alternative design approaches, or that make it
difficult or infeasible to meet the requirements; or the proposed building is
designed true to a specific architectural style and adherence to the building
design standards would be impractical or compromise the building's
architectural integrity; and
         e.   For requests for waivers of an upper floor stepback requirement,
the building must include an alternative means of visually breaking up the
vertical plane of the building.
      6.   In mid-block locations, the FBC Committee may waive the minimum
building height standard to allow for a 2nd story pedestrian courtyard (an area
surrounded by building facades on at least 3 sides), provided a screen wall
that is at least as tall as the second story building facade is constructed co-
planar or recessed a maximum of three feet (3') from the street-facing facade.
The screen wall may either be constructed of high quality building materials
that faithfully imitate an architecturally- finished exterior building facade
with complementary window openings and articulation, or constructed as a
decorative screen wall with a semi-transparent, open pattern, where the top of
the screen wall aligns generally with the top of the second story. For purposes
of regulating signage, the screen wall will be considered a building wall.

with an application for a preliminary plat (
15-2-2).
      2.   Approval Criteria: The following criteria must be met or determined
to not be applicable to rezone to a Form-Based Zone:
         a.   The rezoning demonstrates compliance with the Future Land Use Map
of the Comprehensive Plan and any district plan, as applicable, including
consistency between the land use designations and the proposed zones.
Variations from the Future Land Use Map may be approved for Form-Based Zones
where sensitive areas are present, or where circumstances have changed and/or
additional information or factors have come to light such that the proposed
amendment is in the public interest.
         b.   The rezoning demonstrates that the zones are organized in such a
manner to respond appropriately to the various site conditions. When amending
zone boundaries, more intense zones shall be organized around a neighborhood
feature. Examples include a major street (such as a main street or edge drive),
civic space, a transit stop, a civic building, or other locations suitable for
greater intensities.
         c.   The rezoning demonstrates that transitions are appropriate
between Form-Based Zones, such as zone transitions occurring within the block
or across alleys to provide the same zoning on facing blocks.
         d.   The rezoning demonstrates it is designed to suit specific
topographical, environmental, site layout, and design constraints unique to the
site.
   E.   Neighborhood Plan:
      1.   The Neighborhood Plan, submitted as an accompanying document with
the final plat, ensures compliance with the standards in this Article. It shall
substantially conform to the Future Land Use Map included in the Comprehensive
Plan and District Plan, as applicable.
      2.   The Neighborhood Plan shall include the following components in plan
view on application forms provided by the department, along with any additional
information as requested by the City:
         a.   Identify all applicable Form-Based Zones, lots, and design sites.
         b.   Identify all proposed building types pursuant to section
14-2H-6 (Building Type Standards) and proposed frontage types pursuant to
section
14-2H-8 (Frontages) for each lot and/or design site.
         c.   Apply thoroughfares in an interconnected network and identify
proposed thoroughfare types pursuant to sections
14-2H-9 (Thoroughfare Type Standards) and
15-3-2 (Streets And Circulation), including all proposed passages (
14-2H-9L) and/or alleys (
14-2H-9K).
         d.   Identify natural open space and civic space types pursuant to
section
14-2H-5 (Civic Space Type Standards) and delineate all proposed buildings,
paved areas, trees, and/or landscaping in civic spaces.
         e.   Identify all connections to existing streets and sidewalks and
lots and design sites on adjacent properties in conformance with block
standards pursuant to section
15-3-4 (Layout Of Blocks And Lots).
      3.   Following adoption of the final plat, the following changes to the
Neighborhood Plan may be administratively approved concurrently with building
permit or site plan review. All requested changes from the original
Neighborhood Plan must be identified on site plans and building plans.
         a.   Substituting one building type for another where the lot and/or
design site meets the requirements of sections

14-2H-2: ZONES:
   A.   Purpose: This section establishes the Form-Based Zones that implement
the City’s Comprehensive Plan to generate and support the intended variety and
physical character.
   B.   Sub-Zones: Sub-zones are slightly modified versions of the base Form-
Based Zone. This chapter includes one (1) type of sub-zone:
      1.   Open: The open sub-zone can provide additional flexibility to design
sites located at or near intersections that function or can function as a
neighborhood node of non-residential uses. The open sub-zone is indicated in
the future land use maps of the Comprehensive Plan and is used for either or
both of the following purposes:
         a.   To allow more uses than the base zone allows in specific areas
but within the same form and character of the base zone; and/or
         b.   To more easily allow certain uses that are already allowed in the
base zone.
   C.   T3 Neighborhood Edge Zone (T3NE):

General note: The illustrations above are intended to provide a brief overview
of the zone and are descriptive in nature.
      1.   Intent:
         a.   A walkable neighborhood environment of detached, small- to-large
building footprint, low-intensity housing choices from house large, duplex
side-by-side to cottage court, supporting and within short walking distance of
neighborhood-serving retail, food and service uses.
         b.   The following are appropriate form elements in the zone:
            (1)   House-scale buildings.
            (2)   Detached buildings.
            (3)   Medium-to-large design site width.
            (4)   Small-to-large building footprint.
            (5)   Medium-to-large front setbacks.
            (6)   Medium side setbacks.
            (7)   Up to 2.5 stories.
            (8)   Porch, dooryard and stoop frontage types.
      2.   Sub-Zone(s): None.

14-2H-5: CIVIC SPACE TYPE STANDARDS:
   A.   Purpose: This section establishes the standards applicable to land in
the public realm (publicly or privately owned) for civic gathering purposes,
including civic spaces and civic buildings. These standards supplement the
standards for each Form-Based Zone.
   B.   General Civic Space Type Standards:
      1.   Standards And Characteristics: Each civic space is described as to
its purpose and intent along with standards and characteristics regarding
general physical character, uses, size and location. Characteristics are
considered standards unless stated otherwise.
      2.   Process: Civic spaces are delineated during the subdivision process
(Title 15) and are finalized in the Neighborhood Plan (14-2H-1D). These areas
shall comply with the future land use maps of the Comprehensive Plan.   
   3.   Open Space Required: As required by Chapter 14-5K (Neighborhood Open
Space Requirements), development sites are required to dedicate land to the
City for public open space or pay a fee in-lieu to be determined with the City.
Civic space may be privately or publicly owned. However, private civic space
does not satisfy neighborhood open space obligations.
      4.   Public Access And Visibility: Public access and visibility are
required along public parks, civic uses, and natural open spaces, including
creeks and drainages and stormwater management areas as required through access
easements granted during the subdivision process. Civic spaces shall be fronted
by:
         a.   Single-loaded frontage streets (with development on one side and
open space on the other);
         b.   Bike and pedestrian paths; or
         c.   Other methods of frontage that provide similar access and
visibility to the open space allowed in the zone.
      5.   Building Frontage Along Or Adjacent To A Civic Space: The facades on
building design sites attached to or across a street from a civic space shall
be designed as a "front" on to the civic space, in compliance with Item 5
(Building Placement) and Item 8 (Frontages) of the zone.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3614.png]
      6.    Stormwater Management Through Civic Space: Civic spaces in Form-
Based Zones should serve the additional purpose of helping to contribute to
stormwater management of new development. This may be accomplished as follows:
         a.   Stormwater is to be directed to civic space(s).
         b.   Except for plazas, playgrounds, and passages, each civic space
should accommodate stormwater while primarily being designed as a gathering
space for people.
      7.   Commercial Uses And Civic Spaces: Commercial use of civic spaces may
be allowed for Outdoor Service Areas (
4-3-1).
      8.   Photos: All photos are illustrative, not regulatory.
   C.    Greenway:

      1.    Description: A linear space three (3) or more blocks in length for
community gathering, bicycling, running, or strolling, defined by tree-lined
streets typically forming a one-way couplet on its flanks and by the fronting
buildings across the street. Versions of this civic space type have a street
only on one side in response to site conditions that prevent the one-way
couplet. Greenways serve an important role as a green connector between
destinations.

(Ord. 21-4866, 11-16-2021)
14-2H-6: BUILDING TYPE STANDARDS:
   A.    Purpose: This section sets forth standards for development of
individual building types to achieve the intended physical character of each
zone and provide housing choices and small businesses as amenities within
walkable neighborhoods.
   B.   General Building Type Standards:
      1.   Scale: Building types are categorized into house-scale buildings and
block-scale buildings. The individual types within these two (2) categories are
determined by the intended physical character of each Form-Based Zone. See
Figure 14-2H-6B-1 (Example Of House-Scale And Block-Scale Buildings) for
further details.
      2.   Design Site Size: The design site size standards for each building
type in section
14-2H-2 (Zones) generate pedestrian-oriented buildings that accommodate the
automobile while not letting it visually dominate the fronts of buildings and
streetscapes. The design site size standards identify the range of design site
sizes on which the given building type is allowed to be built.
      3.   Building Types Per Design Site: Each design site shall contain only
one primary building type, except as follows:
         a.   Where allowed by the zone and as allowed in sub-section
14-2H-6C (Carriage House), one (1) carriage house is allowed in addition to the
primary building type;
         b.   Certain building types may consist of multiple individual
buildings per design site as specified in Item 2 of each building type. For an
example of a building type where a design site may include multiple individual
buildings, see Cottage Court (
14-2H-6H).
      4.   Building Types Per Parcel: More than one (1) building type is
allowed on a parcel that contains multiple design sites that meet the standards
of this section. See Figure 14-2H-6B-2 (Example of Multiple Design Sites On An
Existing Parcel).
      5.   Location Of Frontage: Each building type shall have at least one (1)
frontage type along the front street, side street or a civic space. The Cottage
Court building is only required to have a frontage type on the court. The
primary building entrance shall be through said frontage type.
      6.   Diversity Of Building Types: Except in the T4MS zone, there shall be
a mix of at least two (2) different primary building types within each block,

14-2H-8: FRONTAGE TYPE STANDARDS:
   A.   Purpose: This section establishes standards for all frontages.
Frontages are the components of a building that provide the transition and
interface between the public realm (street and sidewalk) and the private realm
(yard or building).
   B.   General Frontage Type Standards:
      1.   Nomenclature: The names of the frontage types indicate their
particular configuration or function and are not intended to limit uses within
the associated building. For example, a porch may be used by non-residential
uses including, but not limited to a restaurant or office as allowed by the
zone.
      2.   Allowable Frontage Types:
         a.   Frontage types not listed in Item 8 (Frontages) of the zone are
not allowed in that zone.
         b.   Each building may have multiple frontage types in compliance with
the allowed types in Item 4 (Allowed Frontage Types) of each building type.
Frontage types not listed in Item 4 (Allowed Frontage Types) of the building
type are not allowed on that building type.
      3.   Location: Each frontage type shall be located in compliance with the
facade zone per Item 5 (Building Placement) of the zone (section
14-2H-2) and with the building type location of frontage standard (sub-section
14-2H-6B-5).
      4.   Entries And Access:
         a.   Along street frontages and passages, sliding doors are prohibited
as building entries. Sliding doors may not be used as a primary means of
entrance to any building or residential unit.
         b.   Access to entrance doors of individual dwelling units located
above the ground floor level must be provided from an enclosed lobby or
corridor and stairway. Unenclosed or partially enclosed exterior stairways are
not allowed as the primary means of access to dwelling units located above the
ground level floor of the building. This provision does not preclude the use of
fire egress structures.
         c.   Dwelling units on the ground floor and their entrances must be
connected to adjacent public right-of-ways, and to parking areas and other on-
site facilities.
      5.   Diversity Of Frontage Types: Except in the T4MS zone, there shall be
a mix of at least two (2) different frontage types within each block, using
only the types allowed in the zone.

14-2H-9: THOROUGHFARE TYPE STANDARDS:
   A.   Purpose:
      1.   The provisions of this section are established to accomplish the
following:
         a.   Provide a range of thoroughfare types to support the intended
physical character of each zone.
         b.   Provide only thoroughfares that are multi-modal and
interconnected in a network that disperses vehicular traffic with multiple
routes to destinations.
         c.   Ensure that streets serve the needs of all users (automobiles,
transit and service vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists).
   B.   General Thoroughfare Type Standards:
      1.   This section identifies the allowed thoroughfare types consistent
with the intended physical character of each Form-Based Zone.
      2.   The individual standards of each thoroughfare type in this section
may be adjusted as part of the subdivision process. In considering adjustments,
the Director of Public Works and the Director of Neighborhood and Development
Services shall find that the proposed adjustment meets all of the following
criteria:
         a.   Supports the intended physical character of the zone abutting the
thoroughfare(s).
         b.   Maintains multiple modes of transportation (transit, pedestrians,
bicycles, automobiles).
         c.   Maintains sidewalks at least six feet (6') wide.
         d.   Maintains on-street parking for a majority of each block face.
         e.   Maintains regularly spaced street trees.
      3.   Street trees shall be installed in the right-of-way by the owner.
         a.   Where adjacent property will remain undeveloped, street trees
shall be planted prior to acceptance of public improvements.
         b.   Where adjacent property will be developed, trees shall be planted
prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for each adjacent lot, with the
following exception:
            (1)   Where street trees cannot be installed prior to occupancy or
commencement of a use due to seasonal conditions that may reduce survivability,
the building official may grant a delay of installation until the seasonal
calendar dates of June 1 or November 1, whichever occurs first, and the
property owner must place in an escrow account, established with the City, an
amount which will cover one hundred ten percent (110%) of the estimated cost of
plants and installation.

CHAPTER 3
OVERLAY ZONES
ARTICLE A. PLANNED DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY ZONE (OPD)
SECTION:
14-3A-1: Purpose
14-3A-2: Applicability
14-3A-3: Approval Procedures
14-3A-4: Approval Criteria
14-3A-5: Approval Criteria For Sensitive Areas Developments
14-3A-6: Additional Approval Criteria For Manufactured Housing Parks
14-3A-7: Exceptions
14-3A-1: PURPOSE:
The planned development overlay zone (OPD) is established to permit flexibility
in the use and design of structures and land in situations where conventional
development may be inappropriate and where modification to requirements of the
underlying zone will not be contrary to the intent and purpose of this title,
inconsistent with the comprehensive plan, as amended, or harmful to the
surrounding neighborhood. The OPD zone is intended to:
   A.   Provide flexibility in the design, placement and clustering of
buildings; mixture of land uses; use of open space; traffic circulation and
parking; and related site and design considerations;
   B.   Encourage the preservation and best use of existing landscape features
through development that is sensitive to the natural features of the
surrounding area;
   C.   Promote efficient land use with smaller utility and street networks
while maintaining pedestrian oriented street frontages;
   D.   Encourage and preserve opportunities for energy efficient development;
   E.   Promote an attractive and safe living environment compatible with
surrounding residential developments;
   F.   Provide an alternative method for redeveloping older residential areas;
and
   G.   Encourage infill development. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-3A-2: APPLICABILITY:
A planned development overlay rezoning may be requested, provided the property
meets the zoning and size limitations listed below and falls into one or more
of the following categories of planned developments:
   A.   Zoning:
      1.   The property on which the planned development is requested must be
zoned residential or commercial, except as specified in subsection A2 of this
section.
      2.   A sensitive areas development is allowed or may be required on any
property, regardless of the underlying base zone, in order to protect regulated
sensitive features while facilitating reasonable development of the remainder
of the property for uses allowed in the underlying base zone.
   B.   Size Limitation:
      1.   To qualify for a planned development overlay rezoning, properties
must contain an undeveloped area of two (2) acres or more, except for the
following situations.
      2.   Development of areas containing less than two (2) acres but more
than one acre qualify for a planned development overlay rezoning where the
existence of environmentally sensitive areas or natural features, the age of
existing development, scenic assets or the fact that the land is completely
surrounded by development makes a planned development more appropriate and
efficient than conventional development. Except as allowed in subsection B3 of
this section, commercial and institutional uses are prohibited in planned
developments containing less than two (2) acres.
      3.   When a sensitive areas development is required, there is no size
limitation.
   C.   Categories Of Planned Developments:
      1.   Sensitive Areas Development: A planned development containing
regulated sensitive features according to the provisions of
chapter 5, article I, "Sensitive Lands And Features", of this title.
      2.   Conservation Development: A planned development in which a portion
of the land area is designated as permanent open space for the purpose of
preserving natural or cultural features and resources as follows:
         a.   Development that protects or preserves environmental features not
otherwise regulated by this title, but which are significant to the
neighborhood or community. For example, such a plan might preserve an important
view shed, protect wildlife areas or other unique natural features of the site.
         b.   Development that preserves cultural and historic features such as
historic sites, historic buildings, and archaeological sites, particularly
those that are designated or that would qualify for historic designation
according to the provisions of
chapter 3, article B, "Historic District And Conservation District Overlay", of
this chapter.
         c.   Development in which the site and the buildings are specifically
oriented and designed for the conservation of energy and other resources.
      3.   Neo-Traditional Development: A planned development that is
characterized by lot configurations, street patterns, streetscapes, and
neighborhood amenities similar to neighborhoods platted prior to 1950.
      4.   Mixed Use Development: A planned development that contains a mix of
residential and commercial uses designed in such a manner that such uses
complement one another to form a more urban neighborhood.
      5.   Infill Development: Development or redevelopment on land that is
surrounded by existing development where the constraints of the existing
infrastructure, buildings, or site make it more difficult to develop the
property.
      6.   Alternative Ownership Development:
         a.   Manufactured Housing Parks: Manufactured housing parks, where the
dwelling unit owner leases the lot on which the dwelling is located from a
separate individual or organization.
         b.   Condominium Development: Condominium developments, where multiple
units are located on the same lot. Dwelling units are typically owned
individually and the structures, common areas, and facilities are owned by all
dwelling unit owners on a proportional, undivided basis. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-
2005)
14-3A-3: APPROVAL PROCEDURES:
Applications for planned developments must be submitted according to the
procedures for planned development overlay rezonings as set forth in chapter 8,
"Review And Approval Procedures", of this title. The proposed development must
meet the applicable approval criteria listed in the following sections. (Ord.
05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-3A-4: APPROVAL CRITERIA:
Applications for all planned developments will be reviewed for compliance with
the standards of this section, except for sensitive areas developments that
comply with all underlying zoning and subdivision regulations. If, however,
modifications to the underlying zoning or subdivision regulations have been
requested as a part of a sensitive areas development, the standards of this
section will apply.
   A.   General Standards:
      1.   The density and design of the planned development will be compatible
with and/or complementary to adjacent development in terms of land use,
building mass and scale, relative amount of open space, traffic circulation and
general layout.
      2.   The development will not overburden existing streets and utilities.
      3.   The development will not adversely affect views, light and air,
property values and privacy of neighboring properties any more than would a
conventional development.
      4.   The combination of land uses and building types and any variation
from the underlying zoning requirements or from city street standards will be
in the public interest, in harmony with the purposes of this title, and with
other building regulations of the city.
   B.   Ownership: At the time of preliminary OPD plan approval, the developer
must submit evidence of ownership of the property to be developed or of a
legally binding executed option agreement for purchasing all of the property.
   C.   Land Uses Allowed: A mixture of land uses are allowed in planned
developments that might not otherwise be allowed with the underlying zoning.
Land uses proposed must meet all of the dimensional and site development
standards of the underlying base zone, unless a modification is specifically
approved during the planned development process. The following provisions
provide standards for uses that might not otherwise be allowed in the
underlying zone:
      1.   Uses Allowed On Properties Zoned Residential: A mixture of housing
types, including single-family, two-family, and multi- family dwellings, is
encouraged in all residentially zoned planned developments. To help assure that
the various building types are compatible with one another, similar
architectural elements, scale, massing, and materials should be used and the
following standards must be followed:
         a.   Single-Family And Two-Family Uses:
            (1)   Unless modified as allowed in subsection C1a(3) of this
section, attached and detached zero lot line dwellings must comply with the
specific approval criteria for attached and detached zero lot line dwellings in
the RS-12 zone as set forth in
chapter 4, article B, "Minor Modifications, Variances, Special Exceptions, And
Provisional Uses", of this title. Townhouse style condominiums must also meet
these approval criteria. In addition, the following provisions apply:
               (A)   Main entrances to dwelling units must be clearly
demarcated by one of the following means: covered porch or canopy; transom and
sidelight windows; pilasters and pediment; or other significant architectural
treatment that emphasizes main entrances. Simple trim around the doorway does
not meet this standard.
               (B)   If multiple townhouse style condominium buildings are
located on a common lot, the buildings must be separated by a distance of at
least twenty feet (20').
               (C)   If the underlying base zone is RS-5 or RS-8, the
requirement that attached single-family dwellings are only allowed on corner
lots with each main entrance oriented toward a different street applies in all
planned developments in order to encourage a mix of residential uses. If
multiple two-unit buildings will be located on a common lot, imaginary lot
lines must be illustrated on the plan for purposes of determining where the
corner units would be located according to base zone standards. This corner lot
standard may only be waived if convincing evidence is submitted that the
configuration of the property or other existing physical condition of the lot
makes the application of this standard impractical. If this standard is waived
the units must be designed and located in a manner that prevents monotony by
varying aspects such as facade detailing, window pattern, building materials,
and color.
            (2)   Two-family uses must comply with the standards for two-family
uses as set forth in
chapter 4, article B, "Minor Modifications, Variances, Special Exceptions, And
Provisional Uses", of this title. In addition, the following provisions will
apply:
               (A)   Main entrances to dwelling units must be clearly
demarcated by one of the following means: covered porch or canopy; transom and
sidelight windows; pilasters and pediment; or other significant architectural
treatment that emphasizes main entrances. Simple trim around the doorway does
not meet this standard.
               (B)   If multiple two-family buildings are located on a common
lot, the buildings must be separated by a distance of at least twenty feet
(20').
               (C)   If the underlying base zone is RS-5 or RS-8, the
requirement that two-family uses are only allowed on corner lots with each main
entrance oriented toward a different street applies in all planned developments
in order to encourage a mix of residential uses. If multiple two-unit buildings
will be located on a common lot, imaginary lot lines must be illustrated on the
plan for purposes of determining where the corner units would be located
according to base zone standards. This corner lot standard may only be waived
if convincing evidence is submitted that the configuration of the property or
other existing physical condition of the lot makes the application of this
standard impractical. If this standard is waived the units must be designed and
located in a manner that prevents monotony by varying aspects such as facade
detailing, window pattern, building materials, and color.
               (D)   Garages and off street parking areas must be located and
designed so that they do not dominate the streetscape according to the
standards specified in subsection K1c(2) of this section.
            (3)   Minimum lot area, lot width, lot frontage, and setbacks
required in the underlying base zone may be reduced in order to provide the
opportunity for a variety of single-family and two- family dwelling types.
However, any such modification to the underlying zoning requirements must be
noted on the plan and the development must comply with the standards listed in
subsection E, "Zoning Requirements", of this section.
         b.   Multi-Family And Group Living Uses: If multi-family or group
living uses are proposed, they must comply with the multi-family site
development standards set forth in
chapter 2, article B, "Multi-Family Residential Zones", of this title. When
located adjacent to single-family and duplex structures, multi-family buildings
should be of a scale, massing and architectural style that is compatible with
adjacent lower density residential development.
         c.   Commercial Uses: Commercial uses are not permitted in planned
developments that are less than two (2) acres in size on property that is zoned
residential. In larger residentially zoned developments, where commercial uses
are proposed, they must comply with the following standards:
            (1)   Any commercial development proposed must comply with the CN-
1 site development standards as set forth in
chapter 2, article C, "Commercial Zones", of this title.
            (2)   Mixed use buildings, which include residential dwellings and
commercial uses, are encouraged.
            (3)   Any commercial development proposed must be of a scale suited
to serve the residents of the immediate development and adjacent neighborhoods.
            (4)   Commercial development should be designed to serve as a focal
point of the overall development and is encouraged to incorporate open spaces
such as town squares.
            (5)   Commercial development should be designed so that the
material, massing and architectural style is compatible with adjacent
residential development.
         d.   Institutional Uses: Institutional uses, such as educational
facilities, religious institutions, and childcare centers, are only allowed if
they are listed as an allowed use in the underlying base zone.
      2.   Uses Allowed On Property Zoned Commercial:
         a.   On property zoned commercial, development must comply with the
commercial site development standards of the underlying base zone as set forth
in
chapter 2, article C, "Commercial Zones", of this title.
         b.   Residential uses are only allowed in such planned developments if
residential uses are listed as an allowed use in the underlying commercial
zone. Residential uses must comply with the requirements specified for such
uses in the underlying base zone, unless modifications are specifically
approved through the planned development process.
      3.   Uses Allowed On Property Zoned Industrial Or Research Park: A
planned development is not allowed on properties that are zoned industrial or
research park unless the property contains regulated sensitive areas according
to the provisions of
chapter 5, article I, "Sensitive Lands And Features", of this title. Uses
allowed in such a planned development are limited to those uses allowed in the
underlying base zone. Such uses must comply with the requirements and standards
specified in the underlying base zone, unless modifications are specifically
approved through the planned development process.
   D.   Maximum Residential Density:
      1.   The City will approve a residential density based on the underlying
density allowed in the base zone and what is compatible with the natural
topography of the site and with surrounding development. The residential
density for a planned development may not exceed the value specified in
table 3A-1, located at the end of this subsection, except as allowed by
subsection
14-3A-4D3 or section 14-4F. Actual residential density allowed, however, may be
less than the maximum expressed in the table due to the topographical
constraints of the property, the scale of the project relative to adjacent
development, and the dimensional, site development, and other requirements of
this title.
      2.   For purposes of this article, "net land area" is defined as total
land area minus public and private street rights of way. When calculating net
land area, the land area devoted to alley and private rear lane rights of way
need not be subtracted from the total land area.
      3.   Sustainability Density Bonus: The maximum residential density that
is required by
Table 3A-1 may be increased by ten percent (10%) of the applicable requirement
for each of the following provisions that is met, up to a maximum of twenty-
five percent (25%). This bonus may be used in conjunction with subsection
14-5A-4F10 (Sustainability Parking Reduction).
         a.   A solar energy system is installed onsite where the size is equal
to at least forty percent (40%) of the surface area of the roofs of all
buildings.
         b.   All uses within the development utilize electricity for one
hundred percent (100%) of their regular energy consumption after construction.
         c.   All buildings within the development are constructed to the most
current edition of the International Energy Conservation Code standards
published by the International Code Council.

*Density bonuses are available in the PRM zone that would increase the allowed
density beyond the figure in this table.
   E.   Zoning Requirements:
      1.   All planned developments must comply with all the applicable
requirements and standards of this title, unless specifically waived or
modified under the provisions of this article.
      2.   Variations in the dimensional requirements of the underlying base
zone may be necessary in order to facilitate the provision of desired
neighborhood amenities or open space; to preserve or protect natural, historic,
or cultural features; to achieve compatibility with surrounding development; or
to create a distinctive or innovative neighborhood environment for area
residents. Therefore, the dimensional requirements of the underlying base zone
may be modified or waived, provided the standards for modified developments set
forth in subsection K of this section are met.
      3.   In order to accommodate the various types of manufactured housing,
the minimum building width specified in the underlying base zone may be waived
for manufactured housing parks.
      4.   In order to avoid development on or near regulated sensitive areas,
parking requirements for commercial and industrial uses may be reduced.
However, parking requirements for residential uses within the development may
not be reduced other than through a special exception approved by the board of
adjustment according to the procedures and approval criteria set forth in this
title for such an exception.
   F.   Dedication Of Public Right Of Way: All proposed dedications of land for
public use, including land dedicated for recreational use, shall be approved,
in writing, by appropriate departments of the city prior to city council
approval of the planned development. All land dedications for public use shall
conform to the requirements of city ordinances.
   G.   Streets: Planned developments shall provide for the continuation and
extension of streets and public sidewalks in accordance with current city
standards. Requests for modifications to city street standards will be
evaluated according to the provisions of subsection K of this section.
   H.   Pedestrian Facilities:
      1.   On Site Pedestrian Facilities: To assure that pedestrians have
adequate access throughout a development, a pedestrian network plan must be
developed so that residents and visitors have access to public streets and
sidewalks, building entrances, parking areas, shared open spaces, natural
areas, and other amenities.
      2.   Pedestrian Facilities Along Streets: Sidewalks must be provided
along all public and private streets according to city standards. Particular
emphasis must be given to maintaining or establishing pedestrian oriented
street frontages. Pedestrian oriented streets are those that are designed to
provide a safe, comfortable environment for pedestrians. Important elements
include sidewalks that are separated and buffered from vehicular traffic with
limited interruption from driveways; the provision of street trees; and
buildings that visually address the street with visible doors and windows.
Buildings with blank facades along the street, long stretches of repetitive
building designs, surface parking lots, and other expanses of paving are
contrary to a pedestrian oriented street.
   I.   Tree Requirements: For any planned development that contains attached
single-family dwellings, two-family uses, multi-family uses, group living uses,
or lease lots for manufactured housing, a landscape plan must be submitted with
the preliminary plan illustrating how the requirements of
chapter 5, article E, "Landscaping And Tree Standards", of this title will be
met.
   J.   Open Space:
      1.   Public Open Space Requirement:
         a.   Residentially zoned planned developments must dedicate land for
public open space, pay a fee in lieu of land for public open space, or a
combination thereof, as set forth in
chapter 5, article K, "Neighborhood Open Space Requirements", of this title.
         b.   In the event that the dedicated open space land will contain
amenities, such as trails, that will serve the residents of the proposed
development, the city may require such amenities be installed by the developer
with the costs shared jointly by the developer and city based on an estimate of
proportional use by the residents of the proposed development. The timing of
such improvements shall be determined and set forth in a development agreement
between the developer and the city.
      2.   Private Shared Open Space:
         a.   In the event open space land, in addition to that required by
chapter 5, article K of this title, is to be retained under private ownership,
the developer must submit a legally binding instrument setting forth the
procedures to be followed for maintaining the areas and for financing
maintenance costs. Such costs shall be shared by all owners of property located
within the planned development through the use of an owners' association or
other entity satisfactory to the city. Any costs incurred by the city due to
failure of this designated entity to meet its obligations under the provisions
of this subsection J2a shall be assessed against, and will become a lien on all
individual properties located within the planned development in favor of the
city.
         b.   The intended purpose of any private, shared open space proposed
for a planned development must be set forth in the plan. Such land must be
suitably improved for its intended purpose. The timing of such improvements
shall be set forth in a legally binding instrument as described in the
subsection J2a of this section.
      3.   Protected Sensitive Areas: Protected sensitive areas and their
required buffers should be incorporated into the design of the development as
public open space dedicated to the city or private open space held in common by
an owners' association. Where protected features and/or their required buffers
are incorporated into individual lots, they must be included within a recorded
conservation easement or protected by restrictive covenants with the city that
are recorded and run with the land.
   K.   Standards For Modified Developments: The following standards are to be
used by the city when evaluating a planned development when modifications to
the underlying zoning requirements or to city street standards are requested.
For single-family uses, townhouse style multi-family uses and two-family uses
that will be located on a common lot, imaginary lot lines must be illustrated
on the plan for purposes of determining when modifications to the underlying
dimensional standards are being requested. When applying the standards, the
city will weigh the specific circumstances surrounding each application, and
strive for development solutions that best promote the spirit, intent and
purpose of this article and of
chapter 5, article I, "Sensitive Lands And Features", of this title and of the
goals, policies and objectives of the adopted district plan for the area in
which the proposed development is located, while permitting development of the
property for reasonable, beneficial uses. Modifications that the city deems as
contrary to public safety will not be approved.
      1.   Modifications To Zoning Requirements:
         a.   Minimum setbacks may be reduced if the following conditions are
met:
            (1)   The setbacks proposed will provide adequate light, air, and
privacy between dwellings and between dwellings and public rights of way.
            (2)   Sufficient setbacks are incorporated to provide the
opportunity for adequate private open space for each dwelling unit.
            (3)   The setbacks proposed will provide sufficient area for
utilities and street trees.
            (4)   If front setbacks are reduced, measures should be taken to
preserve privacy within residential dwellings and to provide a transition
between the public right of way and private property. To ensure privacy within
single-family and two-family dwellings for which setbacks are reduced, the
first floor must be elevated at least thirty inches (30") above the grade of
the adjacent public sidewalk. Other methods to increase privacy are also
encouraged, such as use of front porches.
            (5)   Residential buildings that are located in close proximity to
each other must be designed to preserve privacy. This can be achieved by
placement of windows to prevent direct views into the windows of adjacent
residential dwelling units. In addition, balconies and air conditioning units
may not be located along a building wall that is within twenty feet (20') of a
building wall of an adjacent principal building on the same lot, if the wall of
the adjacent building contains window or door openings into dwelling units.
Proximity of building walls will be subject to all current building code fire
protection requirements.
         b.   The maximum building height and building coverage may be modified
or waived, provided the design of the development results in sufficient light
and air circulation for each building and adequate, accessible open space for
all residents of the development. When the underlying base zone is single-
family residential, at least thirty five percent (35%) of the net land area in
a planned development shall remain free of buildings, parking and vehicular
maneuvering areas.
         c.   Minimum lot area, lot width, and lot frontage requirements may be
reduced. However, due to the concentration of dwelling units that will occur if
these dimensional requirements are reduced, the following conditions must be
met:
            (1)   The proposed modifications will not result in increased
traffic congestion or a reduction in neighborhood traffic circulation. To
mitigate for the concentration of dwellings, shorter block lengths may be
appropriate, and the location of driveways and pedestrian facilities must be
carefully planned.
            (2)   Garages and off street parking areas must be located so that
they do not dominate the streetscape. Alley or private rear lane access will be
required, unless garages are recessed behind the front facade of the dwelling
in a manner that allows the residential portion of the dwelling to predominate
along the street.
 Figure 3A.1 below illustrates some options for garage placement for detached
and attached dwelling units. Other options meeting these standards are also
acceptable.

            (3)   If garages are located with access to the street, the
development must be designed so that there is adequate right of way and front
yard area available to accommodate street trees and front yard landscaping. The
widths of driveways may need to be reduced and garages set back an adequate
distance to accommodate these elements.
      2.   Modifications To Street Standards:
         a.   Right Of Way Width: Street right of way widths may be reduced
below those otherwise required by the subdivision regulations if the proposed
planned development provides sufficient area within the right of way for
required street trees and public and private utilities.
         b.   Pavement Widths For Local Streets: Requests for reductions to
street pavement widths for local streets will be considered if streets are
designed to promote pedestrian oriented frontages and safe access for emergency
vehicles. For example, this might be achieved through the use of alleys or
private rear lanes. Depending on the width of the proposed street and the
anticipated traffic, additional off street parking clusters may be required.
Any separate off street parking areas must be screened to the S2 standard.
         c.   Private Streets:
            (1)   Private streets in single-family and two-family residential
areas are discouraged. Requests for private streets in these areas will be
carefully scrutinized and will only be approved if the proposed private street
serves as a shared access to a cluster or small group of housing units and does
not support any through traffic. In addition, adequate provisions must be made
for street maintenance, snow removal, and garbage service according to the
provisions listed in subsection K2c(3) of this section.
            (2)   Private streets in multi-family, commercial, and industrial
areas may be allowed; provided, that the responsibilities for maintenance, snow
removal, and garbage service is clearly established according to the provisions
of subsection K2c(3) of this section.
            (3)   If private streets are approved, the developer must submit a
legally binding instrument setting forth the procedures to be followed for
maintaining private streets and providing garbage service and snow removal, and
for financing these services. Such costs shall be shared by all owners of
property located within the planned development through the use of an owners'
association or other entity satisfactory to the city. Any costs incurred by the
city due to failure of this designated entity to meet its obligations under the
provisions of this subsection K2c(3) shall be assessed against, and will become
a lien on all individual properties located within the planned development in
favor of the city.
   L.   Other Conditions: Other conditions may be imposed if found necessary to
protect and promote the best interests of the surrounding property or the
neighborhood. Such conditions include, but are not limited to, the following:
      1.   Improvement of traffic circulation for vehicles and pedestrians in
the proposed development and adjoining properties and streets.
      2.   Specific landscaping requirements to maintain privacy or reduce
impacts on adjoining properties.
      3.   Joint use of private open space or amenities by adjoining property
owners. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd. Ord. 06-4245, 12-12-2006; Ord. 09-4366,
12-1-2009; Ord. 23-4893, 1-24-2023; Ord. 23-4914, 11-6-2023)
14-3A-5: APPROVAL CRITERIA FOR SENSITIVE AREAS DEVELOPMENTS:
For properties containing regulated sensitive features, a sensitive areas
development plan must be submitted that demonstrates compliance with the
applicable standards of
chapter 5, article I, "Sensitive Lands And Features", of this title. (Ord. 05-
4186, 12-15-2005)
14-3A-6: ADDITIONAL APPROVAL CRITERIA FOR MANUFACTURED HOUSING PARKS:
A manufactured housing park must comply with the following standards:
   A.   Minimum Area: The development must be at least two (2) acres in size.
   B.   Lot Requirements: The plan must clearly delineate individual lease lots
within the development. Each individual lease lot must meet the dimensional
standards of the underlying base zone, except for variations approved through
the planned development process as set forth in this article.
   C.   Additional Setback Requirements: A thirty foot (30') setback must be
provided between any dwelling unit and the edge of the planned development
except where abutting an arterial street, in which case, a forty foot (40')
building setback is required.
   D.   Minimum Space Between Units: At least a twenty foot (20') building
separation between manufactured housing units shall be provided, except with
respect to manufactured housing units parked end to end. End to end separation
must be at least fifteen feet (15').
   E.   Parking: Nine feet by eighteen feet (9' x 18') hard surfaced off street
parking spaces shall be provided at the rate of two (2) parking spaces per
unit. At least one off street parking space shall be located on each
manufactured housing lease lot. The other required parking space may be located
in a common parking area with convenient access to the manufactured housing
unit. Parking spaces may not be located in the front setback or within ten feet
(10') of an adjacent manufactured housing unit. Separate parking areas must be
set back at least ten feet (10') from any lease lot line and at least twenty
feet (20') from any edge of the planned development. Separate parking areas
must be screened to the S2 standard. (See
chapter 5, article F, "Screening And Buffering Standards", of this title.)
   F.   Sanitary Sewers: The sewerage system shall be designed, constructed and
maintained in accordance with applicable city codes or specifications approved
by the city. Provision shall be made for plugging the drain when a manufactured
housing unit does not occupy the space.
   G.   Additional Requirements For Solid Waste Handling:
      1.   Collection Stations: Unless individual solid waste collection is
provided for each lease lot within the development, dumpsters or collection
stands consisting of a holder or rack on an impervious slab must be provided
within three hundred feet (300') of every manufactured housing space they
serve. Container stands must be designed to prevent containers from being
tipped, to minimize spillage and container deterioration and to facilitate
cleaning around them. Collection stands must be screened from adjacent
dwellings to the S3 standard. (See
chapter 5, article F, "Screening And Buffering Standards", of this title.)
      2.   Collection Receptacles: Collection receptacles shall be provided in
quantities adequate to permit disposal of all solid waste.
   H.   Accessory Structures And Facilities:
      1.   Manufactured Housing Sales: Sales of manufactured housing units is
allowed as an accessory use in conjunction with the management office.
Manufactured housing units, which are not currently located on lease lots, may
not be displayed on site.
      2.   Equipment And Materials Storage: Maintenance materials and equipment
shall be stored either in a permanent structure or in yards fenced in with a
minimum six foot (6') high fence of solid construction.
      3.   Tenant Storage: Storage facilities for tenants of the manufactured
housing park may be provided on individual manufactured housing lease lots or
in shared compounds located within the park. Any shared storage facility or
compound must be screened from view of adjacent streets, neighboring lease
lots, and neighborhood developments to at least the S2 standard. (See
chapter 5, article F, "Screening And Buffering Standards", of this title.)
(Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-3A-7: EXCEPTIONS:
The approval criteria contained in this article are to be used by the city as
minimum requirements for evaluating planned developments. However, such
criteria are not intended to restrict creativity and an applicant may request
modifications to the planned development approval criteria. The city will use
the following criteria when evaluating any such request:
   A.   The modification will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this
title and the city comprehensive plan.
   B.   The modification will generally enhance the proposed planned
development and will not have an adverse impact on its physical, visual or
spatial characteristics.
   C.   The modification shall not result in a configuration of lots or a
street system that is impractical or detracts from the appearance of the
proposed development.
   D.   The modification will not result in danger to public health, safety or
welfare by preventing access for emergency vehicles, by inhibiting the
provision of public services, by depriving adjoining properties of adequate
light and air, or by violating the purposes and intent of this title or the
city's comprehensive plan. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)

14-3B-1: HISTORIC DISTRICT OVERLAY ZONE:
   A.   Purpose: The historic district overlay (OHD) zone is used to designate
local historic landmarks and historic districts. The purpose of this overlay
zone is to:
      1.   Promote the educational, cultural, economic and general welfare of
the public by protecting, enhancing and perpetuating historic landmarks and
districts of historic, architectural and cultural significance;
      2.   Safeguard the city's architectural, historic and cultural heritage
by preserving historic buildings and neighborhoods;
      3.   Provide for design review of new construction or alteration of
existing resources to assure compatibility with the existing character of
historic neighborhoods and preserve the historic integrity of the resource;
      4.   Stabilize and improve property values by encouraging reinvestment in
historic neighborhoods;
      5.   Foster civic pride in the legacy and beauty of past achievements;
and
      6.   Protect and enhance the city's attractiveness to tourists and
visitors, thereby supporting and stimulating business.
   B.   Authority:
      1.   The city council may designate by ordinance areas of the city as
historic districts or local historic landmarks. The process of designation is
considered an overlay rezoning. A historic district overlay rezoning is
required to designate historic districts and local historic landmarks. The
procedures for historic district overlay rezonings are set forth in
chapter 8, article E, "Historic Preservation Commission Approval Procedures",
of this title.
      2.   There are typically many properties within a designated historic
district or that have been designated as local historic landmarks that are
listed on the National Register of Historic Places or are eligible for listing
on the National Register. However, properties listed on the National Register
are not subject to the regulations of this article unless they are located
within a designated historic district or have been designated as a local
historic landmark by the city council.
   C.   Descriptions:
      1.   Historic districts are geographically cohesive areas with
significant concentrations of buildings and other resources that possess a high
degree of historic integrity and convey a distinct sense of time and place and
that have been designated as a historic district by the city council pursuant
to the applicable procedures outlined in this title. To qualify for designation
as a historic district, the subject area must contain abutting pieces of
property under diverse ownership that meet approval criteria of subsections C1a
and C1b of this section and at least one of approval criteria of subsection
C1c, C1d, C1e or C1f of this section.
         a.   Are significant to American and/or Iowa City history,
architecture, archaeology and culture; and
         b.   Possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials and
workmanship; and
         c.   Are associated with events that have made a significant
contribution to the broad patterns of our history; or
         d.   Are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
or
         e.   Embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, method
of construction; or represent the work of a master; or possess high artistic
values; or represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components
may lack individual distinction; or
         f.   Have yielded or may likely yield information important in
prehistory or history.
      2.   A historic landmark is any building, structure, object, area of land
or element of landscape architecture with significance, importance or value
consistent with the approval criteria listed in subsection C1 of this section
for historic districts and that has been designated as a local historic
landmark by the city council pursuant to the applicable procedures outlined in
this title. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd. Ord. 10-4404, 9-7-2010; Ord. 12-
4478, 5-1-2012; Ord. 12-4498, 10-23-2012; Ord. 13-4513, 1-8-2013; Ord. 13-4523,
4-23-2013; Ord. 14-4585, 6-3-2014; Ord. 14-4592, 8-19-2014; Ord. 14-4599, 10-
21-2014; Ord. 16-4662, 4-19-2016; Ord. 22-4884, 8-2-2022)
14-3B-2: CONSERVATION DISTRICT OVERLAY ZONE:
   A.   Purpose: The conservation district overlay (OCD) zone is used to
designate conservation districts. The purpose of this overlay zone is to:
      1.   Conserve the unique characteristics of older neighborhoods and
resources, including their architectural, historical and aesthetic qualities;
      2.   Provide for design review of new construction or alteration of
existing resources to assure compatibility with the existing character of older
neighborhoods and preserve the historic integrity of the resource;
      3.   Encourage the retention, rehabilitation and appropriate maintenance
of existing buildings, structures and sites in older neighborhoods;
      4.   Stabilize property values and encourage reinvestment in older
neighborhoods; and
      5.   Protect the environmental setting of historic landmarks and historic
districts through the designation of conservation districts adjacent to
historic landmarks and historic districts.
   B.   Authority: The city council may designate by ordinance areas of the
city as conservation districts. The process of designation is considered an
overlay rezoning. A conservation overlay rezoning is required to designate
conservation districts. The procedures for conservation district overlay
rezonings are set forth in chapter 8, article E, "Historic Preservation
Commission Approval Procedures", of this title.
   C.   Descriptions: A conservation district is a geographically cohesive area
that is similar to a historic district in character. However, because it has
fewer properties that retain a high degree of historic integrity or contribute
to a distinct sense of time and place, it does not currently qualify as a
historic district. Because these areas are still considered worthy of
protection, the city council may designate them for conservation. To qualify
for designation as a conservation district, the subject area must contain
abutting pieces of property under diverse ownership, the built portions of
which, by majority, are at least fifty (50) years old, but according to a
historic resources survey, sixty percent (60%) or less of the structures are of
a quality, integrity and condition that qualify for historic district
designation. The properties within the subject area must also meet one of the
following additional criteria:
      1.   They represent the traditional character of Iowa City neighborhoods
through architectural characteristics, building scale, building setback and
streetscape design; or
      2.   They exemplify a pattern of neighborhood settlement or development
significant to the cultural history or tradition of Iowa City; or
      3.   They represent unique or unusual physical character that creates a
distinctiveness. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd. Ord. 10-4404, 9-7-2010; Ord.
22-4884, 8-2-2022)
14-3B-3: HISTORIC REVIEW:
   A.   Purpose: The intent of the historic review process is:
      1.   To ensure that material changes to exterior features of landmarks
and properties in historic and conservation districts do not substantially
alter or destroy the defining architectural character of a building, site or
neighborhood.
      2.   To provide property owners, contractors and consultants with
technical assistance and design alternatives to ensure that proposed projects
conform with the applicable historic preservation guidelines.
   B.   Applicability:
      1.   If a material change that requires a regulated permit, as defined in
chapter 9, article B, "Historic Preservation Definitions", of this title, is
proposed for any property located in a historic or conservation district or to
a property that has been designated a historic landmark, historic review is
required. A minor, intermediate, or major review will be conducted as
applicable, and as set forth in
chapter 8, article E, "Historic Preservation Commission Approval Procedures",
of this title, and if approved, will result in the issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness or a certificate of no material effect. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-
2005)
      2.   For purposes of this article, a "material change" is any act that
adds new materials or otherwise modifies an exterior feature of a property.
"Material changes" include alterations to the exterior features of a building
or structure, demolition of a building or structure, demolition of a portion of
a building or structure, and new construction on a property, including
construction of any new street access drives. (Ord. 06-4245, 12-12-2006)
      3.   Normal repairs or maintenance that do not involve material changes
for which a regulated permit is required are exempt from historic review. For
example, changes made in the color of the exterior surfaces of a building are
considered normal maintenance and repair and are therefore not subject to
historic review.
   C.   Approval Criteria: Applications for historic review will be reviewed
for compliance with the following guidelines and standards, which are published
in the "Iowa City Historic Preservation Handbook", as amended:
      1.   Historic Districts And Landmarks: For properties located within a
historic district or designated a historic landmark:
         a.   "Secretary Of Interior's Standards For Rehabilitation", 1990
edition or subsequent revision thereof.
         b.   "Iowa City Guidelines For Historic Preservation".
         c.   Individual district guidelines:
            (1)   "Longfellow Neighborhood District Guidelines".
            (2)   "College Hill Neighborhood District Guidelines".
            (3)   "Woodlawn District Guidelines".
            (4)   "Northside Neighborhood District Guidelines".
      2.   Conservation Districts: For properties located within a conservation
district:
         a.   "Iowa City Guidelines For Historic Preservation".
         b.   Individual district guidelines:
            (1)   "Longfellow Neighborhood District Guidelines".
            (2)   "College Hill Neighborhood District Guidelines".
      3.   Multi-Family And Two-Family Uses: For properties located within a
historic or conservation district in which alterations, additions or new
construction will result in two (2) or more dwelling units, the property must
meet the central planning district multi-family standards in addition to any
applicable guidelines and standards listed above.
   D.   Appeals: Any person aggrieved by any decision of the commission
regarding an application for historic review in a historic district or for a
historic landmark may appeal the action to the city council. Any person
aggrieved by any decision of the commission regarding an application for
historic review in a conservation district may appeal the action to the board
of adjustment. Procedures for such appeals are set forth in
chapter 8, article E, "Historic Preservation Commission Approval Procedures",
of this title. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-3B-4: CERTIFICATE OF ECONOMIC HARDSHIP:
After receiving written notification from the commission of the disapproval of
a certificate of appropriateness, the owner of record may apply for a
certificate of economic hardship if he or she believes that the application of
the provisions of this article would result in economic hardship to the extent
that the property in question cannot yield a reasonable return. The review and
approval procedures for a certificate of economic hardship are set forth in
chapter 8, article E, "Historic Preservation Commission Approval Procedures",
of this title. The applicant bears the burden of proof and must support each of
the approval criteria by a preponderance of the evidence.
   A.   The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if required
to comply with the requirements and standards specified in this article. It is
not sufficient to show that the potential return will be reduced as a result of
these regulations, but rather it must be demonstrated that the resulting
reduction would be near confiscation.
   B.   The owner's situation is unique or peculiar to the property in
question, and the situation is not shared with other landowners in the area nor
due to general conditions in the neighborhood.
   C.   The hardship is not of the property owner's or applicant's own making.
(Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-3B-5: COMPLIANCE WITH CERTIFICATE REQUIRED:
Issuance of a certificate of appropriateness, certificate of no material
effect, or a certificate of economic hardship is authorization to make only
those material changes specified in the approved application. It shall be the
duty of the building official or designee to inspect, from time to time, any
work performed pursuant to such a certificate to ensure compliance with the
requirements of such certificate. If it is found that such work is not being
carried out in accordance with the certificate, the building official shall
issue a stop work order. Any material change at variance with that authorized
by the certificate shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and subject
to any enforcement action and penalties allowed herein. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-
2005)
14-3B-6: REMEDY OF DANGEROUS CONDITIONS:
   A.   Except for emergencies as determined by the building official pursuant
to the ordinances of the city, city enforcement agencies and departments must
give the historic preservation commission at least thirty (30) days' notice of
any proposed order for remedying conditions determined to be dangerous to life,
health or property which may affect the exterior features of any building or
structure located in a historic district, conservation district or that has
been designated a historic landmark.
   B.   The commission may require that material changes not adversely affect
the exterior features of a building in cases where the danger to life, health
or property may be abated without detracting from the exterior features of the
building. In such cases, it is the responsibility of the commission and the
city enforcement agency or department to cooperate with the property owner in
an attempt to achieve a preservation solution whereby the dangerous conditions
will be corrected with minimal adverse impact on exterior features. Such plan
shall be approved by the commission and shall be signed by the chair of the
commission, the property owner and the head of the city enforcement agency or
department.
   C.   If a solution acceptable to the commission, the city enforcement agency
or department and the property owner cannot be reached within thirty (30) days
or a period of time acceptable to the city enforcement agency or department,
the agency or department shall proceed to issue and enforce its proposed order.
(Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-3B-7: PREVENTION OF DEMOLITION BY NEGLECT:
   A.   Duty To Maintain: All buildings and structures that contribute to a
conservation or historic district, or that are listed or are eligible for
listing on the National Register of Historic Places, regardless of whether they
are in a designated historic or conservation district, must be preserved
against decay, deterioration, and kept free from structural defects by the
owner or such person, persons, or entities who may have custody or control
thereof. Accordingly, all such buildings and structures must be maintained in
accordance with the provisions of section
17-5-19, "Responsibilities Of Owners Relating To Maintenance And Occupancy Of
Premises", of this code.
   B.   Determination And Action:
      1.   The historic preservation commission may file a petition with the
building official requesting investigation of any applicable building or
structure suspected of neglect or deterioration according to the standards
referenced in subsection A of this section. The building official will proceed
with investigation and may take any enforcement action necessary to correct or
prevent further violation.
      2.   Upon failure, neglect, or refusal of the property owner(s) or other
responsible person(s), duly notified, to take the corrective action(s)
specified by the building official within the time allotted, the building
official may institute any and all legal or equitable remedies along with
penalties provided by law for said violations. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
ARTICLE C. DESIGN REVIEW
SECTION:
14-3C-1: Purpose
14-3C-2: Applicability
14-3C-3: Design Review
14-3C-4: Compliance Required
14-3C-5: Revisions To Approved Design Plans
14-3C-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of design review is to:
   A.   Assure compatibility with the defining characteristics of the
surrounding area or to preserve the integrity of existing neighborhoods or to
support a unifying theme for a particular development or area in order to spur
economic growth.
   B.   Provide for careful review of new construction or alteration of
existing structures in areas of the City where the existing built environment
is expressive of the architectural traditions of Iowa City and the unique
physical features of the area or to provide guidance in areas where there is a
lack of any defining physical or aesthetic qualities but in which the City
wishes to establish such qualities.
   C.   To provide property owners, contractors and consultants with technical
assistance and design alternatives to ensure that proposed projects conform
with the applicable standards.
   D.   Enhance the social, cultural, economic, environmental and aesthetic
development of the community by encouraging both harmonious and innovative
design.
   E.   Promote orderly community growth and protect property values.
   F.   Recognize that land use regulations aimed at these objectives provide
not only for the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens, but also
for their comfort and prosperity, and for the beauty and balance of the
community. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-3C-2: APPLICABILITY:
The City Council may designate buildings, areas, and structures within the City
that are subject to design review. The Council may also designate Design Review
Districts that contain contiguous parcels of real property, the built portions
of which are expressive of the defining architectural and other physical and
aesthetic properties that give evidence to the physical traditions of Iowa City
and the unique features of the area; or are areas that lack any defining
physical or aesthetic qualities but are places where the City wishes to
establish such qualities.
   A.   Designated Areas, Buildings, And Structures: Projects located in the
following areas are subject to the design review process:
      1.   Urban Renewal Project, Iowa R-14: Exterior alterations or new
construction occurring on all parcels that were acquired and/or disposed of by
the City as part of the urban renewal project known as Iowa R-14 are subject to
design review. Design review is also required for public right-of-way
improvements occurring within and adjacent to the urban renewal area designated
as Urban Renewal Project R-14.
      2.   City Plaza: Design review is required for all projects designated as
requiring such review by title 10, chapter 5, "City Plaza", of this Code. Any
public improvements to City Plaza are also subject to design review.
      3.   Other Public-Private Partnership Agreements: Projects specifically
designated as requiring design review pursuant to a development agreement
between a private property owner and the City, such as for urban renewal
parcels and other properties receiving public tax abatements or subsidies.
      4.   Central Planning District: Any exterior alterations to, additions
to, or new construction of two-family uses, multi- family uses, group living
uses, and institutional/civic uses located on a property in the Central
Planning District, are subject to design review according to the rules of
applicability and standards contained in section
14-2B-6, "Multi-Family Site Development Standards", of this title. (See Central

         e.   Exterior lighting and fixtures should blend with the
architectural design. They should provide adequate illumination for safety
purposes without excess glare.
         f.   Colors should be an integral part of the architectural style.
         g.   Rooftop equipment should blend with building design or be
screened.
      3.   Relationship Of Building(s) To Site:
         a.   The project should integrate with adjoining properties, provide a
transition between the project and pedestrian uses, and provide appropriate
landscaping.
Figure 3C.4 - Integration Of Pedestrian Amenities And Landscaping
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/e8d1768e23d53ec22be0e15c84bd3fa19a74f99f/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2723.png]
 
         b.   Parking and service areas should blend with the street frontage
or be screened from public view.
         c.   The scale of each building should be compatible along a street
frontage to preserve the character of the street or to create the desired
streetscape anticipated by the development plan or agreement. Rhythm and
proportion of buildings, doors, windows and other projections should be
considered. (See
 figure 3C.2, located at the end of subsection C2c of this section.)
         d.   Building materials, colors, textures, lines and masses should
harmonize with adjoining buildings and sites, or alternatively, in areas
proposed for redevelopment or revitalization, the proposed building materials,
colors, textures, lines and masses should be in harmony with the architectural
theme or goals of the revitalization plan, whether it be to strengthen or
preserve the integrity of the existing area or to support a new architectural
theme or set of unifying characteristics for a particular development or area.
         e.   Site grading work should blend with surrounding site grades.
      4.   Landscaping:
         a.   Landscaping should enhance and complement architectural features
and improve the visual and aesthetic quality of the streetscape.
         b.   Plants should be protected by appropriate curbs, raised planting
surfaces, tree guards or other devices when located in areas where plants may
be susceptible to injury by pedestrian or motor traffic.

         f.   Street furniture and miscellaneous structures should be
integrated with the architectural concept and be located and designed to be
convenient and functional for the public. Their design should be compatible
with surrounding buildings and streetscape in scale, materials and color
scheme. Alternatively, in areas proposed for redevelopment or revitalization,
the proposed street furniture and miscellaneous structures should be integrated
with the architectural theme or goals of the revitalization plan, whether it be
to strengthen or preserve the integrity of the existing area or to support a
new architectural theme or set of unifying characteristics for a particular
development or area.
      5.   Canopies And Awnings:
         a.   Canopies and awnings must respect the style and character of the
structure on which they are located, particularly in the material and color.
         b.   The highest point of a canopy/awning or its superstructure must
not be higher than the midpoint of the space between the second story
windowsills and the top of the first floor storefront window or transom. (See

IMAGES/0-0-0-2727.png]
 
         c.   Along sidewalks and pedestrianways, canopies and awnings should
project a sufficient distance from the building wall to be functional, i.e., to
provide shade and weather protection for pedestrians and to prevent reflective
glare on storefront windows that may block views into the storefront or display
window.
   D.   Appeals: Any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any
decision of the design review committee regarding a level I design review
application may appeal such decision to the board of adjustment according to
the applicable procedures for appeals set forth in chapter 8, article C, "Board
Of Adjustment Approval Procedures", of this title. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005;
amd. Ord. 11-4421, 2-1-2011; Ord. 14-4586, 6-3-2014; Ord. 15-4641, 9-15-2015;

14-3C-4: COMPLIANCE REQUIRED:
Approved applications for design review authorize only those changes in
appearance set forth in such approved applications and no other changes in
appearance. It will be the duty of the building official or designee to
inspect, from time to time, any work performed pursuant to such an approved
application to ensure compliance with the requirements of such application. If
it is found that such work is not being carried out in accordance with the
approved application, the building official will issue a stop work order and
may deny issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Any change in appearance at
variance with that authorized by the approved application shall be deemed a
violation of these regulations. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-3C-5: REVISIONS TO APPROVED DESIGN PLANS:
If the building application deviates from approved design review applications,
the director of housing and inspection services or designee will inform the
design review committee, who will then determine if the proposed changes are
substantive. Substantive changes to an approved application for design review
require submittal of those changes to the design review committee and approval
thereof according to the applicable design review procedures. (Ord. 05-4186,
12-15-2005)
CHAPTER 4
USE REGULATIONS
ARTICLE A. USE CATEGORIES
SECTION:
14-4A-1: Purpose
14-4A-2: Classifying Uses
14-4A-3: Residential Use Categories
14-4A-4: Commercial Use Categories
14-4A-5: Industrial Use Categories
14-4A-6: Institutional And Civic Uses
14-4A-7: Other Use Categories
14-4A-1: PURPOSE:
This article classifies land uses and activities into use categories on the
basis of common functional, product, or physical characteristics. The use
categories provide a systematic basis for assignment of present and future uses
to zones. Certain use categories are broken down into subgroups if further
distinction is needed. The decision to permit, permit with provisions, or allow
by special exception a particular use or use category in the various zones is
based on the goals and policies of the comprehensive plan and the stated
purposes of the base zones. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-4A-2: CLASSIFYING USES:
   A.   Use Characteristics:
      1.   Land uses are assigned to the use category that most closely
describes the nature of the principal use. A number of the most common uses are
listed under the "examples" subsection for each use category. In some zones,
developments may have more than one principal use. Developments may also have
one or more accessory uses. For uses not listed as examples, the following is a
list of factors to be considered when classifying a use into a particular
category, and is also used to determine whether the activities constitute
principal uses or accessory uses:
         a.   The description of the use or activities in comparison to the
stated characteristics of each use category;
         b.   The intensity of the activity or use in comparison to the stated
characteristics of each use category;
         c.   The amount of site or floor area and equipment devoted to the use
or activity;
         d.   The presence of and amount of sales from each use or activity;
         e.   The customer type for each use or activity. For example, do
individual customers come to the site or does the firm primarily sell goods or
services to other firms?
         f.   The number of employees involved in the use or activity;
         g.   The hours of operation;
         h.   The building and site arrangement;
         i.   The type of vehicles used for the activity;
         j.   The number of vehicle trips generated by the use or activity;
         k.   How the use advertises itself;
         l.   Whether the use or activity would be likely to be found
independent of the other activities on the site;
         m.   Whether the use is subordinate to and serves another use in the
development;
         n.   Whether a use is subordinate in area, extent or purpose to the
principal building or use served;
         o.   Whether the use contributes to the comfort, convenience or
necessity of occupants, customers, or employees of a principal use; and
         p.   Any other relevant evidence regarding use or activity that would
help to classify a particular land use.
      2.   In cases where a specific use is not listed as an example, the
director of housing and inspection services shall determine the appropriate
category for a use based on the factors listed in subsection A1 of this
section.
      3.   In cases of dispute, the zoning code interpretation panel will issue
a written use determination. Such determination may be appealed to the board of
adjustment according to the procedures outlined in
chapter 8, article C, "Board Of Adjustment Approval Procedures", of this title.
If an appeal is made, the board of adjustment shall determine whether the city
has made an error in classifying the subject use based on the facts in evidence
and the factors listed in subsection A1 of this section.
      4.   Any use that cannot be clearly classified within an existing use
category by the procedures noted above is prohibited, unless incorporated into
this title by a zoning code text amendment, the procedures for which are
outlined in
chapter 8, article D, "Planning And Zoning Commission Approval Procedures", of
this title. A specific use that cannot be classified into an existing use
category shall not be listed as permitted, provisional, or a special exception
in any zone without first establishing a new use category within this article
by zoning code text amendment.
   B.   Use Of Examples:
      1.   The "examples" subsection under each use category provides a list of
examples of specific uses that are included in the use category. These lists
may not be exhaustive of all the specific uses that might be included in a use
category.
      2.   The names of uses on the lists are generic. They are based on the
common meaning of the terms and not on what a specific use may be called. For
example, a use with the business name "Wholesale Liquidators", that sells
mostly to individual consumers, would be included in the sales oriented retail
category rather than the wholesale sales category, because the actual activity
on the site matches the description of the sales oriented retail category.
   C.   Accessory Uses:
      1.   For reference purposes, a list of accessory uses commonly associated
with a particular use category is included under a subsection entitled
"Accessory Uses". Accessory uses and their associated regulations and
requirements are addressed in detail in
chapter 4, article C, "Accessory Uses And Buildings", of this title.
      2.   A use that is accessory to a principal use in one instance may, in
other circumstances, be considered a principal use. For example, a large
business may provide an in-house daycare center for employees. This daycare
center would be considered an accessory use. However, a daycare center would be
considered a separate principal use if it were not affiliated with another
business or use on the property.
   D.   Exceptions: Some of the use categories may contain an "Exceptions"
subsection. These subsections provide a cross reference for uses that may seem
to be part of a particular category, but which are explicitly classified into a
different use category.
   E.   Prohibited Uses: Certain uses are specifically prohibited in the city
of Iowa City, even though they may be construed to be part of a particular use
category. These uses are listed in a subsection entitled "Prohibited" under the
relevant use category. As noted in subsection A4 of this section, some uses may
also be prohibited because they cannot be clearly classified within an existing
use category by the procedures set forth in subsection A of this section.
   F.   Developments With Multiple Principal Uses: Developments with multiple
principal uses will be categorized using the following rules:
      1.   When all of the principal uses of a development fall within one use
category, then the entire development is assigned to that use category. For
example, a development that contains a hair salon, a dry cleaners, and a
photographic studio would be classified as personal service oriented retail.
      2.   When the principal uses of a development fall within different use
categories, each principal use is classified into the applicable use category
and each use is subject to all applicable regulations for the use category. For
example, a development that contains a store that sells musical instruments and
an architectural office would fall into two (2) different use categories: Sales
oriented retail and general office.
      3.   Developments with multiple principal uses, such as shopping centers,
shall incorporate only those uses permitted or allowed as provisional or by
special exception in the underlying zone. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
   G.   Use Classification For Establishments That Sell Alcohol:
      1.   Applicability: Any use for which an application has been filed for a
liquor control license or wine or beer permit is subject to the following use
classification process.
      2.   Definitions: The following definitions shall apply to terms used in
this subsection:
   ALCOHOL SALES: The sale of alcohol and alcoholic beverages, including, but
not limited to, alcohol, beer or wine in closed containers intended for off
site consumption; and alcoholic beverages, including cocktails, shots, wine,
beer, and any part of an alcoholic beverage intended for on site consumption,
as defined in chapter 123 of the state code.
   LICENSE: Any liquor control license, wine or beer permit issued by the state
of Iowa that allows sales of alcohol or alcoholic beverages.
   LICENSEE: Any person or entity that holds a liquor control license, wine or
beer permit issued by the state of Iowa.
      3.   Classification Process:
         a.   Prior to issuance of a license for a new use or renewal of a
license for a use that was established prior to the effective date hereof, but
which has not yet been classified according to these provisions, the licensee
must submit to the department of housing and inspection services a verified
statement that details the nature of the principal use for which the license
will be issued, the type of license(s) applied for, and the hours that the
establishment will be open for business. The city may request any other
information deemed necessary to verify and classify the use, including, but not
limited to, business records upon which the statement is based, state and
federal tax records, applications for dramshop insurance and audits performed
to determine dramshop insurance premiums, and receipts from vendors for goods
purchased.
         b.   Based on the information provided by the applicant, the type of
license being applied for, and the classification system set forth in this
article, the city will advise the applicant regarding the classification of the
proposed use for zoning purposes, and, if applicable, whether the alcohol sales
will be considered a principal or accessory use of the property.
         c.   If through this use classification process, a use that was
legally established prior to the effective date hereof is determined to be
nonconforming with regard to the separation requirements for drinking
establishments or alcohol sales oriented retail uses, the property file will be
tagged by the building official or designee as a nonconforming drinking
establishment or nonconforming alcohol sales oriented retail use, as
applicable. Such a nonconforming use may continue provided it is in compliance
with the applicable provisions of article E, "Nonconforming Situations", of
this chapter.
      4.   Accessory Alcohol Sales Certification: Any use that is classified as
an alcohol sales oriented retail use is considered a principal use and subject
to the regulations pertaining thereto, unless it is determined that alcohol
sales are an accessory use to another principal use of the property through the
following certification process. Any licensee applying for an accessory alcohol
sales certificate must submit verified statements and business records as set
forth in the following subsections:
         a.   For existing uses, if according to a verified statement issued by
a certified public accountant, alcohol sales expressed as a percentage of gross
yearly income is less than twenty five percent (25%), an accessory alcohol
sales certificate will be issued for one year, after which time it must be
renewed annually at the time the license is renewed. Said statement shall be
based on records made in the regular course of the licensee's business. The
licensee shall allow, upon request, the building official, city clerk or
designee to examine the business records upon which the statement is based,
including state and federal tax records, applications for dramshop insurance
and audits performed to determine dramshop insurance premiums, and receipts
from vendors for goods purchased.
         b.   For new uses, if the licensee estimates, based on their submitted
business plan, that alcohol sales expressed as a percentage of gross yearly
income will be less than twenty five percent (25%), an accessory alcohol sales
certificate will be issued for one year. The certificate must be renewed
annually thereafter at the time the license is renewed based on actual sales
according to a verified statement from a certified public accountant as
described in subsection G4a of this section.
         c.   If, at the time of renewal of the certificate, alcohol sales
constitute twenty five percent (25%) or more of gross yearly income and the use
is not in compliance with zoning requirements for alcohol sales oriented uses,
a notice of violation will be issued. If the use is in violation of the zoning
requirements for alcohol sales oriented uses, the licensee must reduce alcohol
sales to below twenty five percent (25%) of gross yearly income or otherwise
bring the use into compliance with the applicable regulations. (Ord. 09-4341,
6-2-2009)
14-4A-3: RESIDENTIAL USE CATEGORIES:
   A.   Household Living Uses:
      1.   Characteristics: The residential occupancy of a dwelling unit by a
single household or group household, who are living together as a single
housekeeping unit. The principal use of the property is for long term
residential living, with each dwelling unit containing its own facilities for
living, sleeping, cooking and eating meals, and with all spaces within the unit
open to the entire household. The dwelling or dwelling units are designed for
residential living and any accessory use shall be secondary to the use of the
property as a residence.
      2.   Examples: Examples include uses from the subgroups listed below. The
single family uses are further divided into various dwelling types, because
these dwelling types have distinct dimensional and development standards based
on the zone in which they are located. Group households, given that they are a
type of "household" rather than a type of dwelling, are permitted in any type
of dwelling listed in the three (3) other subgroups, as is permanent supportive
housing.
         a.   Group Households: Group households include only the following
specific uses: elder family homes, elder group homes, parental group homes, and
family care homes, all as defined in chapter 9, article A, "General
Definitions", of this title.
         b.   Single Family Uses: A single family use is a household living use
where there is no more than one principal dwelling unit per lot. Single family
uses include the following dwelling types.
            (1)   Detached single family dwellings. Farm dwellings; detached

a minor modification, in whole or in part, with or without conditions, only if
the following approval criteria are met:
      1.   Special circumstances apply to the property, such as size, shape,
topography, location, surroundings, or characteristics, or preexisting site
development, which make it impractical to comply with the subject regulation or
which warrant a modification and/or waiver of the subject regulation.
      2.   The minor modification will not be detrimental to the public health,
safety, or welfare or be injurious to other property or improvements in the
vicinity and in the zone in which the property is located.

14-4B-2: VARIANCES:
The Board of Adjustment is empowered to grant variances from the provisions of
this title that will not be contrary to the public interest when, owing to
unique circumstances or conditions, a literal interpretation of this title
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the zoning district under the terms of this title and would impose unnecessary
and undue hardship on the applicant. To ensure that the spirit of this title is
observed and substantial justice done, no variance to the strict application of
any provision of this title shall be granted by the Board unless the applicant
demonstrates that all of the following approval criteria are met. The
procedures for obtaining a variance are set forth in chapter 8, article C,
“Board Of Adjustment Approval Procedures”, of this title.
   A.   Approval Criteria:
      1.   The proposed variance will not be contrary to the public interest;
and
      2.   Where owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of the zoning code provision will result in unnecessary hardship;
and
      3.   The spirit of the zoning code provision shall be observed, and
substantial justice done.
   B.   Definitions:
 
            Lack of a reasonable return may be shown by proof that the owner has been deprived
            of all beneficial use of the land. All beneficial use is said to have been lost
            where the land is not suitable for anything permitted by the zoning code. A zoning
REASONABLE  code provision deprives an owner of a reasonable return if all productive use of
RETURN:     the land is denied. Such deprivation is shown where the land in issue has so
            changed that the purpose for which it was originally zoned are no longer feasible.
            It is not sufficient to show that the value of the land has been depreciated by the
            zoning code provision, or that a variance would permit the owner to maintain a more
            profitable use.
            The applicant establishes an unnecessary hardship by demonstrating all of the
            following elements are met:
               a.   The land in question cannot yield a reasonable return if used only as
UNNECESSARY allowed in that zone.
HARDSHIP:      b.   The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances and not to the
            general conditions in the neighborhood.
               c.   The proposed variance will not alter the essential character of the
            locality.
 
   C.   Use Variance Prohibited: Under no circumstance may the Board grant a
variance that would allow a land use, other than those specifically allowed in
the zoning district in which the subject property is located.
   D.   Burden Of Proof: The applicant bears the burden of proof and must
support each of the approval criteria by a preponderance of the evidence.
   E.   Precedents: The granting of a variance is not grounds for granting
other variances for the same or differing properties. (Ord. 10-4414, 11-16-
2010; amd. Ord. 22-4882, 6-21-2022)
14-4B-3: SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS:
The Board of Adjustment is empowered to grant special exceptions to the
provisions of this title in certain circumstances specifically enumerated
within this title. To ensure that the spirit of this title is observed and
substantial justice done, no special exception shall be granted by the Board
unless the applicant demonstrates that all of the following general approval
criteria are met in addition to any specific approval criteria for the proposed
exception listed in section
14-4B-4 of this article or elsewhere in this title. The procedures for
obtaining a special exception are set forth in chapter 8, article C, "Board Of
Adjustment Approval Procedures", of this title.
   A.   Approval Criteria: In order to grant a special exception, the Board
must find that the applicant meets the specific approval criteria set forth in
this title with respect to the specific proposed exception. The Board must also
find that the applicant meets the following general approval criteria or that
the following criteria do not apply:
      1.   The specific proposed exception will not be detrimental to or
endanger the public health, safety, comfort or general welfare.
      2.   The specific proposed exception will not be injurious to the use and
enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity and will not
substantially diminish or impair property values in the neighborhood.
      3.   Establishment of the specific proposed exception will not impede the
normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for
uses permitted in the district in which such property is located.
      4.   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary
facilities have been or are being provided.
      5.   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress or
egress designed to minimize traffic congestion on public streets.
      6.   Except for the specific regulations and standards applicable to the
exception being considered, the specific proposed exception, in all other
respects, conforms to the applicable regulations or standards of the zone in
which it is to be located.
      7.   The proposed exception will be consistent with the Comprehensive
Plan of the City, as amended.
   B.   Burden Of Proof: The applicant bears the burden of proof and must
support each of the approval criteria by a preponderance of the evidence.
   C.   Precedents: The granting of a special exception is not grounds for
granting other special exceptions for the same or differing properties. (Ord.
05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-4B-4: SPECIFIC APPROVAL CRITERIA FOR PROVISIONAL USES AND SPECIAL
EXCEPTIONS:

enclosed within a building are permitted, provided the use is located at least
two hundred feet (200') from any residential zone and is screened from view of
public rights-of-way to at least the S3 standard. To ensure public safety, the
City may also require that the use be enclosed by a fence. Basic utility uses
that cannot meet the two hundred foot (200') separation requirement may apply
for a special exception from the Board of Adjustment as described in subsection
D(1)b(2) of this section.
            (2)   In all commercial zones, the RDP and ORP zones, and the P-1,
ID-C and ID-RP zones, basic utility uses not enclosed within a building are
permitted only by special exception. Proposed uses must be screened from public
view and from view of any adjacent residential zones to at least the S3
standard. The proposed use must be compatible with surrounding structures and
uses with regard to safety, size, height, scale, location, and design,
particularly for facilities that will be located close to or within view of a
residential zone. For uses located in highly visible areas, the Board may
consider additional design elements such as masonry or brick facades, and walls
or fencing to improve public safety and to soften the visual impact of the
proposed use. Water and sanitary sewer pumps or lift stations approved by the
City as part of subdivision or site plan approval do not require special
exception approval from the Board of Adjustment.
            (3)   In the ID-RP and the ORP zone, the Board of Adjustment may
grant a special exception to reduce the minimum lot size for a basic utility
use; provided that the facility will be located, screened, and landscaped in a

development standards as set forth in section
14-2B-6 of this title.
      4.   General Community Service Uses In CI-1 And I-1 Zones: The proposed
use will not significantly alter the overall character of the zone and will not
inhibit future development of uses for which the zone is primarily intended.
The board will consider such factors as size and scale of the development,
projected traffic generation, and whether adequate transportation, transit, and
pedestrian facilities exist to support the proposed use. Community service uses
that are industrial or repair oriented in nature or that include operations
that require outdoor work areas may be particularly suited to these zones.
      5.   Community Service - Shelter Uses:
         a.   Maximum Density:
            (1)   In the RM-12 and MU zones: Seven hundred fifty (750) square
feet of lot area per permanent resident and two hundred (200) square feet of

three hundred (300) square feet of lot area per permanent resident and two
hundred (200) square feet of lot area per temporary resident is required.
         b.   Nuisance Issues: The proposed use will not have significant
adverse effects on the livability of nearby residential or commercial uses due
to loitering, noise, glare from lights, late night operations, odors, outdoor
storage, and litter. The applicant must submit a site plan and a shelter
management plan that address these issues. The management plan must include a
litter control plan, a loitering control plan, a plan for on site security, and
a conflict resolution procedure to resolve nuisance issues if they occur. The
site plan and shelter management plan must be submitted along with the
application for a special exception, or if allowed as a provisional use, such
plan must be included with the materials submitted for site plan review.
         c.   Site Development Standards:

calculating the required floor area. The dining area may only be included in
the square footage calculation if used by daycare participants for activities
other than meals. When collocated in a facility that houses other uses or
services, the proposed daycare use must have its own separate identifiable
space for program activities during operational hours.
         b.   Required Outdoor Areas: Child daycare uses must provide a fenced
outdoor play area of not less than one hundred (100) square feet per child
based on the maximum number of children that will be using the outdoor play
area at any given time. The outdoor play area must meet the following
standards:
            (1)   Playground equipment is not permitted within the front and
side setbacks.
            (2)   Outdoor play areas must be well drained, free from hazards,
and readily accessible to the daycare center. In residential zones, outdoor
play areas must be completely enclosed by a fence at least four feet (4') in
height. In commercial and industrial zones, the outdoor play area must be
completely enclosed by a fence built to the S4 standard and be screened along
the perimeter of the fence to the S3 standard. (See chapter 5, article F,
"Screening And Buffering Standards", of this title.) The city may waive the
screening requirement if it is determined that land uses surrounding the
daycare use will not pose a nuisance or safety hazard to the children such that
a screening buffer is necessary.
         c.   Vehicular Circulation: The use must provide a drop off/pick up
area in a location that is convenient to or has good pedestrian access to the
entrance to the facility. This drop off/pick up area must contain sufficient
stacking spaces and/or parking spaces to ensure that traffic does not stack
into adjacent streets or other public rights of way. (See minimum parking
requirements for daycare in section

table 5A-2 of this title.) To promote safe vehicular circulation, one-way
drives are encouraged.
         d.   Pedestrian Circulation: A sidewalk must be constructed connecting
the main entrance of the center to the adjacent public right of way. Pedestrian
access must be clearly separated or distinguished from vehicular circulation
areas to minimize the extent to which users of the facility are required to
walk across drives or aisles to gain access to the daycare center.
         e.   Site Development Standards: If the proposed use is located in a
residential zone or in the central planning district, it must comply with the
multi-family site development standards as set forth in section
14-2B-6 of this title. Daycare facilities that are accessory uses are exempt
from this provision.
      8.   Detention Facilities:
         a.   The proposed use will be located at least one thousand feet
(1,000') from any property containing an existing daycare use, educational
facility use, parks and open space use, religious/private group assembly use or

(500') from any other detention facility.
         d.   The facility and its operations will not pose an unreasonable
safety risk to nearby uses and residents. The applicant must submit to the
board of adjustment a detailed plan for on site security.
      9.   General Education Facilities In The CC-2 Zone:
         a.   The use will be functionally compatible with surrounding uses and
will not inhibit retail and service uses for which the zone is primarily
intended. The board may consider such factors as site layout, size and scale of
the development, and traffic circulation.
         b.   The use must provide a drop off/pick up area in a location that
is convenient to, or has good pedestrian access to, the entrance to the
facility. The drop off/pick up area must contain sufficient stacking spaces
and/or parking spaces to ensure that traffic does not stack into adjacent
streets or other public rights of way.
         c.   The site must be designed to promote safe and convenient
pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicular circulation to the school according to the
standards set forth in subsection
14-2C-6F, "Pedestrian, Bicycle, And Vehicular Circulation", of this title.

         a.   The number of off street parking spaces provided may not exceed
one and one-half (1.5) times the minimum number of spaces required, unless
granted a special exception to do so. The board of adjustment will carefully
review any requests for parking spaces beyond the maximum allowed, particularly
in areas where large parking lots will erode the residential character of the
neighborhood. The board may limit the number of parking spaces and the size and
location of parking lots, taking into account the availability of on street
parking, the estimated parking demand, and opportunities for shared parking
with other nonresidential uses in the vicinity of the use.
         b.   If the proposed use is located in a residential zone or in the
central planning district, it must comply with the multi-family site
development standards as set forth in section
14-2B-6 of this title.
      11.   General Educational Facilities In RS-5, RS-8, RS-12, And RNS-12
Zones:
         a.   The following setbacks are required in lieu of the setbacks
specified in the base zone. However, the board of adjustment may reduce these
setbacks, subject to the approval criteria for setback adjustments as specified
in subsection

title.
            (1)   Front: Twenty feet (20').
            (2)   Side: Twenty feet (20').
            (3)   Rear: Fifty feet (50').
         b.   The proposed use will be designed to be compatible with adjacent
uses. The board of adjustment will consider aspects of the proposed use, such
as the site size, types of accessory uses, anticipated traffic, building scale,
setbacks, landscaping, and location and amount of paved areas. The board of
adjustment may deny the use or aspects of the use that are deemed out of scale,
incompatible, or out of character with surrounding residential uses, or may
require additional measures to mitigate these differences. Additional
requirements may include, but are not limited to, additional screening,
landscaping, pedestrian facilities, setbacks, location and design of parking
facilities, and location and design of buildings.
         c.   Given that large parking lots can seriously erode the single-
family residential character of these zones, the board of adjustment will
carefully review any requests for parking spaces beyond the minimum required.
The board may limit the number of parking spaces and the size and location of
parking lots, taking into account the availability of on street parking, the
estimated parking demand, and opportunities for shared parking with other
nonresidential uses in the vicinity of the use.
         d.   The proposed use will not have significant adverse effects on the
livability of nearby residential uses due to noise, glare from lights, late
night operations, odors, and litter.
         e.   The building official may grant approval for the following
modifications to an educational facility, without approval from the board of
adjustment, upon written findings that the modification will not be detrimental
to the public health, safety, or welfare, or be injurious to the other property
or improvements in the vicinity and in the zone in which the property is
located:
            (1)   An accessory storage building less than five hundred (500)
square feet in size.
            (2)   A building addition of less than five hundred (500) square
feet, provided the addition does not increase the occupancy load of the

central planning district, it must comply with the multi-family site
development standards as set forth in section
14-2B-6 of this title.
      13.   Specialized Educational Facilities In The CI-1 Zone: The use will
be functionally compatible with surrounding uses, such that the health and
safety of clients/students are not compromised. The board will consider factors
such as the types of businesses that predominate in the immediate vicinity,
whether there are any significant negative externalities created by these uses,
such as excessive noise, dust, or vibrations from outdoor work areas that may
pose a health or safety risk to clients/students of the proposed use; and where
such negative externalities exist, whether the building(s) and site can and
will be designed to mitigate the harmful effects.
      14.   Hospitals In CO-1 Zone: Hospitals that existed prior to 1963, are
exempt from and may expand without compliance with the maximum height and FAR
standards of the CO-1 zone.
      15.   Parks And Open Space:

and are subject to the regulations of article C, "Accessory Uses And
Buildings", of this chapter:
            (1)   Accessory uses within shared private open space areas:
Swimming pools, tennis courts, boat ramps, and other recreational facilities.
These are recreational facilities that are shared among residents of the
surrounding properties and are maintained and operated by a common homeowners'
or residents' association. Recreational, sports, or athletic clubs operated as
a commercial business and open to the general public to join are classified as
commercial recreational facilities and are regulated as a principal use.
            (2)   Accessory uses within cemeteries: Mausoleums, chapels, and
similar accessory facilities associated with funerals or burial.
            (3)   Accessory uses within golf courses: Clubhouses and driving
ranges.

spaces.
         b.   Religious institutions located in the PRM zone that have parking
areas that existed prior to March 1, 1992, and if such parking areas are within
three hundred feet (300') of a commercial zone, the religious institution may
lease up to and including two-thirds (2/3) of the required parking spaces
within said parking areas to other users.
         c.   The number of off street parking spaces provided may not exceed
one and one-half (1.5) times the minimum number of spaces required, unless
granted a special exception to do so. The board of adjustment will carefully
review any requests for parking spaces beyond the maximum allowed, particularly
in areas where large parking lots will erode the residential character of the
neighborhood. The board may limit the number of parking spaces and the size and
location of parking lots, taking into account the availability of on street
parking, the estimated parking demand, and opportunities for shared parking
with other nonresidential uses in the vicinity of the use.
         d.   If the proposed use is located in a residential zone or in the
central planning district, it must comply with the multi-family site
development standards as set forth in section
14-2B-6 of this title.
      17.   Religious/Private Group Assembly In ID-RS, RS-5, RS-8, RS-12, And
RNS-12 Zones:
         a.   The following setbacks are required in lieu of the setbacks
specified in the base zone. However, the board of adjustment may reduce these
setbacks, subject to the approval criteria for setback adjustments as specified
in subsection
14-2A-4B5, "Adjustments To Principal Building Setback Requirements", of this
title.
            (1)   Front: Twenty feet (20').
            (2)   Side: Twenty feet (20').
            (3)   Rear: Fifty feet (50').
         b.   The proposed use will be designed to be compatible with adjacent
uses. The board of adjustment will consider aspects of the proposed use, such
as the site size, types of accessory uses, anticipated traffic, building scale,
setbacks, landscaping, and location and amount of paved areas. The board of
adjustment may deny the use or aspects of the use that are deemed out of scale,
incompatible, or out of character with surrounding residential uses, or may
require additional measures to mitigate these differences. Additional
requirements may include, but are not limited to, additional screening,
landscaping, pedestrian facilities, setbacks, location and design of parking
facilities, and location and design of buildings.
         c.   Given that large parking lots can seriously erode the single-
family residential character of these zones, the board of adjustment will
carefully review any requests for parking spaces beyond the minimum required.
The board may limit the number of parking spaces and the size and location of
parking lots, taking into account the availability of on street parking, the
estimated parking demand, and opportunities for shared parking with other
nonresidential uses in the vicinity of the use.
         d.   The proposed use will not have significant adverse effects on the
livability of nearby residential uses due to noise, glare from lights, late
night operations, odors, and litter.
         e.   The building official may grant approval for the following
modifications to a religious/private group assembly use, without approval from
the board of adjustment, upon written findings that the modification will not
be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare, or be injurious to the
other property or improvements in the vicinity and in the zone in which the
property is located:
            (1)   An accessory storage building less than five hundred (500)
square feet in size.
            (2)   A building addition of less than five hundred (500) square
feet, provided the addition does not increase the occupancy load of the

         a.   The proposed landing facility must be located at least one
thousand feet (1,000') from any residential zone.
         b.   The landing facility must meet all applicable federal
regulations. Documentation of compliance with federal regulations must be
submitted to the board of adjustment with the application for a special
exception.
      4.   Communication Transmission Facilities In Residential Zones And In
ID-RS And ID-RM Zones:
         a.   Communications antennas are permitted in all residential zones
and in the ID-RS and ID-RM zones, provided the following conditions are met:
            (1)   The antenna is mounted on an existing communications tower,
on the roof of a principal building that contains a nonresidential use or on
the roof of a building that is accessory to a nonresidential use, or on another
tall structure that is permitted in the zone. Examples include church and
school buildings, water towers and clock towers. A maximum of two (2) antennas
is permitted per building or structure.
            (2)   The height of the antenna shall not exceed the height of the
existing structure or building to which it is attached by more than twenty feet
(20'). If it exceeds this limit, a special exception is required to ensure that
the antenna and any associated structure is designed to blend into its
surroundings, or be camouflaged so as not to be obtrusive or detract from
neighboring properties.
            (3)   Strobe lighting is prohibited in residential zones.
Therefore, any antenna that requires such illumination is prohibited.
            (4)   Any equipment associated with an antenna must be located
within the exterior walls of the building to which the antenna is attached. No
separate equipment shed is permitted, except if the antenna is attached to a
tall structure that is not a building. In such a case, a separate equipment
shed is only allowed by special exception if it can be demonstrated that the
shed can be adequately screened or designed in a manner that blends in with the
residential character or future residential character of the surrounding area.
         b.   Communications towers are allowed by special exception in the ID-
RS and ID-RM zones and must comply with the following approval criteria:
            (1)   The proposed tower serves an area that cannot be served by an
existing tower or industrial property or by locating antennas on existing
structures in the area. The applicant must document attempts to utilize
existing structures, towers, and commercial and industrial properties within
one-half (1/2) mile of the proposed tower. Such documentation must include maps
illustrating the location of existing towers and potential alternative sites
for antenna and towers that have been explored by the applicant and the
applicant must state the reasons that these locations were not feasible.
            (2)   The proposed tower will be designed and constructed in a
manner that will camouflage the structure and reduce its visual impact on the
surrounding area. Examples of camouflage design include monopoles, which do not
have guywires or support trusses and that are painted to blend in with the sky
or surroundings, towers camouflaged as flagpoles, monuments, steeples, or the
integration of rooftop towers onto existing buildings, water towers, etc.
Rooftop towers must use materials similar to or that blend in with the
structure to which it is attached. Other camouflaged tower structures must be
of similar height and appearance as other similar structures allowed in the
zone, e.g., towers camouflaged as light poles or utility poles must be of
similar height and appearance as other such poles. The applicant must include
an illustration of how the tower would appear in the proposed location.
            (3)   The proposed tower will be no taller than is necessary to
provide the service intended. Evidence presented should include coverage maps
illustrating current gaps in coverage and changes to coverage with the proposed
tower. Communications towers are exempt from the maximum height standards of
the base zone, but under no circumstance may the tower be taller than one
hundred twenty feet (120') from grade. If a communications tower is camouflaged
to appear similar to another common structure allowed in the zone, it must
comply with the same height standards that would apply to the type of structure
that it emulates. For example, if the tower is camouflaged as a light pole,
flagpole, or utility pole it must not exceed the height limitation for such
structures as specified in the base zone. If no height standard exists in the
code for such a structure, it must be designed to be of similar height and
appearance to other similar or typical structures. If the tower is camouflaged
as a chimney, steeple, or other similar rooftop structure, the board may exempt
it from the base zone height standards if it is designed as if it were an
integral part of the building and is not out of scale or proportion to other
similar rooftop structures.
            (4)   The proposed tower will be set back from the property line at
least a distance equal to the height of the tower.
            (5)   Any equipment associated with the tower facility will be
enclosed in an equipment shed, cabinet, or building, which must be adequately
screened from view of the public right of way and adjacent properties and
designed in a manner that will be compatible and blend in with future
residential development.
            (6)   The proposed tower will not utilize a backup generator as a
principal power source. Backup generators may only be used in the event of a
power outage. The board of adjustment may require that the electric
distribution line necessary to furnish electric service to the tower be made
underground from existing systems, however, this requirement would not apply to
electrical transformers, meter pedestals, switchgear and other appurtenances
impractical to bury.
            (7)   Strobe lighting is prohibited. Therefore, any tower that
requires such illumination is prohibited in these zones.
            (8)   The proposed tower must be designed and constructed to
accommodate at least one additional user, unless in doing so the tower will
exceed the one hundred twenty foot (120') height limitation or if the board of
adjustment determines that allowing the additional height needed to accommodate
another user will detract from the area to the extent that it will prevent
future development as envisioned in the comprehensive plan. The applicant shall
provide a certification by a professional engineer licensed in this state that
the proposed tower will be designed to permit a second antenna system of
comparable size to be added to the tower above or immediately below the
original antenna system.
            (9)   If use of the tower is discontinued, the tower and any
associated equipment must be removed by the owner of the tower, the operator,
or the owner of the property within one year of discontinuance of use and the
land graded and replanted to prevent erosion. The applicant shall present a
signed lease agreement, a recorded declaration of covenants, or other
satisfactory evidence acknowledging this obligation.
      5.   Communication Transmission Facilities In Commercial Zones And ID-
C Zone; Privately Owned Communication Transmission Facilities In Public Zones:
         a.   Communications antennas are permitted in all commercial zones,
the ID-C zone, and in public zones, provided the following conditions are met:
            (1)   The antenna must be mounted on another structure allowed in
the zone, such as a rooftop, light pole, or utility pole.
            (2)   In the CN-1 and CO-1 zones and in any ID-C zone that is
intended for a future CN-1 zone, strobe lighting is prohibited. Therefore, any
antenna that requires such illumination is prohibited in these zones.
            (3)   In public zones and in the CC-2, CH-1, CI-1, CB-2, CB-5, and
CB-10 zones and in any ID-C zone not intended for a future CN-1 zone, antennas
may not be illuminated by strobe lights unless required by federal regulations.
If alternatives are allowed under federal guidelines, strobe lights may not be
used.
            (4)   Any equipment associated with an antenna must be located
within the exterior walls of the building to which the antenna is attached or
screened from view of the public right of way and any adjacent property to at
least the S3 standard. (See chapter 5, article F, "Screening And Buffering
Standards", of this title.) If the equipment is located on the roof, it must be
set back and screened so that it is not within public view or appears to be
part of the building.
         b.   Communications towers are allowed by special exception in public
zones, the ID-C, CO-1, CN-1, CH-1, CI-1, CC-2, CB-2, CB-5, and CB-10 zones, and
must comply with the following approval criteria:
            (1)   If the proposed tower will be located in an ID-C zone that is
intended for a future neighborhood commercial zone according to the
comprehensive plan, as amended, then it must comply with any specific standards
listed below for CN-1 zones.
            (2)   The proposed tower serves an area that cannot be served by an
existing tower or industrial property or by locating antennas on existing
structures in the area. The applicant must document attempts to utilize
existing structures, towers, and industrial properties within one-half (1/2)
mile of the proposed tower. Such documentation must include maps illustrating
the location of existing towers and potential alternative sites for antenna and
towers that have been explored by the applicant and the applicant must state
the reasons that these locations were not feasible.
            (3)   The proposed tower will be constructed in a manner that will
camouflage the structure and reduce its visual impact on the surrounding area.
Examples of camouflage design include monopoles, which do not have guywires or
support trusses and that are painted to blend in with the sky or surroundings,
towers camouflaged as flagpoles, monuments, steeples, or the integration of
rooftop towers onto existing buildings, water towers, etc. Rooftop towers must
use materials similar to or that blend in with the structure to which it is
attached. Other camouflaged tower structures must be of similar height and
appearance as other similar structures allowed in the zone, e.g., towers
camouflaged as light poles or utility poles must be of similar height and
appearance as other such poles. The applicant must include an illustration of
how the tower would appear in the proposed location.
            (4)   The proposed tower will be no taller than is necessary to
provide the service intended. Evidence presented should include coverage maps
illustrating current gaps in coverage and changes to coverage with the proposed
tower. In the ID-C (except areas intended for CN-1), CH-1, CC-2, CI-1, CB-2,
CB-5 and CB-10 zones, communications towers are exempt from the maximum height
standards of the base zone, but under no circumstance may the tower be taller
than one hundred twenty feet (120') from grade. In the CO-1, CN-1, and any ID-
C zone intended for CN-1, communications towers must comply with the same
height standards that would apply to the type of structure to which they are
attached or if a communications tower is camouflaged to appear similar to
another common structure allowed in the zone, it must comply with the same
height standards that would apply to the type of structure that it emulates.
For example, if the tower is camouflaged as a light pole, flagpole, or utility
pole it must not exceed the height limitation for such structures as specified
in the base zone. If no height standard exists in the code for such a
structure, it must be designed to be of similar height and appearance to other
similar or typical structures. If the tower is camouflaged as a chimney or
other similar rooftop structure, the board may exempt it from the base zone
height standards if it is designed as if it were an integral part of the
building and is not out of scale or proportion to other similar rooftop
structures.
            (5)   The proposed tower will be set back at least a distance equal
to the height of the tower from any residential zone, ID-RS zone, and ID-RM
zone.
            (6)   Any equipment associated with the tower facility will be
enclosed in an equipment shed, cabinet, or building, which must be adequately
screened from view of the public right of way and any adjacent residential or
commercial property.
            (7)   The proposed tower will not utilize a backup generator as a
principal power source. Backup generators may only be used in the event of a
power outage.
            (8)   In the CN-1 and CO-1 zones and in any ID-C zone that is
intended for a future CN-1 zone, strobe lighting is prohibited. Therefore, any
tower that requires such illumination is prohibited in these zones. The tower
will not be illuminated by strobe lights unless required by federal
regulations. If alternatives are allowed under federal guidelines, strobe
lights may not be used.
            (9)   The proposed tower must be designed and constructed to
accommodate at least one additional user, unless in doing so the tower will
exceed the one hundred twenty foot (120') height limitation or if the board of
adjustment determines that allowing the additional height needed to accommodate
another user will detract from the area to the extent that it will prevent
future development intended in the zone. The applicant shall provide a
certification by a professional engineer licensed in this state that the
proposed tower will be designed to permit a second antenna system of comparable
size to be added to the tower above or immediately below the original antenna
system.
            (10)   If use of the tower is discontinued, the tower and any
associated equipment must be removed by the owner of the tower, the operator,
or the owner of the property within one year of discontinuance of use and the
land graded and replanted to prevent erosion. The applicant shall present a
signed lease agreement, a recorded declaration of covenants, or other
satisfactory evidence acknowledging this obligation.
      6.   Communication Transmission Facilities In Industrial And Research
Park Zones And ID-RP And ID-I Zones:
         a.   Communications antennas are permitted in all Industrial and
Research Park Zones and in the ID-I and ID-RP Zones, provided the antenna is
mounted on another structure allowed in the zone, such as a rooftop, light
pole, or utility pole.
         b.   Communications towers are allowed in the ID-I, I-1 and I-2 Zones
and by special exception in the ID-RP, RDP and ORP Zones, provided the
following conditions are met:
            (1)   The proposed tower will be set back at least a distance equal
to the height of the tower from any residential zone, ID-RS Zone, and ID-RM
Zone.
            (2)   The tower and any associated equipment, buildings, or
structures must be screened from the public right-of-way and any bordering
residential or commercial zone to at least the S3 standard. (See chapter 5,
article F, "Screening And Buffering Standards", of this title.)
            (3)   The proposed tower must be designed and constructed to
accommodate at least two (2) additional users. The applicant shall provide a
certification by a professional engineer licensed in this State that the
proposed tower will be designed to permit two (2) additional antenna systems of
comparable size to be added to the tower above or immediately below the
original antenna system.
            (4)   If use of the tower is discontinued, the tower and any
associated equipment must be removed by the owner of the tower, the operator,
or the owner of the property within one year of discontinuance of use and the
land graded and replanted to prevent erosion. The applicant shall present a
signed lease agreement, a recorded declaration of covenants, or other
satisfactory evidence acknowledging this obligation.

Accessory uses, buildings or other structures customarily incidental to and
commonly associated with a permitted use, provisional use or special exception
are permitted, provided they are operated and maintained according to the
following standards:
   A.   The accessory use is subordinate to the principal use of the property
and contributes to the comfort, convenience or necessity of occupants,
customers, or employees of the principal use;
   B.   The accessory use, building or structure is under the same ownership as
the principal use or uses on the property;
   C.   The accessory use, building or structure does not include structures,
structural features, or activities inconsistent with the uses to which they are
accessory;
   D.   Except for off street parking located on a separate lot as approved
according to the provisions set forth in subsection
14-5A-4F, “Alternatives To Minimum Parking Requirements”, of this title, the
accessory use, building, or structure is located on the same lot as the
principal use or uses to which it is accessory; and
   E.   The accessory use, building, or structure conforms to the applicable
base zone regulations and to the specific approval criteria and development
standards contained in this article. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd. Ord. 11-
4449, 10-18-2011)
14-4C-2: SPECIFIC APPROVAL CRITERIA:
Any accessory uses listed in the following subsections must comply with the
conditions listed, unless specifically exempted or superseded by more specific
provisions of this title. As noted, some require special exception approval
from the Board of Adjustment. If a regulation in the base zone chapter
conflicts with a regulation contained in this article, the regulation that is
more specific to the situation applies. When regulations are equally specific
or when it is unclear which regulation to apply, the more restrictive
regulation will govern.
   A.   Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs): ADUs are permitted provided the
following conditions are met:
      1.   Applicability: The ADU shall be located in a zone that allows
household living uses and shall be accessory to a principal use that consists
of no more than two (2) dwelling units on a lot.
      2.   Ownership:
         a.   The owner of the property on which an ADU is located must occupy
at least one of the dwelling units on the premises as the permanent legal
resident.
         b.   The ADU and the principal use must be under the same ownership.
      3.   Site Requirements:
         a.   Only one ADU may be established per lot.
         b.   The minimum lot size and area per unit requirements of the
underlying base zone must be met, but no additional lot area is required beyond
that which is required for the principal use.
      4.   Design Requirements:
         a.   The ADU must be a complete, separate dwelling unit that functions
independently from the principal use. It must contain its own kitchen and
bathroom facilities, in addition to a separate entrance from the exterior.
         b.   When located within a building with an existing principal use,
the ADU must be designed so that the appearance of the building remains that of
an allowed use within that zone, and any new entrances, exterior finish
materials, trim, windows, and eaves must visually match the principal use.
      5.   Apartment Size: The floor area of the ADU may not exceed fifty
percent (50%) of the total floor area of the principal use, excluding the area
of an attached garage, or one thousand (1,000) square feet, whichever is less.
   B.   Accessory Retail Sales: For nonresidential uses, accessory retail sales
is permitted, provided the following conditions are met. Retail sales
associated with home occupations is addressed in the subsection M, "Home
Occupations", of this section.
      1.   Accessory retail sales must clearly be subordinate to the use to
which it is accessory. The floor area devoted to accessory retail sales may not
exceed one thousand (1,000) square feet or forty percent (40%) of the total
floor area of the principal use to which the retail sales is accessory,
whichever is less. The floor area devoted to accessory uses is included when
calculating the total floor area of the principal use. For example, a small
manufacturing establishment contains a total of two thousand (2,000) square
feet of floor area. Under this provision, the establishment may include up to
eight hundred (800) square feet of accessory retail space.
      2.   The operation of and area devoted to retail sales must meet the
performance standards for commercial zones as specified in

activities, such as clubhouses, driving ranges, swimming pools, recreation
buildings, sports fields, and tennis courts, which are located within private,
shared open space, are permitted by special exception and are subject to the
following approval criteria, except for uses approved through a planned
development process. Uses, buildings, and structures devoted to active
recreational activities approved through a planned development process are not
initially required to obtain special exception approval. However, any expansion
or enlargement of such a use, building, or structure requires special exception
approval from the board of adjustment, except as permitted in subsection C3g of
this section. A special exception is not required for buildings or structures
devoted to active recreational activities within public parks.
         a.   The proposed use is properly located to provide adequate
separation between properties and between uses within the parks and open space
area. Any buildings associated with the proposed use must comply with the
setback requirements for principal buildings in the underlying base zone. Other
structures and facilities must be set back at least twenty feet (20') from any
property line. The board of adjustment may reduce or increase the setback
requirements; provided, that adequate separation is established based on the
specific use proposed and the nature of the surrounding properties.
         b.   The proposed use is consistent with the intended character of the
specific parks and open space area.
         c.   The location or operation of the proposed use will not compromise
any designated environmental conservation areas adjacent to or within the parks
and open space area.
         d.   The transportation system is capable of safely supporting the
proposed use in addition to the existing uses in the area. Evaluation factors
include street capacity and level of service, access requirements, on street
parking impacts, neighborhood impacts, and pedestrian safety.
         e.   Adequate public services are available or will be made available
to serve the proposed use.
         f.   The proposed use will not have significant adverse impacts on the
livability of nearby residential properties due to noise, glare from lights,
late night operations, odors, and litter.
         g.   The building official may grant approval for the following minor
modifications to accessory uses within parks and open space uses without
approval from the board of adjustment, according to the procedures and approval
criteria for minor modifications as set forth in
chapter 4, article B of this title:
            (1)   An accessory storage building less than five hundred (500)
square feet in size.
            (2)   A building addition of less than five hundred (500) square
feet, provided the addition does not increase the occupancy load of the
building.

      2.   Riverfront Crossings Zones; Limitations And Restrictions:
         a.   In all riverfront crossings subdistricts, except for the west
riverfront and south Gilbert subdistricts, drive-throughs are limited to
facilities that are accessory to financial institutions and pharmacies.
         b.   In the south Gilbert subdistrict, drive-through facilities are
not allowed along frontages designated as required retail storefronts or
required Ralston Creek frontages, or along the required pedestrian streets that
extend east-west through the block to provide connections to the riverfront
park, all as illustrated in section
14-2G-2,
 figure 2G-1, "Regulating Plan", of this title. Otherwise, drive-through
facilities are allowed by special exception for any use allowed in the
subdistrict.
         c.   In the west riverfront subdistrict, drive-through facilities are
allowed by special exception for any use allowed in the subdistrict according
to the provisions set forth in this section.
         d.   Principal buildings to which a drive-through is accessory must
comply with all standards of the applicable riverfront crossings subdistrict as
specified in chapter 2, article G of this title, unless a minor adjustment is
approved by the FBC committee according to the provisions in subsection
14-2G-7H, "Minor Adjustments", of this title.
      3.   Special Exception Approval Criteria:
         a.   Access And Circulation: The transportation system should be
capable of safely supporting the proposed drive-through use in addition to the
existing uses in the area. Evaluation factors include street capacity and level
of service, effects on traffic circulation, access requirements, separation of
curb cuts, and pedestrian safety in addition to the following criteria:
            (1)   Wherever possible and practical, drive-through lanes shall be
accessed from secondary streets, alleys, or shared cross access drives. If the
applicant can demonstrate that access from a secondary street, alley, or shared
cross access drive is not possible, the board may grant access to a primary
street, but may impose conditions such as limiting the width of the curb cut
and drive, limiting the number of lanes, requiring the drive-through bays and
stacking lanes to be enclosed within the building envelope, and similar
conditions.
            (2)   To provide for safe pedestrian movement, the number and width
of curb cuts serving the use may be limited. A proposal for a new curb cut on
any street is subject to the standards and restrictions in chapter 5, article
C, "Access Management Standards", of this title.
            (3)   An adequate number of stacking spaces must be provided to
ensure traffic safety is not compromised. A minimum of six (6) stacking spaces
is recommended for drive-through facilities associated with eating
establishments and a minimum of four (4) stacking spaces for banking,
pharmacies, and similar nonfood related drive-through facilities. "Stacking
spaces" shall be defined as being twenty feet (20') in length and the width of
a one lane, one-way drive. The board may reduce the recommended number of
stacking spaces if the applicant can demonstrate that the specific business has
unique characteristics such that the recommended number of parking spaces is
excessive (i.e., a drive- through that is to be used for pick up only and not
ordering).
            (4)   Sufficient on site signage and pavement markings shall be
provided to indicate direction of vehicular travel, pedestrian crossings, stop
signs, no entrance areas, and other controls to ensure safe vehicular and
pedestrian movement.
         b.   Location:
            (1)   In the CB-2 zone and in all subdistricts of the riverfront
crossings district located east of the Iowa River, drive-through lanes and
service windows must be located on a nonstreet-facing facade. In all other
locations where drive-throughs are allowed, this location standard must be met,
unless the applicant can demonstrate that a street-facing location is
preferable for the overall safety and efficiency of the site, does not conflict
with adjacent uses or pedestrian access, and does not compromise the character
of the streetscape or neighborhood in which it is located.
            (2)   Drive-through lanes must be set back at least ten feet (10')
from adjacent lot lines and public rights of way and screened from view
according to the design standards below.
         c.   Design Standards: The number of drive-through lanes, stacking
spaces, and paved area necessary for the drive-through facility will not be
detrimental to adjacent residential properties or detract from or unduly
interrupt pedestrian circulation or the commercial character of the area in
which the use is located. The board of adjustment may increase or reduce these
standards according to the circumstances affecting the site.
            (1)   To promote compatibility with surrounding development, the
number of drive-through lanes should be limited such that the amount of paving
and stacking space does not diminish the design quality of the streetscape or
the safety of the pedestrian environment.
            (2)   Drive-through lanes, bays, and stacking spaces shall be
screened from views from the street and adjacent properties to the S2 standard.
If the drive-through is located adjacent to a residential use or property zoned
residential, it must be screened from view of these properties to at least the
S3 standard. To preserve the pedestrian oriented character of streets in the
CB-2 zone and the riverfront crossings district, the board may require the
drive-through to be incorporated within the building or be screened with
masonry street walls and landscaping. Street walls shall be a minimum of five
feet (5') in height and shall be designed to complement the principal building
on the site.
            (3)   Multiple windows servicing a single stacking lane (e.g.,
order board, payment window, pick up window) should be considered to reduce the
amount of idling on the site.
            (4)   Stacking spaces, driveways, and drive-through windows shall
be located to minimize potential for vehicular and pedestrian conflicts and
shall be integrated into the surrounding landscape and streetscape design of
the neighborhood in which it is located.
            (5)   Lighting for the drive-through facility must comply with the
outdoor lighting standards set forth in chapter 5, article G of this title and
must be designed to prevent light trespass and glare onto neighboring
residential properties.
            (6)   (Rep. by Ord. 16-4685, 11-15-2016)
            (7)   Loudspeakers or intercom systems, if allowed, should be
located and directed to minimize disturbance to adjacent uses. Special
consideration should be given to locations adjacent to residential uses to
ensure such systems do not diminish the residential character of the
neighborhood.
   L.   Fences, Walls, And Hedges:
      1.   Permit Required: A permit is required for all of the following:
         a.   Electric fences;
         b.   Barbed wire fences;
         c.   Any fence or wall over six feet (6') in height;
         d.   Any retaining wall over four feet (4') in height measured from
the top of the footing to the top of the wall; and
         e.   A retaining wall of any height that supports a surcharge or
impounds flammable liquids.
      2.   Location And Height Requirements: All fences, walls, and hedges
located within a principal building front, side, or rear setback area or within
five feet (5') of a lot line, are subject to the following location and height
requirements:
         a.   Except as otherwise allowed or required in chapter 2, article G,
"Riverfront Crossings And Eastside Mixed Use Districts Form Based Development
Standards", of this title, no portion of a fence or wall more than ten percent
(10%) solid shall exceed eight feet (8') in height. The solidity is the percent
of the fence over a random area which is made up of solid, opaque material, and
which does not allow light or air to pass through. Retaining walls are exempt
from the provisions of this paragraph.
         b.   Fences, walls, and hedges must be set back at least two feet (2')
from any alley or street right of way line.
         c.   On corner lots, fences, walls, and hedges over two feet (2') in
height must comply with the provisions of chapter 5, article D, "Intersection
Visibility Standards", of this title.
         d.   Fences and walls that exceed four feet (4') in height are not
permitted in the principal building, front setback area on properties zoned
residential or on properties located within fifty feet (50') of any property
along the same frontage that is zoned residential. However, this height limit
is increased to six feet (6') for lots with frontages along an expressway or an
arterial street; provided, that the lot is a double frontage lot or a reversed
corner lot. Retaining walls are exempt from the provisions of this paragraph. A
minor modification may be requested to adjust the height of an entranceway gate
in a fence located within a front yard setback area according to the procedures
and approval criteria for minor modifications contained in article B of this
chapter.
         e.   In riverfront crossings zones and the eastside mixed use
district, fences and walls located within private frontage areas are strictly
regulated and, if allowed, must comply with the applicable frontage type
standards as specified in chapter 2, article G of this title.
      3.   Regulations For Barbed Wire And Electric Fences: Barbed wire and
electric fences are subject to the following regulations:
         a.   Barbed wire consists of twisted wires with barbs on each wire.
The barbs on each wire must be at least four inches (4") apart. Any barbed wire
that does not meet this description is prohibited. Concertina wire is
prohibited.
         b.   Except when used for the enclosure of livestock associated with
an allowed agriculture use, barbed wire fences are permitted only in the
commercial, industrial, and research zones, provided the bottom strand of
barbed wire is not less than six feet (6') above grade.
         c.   Except for the enclosure of livestock associated with an allowed
agriculture use, electric fences are not permitted in any zone.
         d.   No electric fence shall carry a charge greater than twenty five
(25) milliamperes nor a pulsating current lower than one- tenth (1/10) second
in a one second cycle. All electric fences must carry the seal of an approved
testing laboratory.
         e.   Barbed wire and electric fences are prohibited within five feet
(5') of a public sidewalk or within four feet (4') of a street right of way
line where a public sidewalk does not exist. In the latter case, however, a
barbed wire or electric fence may be installed or constructed along the right
of way line if the property owner agrees to move the fence back the required
distance within two (2) months after the installation of a public sidewalk.
Said agreement must be submitted with the application for a fence permit.
   M.   Home Occupations: There are two (2) categories of home occupations,
type A and type B. Type A home occupations are permitted, provided the use
complies with the standards in subsections M3 through M9 of this section. Type
B home occupations are permitted, provided the use complies with the standards
in subsections M3 through M9 of this section, and the operator of the use
obtains a home occupation permit from the city as described in subsection M2 of
this section. The standards for bed and breakfast homestays, bed and breakfast
inns, and childcare homes are specified in other subsections of this section
and are, therefore, not subject the provisions of this subsection.
      1.   Home Occupation Types:
         a.   Type A: A "type A home occupation" is one where a resident or
residents of a dwelling use the dwelling as a place of work, but no employees
or customers come to the site. Examples include artists, craftspersons,
writers, and consultants. Type A home occupations also provide an opportunity
for a home to be used as a business address but not as a place of work. No
permit is required for these uses, but they must comply with all of the other
regulations stated herein.
         b.   Type B: A "type B home occupation" is one where a nonresident
employee works at the site or where customers frequent the site on a regular
basis. Examples include counseling, tutoring, and hair cutting and styling. A
home occupation permit is required for these uses.
      2.   Permit Required For Type B Home Occupations: Prior to establishment
of a type B home occupation, a home occupation permit must be obtained from the
department of housing and inspection services according to the procedures set
forth in chapter 8, article B, "Administrative Approval Procedures", of this
title. A home occupation permit is required in order to ensure that the
applicant is aware of the provisions governing home occupations and that the
city has all information necessary to evaluate whether the proposal initially
meets and continues to meet the provisions of this subsection.
      3.   Location And Occupancy:
         a.   The home occupation use must be located within a dwelling unit or
within a building that is accessory to a dwelling unit.
         b.   The dwelling unit must be the bona fide primary residence of the
owner and operator of the home occupation during nonbusiness hours.
      4.   Prohibited Uses: In addition to the uses that would be excluded
based on the conditions specified in this subsection, the following uses are
specifically prohibited as home occupations:
         a.   Adult business uses.
         b.   Veterinary clinics and kennels.
         c.   Commercial recreational uses.
         d.   Commercial parking.
         e.   Eating and drinking establishments.
         f.   Medical/dental offices, except for psychiatrists, psychologists,
chiropractors, and physical therapists.
         g.   Any type of repair or assembly of vehicles or equipment with
internal combustion engines (such as automobiles, motorcycles, scooters,
snowmobiles, outboard marine engines, lawn mowers, chain saws and other small
engines) or of large appliances (such as washing machines, dryers, and
refrigerators) or any other work related to automobiles and their parts.
         h.   Self-service storage.
         i.   Industrial service.
         j.   Any use which changes the fire safety rating of the occupancy
separation classification requirements of the structure.
      5.   Commercial Activity:
         a.   No commodities may be sold on the premises except for those
produced on the premises or those associated with the home occupation conducted
on the premises.
         b.   Type B home occupations are limited to ten (10) clients or
customers per day.
      6.   Traffic And Parking:
         a.   The proposed use will not generate a greater volume or type of
traffic than what is normally expected in the zone in which it is located; nor
will it necessitate parking in excess of what is normally expected in the zone
in which it is located. Vehicles used for delivery and pick up are limited to
those normally servicing residential neighborhoods.
         b.   No more than one truck associated with the home occupation may be
parked at the site. Only light trucks that are less than seven feet (7') in
height are permitted. Medium and heavy trucks are prohibited. A "light truck"
is a truck with a single rear axle and a single set of rear wheels. The home
occupation use must comply with regulations in chapter 5, article A, "Off
Street Parking And Loading Standards", of this title, regarding the parking and
storage of special vehicles and commercial vehicles and the provisions of title
9, chapter 4, "Parking Regulations", of this code.
      7.   Off Site Impacts: Except for a permitted sign, there must be no
indication from the exterior of the dwelling unit or accessory building, such
as noise, odor, smoke, dust, excessive outdoor lighting, or outdoor storage of
materials, that there is a home occupation use on the premises. No visitors or
deliveries to the home occupation use are permitted before seven o'clock (7:00)
A.M. or after ten o'clock (10:00) P.M.
      8.   Size: For a home occupation located within a principal dwelling
unit, the floor area devoted to the home occupation may not exceed twenty five
percent (25%) of the total floor area of the principal dwelling (the floor area
of an attached garage is not included in the calculation of total floor area of
the dwelling). This twenty five percent (25%) limit applies regardless of
whether the home occupation is located within the principal dwelling unit or
within an accessory building. For example, for a property where the principal
dwelling contains two thousand (2,000) square feet of floor area, a home
occupation would be limited to five hundred (500) square feet regardless of
whether it was located within the dwelling or within an accessory building.
      9.   Nonresident Employees: Nonresident employees are prohibited, except
as approved by the building official as a minor modification to the home
occupation use, according to the approval criteria and procedures for minor
modifications as set forth in chapter 4, article B of this title.
      10.   Signage: Home occupations are permitted one nonilluminated fascia
sign, not to exceed one square foot in size.

      1.   Screening:
         a.   All ground level mechanical and utility equipment, such as heat
pumps, air conditioners, emergency generators, electrical vehicle charging
stations, and water pumps, must be screened from public view to at least the S2
standard. (See chapter 5, article F, “Screening And Buffering Standards”, of
this title.) If it is not feasible to use landscape screening, the mechanical
equipment must be screened using wall or fencing materials complementary to the
principal structure. Mechanical structures accessory to single-family uses and
solar energy systems accessory to any uses are exempt from this standard.
         b.   In all zones except I-1 and I-2, rooftop mechanical equipment
must be concealed from public view by integrating equipment into the design of
the building, screening equipment behind building features, such as parapets,
or by setting the equipment back from the edge of the roof so that it is not
visible from ground level. Solar energy systems are exempt from this standard.
      2.   Setbacks:
         a.   Single-Family Residential Zones: Mechanical structures must be
set back at least two feet (2') from the side and rear lot lines. However,
mechanical structures may not be located between the principal dwelling and the
street.
         b.   All Other Zones: Mechanical structures must be set back at least
two feet (2') from any lot line. Additional location standards may apply in
certain zones or for certain uses.
      3.   Minor Modifications For Solar Energy Systems: A minor modification
for solar energy systems may be requested according to chapter 4, article B of
this title.
   O.   Off Street Loading: Off street loading is permitted in the multi-
family, commercial, industrial, and research zones according to the provisions
of chapter 5, article A, "Off Street Parking And Loading Standards", of this
title.
   P.   Off Street Parking: Off street parking must comply with the provisions
of the base zone in which it is located and the provisions of chapter 5,
article A, "Off Street Parking And Loading Standards", of this title.
   Q.   Outdoor Dumpster Areas:

compliance with the applicable provisions of title 16, chapter 3, article H,
"Solid Waste", of this code.
      2.   Any such area must be screened from view of adjacent properties and
from the public right of way to the S3 or S5 standard. (See chapter 5, article
F, "Screening And Buffering Standards", of this title.)
   R.   Outdoor Lighting: Outdoor lighting must comply with the provisions of
the base zone in which it is located and the provisions of chapter 5, article
G, "Outdoor Lighting Standards", of this title.
   S.   Outdoor Storage And Display: Any use with permanent outdoor storage or
outdoor display areas must comply with the standards for the base zone in which
the use is located, the relevant performance standards as specified in chapter
5, article H of this title, and any additional standards required for the use
in article B of this chapter. Uses with temporary outdoor storage and display
areas must comply with the regulations in article D, "Temporary Uses", of this
chapter.
   T.   Swimming Pools, Hot Tubs, And Tennis Courts: Swimming pools, hot tubs,
and tennis courts intended for private use by persons that reside on the
property or their guests are permitted, provided the following conditions are
met:
      1.   Setbacks:
         a.   Residential Zones, Riverfront Crossings Zones, And The Eastside
Mixed Use District:
            (1)   The use must be set back a minimum of ten feet (10') from any
side or rear lot line.
            (2)   The use may not be located in the front yard (see definition
of "front yard" in chapter 9, article A of this title) unless the use is set
back at least forty feet (40') from the front property line.
         b.   Nonresidential Zones: In nonresidential zones, the use must be
set back a minimum of ten feet (10') from any side, rear, or front property
line, unless the property on which the use is located is directly abutting or
across the street from a property zoned residential. In the case of such an
adjacency, the use must comply with the setback requirements for residential
zones as stated in subsection T1a of this section.
      2.   Lighting Standards: Lighting for such facilities must comply with
the standards specified in chapter 5, article G, "Outdoor Lighting Standards",
of this title.
      3.   Fence Requirement: Swimming pools, with a depth of eighteen inches

constructed so that a sphere, five inches (5") in diameter, cannot pass through
the fence.
         b.   A principal or accessory building may be used as part of the
enclosure.
         c.   All gates and doors opening through the enclosure must be
equipped with a self-closing and self-latching device for keeping the gate or
door securely closed at all times when not in use, except the door of any
building which forms a part of the enclosure need not be so equipped.
         d.   The building official may permit other protective devices or
structures to be used so long as the degree of protection afforded by the
substitute device or structure is not less than the protection afforded by an
enclosure built to the specifications of this subsection T3.
   U.   Roadside Stands For The Sale Of Produce: Roadside stands for the sale
of produce grown on the premises are permitted in the ID zones and the RR-
1 zone, provided the following conditions are met:
      1.   The stand contains no more than six hundred (600) square feet of
floor area;

continuous period of six (6) months, the system shall be deemed to be
abandoned. The SWECS owner and/or the owner of the property shall remove the
abandoned system at their expense. To comply with this requirement, the entire
structure, transmission equipment and any surrounding fencing must be removed
from the property, excluding foundations. Nonfunction or lack of operation may
be proven by reports from the interconnected utility. For off grid systems the
City of Iowa City shall have the right to enter the property at its sole
discretion to determine if the off grid system is generating power. Such
generation may be proven by use of an amp meter. The SWECS owner/operator and
any successors shall make available to the Director of Housing and Inspection
Services or designee any and all reports or documents needed to determine
functionality, if requested. If removal of towers and appurtenant facilities is
required, the Director of Housing and Inspection Services Department or

      1.   Approval Criteria For Rooftop Service Areas:
         a.   Accessibility: The RSA shall meet all building and fire code
requirements, be ADA compliant, include elevator service, and have accessible
restrooms provided.
         b.   Design: The RSA shall be designed in an attractive manner that
will not detract from adjacent uses, and will prevent nuisance and safety
issues. The applicant shall submit a design plan with the application for an
RSA that, at a minimum, specifies and illustrates the proposed size,
dimensions, setbacks from adjacent buildings and roof edges, occupancy load,
layout, landscaping elements, access routes, elevator, and accessible
bathrooms. RSAs shall meet the following minimum standards. If a special
exception is required, the board of adjustment may impose additional or more
restrictive conditions to mitigate any anticipated externalities, including,
but not limited to, restrictions on hours of operation, lighting, size,
occupancy load, and setback and screening requirements.
            (1)   The RSA shall be located directly adjacent to or above the
use to which it is accessory and there shall not be other uses located on
floors in between the RSA and the use to which it is accessory.
            (2)   The RSA must be set back from adjacent upper floor uses and
the edge of the roof and screened and completely enclosed within a decorative
fence or wall built of high quality, durable materials. Landscaping elements,
such as planters and green roofs, may be used to soften views or provide a
buffer. The setback and screening must be established in a manner that will not
unduly block light, air, or outdoor views from upper floor windows on abutting
buildings.
            (3)   The RSA must be set back a minimum of ten feet (10') from the
street facing edge of the roof. A smaller buffer between the RSA and the roof
parapet or guardrail may be allowed, provided the buffer is determined to
adequately address public safety. The buffer and screen wall shall be of a
sufficient depth and/or height and constructed of attractive, durable materials
that may also include landscaping elements to prevent persons from leaning or
dropping things over the parapet or guardrail that encloses the terrace or
rooftop. A design of the proposed buffer and screen wall shall be submitted
with the application.
            (4)   The lighting must comply with chapter 5, article G, "Outdoor
Lighting Standards", of this title. Except for any lighting required by the
building code, lights must be turned off when the RSA is not in operation. A
lighting plan shall be submitted that illustrates compliance with these
standards.
            (5)   No signs shall be allowed in or on the exterior wall or fence
of the RSA that are within public view, as defined in chapter 9, article
A of this title.
         c.   Management:
            (1)   For RSAs that are also outdoor service areas, as defined in
title 4 of this code, there must be an RSA management plan in place and at
least one employee must be designated to monitor the safety and compliance of
the RSA during hours of operation. The proposed management plan shall be
submitted with the application. If nuisance or safety issues arise, the city
may require immediate changes to the management plan and/or the number of
monitors to remedy the situation and reserves the right to suspend or revoke
the RSA permit.
            (2)   In the CB-10 zone, where the building containing the RSA
abuts or is directly across a public alley from a property containing upper
floor residential uses or hotel rooms that have windows facing the RSA, the
hours of operation of the RSA are limited to ten o'clock (10:00) A.M. to ten
o'clock (10:00) P.M. Sunday through Thursday and ten o'clock (10:00) A.M. to
twelve o'clock (12:00) midnight Friday and Saturday.
         d.   Food Service: If alcohol is being served, food service must be
provided. Prior to approval of an RSA, the applicant must submit evidence
indicating how this requirement will be met.
         e.   Noise: The design of the RSA must minimize the carry of noise
across property boundaries. Use of specialized screen wall materials, sound
deadening techniques, or similar, may be required. Evidence of such a noise
mitigation plan must be included with an RSA application. In addition, after an
RSA is established, the city reserves the right to require additional measures
to remedy any violation of the city's noise or nuisance ordinance, as
determined by the city.
         f.   Amplified Sound: Due to the potential nuisance to neighboring
properties and the general public in the surrounding neighborhood, amplified
sound is only allowed for RSAs associated with hospitality oriented retail uses
in the RFC-SD subdistrict and for RSAs in the CB-10 zone, subject to the
limitations set forth below. RSAs accessory to hospitality oriented retail uses
are not required to obtain a temporary use permit, but must comply with the
city's noise and nuisance ordinance, and the standards stated below. Amplified
sound is only allowed for an RSA in the CB-10 zone upon receipt of a seasonal
temporary use permit, unless it is accessory to a hospitality oriented use.
Permits for amplified sound are subject to the standards and restrictions set
forth below and the general approval criteria for temporary uses as set forth
in article D of this chapter. A temporary use permit may be denied or rescinded
at the discretion of the city if noise becomes a nuisance or terms of the
temporary use permit or the special exception conditions are violated.
            (1)   If an RSA is located within three hundred feet (300') of a
residential zone, amplified sound is prohibited;
            (2)   The city may restrict the hours when amplified sound may be
used. However, in no case shall amplified sound be permitted between the hours
of twelve o'clock (12:00) midnight and ten o'clock (10:00) A.M.;
            (3)   No live entertainment using amplification shall be allowed;
            (4)   Amplified sound may be restricted or prohibited during public
events, festivals or concerts;
            (5)   The applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
city that the design of the RSA will minimize carry of noise across property
boundaries. Use of specialized screen wall materials, sound deadening
techniques, control of volume, or similar may be required.
      2.   Additional Special Exception Approval Criteria For Nonconforming
Drinking Establishments: An RSA accessory to a nonconforming drinking
establishment may be allowed by special exception provided it meets the general
approval criteria for special exceptions set forth in section
14-4B-3 of this chapter, the approval criteria stated above for all RSAs and
the additional approval criteria listed below:
         a.   The RSA shall be located directly above and contiguous to the
licensed drinking establishment. Contiguous means there may not be other uses
located on floors in between the drinking establishment and the accessory RSA.
         b.   There shall be no horizontal expansion of the licensed drinking
establishment, except as allowed per
14-4E-5G;
         c.   There shall be no increase in interior floor area or interior
occupant load of the existing drinking establishment, except if necessary for
required bathrooms, elevator, stairs, kitchen equipment, or other essential
elements necessary to meet accessibility, building code requirements or to meet
the requirements or conditions of the special exception, or except as allowed
per
14-4E-5G. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd. Ord. 06-4245, 12-12-2006; Ord. 12-

14-4C-3: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
The following development standards help to ensure that accessory structures
and buildings remain secondary to the principal uses and buildings on a site.
The standards provide for necessary access around structures, help maintain
privacy to abutting lots, and maintain open front setback areas. In addition to
any requirements in the base zone and any specific approval criteria in section
14-4C-2 of this article, accessory structures are subject to the following
requirements:
   A.   Time Of Construction: Accessory structures may not be constructed prior
to the start of construction of the principal building on a site; except, that
temporary construction trailers may be placed on a site at the time site
clearance and grading begins and may remain on the site only for the duration
of construction.
   B.   Setbacks:
      1.   Accessory Structures Other Than Buildings: Allowed accessory
structures, other than buildings, may be located anywhere on a lot, provided
the structure complies with any specific setback standards listed in section
14-4C-2 of this article, and provided that on corner lots, such a structure is
located in compliance with the provisions of
chapter 5, article D, "Intersection Visibility Standards", of this title.
      2.   Detached Accessory Buildings:
         a.   Corner Lot Setback Requirements: On corner lots, detached
accessory buildings must be located in compliance with the provisions of
chapter 5, article D, "Intersection Visibility Standards", of this title.
         b.   Front Setback Requirements:
            (1)   Except for roadside stands, detached accessory buildings must
comply with the principal building, front setback requirements of the base zone
in which the building is located. Roadside stands, when allowed, are exempt
from this requirement. In addition, garages and carports must comply with
subsections B2b(2) and B2b(3) of this section.
            (2)   Garages and carports must be located pursuant to the site
development standards of the applicable base zone.
            (3)   For single-family and two-family uses, a garage or carport
must be set back at least twenty five feet (25') from any street- side lot line
that the garage or carport entrance faces. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
         c.   Side And Rear Setback Requirements:
            (1)   Residential Zones:
               (A)   Along street-side lot lines, accessory buildings must
comply with the front, principal building setback requirement. Along side or
rear lot lines that are not street-side lot lines, accessory buildings must be
set back at least five feet (5') from the side or rear lot line. This five foot
(5') setback requirement may be reduced if an accessory building is set back at
least sixty feet (60') from the edge of the street pavement. In such cases, the
building may be located within three feet (3') of a side or rear property line.
However, garages and carports entered directly from an alley must be set back
at least five feet (5') from the alley right-of-way line, regardless of how far
back the structure is from the street.
               (B)   A detached accessory building for a zero lot line dwelling
must comply with the same side setback requirements as the principal dwelling.
(Ord. 06-4245, 12-12-2006)
            (2)   Nonresidential Zones: Along street-side lot lines, accessory
buildings must comply with the front, principal building setback requirement.
Along side or rear lot lines that are not street- side lot lines, detached
accessory buildings do not have a required side or rear setback, unless the
detached building is a parking garage that is accessed from an alley. In such a
case, the garage must be set back at least five feet (5') from the alley right-
of-way line.
      3.   Attached Accessory Buildings:
         a.   An attached accessory building must comply with the setback
requirements applicable to the principal building to which it is attached. In
addition, attached garages and carports must comply with subsections B3b and
B3c of this section.
         b.   Attached garages and carports must be located pursuant to the
site development standards of the base zone.
         c.   For single-family and two-family uses, a garage or carport must
be set back at least twenty five feet (25') from any street- side lot line that
the garage or carport entrance faces. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
         d.   For purposes of determining setbacks, garages located in the rear
yard and attached to the principal dwelling with a (non- habitable) breezeway
(8 feet or narrower in width) will be considered detached accessory buildings
and, therefore, are subject to the setback requirements for detached accessory
buildings, rather than principal building setback requirements. Similarly,
subject breezeways shall be treated as detached accessory structures/buildings.
(Ord. 18-4744, 4-2-2018)
      4.   Adjustments To Setback Requirements:
         a.   A minor modification to reduce setback requirements for an
accessory use, building, or structure may be requested according to the
approval criteria and procedures for minor modifications contained in
chapter 4, article B of this title.
         b.   A special exception may be requested to reduce setback
requirements for an accessory use, building, or structure beyond what is
allowed by minor modification. The Board of Adjustment may adjust setback
requirements if the owner or lawful occupant of a property demonstrates that
the general special exception approval criteria and the following specific
approval criteria have been satisfied:
            (1)   The situation is peculiar to the property in question;
            (2)   There is practical difficulty in complying with the setback
requirements;
            (3)   Granting the exception will not be contrary to the purpose of
the setback regulations; and
            (4)   Any potential negative effects resulting from the setback
exception are mitigated to the extent practical.
            (5)   The accessory use, building or structure will be located no
closer than three feet (3') to a side or rear property line, unless the side or
rear property line abuts a public right-of-way or permanent open space.
   C.   Building Separation And Lot Coverage:
      1.   In residential zones, the combined footprint of all detached
accessory buildings may not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the total lot area.
The area of any outdoor special vehicle storage area must also be included as a
part of this fifteen percent (15%) lot coverage limitation.
      2.   No portion of a detached accessory building may be located closer
than three feet (3') to the principal building.
      3.   There must be at least three feet (3') between all unattached
accessory buildings.
   D.   Height:
      1.   In residential zones, one story accessory buildings and structures,
except for those specifically exempted, may not exceed a height of fifteen feet
(15'). One and one-half (11/2) story and two (2) story accessory buildings may
not exceed a height of twenty feet (20').
      2.   In nonresidential zones, accessory buildings and structures, except
for those specifically exempted, may not exceed the maximum height standard of
the base zone in which the structure is located.
      3.   Structures and building features that are exempt from the maximum
height standards of the base zone are also exempt from the applicable height
standards listed in subsections D1 and D2 of this section.
      4.   A minor modification may be requested adjusting the maximum height
for an accessory building according to the procedures and approval criteria for
minor modifications contained in
chapter 4, article B of this title. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)

ARTICLE E. NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
SECTION:
14-4E-1: Purpose
14-4E-2: Types Of Nonconforming Situations
14-4E-3: General Provisions And Restrictions
14-4E-4: Nonconforming Single-Family Uses
14-4E-5: Regulation Of Nonconforming Uses
14-4E-6: Regulation Of Nonconforming Structures
14-4E-7: Regulation Of Nonconforming Lots
14-4E-8: Regulation Of Nonconforming Development
14-4E-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this article is to regulate nonconforming situations.
Nonconforming situations are created when the zoning designation is changed or
the zoning regulations are changed such that an existing lawfully established
use, structure, lot, or development no longer complies with the zoning
regulations. The intent of these regulations is not to force all nonconforming
situations to be immediately brought into conformance. Rather, the intent is to
guide future uses and development in a direction consistent with City policy,
to protect the character of an area by reducing the potential negative impacts
from nonconforming situations, and, over time, to bring development into
compliance with the City's regulations. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-4E-2: TYPES OF NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS:
   A.   Nonconforming Use: A "nonconforming use" is a use that, when
established, was a permitted use, was allowed as a provisional use, or was
approved as a special exception, but which subsequently, due to a change in the
zone or to the requirements of the Zoning Code, is no longer allowed. This
definition includes residential uses that exceed the allowable residential
density of a zone (minimum lot area per unit requirements) and uses that exceed
the maximum floor area ratio or maximum floor area standards specified for a
particular use or zone.
   B.   Nonconforming Structure: A "nonconforming structure" is a structure or
portion of a structure that was established in conformance with the setback,
building height, building width, lot coverage standards, or other requirements
or standards of the Zoning Code that relate to the design of the building or
structure, but which subsequently, due to a change in the zone or to the
requirements of the Zoning Code, is no longer in conformance with one or more
of these standards.
   C.   Nonconforming Development: "Nonconforming development" is an element of
a development, such as a parking area, a loading area, outdoor lighting,
landscaping, screening, or signage, that was established in conformance with
the Zoning Code, but which subsequently, due to a change in the zone or to the
requirements of the Zoning Code, is no longer in conformance with the current
applicable standards.
   D.   Nonconforming Lot: A "nonconforming lot" is a lot of record that was
established in conformance with the minimum lot area, width, and frontage
requirement of the Zoning Code, but which subsequently, due to a change in the
zone or the requirements of the Zoning Code, is no longer in conformance with
one or more of these requirements. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-4E-3: GENERAL PROVISIONS AND RESTRICTIONS:
   A.   Continuation Of Nonconforming Situations: Legal nonconforming
situations are allowed to continue in accordance with the provisions of this
article.
   B.   Continuance Of Unlawful Uses: Nothing in this article shall be
interpreted as authorization for the continuance of the use of a structure or
land established unlawfully in violation of the regulations in effect at the
time that the use or structure was established.
   C.   Determination Of Nonconforming Status: The burden of establishing that
a nonconforming situation is a legal nonconforming situation rests solely upon
the owner of such nonconformity.
   D.   Repairs And Maintenance: Incidental repairs and routine maintenance of
a nonconforming use or nonconforming structure is permitted unless such repairs
increase the extent of nonconformity or are otherwise expressly prohibited by
provisions of this title. Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent
structures from being structurally strengthened or restored to a safe condition
in accordance with an official order of a public official. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-
15-2005)
14-4E-4: NONCONFORMING SINGLE-FAMILY USES:
Except with regard to the occupancy, any single-family use, structure for a
single-family use, including any accessory structures, and any lot on which a
single-family use is located, that was established lawfully prior to the
establishment of the currently applicable development regulations and, due to a
change in the regulations, is no longer in conformance with the provisions of
this title, will generally be treated as conforming for as long as the dwelling
is used for a single-family use. Accordingly, the following rights are granted
under this article:
   A.   A nonconforming single-family use may be reestablished and its
structure reconstructed if the structure for the nonconforming single-family
use is destroyed or damaged by fire, explosion, act of God or by a public
enemy.
   B.   A nonconforming single-family use may also be expanded, repaired and
structurally altered, provided such expansion or alteration does not increase
or extend any other nonconforming situation on the property. However, if a
nonconforming single- family use is changed in order to increase the occupancy
beyond that of a family or group household, the property must be brought into
full compliance with the number of required off street parking spaces.
   C.   A nonconforming structure that contains a single-family use may be
restored to the same degree of nonconformity or less if destroyed or damaged by
fire, explosion, act of God or by a public enemy. Such a structure may also be
repaired or structurally altered, provided such construction does not increase
or extend the degree of nonconformity and does not increase or extend any other
nonconforming situation on the property.
   D.   A nonconforming accessory structure to a single-family use may be
restored to the same degree of nonconformity or less if destroyed or damaged by
fire, explosion, act of God or by a public enemy. Such a structure may also be
repaired and structurally altered, provided such construction does not increase
or extend the degree of nonconformity and does not increase or extend any other
nonconforming situation on the property.
   E.   A nonconforming lot that contains a single-family use is granted the
same rights as listed in subsections A, B and C of this section, and will be
treated as if the lot were conforming. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-4E-5: REGULATION OF NONCONFORMING USES:
Except as otherwise provided in this article, nonconforming uses shall be
regulated as follows:
   A.   Enlargement Or Alteration:
      1.   A nonconforming use shall not be enlarged, except as set forth in
this section.
      2.   A structure that contains or is accessory to a nonconforming use
shall not be constructed or altered in such a way as to enlarge the
nonconforming use.
      3.   Ordinary repair, maintenance, and remodeling are allowed as long as
the nonconforming use is not enlarged. For purposes of this provision, changes
made to provide safe access to a building for persons with disabilities is not
considered an enlargement.
   B.   Change Of Use:
      1.   A nonconforming use may be converted only to another use in the same
use category and subgroup or to a conforming use, except as provided in
subsection B2 of this section.
      2.   The Board of Adjustment may grant a special exception to allow a
nonconforming use, which is located in a structure not designed for a use
allowed in the zone, to be converted to a nonconforming use in a different use
category or subgroup that is the same or lesser in intensity than the existing
use, provided the following conditions are met:
         a.   The proposed use will be located in a structure that was designed
for a use that is currently not allowed in the zone, for example a storefront
commercial building located in a single- family residential zone.
         b.   The proposed use is of the same or lesser level of intensity and
impact than the existing use. The Board of Adjustment will make a determination
regarding the relative intensity of the proposed use by weighing evidence
presented by the applicant with regard to such factors as anticipated traffic
generation, parking demand, hours of operation, residential occupancy, noise,
dust, and customer and/or resident activity. The Board of Adjustment may also
consider qualitative factors such as whether a proposed use will serve an
identified need in the surrounding neighborhood.
         c.   The proposed use is suitable for the subject structure and site.
         d.   The structure will not be structurally altered or enlarged in
such a way as to enlarge the nonconforming use. Ordinary repair and maintenance
and installation or relocation of walls, partitions, fixtures, wiring, and
plumbing is allowed, as long as the use is not enlarged.
      3.   Once a nonconforming use is converted to a conforming use, it may
not be converted back to a nonconforming use.
      4.   Once a nonconforming use is converted to a less intensive
nonconforming use in accordance with subsection B2 of this section, it may not
be converted back to the prior nonconforming use.
      5.   A use is deemed "converted" when an existing nonconforming use is
terminated and a new use commences and continues for a period of seven (7)
consecutive days.
   C.   Occupancy Of A Nonconforming Use: (Rep. by Ord. 18-4744, 4-2-2018)
   D.   Accessory Uses:
      1.   A nonconforming use is permitted to have the same amount and type of
signage as would be allowed for such a use in the most restrictive zone in
which the use is allowed.
      2.   No use, including parking and signage, that is accessory to a
principal nonconforming use shall continue after the principal use has ceased
or been terminated unless the accessory use thereafter conforms to all
provisions of this title.
   E.   Damage Or Destruction:
      1.   Any structure for a nonconforming use which has been destroyed or
damaged by fire, explosion, act of God or by a public enemy to the extent of
less than seventy five percent (75%) of the assessed value of the structure at
the time of damage or destruction, may be restored for the same nonconforming
use as existed before such damage. However, the nonconforming use must not be
enlarged to more than what existed before such damage occurred. Any such
restoration must be completed within two (2) years of the date the structure
was destroyed or damaged; otherwise, the property must revert to a conforming
use.
      2.   A lot or portion of a lot upon which is located a structure for a
nonconforming use, or other unpermitted use, that has been previously
established and in existence for over twenty five (25) years that has been
destroyed or damaged by fire, explosion, act of God or by a public enemy to the
extent of seventy five percent (75%) or more of the assessed value of the
structure at the time of damage or destruction, must revert to a conforming
use, unless a special exception is granted by the Board of Adjustment according
to the provisions of subsection E4 of this section. The provisions for a
special exception as outlined in subsection E4 of this section shall not apply
or be available to a nonconforming or illegal residential occupancy.
      3.   For purposes of this subsection, the extent of the damage will be
determined by the building official based on credible evidence provided by the
property owner.
      4.   The Board of Adjustment may grant a special exception for uses
detailed in subsection E2 of this section provided the following conditions are
met:
         a.   An application for the special exception to restore the use must
be filed with the City within one year of the date the structure was destroyed
or damaged; and
         b.   The restored structure for the use may be redesigned or located
on the property in order to increase the compatibility with surrounding uses,
but neither the structure nor use may be enlarged beyond what existed before
such damage or destruction occurred; and
         c.   Prior to the damage or destruction, the intensity of the use and
the activities, operations, buildings and other aspects of the use were
generally compatible with the surrounding neighborhood; and
         d.   The proposal for the restored use will be equally or more
compatible with the surrounding neighborhood as was the use prior to the damage
or destruction. The Board of Adjustment may consider such factors as traffic
generation, parking, hours of operation, noise, dust, aesthetics, screening,
amount of customer traffic; number of employees, residents, or occupants of a
building or business; and any other factors that relate to the compatibility of
the nonconforming or previously established use with the surrounding
neighborhood and uses; and
         e.   Once restored/rebuilt, the nonconforming or previously
established unpermitted use will retain or be conferred nonconforming status.
The Board of Adjustment may impose additional conditions such that the
conference of nonconforming status is limited.
   F.   Discontinuance Of Nonconforming Use: Except as allowed in subsection E,
G, and H of this section, a nonconforming use that is discontinued for a period
of one year must revert to a conforming use or, in qualifying situations, a
special exception may be applied for according to the provisions of subsection
B of this section.
   G.   Nonconforming Drinking Establishments And Alcohol Sales Oriented Retail
Uses: In addition to the other provisions in this section, the following
provisions apply to nonconforming drinking establishments and nonconforming
alcohol sales oriented retail uses:

situations occur. If one or both of these conditions occur, then nonconforming
rights cease and the use must convert to a conforming use:
         a.   The liquor license lapses, is revoked or is discontinued for a
period of one year; or
         b.   There are changes to the use such that the use no longer meets
the definition of "alcohol sales oriented retail use".

that has remained vacant for the previous two (2) consecutive years.
      5.   Nonconforming drinking establishments may connect to a sales-
oriented retail use so long as the following criteria are satisfied. At the
sole discretion of the Chief of the Police, repeated violations of Iowa Code
Chapter 123 or City Code Section
4-5-5 shall be grounds for temporary or permanent closure of the door, thereby
prohibiting access between the two uses.
         a.   The door connecting the two uses shall meet the same fire-
resistive rating as the wall separating the two uses and be ADA-compliant;
         b.   A notice, in a form and location approved by the City, shall be
posted at the door informing patrons that open containers of alcohol are
prohibited in the sales-oriented retail use pursuant to Iowa City Code Section
4-5-5; and

thereafter conform to the applicable setback, building height, building width,
and lot coverage standards.
   B.   Change Of Use:
      1.   Any nonconforming structure containing a conforming use may be
converted to another conforming use, provided the conversion does not result in
an increase in the degree of nonconformity of the structure.
      2.   Any nonconforming structure containing a nonconforming use may only
be converted to another use in accordance with the provisions of section
14-4E-5, "Regulation Of Nonconforming Uses", of this article, and provided the
conversion does not result in an increase in the degree of nonconformity of the
structure. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
   C.   Damage Or Destruction:
      1.   Any nonconforming structure that has been destroyed or damaged by
fire, explosion, act of God or by a public enemy to the extent of less than

frontage or lot width, provided the minimum lot area required for the use is
met, and provided the use or structure meets all other requirements of this
title.
   B.   Any use or structure for a use, either one of which requires more lot
area than presently exists, is prohibited, except as provided in subsection C
of this section.
   C.   In any zone in which single-family uses are permitted, a single-family
use and accessory structures may be established on any lot of record,
notwithstanding failure to meet the minimum lot area requirement of the zone in
which the lot is located.

14-4E-8: REGULATION OF NONCONFORMING DEVELOPMENT:
   A.   General Provisions:
      1.   Conversion: Except as otherwise restricted, prohibited or allowed in
this article, a use or structure located on a lot that contains nonconforming
development may be converted to a different use or altered, provided such
change in use or alteration does not increase or extend the nonconformity and
provided the applicable compliance standards listed in this section are met.
(Ord. 12-4472, 4-3-2012)
      2.   Alterations: When structural alterations are made to a building or
buildings on a property that contains nonconforming development, and said
structural alterations result in an increase in the occupancy load of a
building or increase the number of bedrooms, number of dwelling units, or
otherwise increase the allowable residential occupancy of a building, the site
must be brought into conformance with the development standards listed in
subsection A2b of this section, up to the cap stated in subsection A2c of this
section. Certain structural alterations are exempt from the requirements of
this paragraph as listed in subsection A2a of this section.
         a.   Exemptions: Improvements for fire, life safety and accessibility
shall not trigger a requirement to bring nonconforming development into
compliance.
         b.   Standards That Must Be Met: Development not in compliance with
the development standards listed below must be brought into conformance or be
granted a minor modification. Requirements or standards that would not be
feasible or practical or would unduly reduce the ability to use or reuse the
property due to topography, location of existing buildings, or other site
constraints, may be modified or waived by minor modification. The city, at its
discretion, may also waive or modify by minor modification any standards that
cannot be met due to a conflict with any other requirement of this title.
            (1)   Screening of existing parking, loading, vehicular use areas,
and outdoor storage and display areas along street side lot lines according to
the applicable screening standard. Setback requirements may be modified to
address site constraints;
            (2)   Screening of existing parking, loading, vehicular use areas,
and outdoor storage and display areas from the Iowa River or from any parks and
open space use, including trails, according to the applicable screening
standard. Setback requirements may be modified to address site constraints;
            (3)   Outdoor lighting standards;
            (4)   Bicycle parking requirements;
            (5)   Street and residential tree requirements;
            (6)   Design, layout, landscaping, and tree requirements within
parking areas;
            (7)   Pedestrian circulation standards;

and outdoor storage and display areas along side or rear lot lines. Setback
requirements may be modified to address site constraints;
            (9)   Access management standards.
         c.   Cap On The Cost Of Compliance: The standards listed in subsection
A2b of this section must be met for the entire site. However, where the cost of
compliance with the standards enumerated in subsection A2b of this section
exceeds ten percent (10%) of the value of the applicable structural
alterations, the site shall be brought into compliance with all site
development standards up to this ten percent (10%) cap. The value of the
alterations is based on the entire project, not individual building permits. It
is the responsibility of the applicant to document that the cost of the
required site development improvements will be greater than ten percent (10%)
of the value of the proposed structural alterations to the building or
buildings on the site. If not all site improvements are being made, due to the
cost exceeding the cap, the extent and location of the site improvements below
the cap will be determined by the city and shall generally follow the order of
priority listed in subsection A2b of this section. However, at the discretion
of the city, the order of priorities may be adjusted in response to specific
site characteristics and traffic safety concerns in order to maximize the
benefits of site improvements for site users, adjacent properties, and the
public.
      3.   Damaged, Demolished Or Destroyed Site:
         a.   Restoration of a structure, which has been damaged by fire,
explosion, act of God or by a public enemy shall not trigger a requirement to
bring nonconforming development into compliance.
         b.   When a use is proposed for a property where the principal
building(s) have been demolished or destroyed, but that contains nonconforming
development, such as parking lot paving, exterior lighting, signage, etc., the
property must be brought into compliance with all applicable site development
standards as set forth in the base zone and in chapter 5 of this title. (Ord.
13-4519, 4-9-2013)

Any new site elements being constructed or established on the site, such as new
exterior lighting, new parking areas, new outdoor storage or display areas, new
signage, etc., must comply with current applicable standards.
      5.   Reconstruction Or Reestablishment Of Site Development: Any
nonconforming site elements that are being reconstructed or reestablished must
be brought into compliance with the current applicable standards. However,
requirements or standards that would not be feasible or practical or would
unduly reduce the ability to use or reuse the property due to topography,
location of existing buildings, or other site constraints may be modified or
waived by minor modification. The city may also waive or modify by minor
modification any standard that cannot be met due to a conflict with any other
requirement of this title.

over the existing situation, only the number of spaces relating to the
modification, expansion or enlargement need to be provided. These spaces are in
addition to any spaces already in existence on the site.
      2.   If a residential use, which is nonconforming with regard to the
required number of parking, stacking, or loading spaces, is changed in any way
such that there is an increase in the number of required spaces over the
existing situation, the property must be brought into full compliance with the
number of spaces required.
      3.   A use that is nonconforming with regard to the required number of
parking, stacking, or loading spaces may be converted to a use in another use
category or subgroup without full compliance with the number of parking,
stacking, or loading spaces, according to the following rules:
         a.   If the number of required spaces for the converted use is more
than what was required for the established use, only the number of spaces
beyond what was required for the established use need to be provided. These
spaces are in addition to any spaces already in existence on the site.
         b.   In addition to any additional spaces required in subsection B3a
of this section, as many spaces as the lot will accommodate must be provided,
up to the number needed to fully comply with the standard.

to the City that it is in compliance with these program requirements, and
provide any documentation as deemed necessary by the City to determine
compliance, which may include examination of the documents used to verify
tenant income. Any violation of this requirement may result in immediate
suspension of any rental permit issued for the applicable unit. (Ord. 23-4914,
11-6-2023)
14-4F-8: ALTERNATIVE METHODS TO PROVIDE REQUIRED AFFORDABLE HOUSING:
For Required Affordable Housing, the owner may use one or more of the following
methods to meet the Affordable Housing Requirement. If the owner desires to
provide offsite Affordable Housing and/or a contribution of land, the owner
must establish that onsite Affordable Housing or a fee in lieu contribution to
an affordable housing fund cannot feasibly be satisfied, as reasonably
determined by the City.
   A.   Fee In Lieu Contribution: In lieu of providing Affordable Housing
dwelling units, an owner of land zoned a Riverfront Crossings zoning
designation pursuant to 14-2G may contribute a fee to a Riverfront Crossings
District affordable housing fund to be established by the City. The
contribution per dwelling unit shall be determined biennially by resolution of
the City Council based upon a formula that analyzes the difference between
renting a market rate unit for the Term of Affordability and renting a dwelling
unit affordably to an Income Eligible Household. The fund shall be utilized
solely for affordable housing purposes, which may include administration costs,
in the Riverfront Crossings District.
   B.   Transfer Of Affordable Housing Dwelling Units Off Site: Upon the owner
establishing that the affordable housing requirement cannot be satisfied
onsite, as reasonably determined by the City, it may be satisfied by
designating offsite existing or newly constructed dwelling units in the
Riverfront Crossings District as Affordable Housing dwelling units. Any
transferred Affordable Housing units shall in no way waive or reduce any
obligation to provide Affordable Housing units within the development to which
the obligation is transferred. In addition to satisfying the general
requirements set forth in Section
14-4F-5, these units must satisfy the following requirements:
      1.   Development Requirements:
         a.   Provision Of Units: Offsite Affordable Housing dwelling units,
whether they are owner- or renter-occupied, shall be provided in accordance
with the development requirements for Owner-Occupied Affordable Housing set
forth in Section
14-4F-6. The City reserves the right to deny a request to transfer Affordable
Housing units to a particular development if it would result in an undue
concentration of Affordable Housing units within that development.
         b.   Timing: Where the affordable housing requirement is to be met
through the provision of newly constructed dwelling units, such units shall be
constructed and pass final inspection no later than the date the occupancy
permit is issued for the development creating the need for the Affordable
Housing, unless otherwise agreed upon by the City Manager, or designee. Where
the affordable housing requirement is to be met through the provision of
existing offsite dwelling units, they shall be established as Affordable
Housing dwelling units prior to issuance of any occupancy permit for the
development creating the need for the affordable housing. The marketing of the
Affordable Housing dwelling units should occur no later than one (1) year after
the first market rate dwelling unit in the site that generated the requirement
passes final inspection, unless otherwise agreed upon by the City Manager. The
affordable housing agreement pursuant to Subsection
14-4F-5B-1 shall be recorded prior to issuance of a building permit for the
development creating the need for the Affordable Housing.
      2.   Programming Requirements:
         a.   Where the offsite Affordable Housing dwelling units are to be
Owner-Occupied Affordable Housing, those units shall comply with the
programming requirements for Owner-Occupied Affordable Housing set forth in
Section
14-4F-6.
         b.   Where the offsite Affordable Housing dwelling units are to be
Renter-Occupied Affordable Housing, they shall comply with the programming
requirements for Renter-Occupied Affordable Housing set forth in Section
14-4F-7.
   C.   Land Dedication: Upon the owner establishing that the affordable
housing requirements cannot be satisfied onsite, as reasonably determined by
the City, it may be satisfied by the dedication of land to the City of Iowa
City or an entity designated by the City of Iowa City for construction of
Affordable Housing dwelling units in accordance with the provisions of this
section, upon consideration of the following factors:
      1.   Location: The land shall be located in the Riverfront Crossings
District, in an area appropriate for residential redevelopment, as determined
by the City;
      2.   Number Of Affordable Housing Units: The total Affordable Housing
dwelling units possible on the land shall be equal to or greater than the
number of required Affordable Housing dwelling units;
      3.   Dwelling Type: The land shall allow for the provision of Affordable
Housing units of equivalent type (single-family, multi-family, townhome, etc.),
floor area, and number of bedrooms to that which would have been otherwise
required;
      4.   Land Value: The value of land to be dedicated shall be determined,
at the cost of the developer, by an independent appraiser, who shall be
selected from a list of certified appraisers provided by the City, or by such
alternative means of valuation to which a developer and the City agree; and
      5.   Right To Refuse: The City reserves the right to refuse dedication of
land in satisfaction of the affordable housing requirement if it determines, in
its sole discretion, that such a dedication is not in the best interests of the
public for any reason, including a determination that the City is not likely to
construct or administer an Affordable Housing development project in a timely
manner due to the unavailability of funds or other resources. Additionally,
where the value of the land proposed to be dedicated is less than the value of
the fee in lieu contribution established in accordance with the provisions
above, the City reserves the right to require an owner to contribute a fee
making up this difference in values. (Ord. 23-4914, 11-6-2023)
14-4F-9: ADMINISTRATIVE RULES:
The City Manager or designee is hereby authorized to establish administrative
rules deemed necessary to assure that the purposes of this section are
accomplished. A copy of the rules shall be on file with the City Clerk and
available on the City website. (Ord. 23-4914, 11-6-2023)
CHAPTER 5
SITE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
ARTICLE A. OFF STREET PARKING AND LOADING STANDARDS
SECTION:
14-5A-1: Applicability
14-5A-2: Use And Restrictions
14-5A-3: Maximum Parking Allowed
14-5A-4: Minimum Parking Requirements
14-5A-5: Construction And Design Standards
14-5A-6: Off Street Loading Requirements
14-5A-1: APPLICABILITY:
Unless specifically exempted or superseded by other provisions of this title,
the regulations of this article apply to all parking spaces, stacking spaces,
aisles, and drives in all zones, whether required by this code or put in for
the convenience of property owners or users. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-5A-2: USE AND RESTRICTIONS:
   A.   The use of required off street parking is reserved for vehicle parking.
Other uses of a required parking area are not permitted, except as approved for
a temporary use. (See
chapter 4, article D of this title.)
   B.   Unless otherwise exempted, motor vehicles must be parked on an improved
surface, as specified in this article.
   C.   The storage of merchandise, materials, equipment, refuse containers,
obsolete or junk vehicles or the major repair of vehicles in required off
street parking and stacking spaces is prohibited.
   D.   Except for the purpose of making local deliveries, vehicles designed
for the shipment of detonable or flammable solids, liquids or gases may not be
parked or stored in any residential zone.
   E.   Commercial vehicles more than seven and one-half feet (71/2') in height
may not be stored in any residential zone. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-5A-3: MAXIMUM PARKING ALLOWED:
   A.   Purpose: Certain areas and zones of the city are subject to a limit on
the amount of parking provided due to a desire to foster compact, pedestrian
oriented areas close to the downtown, the university, and in neighborhood
commercial areas adjacent to residential neighborhoods. The maximum parking
standards are a tool to prevent the development of excess parking capacity on a
site. Limiting the amount of land devoted to parking will make additional land
available for building area, open space, pedestrian amenities, and other
productive uses and will reduce stormwater runoff and protect water quality by
limiting the amount of impervious surface on a site. To further that goal, off
street parking in the central business district is generally provided in
municipally owned parking facilities, rather than in private surface lots or
structures. Providing conveniently located public parking facilities reserves
land in the downtown for more intensive commercial and civic uses and prevents
large surface parking lots from damaging the pedestrian friendly character of
the central business district.
   B.   CN-1 Zone: In the CN-1 zone, the number of parking spaces provided may
not exceed one hundred ten percent (110%) of the number of parking spaces
required, except if granted a special exception to exceed this limit by the
board of adjustment. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
   C.   CB-5 Zone: (Rep. by Ord. 14-4586, 6-3-2014)
   D.   CB-10 Zone:
      1.   Off street parking is not required for any use, except household
living uses, as specified in section
14-5A-4,
table 5A-1 of this article.
      2.   Private, off street parking is permitted only after approval of a
special exception, except for hospitality oriented retail uses and household
living uses as specified in the following subsections.
      3.   Hospitality oriented uses are allowed up to one and one-fourth (11/
4) parking spaces for each guestroom and parking spaces equal to one-third (1/
3) the occupant load of any meeting or convention facilities without going
through the special exception process. Any parking spaces allowed under this
maximum must meet the standards specified in subsections D5b through D5e of
this section. Any parking spaces requested beyond this maximum must be approved
by the board of adjustment as a special exception and meet all of the approval
criteria listed in subsection D5 of this section. (Ord. 08-4326, 12-22-2008)
      4.   Household living uses must provide parking according to section
14-5A-4,
table 5A-1 of this article. The parking must meet the standards specified in
subsections D5b through D5e of this section. If there is practical difficulty
providing the required parking for household living uses on site, off site
parking for household living uses may be approved according to the provisions
of subsection
14-5A-4F, "Alternatives To Minimum Parking Requirements", of this article.
(Ord. 14-4586, 6-3-2014)
      5.   In addition to the general special exception approval criteria
specified in
chapter 4, article B of this title, applications for a special exception for
private off street parking in the CB-10 zone must meet the following specific
approval criteria:
         a.   The applicant must demonstrate through a parking demand analysis
that the number of parking spaces requested does not exceed the demand for
parking for the specific building or project proposed and that the parking
demand cannot be satisfied through the public parking system. Short term
parking demand is preferred to be satisfied through the public parking system.
         b.   Surface parking is not permitted.
         c.   Underground parking is preferred over aboveground structured
parking. The design of any underground parking must not detract from or prevent
active building uses on the ground level floor of the building. To that end,
the ceiling height of any underground parking level may not extend more than
one foot (1') above the level of the adjacent sidewalk. On sloping building
sites and for existing buildings, the city may adjust this requirement.
However, on sloping sites at least a portion of the ground level floor height
of any new building must be located no more than one foot (1') above the level
of the abutting sidewalk or pedestrian plaza; and the floor height of the
ground level floor of the building must be no more than three feet (3') above
the level of the abutting public sidewalk or pedestrian plaza at any point
along a street-facing building facade.
         d.   Aboveground structured parking may be approved only by special
exception according to the standards in subsection D5e of this section.
         e.   Where parking is located within the exterior walls of a building,
the following standards apply: (Ord. 08-4326, 12-22-2008)
            (1)   The proposed structured parking will not detract from or
prevent ground floor storefront uses. Structured parking may be permitted on
the ground level floor of a building, provided that a substantial portion of
the ground level floor of the building is reserved for and built to accommodate
storefront uses. On the ground level floor of the building, parking is not
allowed within the first fifty feet (50') of building depth as measured from
the front building line. The board of adjustment may reduce this storefront
depth requirement if the applicant demonstrates that conditions on the subject
property create a practical difficulty in achieving full compliance. In such a
case, the applicant must demonstrate that the resulting alternative storefront
space, both the interior and exterior, will be of a quality in both design and
materials that will enhance the commercial character of the central business
district. To mitigate for loss of ground floor commercial space, the board may
also require additional quality commercial space be included on an upper floor
or mezzanine level and said space be reserved for nonresidential uses. (Ord.
11-4450, 10-18-2011)
            (2)   Vehicular access to parking within buildings must be from a
rear alley or private rear lane, whenever feasible. Garage openings along the
primary street frontage are not permitted if access is feasible from another
street or from a rear alley, private street or private rear lane. If there is
no other feasible alternative, a garage opening may be allowed along the
primary street frontage, if the board determines that the opening(s) will not
detract from or unduly interrupt pedestrian flow along the street and traffic
and pedestrian safety will not be compromised. Garage openings shall be built
to the minimum width necessary for access.
            (3)   Any exterior walls of a parking facility that are visible
from a public or private street must appear to be a component of the facade of
the building through the use of building materials, window openings and facade
detailing that is similar or complementary to the design of the building.
            (4)   Each entrance and exit to the parking area must be
constructed so that vehicles entering or leaving the parking area are clearly
visible to a pedestrian on any abutting sidewalk at a distance of not less than
ten feet (10'). Stop signs and appropriate pedestrian warning signs may be
required. (Ord. 08-4326, 12-22-2008)
14-5A-4: MINIMUM PARKING REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Purpose: The minimum parking requirements are intended to ensure that
enough off street parking is provided to accommodate most of the demand for
parking generated by the range of uses that might locate at a site over time,
particularly in areas where sufficient on street parking is not available. The
minimum parking requirements are also intended to ensure that enough parking is
provided on a site to prevent parking for nonresidential uses from encroaching
into adjacent residential neighborhoods.
   B.   Minimum Requirements:
      1.   
Table 5A-2 of this section lists the minimum parking requirements and minimum
bicycle parking requirements for the land use or uses on properties in all
zones except the CB-5, CB-10, Eastside Mixed Use and Riverfront Crossings
Zones. For some land uses, the minimum parking requirements differ based on the
zone in which the property is located.
      2.   For properties located within the Downtown Planning District, zoned
CB-5 and, in part, Historic District Overlay, the bicycle parking requirement
shall be 1.25 spaces per dwelling unit. For such properties, there shall be no
vehicular parking requirement. Except for the preceding,
table 5A-1 of this section lists the minimum parking requirements and minimum
bicycle parking requirements for all other properties within the CB-5 and CB-10
Zones, where parking is only required for household living uses.
      3.   
Table 5A-3 of this section lists the minimum parking requirements and minimum
bicycle parking requirement for properties zoned Riverfront Crossings and
Eastside Mixed Use. Affordable housing dwelling units provided in accordance
with section
14-2G-8 of this title shall not be required to provide parking, and are
therefore exempt from the minimum parking requirement calculation for the
respective Riverfront Crossings zoning classification.
      4.   In the CB-10 Zone, off street parking must meet the standards
specified in subsection
14-5A-3D of this article.
   C.   Parking For Persons With Disabilities: Where a use is required to
provide accessibility for persons with disabilities, the number and design of
such parking spaces must be in accordance with State of Iowa Administrative
Code, 661 IAC 18, parking for persons with disabilities, as amended.
   D.   Rules For Computing Minimum Parking Requirements:
      1.   Where a fractional space results, the number of parking and stacking
spaces actually required will be the closest whole number, with a half space
rounded down.
      2.   Any use that is nonconforming with regard to the number of required
parking spaces is subject to the applicable provisions of
chapter 4, article E, "Nonconforming Situations", of this title.
      3.   In the case of mixed uses, the number of parking and stacking spaces
required is equal to the sum of the requirements for the various uses computed
separately, except for shopping centers, as specified in
table 5A-2 of this section, and for reductions allowed under subsection F,
"Alternatives To Minimum Parking Requirements", of this section.
      4.   When the parking requirement is based on the number of residents or
occupants, the number of residents or occupants shall be based on the maximum
occupancy of the use as determined by the City.
   E.   Rules For Computing Bicycle Parking Requirements:
      1.   In
tables 5A-1 and
5A-2 of this section, the minimum bicycle parking requirements are expressed as
a certain number of spaces per dwelling unit or as a percentage of the required
number of vehicle parking spaces. In
table 5A-3 of this section, the minimum bicycle parking requirements are
expressed as a certain number of spaces per dwelling unit or per resident or,
in the case of nonresidential uses, as a ratio based on the floor area of the
proposed use. When expressed as a number of spaces per resident, the number of
residents shall be based on the maximum occupancy of the use as determined by
the City.
      2.   In all cases where bicycle parking is required, a minimum of four
(4) spaces shall be provided.
      3.   After the first fifty (50) bicycle parking spaces are provided,
additional spaces are required at fifty percent (50%) of the number required by
this section.
      4.   Where the expected need for bicycle parking for a particular use is
uncertain due to unknown or unusual operating characteristics of the use or due
to a location that is difficult to access by bicycle, the building official may
authorize that the construction of up to fifty percent (50%) of the required
bicycle parking spaces be deferred. The land area required for the deferred
bicycle parking spaces must be maintained in reserve. If an enforcement
official of the City determines at some point in the future that the additional
parking spaces are needed, the property owner will be required to install the
parking in the reserved area. The owner of the property on which the bicycle
parking area is reserved must properly execute, sign, and record a written
agreement that is binding upon their successors and assigns as a covenant
running with the land that assures the installation of bicycle parking within
the reserved area by the owner if so ordered by an enforcement official of the
City.

   F.   Alternatives To Minimum Parking Requirements:
      1.   Off Site Parking On Private Property: Off street parking may be
located on a separate lot from the use served according to the following rules.
When the proposed off site parking is located in a residential zone or CB-10
Zone, or is intended for a use located in the CB-10 Zone, the Board of
Adjustment may grant a special exception for the proposed parking, provided the
conditions contained in subsections F1a through F1f of this section are met.
When the proposed off site parking is located in the Eastside Mixed Use
District, a Riverfront Crossings Zone, an industrial zone, research zone, or
commercial zone, except the CB-10 Zone, the Director of Neighborhood and
Development Services may approve the proposed parking, provided the conditions
contained in subsections F1a through F1f of this section are met.
         a.   Special Location Plan: A special location plan must be submitted
with the application for off site parking. The location plan must include a map
indicating the proposed location of the off site parking, the location of the
use or uses served by the parking, and the distance and proposed walking route
between the parking and the use(s) served. The map must be drawn to scale and
include property boundaries, including boundaries of any intervening
properties. In addition, documentation must be submitted providing evidence
deemed necessary to comply with the requirements herein.
         b.   Location Of Off Site Parking:
            (1)   In residential, commercial zones, Eastside Mixed Use
District, and Riverfront Crossings Zones, any proposed off site parking space
must be located within three hundred feet (300') from an entrance to the use
served.
            (2)   In industrial and research zones, any proposed off site
parking space must be located within six hundred feet (600') from an entrance
to the use served.
         c.   Zoning: Off site parking spaces must be located in the same zone
as the principal use(s) served, or located as follows:
            (1)   In a multi-family zone serving a use located in a different
multi-family zone, Eastside Mixed Use District, or in the MU Zone or vice
versa.
            (2)   In a commercial zone serving a use located in a different
commercial zone, industrial zone, Eastside Mixed Use District, or Riverfront
Crossings Zone.
            (3)   In an industrial zone serving a use located in a different
industrial zone or commercial zone.
            (4)   In a Riverfront Crossings Zone serving a use located in a
different Riverfront Crossings Zone or commercial zone.
         d.   Shared Use Of Off Site Parking: Where two (2) or more uses will
jointly use the proposed off site parking, the number of parking spaces shall
equal the sum of off street parking spaces required, as indicated in tables 5A-
1, 5A-2, and 5A-3 of this section, except for reductions approved under the
provisions of subsection F2, "Allowed Reductions For Shared On Site Parking",
of this section.
         e.   Approval Criteria: In assessing a special location plan for off
site parking, the Board of Adjustment or Director of Neighborhood and
Development Services, as applicable, will consider the desirability of the
proposed off street parking and stacking spaces location; pedestrian and
vehicular traffic safety; any detrimental effects on adjacent property; the
appearance of the streetscape as a consequence of the off street parking; and,
in the case of nonrequired parking, the need for additional off street parking.
         f.   Covenant For Off Site Parking: A written agreement between the
property owners must be submitted with the application for off site parking.
The agreement must assure the retention of the parking and stacking spaces,
aisles and drives and be binding upon their successors and assigns. The
agreement must provide that it cannot be released, and its terms and conditions
cannot be modified in any manner whatsoever, without prior written consent and
approval from the City. The written agreement must be reviewed and approved by
the City Attorney. Upon approval of the off site parking, the applicant shall
provide evidence to the building official confirming that the agreement has
been properly executed and has been recorded as a covenant running with the
land before issuance of a building permit.
      2.   Minor Modification For Parking Reduction For Shared On Site Parking:
The building official, in consultation with the Director of Neighborhood and
Development Services, may approve a minor modification as specified in section
14-4B-1 of this title to reduce the total number of parking spaces required by
up to fifty percent (50%) if the uses sharing the parking are not normally
open, used, or operated during the same hours. To qualify for a reduction under
this provision, a parking demand analysis must be submitted that provides
evidence that the amount of parking proposed for the shared parking area will
be sufficient to meet the parking demand. This reduction is not allowed for
residential uses.
      3.   Minor Modification For Parking Reduction in Commercial Zones: The
building official, in consultation with the Director of Neighborhood and
Development Services, may approve a minor modification as specified in 14-4B-
1 of this title to reduce the total number of parking spaces required by up to
fifty percent (50%) if it meets the following standards:
         a.   It must be in a CB-2, CB-5, CC-2, CN-1, CO-1, or MU zone;
         b.   Buildings must be limited to a footprint of 5,000 square feet;
         c.   A parking demand analysis must be submitted that provides
evidence that the amount of parking proposed will be sufficient to meet the
parking demand, which depending on the complexity of the site, may require an
engineered study, as determined by staff; and
         d.   The proposed development must not result in the demolition of a
property that is designated as an Iowa City landmark, registered in the
National Register of Historic Places, or individually eligible for the National
Register of Historic Places.
      4.   Affordable Housing Parking Reduction: Affordable Housing dwelling
units allowed and regulated pursuant to Article 14-4F shall be exempt from
providing the minimum number of parking spaces otherwise required by the zoning
code.
      5.   Minor Modification for Commercial Use Parking Reductions. The number
of required parking spaces for commercial uses may be reduced up to ten percent
(10%).
      6.   Downtown And Riverfront Crossings Parking District: For qualifying
development as set forth below, the number of required on site parking spaces
may be reduced in order to facilitate said development according to the
provisions of this subsection.
         a.   Qualifying Development: To qualify for a parking reduction under
this subsection, the proposed development:
            (1)   Must be located in the downtown and Riverfront Crossings
parking district;
            (2)   Must not result in the demolition of a property that is
designated as an Iowa City landmark, registered on the National Register of
Historic Places, or individually eligible for the National Register of Historic
Places; and
            (3)   Must include uses, elements or features that further housing,
economic development, or other goals of the comprehensive plan, including the
downtown and Riverfront Crossings master plan.
         b.   Parking District Boundaries: Properties described below shall be
considered part of the Downtown and Riverfront Crossings Parking District:
            (1)   Properties located within the area bounded by Burlington
Street on the south, Van Buren Street on the east, Iowa Avenue on the north,
and Capitol Street on the west. For purposes of this subsection, this area
shall be referred to as the Central Business District; and
            (2)   Properties zoned South Downtown Subdistrict (RFC-SD),
University Subdistrict (RFC-U), and Central Crossings Subdistrict (RFC-CX) that
are located north of the Iowa Interstate rail line.
         c.   Reduction Of The On Site Parking Requirement:
            (1)   For qualifying development, the off street parking
requirement may be reduced by up to fifty percent (50%), provided a fee is paid
in lieu based on the number of parking spaces that would otherwise have to be
provided.
            (2)   For qualifying development where it is infeasible to provide
at least fifty percent (50%) of the required parking on site due to specific
qualifying site constraints as noted below, a developer may request a special
exception to reduce the parking requirement by up to one hundred percent
(100%), provided a fee is paid in lieu of each parking space not provided on
site and the following review and approval criteria are met. The Board of
Adjustment will review such a request according to the following approval
criteria:
               (A)   Convincing evidence has been presented that it is not
feasible to provide at least fifty percent (50%) of the required residential
parking on site due to a lack of alley access, a lot width narrower than sixty
feet (60'), a lot orientation that makes it infeasible to provide on site
parking and meet storefront depth requirements of the zone, or other unique
circumstance; and
               (B)   The proposed project will be designed in a manner that is
sensitive and complementary to adjacent properties designated as Iowa City
landmarks, registered on the National Register of Historic Places, or
individually eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. See
subsection
14-3C-3C, “Design Review Guidelines”, of this title for guidance on the factors
to be considered to comply with this standard. This standard is not intended to
impose any particular architectural style, but rather to foster a harmonious
rhythm and proportion of building elements along a street frontage and ensure
that differences in mass and scale are mitigated through facade articulation
and upper story stepbacks; and
               (C)   The proposed project will be designed in a manner that
will contribute to the pedestrian oriented, urban character of central Iowa
City as envisioned in the downtown and riverfront crossings master plan.
         d.   Payment Of Fee In Lieu Of Required Parking:
            (1)   Where the City has allowed up to a fifty percent (50%)
reduction in the parking requirement, the developer shall pay a fee for each
space otherwise required in the amount of seventy five percent (75%) of the
estimated cost of constructing a structured parking space.
            (2)   Where a special exception has been granted reducing the
parking requirement by more than fifty percent (50%), the developer shall pay a
fee in lieu of the provision of each space otherwise required in the amount of
ninety percent (90%) of the estimated cost of constructing a structured parking
space.
            (3)   The estimated cost of a structured parking space is twenty
four thousand dollars ($24,000.00) in 2013 dollars. This fee shall be adjusted
annually based on the national historical cost indexes contained in the most
recent edition of “Engineering News Record”, as amended. In the event the
national historical cost index is negative in any edition, the fee shall remain
at the amount previously set under this paragraph.
            (4)   The City shall calculate and assess the entire fee upon
issuance of a building permit. The fee payor shall pay the entire fee prior to
the issuance of the building permit.
            (5)   All fees paid shall be deposited in the Downtown and
Riverfront Crossings Parking District Restricted Fund, as set forth in this
subsection. Monies held in the Restricted Fund, including any accrued interest,
shall be used for the purpose of acquiring land for and constructing public
parking facilities located in the Downtown and Riverfront Crossings Parking
District.
            (6)   In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are
issued for the acquisition or construction of the aforementioned property,
infrastructure or facilities within the Parking District, monies held in the
Restricted Fund may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt
instruments.
      7.   Parking Reduction For Other Unique Circumstances: Where it can be
demonstrated that a specific use has unique characteristics such that the
number of parking or stacking spaces required is excessive or will reduce the
ability to use or occupy a historic property in a manner that will preserve or
protect its historic, aesthetic, or cultural attributes, the Board of
Adjustment may grant a special exception to reduce the number of required
parking or stacking spaces by up to fifty percent (50%) (up to 100 percent for
properties designated as a local historic landmark, listed on the National
Register of Historic Places, or listed as key or contributing structures in a
Historic District or Conservation District Overlay Zone).
      8.   Parking Reduction For Liner Buildings: For liner buildings
constructed to mask a Municipal parking facility, the private off street
parking requirement may be reduced by up to one hundred percent (100%) if
parking for uses located within the liner building is provided within the
associated public parking facility. Monthly permits shall be made available for
purchase to residents, businesses, or other tenants located within the liner
building, but specific parking spaces within the associated parking structure
may or may not be designated for use by said permit holders, at the discretion
of the City. Compensation for construction of said parking shall be made to the
City with the amount and terms of said compensation determined through an
agreement with the City, which shall be executed prior to issuance of an
occupancy permit for the subject liner building.
      9.   Allowance For Scooter Or Motorcycle Parking: Up to ten percent (10%)
of the parking spaces required for a use may be reconfigured to accommodate
motorized scooters or motorcycles. Conversion of a minimum of two (2) abutting
standard parking spaces (an area equal to 18 feet by 18 feet) is required to
ensure adequate access and vehicular movement for up to six (6) scooter/
motorcycle spaces. Design of the scooter/motorcycle parking shall be approved
by the City. This provision shall not increase or decrease the allowed
occupancy or residential density of the uses on the property, i.e., each
required vehicular space converted to scooter/motorcycle spaces shall still be
counted as one required parking space.
      10.   Sustainability Parking Reduction: The minimum parking requirement
may be reduced by ten percent (10%) where each of the following provisions is
met, up to a maximum reduction of twenty-five percent (25%). This reduction may
be used in conjunction with subsections
14-2A-7E,
14-2B-8D,
14-2C-11E, and
14-3A-4D3 (Sustainability Density Bonus).
         a.   A solar energy system is installed onsite where the size is equal
to at least forty percent (40%) of the surface area of the roofs of all
buildings.
         b.   All uses within the development utilize electricity for one
hundred percent (100%) of their regular energy consumption after construction.
         c.   All buildings within the development are constructed to the most
current edition of the International Energy Conservation Code standards
published by the International Code Council. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd.

14-5A-5: CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN STANDARDS:
   A.   Purpose: The construction and design standards are intended to ensure
safe and efficient vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian circulation on a site,
and to ensure that parking areas are designed with trees and landscaping in a
manner that will break up the appearance of large expanses of paving, provide
shade coverage, and ensure appropriate screening and buffering from
pedestrianways and adjacent streets and properties.
   B.   Paving Materials: All parking and stacking spaces, drives and aisles
must be constructed of asphaltic cement concrete, portland cement concrete or
manufactured paving materials, such as brick, except in the following
situations:
      1.   Drives and aisles serving single-family dwellings or duplexes that
abut and access historic Woodlawn Avenue or a nonhard surfaced alley are exempt
from this standard.
      2.   The City building official may permit materials other than those
listed, but excluding crushed rock or chip seal surfaces, for parking spaces,
aisles, and drives if the use of such material provides a durable, permanent
surface deemed suitable for the intended purpose and intensity of use.
      3.   Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, all parking and
stacking spaces, drives and aisles must be paved with an approved surface as
specified above; except, that the building official may issue a temporary
certificate of occupancy in those instances where the building official finds
that the paving cannot reasonably be completed due to adverse weather
conditions or settling of land on the site after demolition or filling. A
temporary certificate of occupancy will be effective only to a date specific.
Prior to the issuance of a temporary certificate, the property owner must place
in an escrow account established with the City an amount equal to one hundred
ten percent (110%) of the estimated cost of paving.
   C.   Parking, Stacking Space Size, And Drive Dimensions:
      1.   The minimum size of a standard off street parking space is nine feet
by eighteen feet (9' x 18'), exclusive of aisle width.
      2.   The minimum size of a compact off street parking space is eight feet
by fifteen feet (8' x 15'), exclusive of aisle width.
      3.   For all uses, except single-family and two-family uses, the
following rules apply:
         a.   Up to fifty percent (50%) of the required number of parking
spaces may be compact spaces. A "Compact Vehicles Only" sign must be posted on
or in front of each compact space.
         b.   All other spaces, both required and nonrequired, must meet or
exceed the minimum size specification for standard spaces.
         c.   Parking spaces reserved for persons with disabilities must be
sized and designed in accordance with State of Iowa Administrative Code, 661
IAC 18, "Parking for Persons With Disabilities", as amended.
      4.   For single-family and two-family uses, required parking spaces must
be at least nine feet by eighteen feet (9' x 18') in size.
      5.   Required stacking spaces must be at least nine feet (9') wide and
nineteen feet (19') long.
      6.   In all required parking areas that contain more than four (4)
parking spaces, such spaces must be visibly delineated on the surface by
painted or marked stripes.
      7.   A drive providing access to any parking area, either structured or
surface, with more than eighteen (18) spaces must be no less than eighteen feet
(18') in width if designed for two- way traffic or ten feet (10') in width if
designed for one-way traffic.
   D.   Drainage:
      1.   All parking and stacking spaces, drives and aisles in parking areas
must be pitched or curbed and drained to prevent the flow of excess water from
such areas onto streets and alleys which do not have adequate drainage
facilities as determined by the City Engineer.
      2.   Drives and aisles that are located within three feet (3') of a side
or rear lot line must be pitched or curbed and drained to prevent flow of water
onto adjoining property. Alternatively, a drainage course must be established
along lot lines to handle stormwater runoff.
   E.   Location:
      1.   Off street parking and stacking spaces must be located on the same
lot as the use served except as allowed in subsection
14-5A-4F, "Alternatives To Minimum Parking Requirements", of this article.
      2.   Off street parking spaces, stacking spaces, aisles and drives are
subject to the location and setback requirements specified in the base zone and
any other location requirements of this title that specifically supersede or
augment these general location standards.
      3.   Unless otherwise specified in this title, stacking spaces must be
located in such a way that a required parking space or access to a required
parking space is not obstructed.
   F.   Standards For Structured Parking In Multi-Family, Commercial Zones, The
Eastside Mixed Use District, And The Riverfront Crossings Zones: The following
standards apply to structured parking in all Multi-Family Zones, all Commercial
Zones, except the CB-10 Zone, and on property zoned Riverfront Crossings or
Eastside Mixed Use. On properties zoned Riverfront Crossings or Eastside Mixed
Use, these standards apply to tuck under, midblock structures, lined
structures, integrated structures, and underground structures, as described in
chapter 2, article G of this title. Standards for structured parking in the CB-
10 Zone are specified in subsection
14-5A-3D of this article.
      1.   Parking Within Building: In Multi-Family, CN-1, CB-2, CB-5, and MU
Zones, the ground level floor of a building is reserved primarily for principal
uses allowed in the zone. Therefore, any parking located within the exterior
walls of the building must meet the following standards:
         a.   In the CN-1, CB-2, CB-5, and MU Zones, structured parking is not
permitted on the ground level floor of the building for the first thirty feet
(30') of lot depth as measured from the minimum setback line, except as allowed
by subsection
14-4B-4A7f of this title.
         b.   In Multi-Family Zones, structured parking is not permitted on the
ground level floor of the building for the first fifteen feet (15') of building
depth as measured from the street-facing building wall. On lots with more than
one street frontage this parking setback must be met along each street
frontage, unless reduced or waived by minor modification. The Building Official
may also waive this requirement where a townhome-style multi-family unit has
parking along a side street. When considering a minor modification request, the
City will consider factors such as street classification, building orientation,
location of primary entrance(s) to the building, and unique site constraints
such as locations where the residential building space must be elevated above
the floodplain.
         c.   In the CN-1, CB-2, CB-5, and MU Zones, the ceiling height of any
underground parking may extend no more than one foot (1') above the level of
the adjacent sidewalk. On sloping building sites and for existing buildings,
the City may adjust this requirement by minor modification. However, on sloping
sites at least a portion of the ground level floor height of any new building
must be located no more than one foot (1') above the level of the abutting
sidewalk or pedestrian plaza; and the floor height of the ground level floor of
the building must be no more than four feet (4') above the level of the
abutting public sidewalk or pedestrian plaza at any point along a street-facing
building facade.
         d.   In Multi-Family Zones, the ceiling height of any underground
parking may extend no more than three feet (3') above grade. For purposes of
this subsection, "grade" shall be defined as the average point of elevation of
the finished surface of the ground, paving, or sidewalk within the area between
the building and the streetside property line(s) or when the streetside
property line is more than five feet (5') from the building, between the
building and line five feet (5') from the building. A parking level that has
more than three feet (3') of its floor to ceiling height above "grade" as
defined herein shall be considered ground level parking and therefore shall be
subject to the setback stated in subsection F1b of this section.
      2.   Riverfront Crossings Or Eastside Mixed Use Properties: On property
zoned Riverfront Crossings or Eastside Mixed Use, structured parking shall be
placed in accordance with the provisions set forth in chapter 2, article G,
"Riverfront Crossings And Eastside Mixed Use Districts Form Based Development
Standards", of this title.
      3.   Parking Area To Be Enclosed: Except for garage openings, the parking
area must be enclosed within the exterior walls of the building. In no case
shall a building have the appearance from the street or from abutting
properties of being elevated above a parking level or "on stilts" (see
figure 5A.1 of this subsection).
FIGURE 5A.1
STRUCTURED PARKING

IMAGES/0-0-0-2729.png]
 
      4.   Exterior Walls: Any exterior walls of a parking facility that are
visible from a public or private street or from an abutting property must
appear to be a component of the facade of the building through the use of
building materials, window openings and facade detailing that is similar or
complementary to the design of the building and must comply with the other
standards of this section (see subsection F3,
figure 5A.1 of this section).
      5.   Parking Space Configurations: Parking spaces within the structure
must be perpendicular to parking aisles. However, angled parking or parallel
parking configurations may be allowed if parking aisles are one-way.
      6.   Landscaping: In addition to the facade detailing noted above, the
City may require landscaping as a means to soften the visual effect of any
garage walls located at the street level. Shrubs, small berms, and planters may
be used to form a landscaped screen generally ranging between two feet (2') and
four feet (4') in height. Trees may also be incorporated into the landscaped
area if sufficient area is available for tree growth.
      7.   Garage Entrances/Exits:
         a.   Vehicular access to parking within buildings should be located
and designed to minimize traffic congestion and hazards to pedestrians and to
preserve street frontages for active building uses.
         b.   Garage entrances/exits should be located along a building wall
that does not face a public street and accessed from a private drive, private
rear lane or public alley. In the CB-2, CB-5, MU, Eastside Mixed Use, and
Riverfront Crossings Zones, alley or rear lane access is preferred. If the Form
Based Code Committee, in consultation with the Director of Neighborhood and
Development Services, determines that such access is not feasible due to lack
of alley access, topographical limitations, or other unique circumstances, or
if allowing direct access from a street will better meet the objectives as
stated in subsection F7a of this section, garage openings may face a street,
but must be designed in a manner that will best meet the objectives listed in
subsection F7a of this section, and must meet the standards listed in
subsections F7b(1), F7b(2), and F7b(3) of this section.
            (1)   If the structured parking is intended for residents or
tenants of a building and not the general public, there may be no more than one
doublewide or two (2) singlewide garage openings per building. Doublewide
openings may not exceed twenty feet (20') in width; singlewide openings may not
exceed ten feet (10') in width. For existing buildings where it is not possible
to meet this standard due to structural constraints of the building, the
building official may adjust this provision to allow one additional garage
entrance/exit that faces a street, provided that the minor modification
approval criteria are met and the garage opening is designed to minimize its
effect on the streetscape and minimize hazards to pedestrians.
            (2)   For structured parking intended for use by the general
public, garage openings should be limited in width and number to only what is
necessary to provide adequate access for the types and numbers of vehicles
using the parking facility.
            (3)   Except in the CN-1, CB-2, MU and CB-5 Zones, the opening(s)
must occupy no more than fifty percent (50%) of the length of the street-facing
building wall. On corner lots, only one street- facing garage wall must meet
this standard. In the Eastside Mixed Use, Riverfront Crossings Zones and in the
CN-1, CB-2, MU and CB-5 Zones, garage opening(s) along the primary street
frontage are not permitted if access is feasible from another local or
collector street or from a rear alley, private street or private rear lane. If
there is no feasible alternative, garage opening(s) may be allowed along the
primary street frontage, provided that they occupy no more than thirty five
percent (35%) of the length of the primary street frontage of the lot and
provided that all provisions of article C, "Access Management Standards", of
this chapter are met.
   G.   Standards For Structured Parking In Industrial And Research Zones:
Where parking is located within the exterior walls of a principal building, the
following standards apply:
      1.   Any exterior walls of a parking facility that are visible from an
arterial street must appear to be a component of the facade of the building
through the use of building materials, window openings and facade detailing
that is similar or complementary to the design of the building. In no case
shall a building have the appearance from an arterial street of being elevated
above a parking level or "on stilts". (See subsection F3,
figure 5A.1 of this section.)
      2.   Vehicular access to parking within buildings should be located and
designed to minimize traffic congestion and hazards to pedestrians; and to
preserve street frontages for active building uses to the extent feasible.
Garage openings should be limited in width and number to only what is necessary
to provide adequate access for the types and numbers of vehicles using the
parking facility.
   H.   Design And Layout Of Surface Parking Areas: Except for parking for
single-family and two-family uses, all parking and stacking spaces, aisles and
drives must be designed as follows:
      1.   Minimum Dimensions: Parking areas must be configured according to
the aisle and parking space angle dimensions as illustrated in subsection H2,
figure 5A.2 of this section. Where the edges of parking spaces are curved, as
on a curved aisle, all angles are to be measured between the straight edges of
the parking spaces and tangents to the curved edges at their point of
intersection.
      2.   Aisles:
         a.   All parking spaces must be connected to an aisle that has a
minimum width as indicated in subsection H2,
figure 5A.2 of this section. Aisles designed for two-way traffic must be a
minimum of twenty two feet (22') in width.
         b.   The greatest aisle width shown in subsection H2,
figure 5A.2 of this section, must be provided when combining different parking
space configurations on the same aisle.
         c.   The maximum aisle width is twenty four feet (24').

IMAGES/0-0-0-2731.png]
 
      3.   Circulation: Parking areas must be designed to promote safe and
convenient pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicular circulation according to the
following standards and the standards of the base zone in which the property is
located:
         a.   Parking areas must be set back from rights-of-way and abutting
properties and properly screened from view as specified in the applicable base
zone regulations.
         b.   The drive(s) on a property should be designed to facilitate
vehicular circulation and connect street access points to parking areas,
loading and unloading areas, drive-through facilities, and other vehicular use
areas on a lot or tract. In general, drives should not be used as aisles.
However, the City may allow parking spaces along a drive in situations where
vehicular and pedestrian safety will not be compromised. When determining the
length and location of drives and the configuration of parking spaces and
aisles, the City will consider such factors as:
            (1)   Size and shape of the parking lot. Large parking lots with
multiple aisles of parking may need a system of separated drives to facilitate
traffic circulation; parking spaces should not be located along main
circulation routes where traffic speeds may be higher, but may be allowed in
lower traffic volume areas. In small parking areas, circulation drives may not
be necessary.
            (2)   Proximity to street access points. Parking spaces should not
be located so as to impede vehicles entering or exiting the site. The throat
length of drives at street access points must be sufficient in length to
provide the necessary vehicle stacking based on the anticipated traffic volume.
Parking spaces and aisles will not be allowed in close proximity to the
necessary driveway throats, as determined by the City.
            (3)   Proposed use of the drive. Parking spaces should not be
located so as to impede drive-through lanes, loading and unloading areas, or
higher volume delivery or truck circulation routes.
         c.   To control vehicle speeds and facilitate traffic safety and
circulation, drives must be separated from parking aisles by landscaped medians
and islands as illustrated in subsection H4,
figure 5A.4 of this section.
         d.   When used, medians should be at least four feet (4') in width and
be landscaped. If a median contains trees, it should be at least eight feet
(8') wide. If medians are intended for pedestrian circulation they should be
approximately twelve feet (12') to twenty feet (20') wide to accommodate a
walkway and shrubs and/or trees to buffer pedestrians from surrounding vehicle
areas.
         e.   To guide turning vehicles, maintain sightlines, and protect
vehicles at row ends, the free end of all parking aisles must be capped with a
landscaped terminal island as illustrated in
 figure 5A.3 of this subsection. In the CN-1 Zone, at least one shade tree must
be provided within each terminal island.
FIGURE 5A.3
TERMINAL PARKING ISLANDS
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/e8d1768e23d53ec22be0e15c84bd3fa19a74f99f/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2733.png]
 
         f.   Parking spaces within parking areas must be provided with car
stops or curbing to prevent encroachment into landscaped setbacks, medians, and
islands.
         g.   Parking areas must be designed to permit ingress and egress of
vehicles without needing to move any other vehicle occupying a parking space.
         h.   No parking area shall be designed in such a manner that exiting a
parking area would require backing into a street.
         i.   If the number of parking spaces required or provided for a use or
a combination of uses on a lot is greater than eight (8) spaces, none of those
spaces may be located in such a manner that would require backing into an
alley.
      4.   Partition Of Large Parking Areas: Surface parking areas that are
larger than forty five thousand (45,000) square feet or that have any perimeter
dimension greater than three hundred feet (300') must be divided into smaller,
connected lots to slow traffic movement, improve pedestrian safety, and reduce
the visual impact of large parking areas. The following design techniques must
be utilized to meet this standard. These design techniques may also be utilized
as a means of meeting the pedestrian circulation standards of the base zone.
(See
figure 5A.4 of this subsection H4.)
         a.   Divide the parking into separate areas with the use of drives and
landscape medians. These "separate areas" should have no dimension greater than
approximately two hundred feet (200').
         b.   The parking layout should ensure that no aisle of parking is
longer than approximately two hundred feet (200') without being end capped and
crossed by a drive or landscaped median.
         c.   Some parking areas may not easily accommodate the techniques
described above, such as long and narrow parking lots, so other options may be
approved by the Director of Planning and Community Development, such as the use
of landscaped islands to interrupt parking aisles and provide opportunities for
pedestrian crossings.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2735.png]
 
   I.   Landscaping And Tree Requirements Within Parking Areas:
      1.   Applicability:
         a.   Parking areas that contain more than eighteen (18) parking spaces
must be designed to include trees and planting areas according to the
requirements of this subsection.
         b.   If the number of parking spaces in an existing parking area is
increased to accommodate more than eighteen (18) parking spaces, then the newly
added parking area must comply with the requirements of this subsection.
         c.   If an existing parking area, which is not constructed with a
permanent durable surface according to the construction and design standards
above, is subsequently required to be surfaced or altered in any way, the
provisions of this subsection shall apply as if the parking area did not
previously exist.
         d.   Parking ramps, covered parking areas, and parking areas that are
an integral part of a building are exempt from the requirements of this
subsection. However, in such cases, certain perimeter landscaping may be
required according to the provisions of the base zone.
      2.   Requirements:
         a.   Trees must be planted or preserved on the site so that every
parking space or portion thereof is within forty feet (40') of a small tree or
within sixty feet (60') of a large tree.
         b.   In addition to the required trees, all medians, islands and other
planting areas within the parking area must be landscaped with turf, grasses,
low shrubs or other living cover. Planting areas at the ends of parking aisles
must consist of low growing varieties of shrubs, grasses, and ground cover (2
feet in height or less) so as not to impede vehicular sight lines. Landscape
medians along drives and pedestrian walkways may utilize larger shrubs and
plants to visually break up the appearance of large parking areas and buffer
pedestrian walkways. Trees may be planted in any median or planting island,
provided the median or island meets the minimum planting area size specified in
chapter 5, article E, "Landscaping And Tree Standards", of this title.
         c.   Planting areas must be separated from parking spaces, drives,
aisles, and alleys with unmountable curbs or barriers at least five inches (5")
in height. Curbs and barriers must be constructed in a manner that will prevent
salt and sand from storm water runoff from damaging trees and plantings. The
city may waive this requirement when drainage swales are utilized to facilitate
storm water runoff.
         d.   The design of any drainage swales proposed must be approved by
the city. Drainage swales must be planted with salt tolerant prairie grasses,
sedges and reeds that will slow runoff and allow ground infiltration. The
plants used in such swales must be approved by the city.
         e.   Coniferous trees may not be used to satisfy parking lot coverage
requirements.
         f.   Trees planted to meet the street tree requirements or to meet the
tree requirements for residential uses (see chapter 5, article E of this title)
may also be used to fulfill the requirements of this subsection; provided, that
no parking space is further than forty feet (40') from a small tree or sixty
feet (60') from a large tree.
         g.   All trees and landscaping within parking lots are subject to the
provisions of sections
14-5E-3, "General Requirements And Measurements",
14-5E-4, "Tree Planting Requirements",
14-5E-5, "Protection And Maintenance", and
14-5E-6, "Preservation Of Existing Trees", of this title.
   J.   Screening And Setback Requirements: Parking areas must be set back from
rights of way and abutting properties and screened from view according to
applicable setback and screening provisions of the subject base zone.
   K.   Design Of Bicycle Parking Areas:
      1.   The minimum size for a bicycle parking space is one and one-half
feet by six feet (1.5' X 6'). Where required for access, a minimum aisle width
of four feet (4') shall be provided.
      2.   Bicycle parking areas must be constructed of asphaltic cement
concrete, Portland cement concrete or manufactured paving materials, such as
brick. However, the city building official may permit the use of rock or gravel
areas for bicycle parking, provided edging materials are used so that the
bicycle parking area is clearly demarcated and the rock material is contained.
      3.   Required bicycle parking racks must be designed to support the
bicycle by its frame and allow the use of either a cable lock or a U-shaped
lock. Bicycle parking racks shall be installed a minimum of two feet (2') from
any curb, pavement edge, parking space, drive, walkway, or obstruction such as
a well wall, fence, doorway, or landscaping. Bicycle lockers and secure indoor
storage facilities are also allowed.
      4.   Bicycle parking facilities shall be located in a clearly designated,
safe, visible, and convenient location and shall be located so as not to impede
pedestrian or vehicular traffic. Bicycle parking is allowed in front and side
building setbacks in all zones; provided, that such a parking area results in
no more than twenty five percent (25%) of the required setback area being
paved.
   L.   Special Vehicle Parking And Storage Requirements In Single-Family
Zones, T3 Neighborhood Edge Zone, And T3 Neighborhood General Zone: The
provisions of this subsection apply in all single-family residential zones and
the above listed Form-Based Zones. For purposes of this subsection, a “special
vehicle” is defined as any device, more than seven and one-half feet (7.5') in
height and more than twenty feet (20') in length, which is or may be
transported or drawn upon a highway, street, or body of water, including,
without limitation, any motor vehicle, truck, trailer, tractor, wagon,
watercraft or any combination thereof exceeding these dimensions. A storage
area for a special vehicle includes any space equal in size to the outer
perimeter of the subject special vehicle that is used for storage of such a
vehicle. The following provisions apply to all such special vehicles:
      1.   A special vehicle may be stored inside any building, provided it is
not stored in a required parking space.
      2.   A special vehicle stored outside a building must comply with the
following standards:
         a.   The vehicle must be in operational condition and properly
licensed as required by state and federal law.
         b.   The special vehicle must belong to the owner or tenant of the
property on which the vehicle is located, except for special vehicles of
guests, as provided in subsection L2c of this section.
         c.   A special vehicle may not be used for dwelling purposes except as
temporary lodging for guests of the property owner or tenant. Such temporary
lodging may occur for no more than twenty one (21) consecutive days nor may
temporary lodging exceed a total of forty five (45) days in any calendar year.
An extension may be approved by the city manager or designee.
         d.   The special vehicle may not be used for storage of items other
than those considered to be part of the unit.
         e.   The storage area must be surfaced with crushed rock, asphalt,
concrete or a similar surface designed and maintained to prevent muddy
conditions, erosion from the flow of water onto adjoining property and weed
growth. In cases where crushed rock is used, the perimeter of a storage area
must be lined with bricks, landscape timbers or similar material that will
effectively contain the crushed rock.
         f.   (1) A special vehicle may not be parked or stored on a vacant
residential lot.
            (2)   No special vehicle may be stored in a front setback, except
on a regularly constructed aisle for a period of no more than four (4) days for
the purpose of loading and unloading.
            (3)   A special vehicle may be stored in the required rear setback
or the required side setback, provided the outer edge of the storage area is no
closer than three feet (3') to a side lot line or to a rear lot line of a
reversed corner lot.
            (4)   The city manager or designee may permit outside storage of a
special vehicle in the required front setback or the required side setback
along a street, provided:
               (A)   Storage space is not available in the side or rear setback
or there is no access to either the side or rear setback. For purposes of this
provision, a corner lot will always be deemed to have access to the rear
setback. Accessory structures and buildings less than one hundred sixty (160)
square feet in area and vegetation that is transplantable are not deemed to
prevent access.
               (B)   Inside storage is not possible because the size of the
special vehicle exceeds either the space available or the size of the entrance
available in any existing building, or both.
               (C)   The special vehicle is parked perpendicular to the street.
               (D)   The special vehicle storage area is screened from view of
the street using landscaping, a fence or a wall. Fences, walls, and hedges must
meet the applicable standards specified in chapter 4, article C, "Accessory
Uses And Buildings", of this title.
               (E)   No part of the special vehicle extends beyond the property
line or over a public right of way. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd. Ord. 06-
4220, 7-18-2006; Ord. 06-4245, 12-12-2006; Ord. 14-4586, 6-3-2014; Ord. 16-

14-5A-6: OFF STREET LOADING REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Applicability: In all zones, except the CB-5 and CB-10 zones, off
street loading spaces must be provided and maintained in compliance with the
requirements of this section.
   B.   Off Street Loading Requirements: Any nonresidential use that receives
or distributes materials or merchandise by trucks or vans and that has an
aggregate gross floor area of ten thousand (10,000) square feet or more must
provide the minimum number of loading spaces as indicated in
table 5A-4 of this section. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)

(Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd. Ord. 14-4586, 6-3-2014)
   C.   Rules For Computing Minimum Loading Requirements:
      1.   Where a fractional space results, the number of loading spaces
required is the closest whole number. A half space will be rounded down.
      2.   Any use that is nonconforming with regard to the number of required
loading spaces is subject to the applicable provisions of
chapter 4, article E, "Nonconforming Situations", of this title.
   D.   Use And Restrictions:
      1.   The use of required loading spaces is reserved for loading. Other
uses of required loading areas are not permitted, except as approved for a
temporary use. (See
chapter 4, article D, "Temporary Uses", of this title.)
      2.   The storage of merchandise, materials, equipment, refuse containers,
obsolete or junk vehicles or the major repair of vehicles in required loading
areas is prohibited.
   E.   Design And Maintenance Requirements: All loading spaces must be
constructed of asphalt, concrete or similar permanent dust free surface and in
accordance with the following requirements:
      1.   Loading spaces must be a minimum of ten feet (10') wide, twenty five
feet (25') long and twelve feet (12') high, exclusive of aisles. When more than
two (2) spaces are required, the spaces, other than the first two (2), must be
at least twelve feet (12') wide, seventy two feet (72') long and fourteen feet
(14') high.
      2.   All loading spaces must be pitched and drained to prevent the flow
of water from such areas onto streets and alleys that do not have adequate
drainage facilities as determined by the city engineer.
   F.   General Location Standards:
      1.   Loading spaces must be located so that trucks or vans loading or
unloading do not back onto or out of a street.
      2.   Off street loading areas are subject to the location and setback

14-5B-1: FINDINGS, PURPOSE AND INTERPRETATION:
Signs can obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses for
land and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation.
The purpose of this article is to regulate the size, illumination, movement,
materials, location, height and condition of all signs placed on private
property meant to be visible to the public from a street or other public right
of way thus enhancing and protecting the physical appearance and safety of the
community, protecting property values and the character of the various
neighborhoods, and preserving Iowa City's areas of natural, historic and scenic
beauty.
These regulations are intended to reduce distractions and obstructions
contributing to traffic accidents; reduce hazards caused by signs projecting
over the public right of way; provide a reasonable opportunity for all sign
users to display signs without interference from other signage.
These regulations are further intended to provide fair and equitable treatment
for all sign users; to allow for creative design; to encourage economic
development; to distinguish between areas designed primarily for auto oriented
commerce and areas designed for residential living or pedestrian oriented
commerce; and to establish a reasonable period of time for the elimination of
nonconforming signs.
This article allows adequate communication through signage while encouraging
aesthetic quality and creativity in the design, location, size and purpose of
all signs. This article must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the
first amendment guarantee of free speech. A sign placed on land or on a
building for the purpose of identification, protection or directing persons to
a use conducted therein must be deemed to be an integral but accessory and
subordinate part of the principal use of land or building. Therefore, the
intention of this article is to establish limitations on signs in order to
ensure they are appropriate to the land, building or use to which they are
appurtenant and are adequate for their intended purpose while balancing the
individual and community interests identified above. These regulations are
intended to promote signs that are compatible with the use of the property to
which they are appurtenant, landscape and architecture of surrounding
buildings, are legible and appropriate to the activity to which they pertain,
are not distracting to motorists, and are constructed and maintained in a
structurally sound and attractive condition.
The regulations are not intended to and do not apply to signs erected,
maintained or otherwise posted, owned or leased by the city, state or federal
government.
A sign displaying a noncommercial message of any type is allowed anywhere that
commercial signs are allowed, subject to the same regulations applicable to
such commercial signs to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech
over noncommercial speech, or favoring of any particular commercial message
over any other noncommercial message. (Ord. 16-4685, 11-15-2016)
14-5B-2: GENERAL RULES AND APPLICABILITY:
   A.   Applicability: All signs on private property must be installed,

this article shall be installed, altered, moved, improved or converted without
first obtaining a sign permit from the building official or designee according
to the procedures specified in chapter 8, "Review And Approval Procedures", of
this title. A permit is not required for incidental repairs or routine
maintenance.
      2.   Certain types of signs are allowed without a permit and such
exemption from the sign permit requirements is clearly specified in the tables
included in sections
14-5B-8 and
14-5B-9 of this article. A permit is required for any sign that is not
specifically exempted from the permit requirements.
   C.   Sign Installer's License Required:
      1.   Except for those signs not requiring a permit, as listed in sections
14-5B-8 and
14-5B-9 of this article, it shall be unlawful for any person to install, alter,
move, improve, remove or convert any sign without having a sign installer's
license in good standing issued by the city. A onetime sign installer's license
shall be available to a tenant or owner of a building to permit the tenant's or
owner's own sign to be installed.
      2.   The license to install, alter, move, improve, remove or convert any
sign as required herein shall be known as a "sign installer's license" and
shall be issued by the city to the person desiring to perform the work
indicated above. No such license shall be issued to any person until such
person shall have paid to the city a license fee as established by resolution
of city council and shall have filed with the department of housing and
inspection services a copy or a certificate of a contractor's public liability
insurance policy with coverage limits as set out in this code. The city shall
be designated as an additional insured, and the policy shall provide that the
city is to be notified thirty (30) days in advance of the termination of the
policy. The license shall indemnify and save harmless the city from any and all
damage, judgment, cost or expense which the city may incur or suffer by reason
of said license issuance.
      3.   All sign installer's licenses shall expire on December 31 of each
year. Renewal fees and reinstatement fees shall be as established by resolution
of the city council. Any license that has expired may be reinstated within
sixty (60) calendar days after the expiration date upon payment of an
additional reinstatement fee.
      4.   A onetime sign installer's license shall be valid for thirty (30)
days from the date of issuance.
      5.   The building official or designee is responsible for enforcement of
these provisions and is empowered to suspend or revoke a sign installer's
license for a violation of the sign regulations or if the license was obtained
by fraud or if the license allows any person not employed by the sign installer
without a valid installer's license to do or cause to be done any work
requiring a license.
      6.   A person aggrieved by the revocation, suspension or denial of a
license may appeal said action to the board of adjustment.
      7.   If a license is revoked for any reason, another installer's license
shall not be issued to such person for twelve (12) months after revocation.
   D.   Application Of State Law: In any case in which the code of Iowa, as
amended, contains more restrictive requirements than the regulations contained
herein, the code of Iowa, as amended, will govern. (Ord. 08-4319, 11-3-2008;

ambient light conditions. At no time shall the sign be operated at a brightness
level greater than the manufacturer's recommended levels. The electronic
changeable copy must be monochromatic. It must utilize a dark background with
only the message or image lit in a single color.
      4.   Artificial external light sources used to illuminate a sign face
must be located and shielded such that the bulb is not directly visible from
any adjacent residentially zoned property or public right-of-way and must use a
narrow cone of light that does not extend beyond the illuminated sign face.
      5.   Illumination on a property, including illumination from signs, must
not exceed 0.5 initial horizontal foot-candle and 2.0 initial maximum foot-
candles as measured at any point along a property boundary that is adjacent to

14-5B-8,
table 5B-4 of this article.
      11.   No vehicle, including trailers, shall be parked so that it
functions primarily as a sign. A vehicle will be considered in violation of
this provision if the questions in subsections A11a through A11c of this
section can be answered in the affirmative, and there is no compelling answer
to the question in subsection A11d of this section to justify the parking
location as opposed to some less conspicuous location.
         a.   Is the vehicle parked at a prominent location?
         b.   Can people driving by the sign easily read the sign?
         c.   Is the vehicle in the same or similar locations for several hours
during the same day or for several days during the same week?
         d.   Are there any stated or apparent reasons, other than for signage
purposes, that justify the vehicle being at that location? (Ord. 16-4685, 11-
15-2016)
   B.   Removal Of Prohibited Or Illegal Signs: In accordance with the
following procedure, the building official or designee is authorized to require
the removal of any illegal or prohibited sign:
      1.   Before taking action to require the removal of any illegal or
prohibited sign, the building official or designee will provide written notice
to the owner or operator of the business to which the sign relates.
      2.   The notice will specify that the illegal or prohibited sign must be
removed or brought into compliance with this article within a reasonable time
of such notice.
      3.   If the sign is not removed or repaired, as the case may be, within
the time allowed, the building official or designee is hereby authorized to
have the sign removed to be used as evidence and assess the costs of removal
against the property for collection in the same manner as a Property Tax. (Ord.
08-4319, 11-3-2008)
14-5B-7: MEASUREMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Maximum Sign Area:
      1.   Where the size of a sign is regulated by the area of a wall, an
awning or a canopy, the maximum sign area is calculated as a percentage of the
total area of the wall, the awning, or the canopy on which the sign is affixed.
      2.   For entranceway signs located on the front elevation of the subject
archway, the maximum sign area is calculated as a percentage of the total area
delineated by the archway. For entranceway signs located on the side of the
archway, the maximum sign area is calculated as a percentage of the surface
area of the side of the archway support on which the sign is located.
Figure 5B.1 of this section illustrates how to measure the total area
delineated by the archway and the surface area of the side of the archway
support. The total area delineated by the archway in
figure 5B.1 of this section equals x(y). The surface area of the side of the
archway support in
figure 5B.1 of this section equals a(b).

IMAGES/0-0-0-2737.png]
 
      3.   The total building signage on a wall, canopy, or awning shall not
exceed the maximum sign allowance for that wall, canopy, or awning, regardless
of the number of uses or occupants in the building. For example, if the maximum
sign area for fascia signs is fifteen percent (15%), then no more than fifteen
percent (15%) of any single wall of the building may be covered by fascia
signs, regardless of how many businesses are located in the building.
   B.   Measuring Sign Area: The area of each sign, regardless of shape, shall
be computed by determining the area of a triangle, rectangle or circle that
completely encloses the outer perimeter of the sign face. In the case of a sign
composed of characters or words that are attached directly to a building, an
appurtenance to a building, or a masonry wall, the area of the sign will be
computed by determining the area of a triangle, rectangle, or circle that
completely encloses the whole group of characters or words.
   C.   Measuring Sign Height: The maximum height of a sign shall be the
measurement from grade to the highest point on the sign. In the case where a
minimum height is established, the minimum height shall be measured from grade
to the lowest point on the sign. (Ord. 08-4319, 11-3-2008)

   G.   Sign Standards For Riverfront Crossings And Eastside Mixed Use Zones:
      1.   In the South Downtown, University, Central Crossings, Park, South

signage on mixed use and nonresidential buildings shall be allowed according to
the standards that apply in the CB-10 Zone, except that in the South Gilbert
Subdistrict the maximum sign area for fascia signs for Cottage Industries and
associated uses located in existing buildings that are legally non-compliant
with storefront frontage standards is fifteen percent (15%) of the sign wall.
      2.   In the Gilbert Subdistrict, signage for mixed use and nonresidential
buildings shall be allowed according to the standards that apply in the CN-
1 Zone.
      3.   In the West Riverfront Subdistrict, signage on mixed use and

zones applies.
      5.   Signs shall be integrated into the architectural design of the
building and not dominate the facade or interfere with adjacent buildings. For
buildings with multiple storefronts, a sign plan is required at the time of
development that ensures that signage allowances are fairly apportioned
according to the relative width of the individual storefronts and that the
signage type and designs are consistent and complementary along the building
frontage.

be primarily oriented to pedestrians and scaled appropriately. Window signs and
temporary signs in windows shall not block views into the interior and shall

sign regulations, standards, and requirements as set forth in this article.
   H.   Sign Standards And Types For Form-Based Zones:
      1.   Purpose: This section ensures that all signs installed in Form-Based
Zones subject to Article 14-2H are compatible with the intended physical
character, and in compliance with all applicable plans of the City. This
section promotes public health, safety, and welfare through a comprehensive
system of reasonable, effective, consistent, content-neutral, and
nondiscriminatory sign standards to:
         a.   Promote and accomplish the goals, policies, and actions of
applicable City plans;
         b.   Balance public and private objectives by allowing adequate
avenues for effective messaging;
         c.   Improve pedestrian, bicycle, and traffic safety from injury or
property damage caused by, or which may be fully or partially attributed to,
cluttered or distracting signage;
         d.   Prevent property damage, personal injury, and litter caused by
signs that are improperly constructed or poorly maintained;
         e.   Protect property values, improve the local economy and quality of
life by preserving and enhancing the appearance of the streetscape; and
         f.   Provide clear and unambiguous sign standards that enable fair and
consistent enforcement of these sign standards.
      2.   The sign types established in this section are intended to be viewed
from the public right-of-way and from outdoors in areas of public and private
property used for public pedestrian access.
      3.   Sign Types:

14-5B-10: PRIVATELY OWNED SIGNS IN PUBLIC PLACES:
   A.   Purpose: In order to promote the health, safety and general welfare of
the population, no privately owned signs shall be placed on or over a “public
place”, as defined in chapter 9, article C of this title, except as permitted
by the City.
   B.   Removal: Existing privately owned signs currently located on or over a
public place that are not in compliance with this Code shall be eliminated and

14-5C-1: Purpose
14-5C-2: Applicability And Rules Of Interpretation
14-5C-3: Permit Required
14-5C-4: Driveway Spacing Standards
14-5C-5: Location And Dimensional Standards For Driveways
14-5C-6: Arterial Street Access Requirements
14-5C-7: Cross Access Easements
14-5C-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this article is to ensure safe and adequate access to the public
street network by establishing standards to control the location and number of
access points, separate and control intersection conflict areas, remove turning
vehicles from through travel lanes when appropriate, provide adequate spacing
between driveways, and minimize impervious driveway surface in the parkway
portion of the public right of way. These standards help to ensure that the
city's street network is designed to balance the functions of access to
adjoining property, pedestrian circulation, and vehicular traffic circulation.
(Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-5C-2: APPLICABILITY AND RULES OF INTERPRETATION:
   A.   It is unlawful for any person to cut, break, or remove any curb along a
street except in compliance with the requirements of this article, or unless
specifically exempted or superseded by more specific provisions of this title.
   B.   No building permit will be issued and no site plan or subdivision will
be approved unless the proposed development is in compliance with the
requirements of this article.
   C.   Every residential and nonresidential property will be permitted at
least one means of vehicular access to a public street. However, direct
driveway access to a public street may not be permitted in all instances. Use
of alleys, private rear lanes, backage roads, and cross access easements may be
required as alternatives to direct street access.
   D.   The specifications, design, and construction of all curb cuts, access
drives and sidewalks must comply with the Iowa City municipal design standards
(MDS), as amended. In cases where the provisions of the MDS conflict with the
provisions of this article, the provisions of this article shall govern.
   E.   Arterial streets, as referenced in this article, are those streets
shown on the Iowa City arterial street map in
figure 5C.1 (found in subsection
14-5C-6F of this article), and include future arterial streets as shown on the
map. Said map is based on the JCCOG arterial street map, as amended. If the
JCCOG arterial street map, as amended, conflicts with
figure 5C.1 of this article, the JCCOG map will supersede
figure 5C.1. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd. Ord. 06-4245, 12-12-2006; Ord. 20-
4833, 11-17-2020)
14-5C-3: PERMIT REQUIRED:
   A.   Except as otherwise specified in subsections B through D of this
section, an access permit must be obtained prior to cutting, breaking, or
removing any curb. Procedures for obtaining an access permit are specified in
chapter 8, "Review And Approval Procedures", of this title.
   B.   An access permit is always required for access to an arterial street,
unless the specific access point has already been approved through the site
plan review process.
   C.   For local and collector streets, if access locations are specified and
approved as a part of a subdivision or site plan review process, separate
access permits are not required upon development of the individual lots within
the subdivision. However, an access permit is required if the request for an
access point is other than what was approved through the site plan review or
the subdivision process or if access was not addressed through the subdivision
or site plan review process.
   D.   For access to a state highway, an access permit must be approved by the
Iowa department of transportation (IDOT), with a recommendation from the city.
A recommendation from the city is required prior to filing an application with
the IDOT. However, a separate city access permit is not required. (Ord. 05-
4186, 12-15-2005)
   E.   Historic review, as set forth in
chapter 8, article E, "Historic Preservation Commission Approval Procedures",
of this title, is required for any new access to property designated as an Iowa
City landmark or property located in a historic or conservation district. (Ord.
06-4245, 12-12-2006)
14-5C-4: DRIVEWAY SPACING STANDARDS:
   A.   Driveway Spacing From Street Intersections: On corner lots, driveways
must be constructed as far away from the intersection as possible while
maintaining the driveway spacing standards specified in subsection B of this
section. In addition to this general standard, the following standards apply,
based on the functional classification of the street.
      1.   Along local streets and collector streets, there must be a minimum
of twenty feet (20') between the end of a radius of a street intersection and
the beginning of a driveway curb cut as measured at the curb line, except as
required in the subsection A2 of this section.
      2.   Along collector streets, where they intersect with arterial streets,
there must be a minimum of fifty feet (50') between the end of a radius of a
street intersection and the beginning of a driveway curb cut as measured at the
curb line.
      3.   Along arterial streets, there must be a minimum of one hundred fifty
feet (150') between the end of a radius of a street intersection and the
beginning of a driveway curb cut as measured at the curb line.
      4.   Additional distance between the radius of a street intersection and
the beginning of a driveway curb cut may be required by the city where deemed
necessary due to high traffic volumes or other safety concerns.
      5.   The city may adjust the driveway spacing standards so that driveways
line up with existing driveways across the street.
   B.   Minimum Spacing Between Driveways:
      1.   Along arterial streets, there must be at least fifty feet (50')
between curb cuts, measured at the curb line. No portion of a driveway may be
constructed within twenty five feet (25') of a side property line extended,
except when a common driveway agreement has been reached with an adjacent
property owner and is of record.
      2.   Along local and collector streets, there must be at least six feet
(6') between curb cuts, measured at the curb line. No portion of a driveway may
be constructed closer than three feet (3') to a side property line extended,
except when a common driveway agreement has been reached with an adjacent
property owner and is of record.
   C.   Modifications To Driveway Spacing Standards: If it can be demonstrated
that there is practical difficulty meeting a driveway spacing standard
contained in this section due to topographical limitations, natural features of
the site, or other circumstances peculiar to the property in question, a
property owner may request a modification or waiver of said standard according
to the applicable approval criteria for a minor modification as set forth in
chapter 4, article B of this title. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-5C-5: LOCATION AND DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS FOR DRIVEWAYS:
The following location and dimensional standards for access points provide the
opportunity for access to streets while setting limits on the number of curb
cuts permitted and the width of driveways. Maximums are intended as an upper
limit on the number and dimensions of driveways and should not be construed as
minimum requirements. In many cases, fewer and narrower driveways may be
desirable to reduce interruption of the city's street and sidewalk system, to
preserve opportunities for on street parking, and to reduce impervious surface
and storm water runoff.
   A.   Household Living Uses, Except Multi-Family Uses:
      1.   Group Households: Group households must comply with the access
regulations that pertain to the type of dwelling in which the group household
is located. For example, a group household located in a two-family use must
comply with the access regulations for two-family uses.
      2.   Number Of Access Points Allowed:
         a.   For detached single-family dwellings and detached zero lot line
dwellings, a maximum of two (2) access points may be approved per property,
regardless of whether it is a single frontage, double frontage, or corner lot.
For lots with less than fifty feet (50') of frontage, only one access point is
allowed.
         b.   For attached single-family dwellings and two-family uses, a
maximum of one access point per dwelling unit will be allowed, regardless of
whether it is a single frontage, double frontage, or corner lot.
      3.   Access Based On Street Classification: Direct lot access to city
streets is allowed according to the following rules. Single- family and two-
family uses must also comply with the single- family site development standards
as set forth in section
14-2A-6 of this title and/or according to any applicable provisions of the
single-family density bonus options set forth in section
14-2A-7 of this title.
         a.   If two (2) access points are approved for a single lot, the
primary access drive must be from the lower classified street.
         b.   Where a lot is adjacent to a paved alley or paved private rear
lane, primary access must be from the alley or private rear lane, unless, due
to topographical limitations or other unique circumstances, such access is not
feasible.
         c.   For properties without feasible access to a paved alley or paved
private rear lane, the primary access may be located along a local or collector
street. For lots with frontage along more than one street, primary access must
be located along the lower classified street.
         d.   Direct lot access to an arterial street may be requested when
access to a paved alley, private rear lane, local street, or collector street
is not feasible due to inadequate frontage, topographical limitations or other
unique circumstances. When land is being subdivided or resubdivided into lots
intended for single-family or two-family uses, individual lot access to
arterial streets is discouraged. The city, at its discretion, may deny a
request for a subdivision design that would necessitate individual lot access
for single-family and two-family uses to an arterial street. Requests for
direct lot access to an arterial street are subject to the provisions of
section
14-5C-6, "Arterial Street Access Requirements", of this article.
         e.   For two-family uses and attached single-family dwellings in the
RS-5 and RS-8 zone, if access to a paved alley or private rear lane is not
feasible, the garage entrance and access drive for a dwelling unit must be
oriented towards the same street as that dwelling unit's main entrance.
      4.   Narrow Lots: Additional access restrictions may apply to lots less
than sixty feet (60') in width. See the single-family site development
standards contained in
chapter 2, article A, "Single- Family Residential Zones", of this title.
      5.   Shared Driveways: Dwellings may share drives and aisles; provided,
that a shared access easement is secured from the owners of each property
sharing the drive or aisle. The easement must be recorded and proof of such
recording must be submitted prior to issuance of an access permit.
      6.   Dimensional Standards:
         a.   For alley or rear lane access, the driveway is allowed to be as
wide as necessary to provide access to the garage or parking space(s).
         b.   For properties with a single access point, the maximum driveway
width is twenty four feet (24') measured at the property line and thirty feet
(30') measured at the curb line.
         c.   If two (2) access points are approved on a single frontage lot,
the maximum dimension for each driveway is twelve feet (12') measured at the
property line and eighteen feet (18') measured at the curb line.
         d.   For single-family uses, if two (2) access points are approved,
one from an alley or private rear lane, and one from a street, the primary
access drive must be from the alley or private rear lane. In such a case, the
maximum driveway width for the secondary driveway from the street is twelve
feet (12') measured at the property line and eighteen feet (18') measured at
the curb line. The access drive from the alley or rear lane is allowed to be as
wide as necessary to provide access to the garage or parking space(s).
         e.   For single-family uses, if two (2) access points are approved on
a double frontage or corner lot, one on each frontage, maximum driveway width
for the primary driveway is twenty four feet (24') measured at the property
line and thirty feet (30') measured at the curb line. The maximum driveway
width for the secondary driveway is twelve feet (12') measured at the property
line and eighteen feet (18') measured at the curb line.
         f.   For two-family uses, if two (2) access points are approved, one
from an alley or private rear lane, and one from a street, the maximum driveway
width for the driveway from the street is twenty feet (20') at the property
line and twenty six feet (26') at the curb line. The access drive from the
alley or rear lane is allowed to be as wide as necessary to provide access to
the garage or parking space(s).
         g.   For two-family uses, if two (2) access points are approved on a
double frontage or corner lot, one on each frontage, the maximum driveway width
for each driveway is twenty feet (20') at the property line and twenty six feet
(26') at the curb line.
         h.   The maximum width for shared driveways is twenty four feet (24')
measured at the property line and thirty feet (30') measured at the curb line.
         i.   Additional driveway width restrictions may apply to lots narrower
than sixty feet (60'). (See single-family site development standards contained
in
chapter 2, article A of this title.)
         j.   In all cases, at least fifty percent (50%) of the area within the
front building setback must remain open space free of impervious surface.
Drives may not be constructed such that this limit is exceeded, except when a
special exception is granted by the board of adjustment according to the
applicable approval criteria as stated in the base zone.
   B.   Multi-Family Uses And Group Living Uses:
      1.   Group Households: Group households located within multi-family uses
are subject to the standards of this subsection.
      2.   Determining Number And Location Of Access Points:
         a.   The city will grant direct lot access to local or collector
streets based on the size of the residential development, anticipated traffic,
the location, the surrounding land uses, and the availability of cross access
easements, or alley or private rear lane access. Based on these factors, the
city will determine the number and location of access points.
         b.   Direct lot access to arterial streets may be requested if access
to an alley, private rear lane, local street, or collector street is not
feasible and if access is not feasible by means of a cross access easement.
Requests for direct lot access to an arterial street are subject to the
provisions of section
14-5C-6, "Arterial Street Access Requirements", of this article.
         c.   No more than two (2) driveways will be allowed on any single
frontage property. No more than three (3) driveways will be allowed on any
double frontage/corner lot, with a maximum of two (2) driveways permitted along
any one street.
      3.   Driveway Dimensional Standards: The city will determine driveway
specifications, including width and configuration of lanes, for multi-family
and group living uses based on the size of the development, the anticipated
traffic generated by the use, the location, the surrounding land uses, and the
functional classification of the street to which the driveway provides access.
Driveway widths may not exceed twenty four feet (24') measured at the property
line and thirty two feet (32') at the curb line, except as required by the city
for high traffic volume situations.
   C.   Nonresidential Uses:
      1.   Determining Number And Location Of Access Points:
         a.   The city will grant direct lot access to local or collector
streets that are nonresidential in nature, provided traffic circulation and/or
public safety will not be compromised. The city will determine the number,
location, and design of the access based on the size and location of the
nonresidential development, the type of use, the anticipated traffic and safety
issues, and the surrounding land uses.
         b.   When a site is being developed or redeveloped for nonresidential
uses, existing access points along local or collector streets may be retained
in most instances. However, the city may require that an access point be moved
or combined with another access point in order to prevent public safety or
traffic circulation problems that might reasonably be expected to occur due to
the development or redevelopment of the site.
         c.   Institutional uses that are allowed in residential zones may be
permitted access to residential local and collector streets, provided such
access does not conflict with the approval criteria for provisional and special
exception uses contained in
chapter 4, article B of this title.
         d.   Direct lot access to arterial streets may be requested if access
to a local or collector street is not feasible and if access is not feasible by
means of a cross access easement. Requests for direct lot access to an arterial
street are subject to the provisions of section
14-5C-6, "Arterial Street Access Requirements", of this article.
         e.   No more than two (2) driveways will be allowed on any single
frontage property. No more than three (3) driveways will be allowed on any
double-frontage/corner lot, with a maximum of two (2) driveways permitted along
any one street.
      2.   Driveway Dimensional Standards:
         a.   The city will determine driveway specifications, including width
and configuration of lanes, for nonresidential uses based on the size of the
nonresidential development, the anticipated traffic generated by the use, the
location, the surrounding land uses, and the functional classification of the
street to which the driveway provides access.
         b.   Driveway widths may not exceed thirty four feet (34') measured at
the property line and forty two feet (42') at the curb line, except as required
by the city for high traffic volume situations and for commercial and
industrial properties that need to accommodate large truck traffic. The Iowa
City municipal design standards, as amended, describe and illustrate type A, B,
and C driveways that are intended for these situations. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-
2005)
14-5C-6: ARTERIAL STREET ACCESS REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Direct lot access to an arterial street (see
 figure 5C.1 at subsection F of this section) will only be granted upon
presentation by the applicant of convincing evidence that an alternative means
of access is not feasible from an intersecting local or collector street or
through means of a cross access easement.
   B.   The city will approve or deny a request for direct lot access to an
arterial street based on whether an alternative means of access is available,
the size and nature of the proposed development, the anticipated amount of
traffic that will be generated by the development, the capacity of the
surrounding streets, and the character of surrounding land uses. At the
discretion of the city, a traffic study may be required as described in
subsection C of this section for any request for access to an arterial street.
   C.   When an applicant makes a request for driveway access from any use to
an arterial street, either as part of an access permit application or an
application for a new subdivision, the city may require the applicant to
conduct and submit a traffic study. The city will determine the scope of the
traffic study. The traffic study must provide accurate and convincing evidence
justifying the need for the proposed access point and also determine whether
additional traffic control improvements are necessary for safe access. These
improvements may include, but are not limited to the following:
      1.   Right turn lanes.
      2.   Left turn lanes, including two-way left turn lanes.
      3.   Opening or closing a median.
      4.   Cross access roads or driveways.
      5.   Installation or modification of traffic signals, or other traffic
control devices.
      6.   Widening or narrowing driveways and improving on site vehicle
storage areas.
      7.   Consolidating or closing existing driveways.
      8.   Relocating or re-orienting access to provide better sight distance.
      9.   Redesigning internal road and parking layout.
      10.   Modifications to on street parking or off street parking.
   D.   If the city determines that a cross access easement, road or driveway
is required as a condition of approval, the development must adhere to the
standards for cross access easements outlined in section
14-5C-7 of this article.
   E.   In addition to any traffic control improvements required based on the
traffic study, the driveway spacing, location, and dimensional standards
contained in this article must be met.
   F.

(Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-5C-7: CROSS ACCESS EASEMENTS:
   A.   Purpose: Cross access easements provide the opportunity to minimize the
number of access points along an arterial street in order to maximize the
traffic carrying capacity of the street and improve the overall safety of the
transportation corridor.
   B.   Applicability And Rules Of Interpretation:
      1.   If a property with frontage along an arterial street is proposed to
be subdivided, developed or redeveloped for any multi-family, group living,
commercial, or industrial use, a cross access easement must be provided by the
property owner to all adjoining properties that front on the same arterial
street that are or may be developed as multi-family, group living, commercial,
or industrial uses.
      2.   The city may waive the requirement for a cross access easement in
cases where unusual topography, existing buildings, utility substations or
other unique conditions would render such an easement functionally unusable.
The city may also waive cross access easement requirements between properties
that contain dissimilar uses, such as between residential uses and commercial
or industrial uses.
      3.   The city may approve the vacation of cross access easements in those
cases where the adjoining parcels are subsequently developed with a dissimilar
use such as a single-family dwelling or duplex, multi-family dwellings adjacent
to commercial uses, or other similar situation.
   C.   Requirements:
      1.   The cross access easement must be at least twenty four feet (24') in
width, unless a narrower width is approved by the city due to topography,
existing buildings, or other site conditions.
      2.   The drive or lane constructed in the cross access easement must be
at least twenty feet (20') wide, unless a greater width is required due to fire
apparatus access drive requirements or driveway width requirements contained in
chapter 5, article A, "Off Street Parking And Loading Standards", of this
title.
      3.   The cross access drive must meet any other applicable standards for
access drives contained in
chapter 5, article A, "Off Street Parking And Loading Standards", of this
title.
      4.   Cross access easements should function as rear service lanes or as
traffic circulation drives between parking areas of adjacent properties. See
figures 5C.2 and
5C.3 below.
Figure 5C.2 - Rear Service Lane As A Cross Access Easement

      5.   Permanent structures that would interfere with the proposed access
are not permitted within the easement. Improvements such as medians and parking
islands may be constructed within a cross access easement if it can be
demonstrated that adequate circulation and cross access will be accomplished.
      6.   The property owner is responsible for properly maintaining the cross
access easement. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)

The intersection visibility standards establish triangular areas on corner
lots, referred to herein as "vision triangles", within which the placement of
buildings, fences, hedges, walls, and other structures is restricted in order
to maintain clear lines of sight at street intersections for the purposes of
traffic and pedestrian safety. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-5D-2: APPLICABILITY:
Lots located at the corner of any street intersection must comply with the
requirements of this article, unless specifically exempted or superseded by
more specific provisions of this title. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd. Ord.
20-4833, 11-17-2020)
14-5D-3: VISION TRIANGLES:
The dimensions of vision triangles are determined as follows: (See also
 figure 5D.1, located at the end of this section.)
   A.   At the intersection of two (2) local streets, a local street with a
collector street, or two (2) collector streets, the legs of the vision triangle
will be thirty feet (30') in length, as measured along the curb line from the
point where the curbs of the two (2) streets intersect. In the absence of a
curb, the legs of the triangle will be thirty feet (30') in length, as measured
along the edge of the street pavement from the point where the pavement of the
two (2) streets intersect.
   B.   At the intersection of two (2) arterial streets, the legs of the
triangle will be thirty feet (30') in length, as measured along the right of
way line from the point the right of way lines of the two (2) streets
intersect.
   C.   At the intersection of a local street with an arterial or at the
intersection of a collector street with an arterial, the local or collector leg
of the triangle will be thirty feet (30') in length, as measured along the curb
line from the point where the curbs of the streets intersect. The arterial leg
of the triangle will be thirty feet (30') in length, as measured along the
right of way line from the point the right of way lines of the two (2) streets
intersect.

05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-5E-2: APPLICATION OF PROVISIONS:
   A.   Applicability: No building permit shall be issued for the construction,
reconstruction or structural alteration of a building nor shall any use be
established or converted nor shall a certificate of occupancy be granted for a
use without conformity with the provisions of the tree regulations, unless
specifically exempted or superseded by more specific provisions of this title.
   B.   Exemptions: The following are exempt from the requirements of this
article:
      1.   Any individual lot occupied by a detached single-family dwelling or
a detached zero lot line dwelling, including group households, if located
within such a dwelling.
      2.   Property in the ID and CB-10 zones.
      3.   In commercial zones, property developed in accordance with the
setback requirements of the base zone in such a manner that insufficient area
is available to achieve compliance with the requirements of this article;
however, all trees that can be provided in compliance with the requirements
must be provided. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd. Ord. 06-4245, 12-12-2006;
Ord. 20-4833, 11-17-2020)
14-5E-3: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND MEASUREMENTS:
   A.   Permitted Species: The list of recommended trees for Iowa City, as
established by the city forester, specifies the varieties of trees permitted
for the uses indicated by this article. References to "large" or "small" trees
herein refer to the mature heights of the trees as indicated in said list.
   B.   Landscape Plans Required: When the provisions of this article are
applicable, a landscaping plan must be submitted that illustrates and lists the
following information:
      1.   The size and location of required planting areas.
      2.   The mature height (small or large) of both proposed trees and trees
that will be preserved.
      3.   The species of trees (both preserved and proposed).
      4.   The location of the preserved and proposed trees.
      5.   The location of any existing trees within the right of way.
   C.   Measurements:
      1.   When measuring to determine the location or spacing of required
trees or shrubs, the distance is measured to the center of the tree or shrub.
      2.   Where fractional numbers of trees result from calculations, the
number of trees required will be rounded to the closest whole number. (Ord. 05-
4186, 12-15-2005)
14-5E-4: TREE PLANTING REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Plantings Required Prior To Occupancy:
      1.   All plantings required by this article must be installed prior to
occupancy or commencement of a use, except as allowed in subsection A2 of this
section.
      2.   If the plantings cannot be installed prior to occupancy or
commencement of a use due to seasonal conditions that may reduce survivability,
the building official may issue a temporary certificate of occupancy and grant
a delay of installation until the seasonal calendar dates of June 1 or November
1, whichever occurs first, and the property owner must place in an escrow
account, established with the city, an amount which will cover one hundred ten
percent (110%) of the estimated cost of plants and installation.
   B.   Planting Sizes:
      1.   Deciduous Trees: At the time of planting, deciduous trees must have
a single stem and have a minimum trunk diameter of one and one-half inches
(1.5") measured at a point six inches (6") above ground level or above the top
of burlap wrapping. It must demonstrate the growth capabilities, branching
formation and crown balance that are indigenous to the particular variety. The
tree must be straight of trunk with the main leader intact and must be healthy
and free of disease and pests.
      2.   Coniferous Trees: At the time of planting, coniferous trees must
have a minimum height of three feet (3') measured from the planted level to the
top of the tree. The needle color and branching habits must be normal for the
species, and the overall appearance must be indicative of previous care in
pruning and development. The tree must be healthy and free of disease and
pests.
   C.   Siting Requirements:
      1.   Trees must be located in a manner that, at maturity, will avoid
interference with the construction, maintenance and operation of public and
private utilities and services aboveground or belowground.
      2.   The minimum planting area required for large trees is two hundred
fifty six (256) square feet. The minimum planting area required for small trees
is one hundred twenty (120) square feet.
      3.   At the time of planting, trees and plantings must be separated from
other structures and features on a site in order to minimize conflicts as
plants mature.
Table 5E-1 below specifies the minimum spacing between plantings and various
features of a site. However, the minimum distances between trees, between trees
and shrubs, and between shrubs may be reduced by twenty five percent (25%) to
permit design flexibility or to create denser screening where desired.

(Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-5E-5: PROTECTION AND MAINTENANCE:
   A.   The provisions of this section apply to all plantings required by this
title, whether newly planted or preserved.
   B.   Required planting areas must be separated from abutting vehicular use
areas, including parking spaces, drives, aisles, alleys, vehicle display and
loading areas, etc., by an unmountable curb or barrier that is a minimum of
five inches (5") in height. The curb or barrier must be constructed in such a
manner that salt water runoff will not damage the tree or plantings.
   C.   The property owner must keep all trees properly maintained, pruned as
needed, and free from trash and litter. It is the responsibility of the
property owner to maintain and replace trees and plantings required by this
title. Required landscaping must be continuously maintained in a healthy
manner. Plants that die must be replaced. Improper maintenance, pruning, or
removal of plantings may be subject to municipal infraction proceedings, up to
and including environmental infraction proceedings. Any preserved tree that has
been improperly maintained, pruned, or removed may be required to be replaced
by the same number of trees for which it substituted.
   D.   Any trees that overhang the public right of way must be maintained in
accordance with the provisions of title 10, chapter 8, "Trees And Plant
Materials", of this code.
   E.   Maintenance of trees within street rights of way will be the
responsibility of the city. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-5E-6: PRESERVATION OF EXISTING TREES:
Existing trees may be used to comply with the requirements of sections
14-5E-7, "Street Tree Requirements", and
14-5E-8, "Tree Requirements For Residential Uses", of this article, and to meet
the tree requirements for parking areas contained in article A, "Off Street
Parking And Loading Standards", of this chapter. Existing trees used to satisfy
these requirements must be in good health prior to and following site
development. The city forester is authorized to approve substitutions based on
determination of health and survivability.
Table 5E-2, "Schedule Of Substitution Values", of this section, will be used to
determine the ratio of substitution. The following provisions must also be
observed:
   A.   The same minimum separation distances that are required of new
plantings must be observed when possible; except, that extant groupings of two
(2) or more trees may be preserved upon approval by the city forester, who will
also determine if trees or branches must be removed from such groupings in the
interest of public safety and/or to assure survival of the specimen.
   B.   The building official will determine if a preserved tree will be a
substitute for a street tree or a residential use tree, depending on its
location on a lot.
   C.   The roots of a tree must be protected during site development with
barrier fencing extending out at least as far as the drip line of the tree, or
as far as the city forester deems necessary to minimize damage. Any limbs that
might be damaged during construction must be pruned according to the direction
of the city forester.
   D.   No paving or construction will be allowed within the drip line of a
preserved tree.
   E.   Any preserved tree that dies within five (5) years of the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy must be replaced by the same number of trees for which
it substituted.
Table 5E-2: Schedule Of Substitution Values1
 
Diameter Of Existing Tree  (Measured 4 Feet Above Ground   Substitution Value
Level)
   36 inches or more                                   3 required trees
   12 to 35 inches                                     2 required trees
   2 to 12 inches                                      1 required tree
 
Note:
   1.    The substitution value of groupings of 1 or more trees, provided their
preservation as a group is approved by the city forester, will be based on the
caliper measure of the largest tree of the group.
(Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-5E-7: STREET TREE REQUIREMENTS:
The requirements of this section provide for trees along streets to complement
and soften the edges of development, to provide a tree canopy for pedestrians,
and to define and unify the street edge. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
   A.   Street Trees Adjacent To Public Right Of Way:
      1.   On single frontage lots, one large tree is required for every forty
(40) linear feet of frontage or one small tree for every thirty (30) linear
feet of frontage, but not less than one tree per lot.
      2.   On lots with more than one frontage, one tree is required for every
sixty (60) linear feet of frontage.
      3.   Required trees must be located as follows:
         a.   Trees must be planted on private property adjacent to the right
of way, except when subsection A3b or A3c of this section apply. For purposes
of this section, "adjacent" means that large trees must be planted within
fourteen feet (14') of the right of way line and small trees must be planted
within eight feet (8') of the right of way line. All other siting requirements
contained in this article must be observed.
         b.   The number of trees required may be reduced by the number of
qualifying trees that already exist in the right of way or adjacent to the
right of way. To qualify, a tree must meet the requirements of section
14-5E-6, "Preservation Of Existing Trees", of this article.
         c.   Trees that cannot be planted adjacent to the right of way due to
a conflict with any provision of this title must be planted within the right of
way according to the provisions of subsection B, "Street Trees Within Public
Right Of Way", of this section. However, trees that cannot be planted in
conformity with the provisions of said subsection B may be omitted.
   B.   Street Trees Within Public Right Of Way:
      1.   Required street trees are to be planted within the right of way only
in those cases where trees cannot be planted adjacent to the street right of
way in accordance with subsection A of this section.
      2.   Trees planted in the public right of way must meet the following
requirements:
         a.   A tree planting permit must be obtained from the city forester.
         b.   Trees may not be planted in the area between a curb and a
sidewalk if the width of the planting area is less than nine feet (9'), unless
approved by the city forester.
         c.   All other siting requirements contained in section
14-5E-4 of this article must be observed.
         d.   Any tree planted within the street right of way must have a
single trunk, with a minimum of four feet (4') from grade to the first branch,
at the time of planting and must conform to the requirements of title 10,
chapter 8, "Trees And Plant Materials", of this code. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-
2005; amd. Ord. 12-4472, 4-3-2012)
14-5E-8: TREE REQUIREMENTS FOR RESIDENTIAL USES:
   A.   Minimum Requirements:
      1.   For lots containing two-family dwellings, multi-family dwellings, or
group living uses, trees must be planted on site at a minimum ratio of at least
one tree for every five hundred fifty (550) square feet of total building
coverage of the lot. Any combination of small and large trees is allowed,
provided this coverage ratio is met.
      2.   For lease lot developments, trees must be planted at a ratio of one
tree for every lease lot in the development. Any combination of small and large
trees is allowed, provided this coverage ratio is met.
   B.   Reductions And Substitutions:
      1.   Trees planted to meet the requirements of section
14-5E-7, "Street Tree Requirements", of this article, or to meet the tree
requirements for parking areas specified in article A, "Off Street Parking And
Loading Standards", of this chapter, may also be used to fulfill the
requirements of this section.
      2.   Existing trees preserved according to the provisions of section
14-5E-6, "Preservation Of Existing Trees", of this article may be used to
fulfill the requirements of this section. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd. Ord.

ARTICLE F. SCREENING AND BUFFERING STANDARDS
SECTION:
14-5F-1: Purpose
14-5F-2: Applicability
14-5F-3: General Requirements
14-5F-4: Planting Requirements
14-5F-5: Protection And Maintenance
14-5F-6: Screening Standards (S-Series)
14-5F-1: PURPOSE:
The screening and buffering standards are intended to improve the appearance of
Iowa City streetscapes for the benefit of its citizens; to create aesthetically
pleasing and functional living environments; to protect and enhance property
values; and to provide for transitions between dissimilar uses. This article
contains a menu of screening tools collectively referred to as "S-series
standards". These standards are applied in situations where uses, activities,
materials, or equipment must be separated from or screened from view of public
ways, other zones, or adjacent properties. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-5F-2: APPLICABILITY:
The screening and buffering standards will be applied throughout this title,
unless specifically exempted or superseded by more specific provisions of this
title, where they will be referenced with the numbers S1, S2, S3, etc. The
regulations in this article address materials, placement, layout, and timing of
installation. The standards in this article are expressed as minimum standards;
additional landscaping and screening materials may be used as long as they do
not conflict with the provisions of this article. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005;
amd. Ord. 20-4833, 11-17-2020)
14-5F-3: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Permitted Plant Species:
Table 5F-2, located at the end of section
14-5F-6 of this article, lists the various plant species that are allowed to be
used to satisfy screening and buffering requirements. These plants were chosen
because of characteristics, such as hardiness, growth rate, type and density of
foliage, and mature height. Deviations from the listed plants are allowed if
the replacement shrubs are similar in form or hardiness to a permitted variety
and are approved by the city.
   B.   Landscape Plans Required: When provisions of this article are
applicable, a landscaping plan must be submitted with the request for a
building permit, which, in addition to the information normally required, must
indicate the following:
      1.   The size and location of required planting areas.
      2.   The estimated mature height of required plantings, both preserved
and proposed.
      3.   The common and scientific names of any required shrubs, including
any shrubs preserved in lieu of new plantings.
      4.   On the plan, preserved shrubs must be distinguished from new shrubs.
(Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-5F-4: PLANTING REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Plantings Required Prior To Occupancy:
      1.   All plantings required by this article must be installed prior to
occupancy or commencement of a use, except as allowed in subsection A2 of this
section.
      2.   If the plantings cannot be installed prior to occupancy or
commencement of a use due to seasonal conditions that may reduce survivability,
the building official may issue a temporary certificate of occupancy and grant
a delay of installation until the seasonal calendar dates of June 1 or November
1, whichever occurs first, and the property owner must place in an escrow
account, established with the city, an amount which will cover one hundred ten
percent (110%) of the estimated cost of plants and installation.
   B.   Plant Materials Specifications:
      1.   The minimum planting height of shrubs is eighteen (18) to thirty six
inches (36"), depending on species or as noted in the S-series requirements.
      2.   The use of mulch must be confined to the areas around plantings.
Lawn grass or other living ground cover, such as low growing shrubs and/or
creeping plants should be used for exposed areas. Decorative landscaping
gravel, cobbles or small stones may be used as a mulch alternative.
   C.   Planting Area Specifications:
      1.   The minimum width of a planting area will be specified in the base
zone requirements, use regulations, or development standards for the use or
development being screened or buffered. If not specified in any of the above
listed provisions, the minimum width of a planting area is five feet (5').
However, a wider planting area may be needed to accommodate the number and
types of plants proposed and the spacing requirements listed in table 5F-1,
located at the end of this section, and
table 5F-2, located at the end of section
14-5F-6 of this article.
      2.   Screening and buffering requirements will often coincide with
required trees. (See
chapter 5, article E, "Landscaping And Tree Standards", of this title.) In such
a case, the landscaping design and the size and width of the planting area must
accommodate both trees and shrubs.
   D.   Siting Requirements:
      1.   Plantings may not be located in violation of the provisions of
chapter 5, article D, "Intersection Visibility Standards", of this title.
      2.   At the time of planting, trees and plantings must be separated from
other structures and features on a site in order to minimize conflicts as
plants mature. Table 5F-1 below lists the minimum spacing between plants and
between plants and other features and structures on a site. However, the
minimum distances between trees, between trees and shrubs, and between shrubs
may be reduced by twenty five percent (25%) to permit design flexibility or to
create denser screening where desired. Distances are measured to the center of
a tree or the approximate center of individual shrubs.

   1.   The minimum distance between plantings and sidewalks or pavement also
applies to the anticipated location of a future sidewalk or paved surface.
(Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-5F-5: PROTECTION AND MAINTENANCE:
   A.   The provisions of this section apply to all plantings required by this
title, whether newly planted or preserved.
   B.   Required planting areas must be separated from abutting vehicular use
areas, including parking spaces, drives, aisles, alleys, vehicle display and
loading areas, etc., by an unmountable curb or barrier that is a minimum of
five inches (5") in height. The curb or barrier must be constructed in such a
manner that salt water runoff will not damage trees or plantings.
   C.   The property owner must keep all plantings properly maintained, pruned
as needed, and free from trash and litter. It is the responsibility of the
property owner to maintain and replace trees and plantings required by this
title. Required landscaping must be continuously maintained in a healthy
manner. Plants that die must be replaced. Improper maintenance, pruning, or
removal of plantings may be subject to municipal infraction proceedings, up to
and including environmental infraction proceedings.
   D.   Any trees that overhang the public right of way must be maintained in
accordance with the provisions of title 10, chapter 8, "Trees And Plant
Materials", of this code.
   E.   To prevent interference with pedestrian traffic, plantings must be
located appropriately and maintained so that foliage does not grow any closer
than one foot (1') to the edge of a sidewalk or pedestrian trail. This one foot
(1') setback must be maintained for at least the first nine feet (9') of plant
height.
   F.   Maintenance of trees within street rights of way is the responsibility
of the city. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-5F-6: SCREENING STANDARDS (S-SERIES):
The screening and buffering standards listed below will be applied throughout
this title, where they will be referenced with the numbers S1, S2, S3, etc. The
plant varieties listed in
table 5F-2, located at the end of this section, are to be used to satisfy the
requirements of these various standards. Deviations from the listed plants are
allowed if the replacement shrubs are similar in form or hardiness to a
permitted variety and are approved by the city.
   A.   General Buffering, S1:
      1.   Intent: The S1 standard is a basic transitional buffering standard,
where planting areas separate uses from the public right of way, define edges
and separate vehicular use areas from pedestrians, yet allow views to easily
penetrate, as for outdoor sales display lots and for general landscaping on
commercial properties.
      2.   Requirements: A grass lawn must be maintained within the landscaped
area, with groupings of low growing shrubs and ground plants. Approximately
half the landscaping plants must be of an evergreen variety to provide texture
and color throughout the year. Plantings should be arranged to achieve the
desired buffering effect, but there is no established minimum or maximum
height.
      3.   
Figure 5F.1 - General Buffering, S1:

IMAGES/0-0-0-2747.png]
 
   B.   Variable Height Screen, S2:
      1.   Intent: The S2 standard is a buffering treatment that uses distance
and low level screening to separate uses from the public right of way, from
other zones, to define edges and separate vehicular use areas from pedestrians.
The standard is applied where moderate screening is necessary to soften the
impact of uses or paved areas, but where some visibility between areas is more
desirable than a total visual screen.
      2.   Required Materials: The S2 standard requires enough shrubs to form a
landscape screen ranging between two feet (2') and four feet (4') in height. At
least a third of the shrubs must grow to no less than four feet (4') in height.
         a.   Alternative Materials (Option A): Low berms or planters may be
used to elevate shrubs as long as the overall height of the screening ranges
from two feet (2') to four feet (4'). At least one-third (1/3) of the shrubs
must grow to no less than four feet (4') in height.
         b.   Alternative Materials (Option B): A continuous or semicontinuous
two (2) to three foot (3') high masonry wall. Breaks in the wall are permitted
for sidewalk access and to accommodate required street trees. One shrub per ten
(10) linear feet of wall, on average, is required. Shrubs may be grouped, but
long stretches without any shrubs should be avoided. At least one-third (1/3)
of the shrubs must grow to no less than four feet (4') in height.
      3.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2749.png]
 
   C.   High Screen, S3:
      1.   Intent: The S3 standard is a buffering treatment that uses dense
landscape screening to provide a visual and physical separation between uses
and zones. It is commonly applied between residential uses and commercial and
industrial uses and to screen outdoor work or storage areas.
      2.   Required Materials: Enough shrubs and small evergreens to form a
continuous screen or hedge at least five feet (5') to six feet (6') in height
and more than fifty percent (50%) solid year round. Screening materials must be
at least three feet (3') high when planted. At least one-half (1/2) the shrubs
must be evergreen varieties.
         a.   Alternative Materials (Option A): A berm may be used in
conjunction with a hedge to achieve an overall height of six feet (6').
         b.   Alternative Materials (Option B): A continuous or semicontinuous
five (5) to six foot (6') high masonry wall or solid fence. Breaks in the wall
or fence are permitted for access and to accommodate required street trees. One
shrub per ten (10) linear feet of wall, on average, is required. Shrubs may be
grouped, but long stretches without any shrubs should be avoided. At least one-
third (1/3) of the shrubs must grow to no less than five feet (5') in height.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2751.png]
 
   D.   Open Pattern Fence Or Wall, S4:
      1.   Intent: The S4 standard provides a tall, semiopaque visual
separation. The standard is applied where separation is required, but where
visibility between areas is more desirable than a total visual screen. This
standard provides for instances where security may be an issue and where
landscaping is not a practical option.
      2.   Required Materials: A four (4) to six foot (6') high fence of fifty
percent (50%) or greater opacity constructed of wood, brick, metal, masonry or
other permanent materials.
   E.   Opaque Fence Or Wall, S5:
      1.   Intent: The S5 standard provides a complete visual separation. The
standard is applied in instances where complete screening is needed to protect
abutting uses. This standard provides for instances where security may be an
issue and where landscaping is not a practical option.
      2.   Required Materials: A four (4) to eight foot (8') high fence,
completely opaque, constructed of wood, brick, metal, masonry or other
permanent materials. When used for dumpster or utility enclosures, the material
must match the primary building material or be complementary to it. The height
of the fence or wall will be determined based on the activity, materials, or
equipment being screened. In general, the fence or wall should be of sufficient
height to screen the activity, materials, or equipment from public view.

ARTICLE G. OUTDOOR LIGHTING STANDARDS
SECTION:
14-5G-1: Purpose
14-5G-2: Applicability
14-5G-3: Standards For Single-Family And Two-Family Uses
14-5G-4: Physical Controls
14-5G-5: Total Outdoor Light Output Standards
14-5G-6: Prohibited Lighting And Bulbs
14-5G-7: Exemptions For Special Uses
14-5G-8: Measurement
14-5G-1: PURPOSE:
The outdoor lighting standards are intended to reduce the obtrusive aspects of
outdoor light usage while preserving safety, security, and the nighttime use
and enjoyment of property. These measures will encourage lighting practices
that direct appropriate amounts of light where and when it is needed and
decrease glare resulting from overlighting and poorly shielded or
inappropriately directed lighting fixtures. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-5G-2: APPLICABILITY:
   A.   Application Of Provisions: The standards contained in this article
apply to all uses in all zones, except for the exemptions listed in subsection
B of this section, or unless specifically exempted or superseded by more
specific provisions of this title.
   B.   Exemptions:
      1.   Single-family uses, two-family uses, and group households located
within single-family or two-family dwellings are exempt from all provisions of
this article, except for the provisions contained in section
14-5G-3 of this article.
      2.   Airport lighting for navigational purposes is exempt from the
provisions of this article.
      3.   FAA required lighting on towers and buildings is exempt from the
provisions of this article.
      4.   The temporary use of lighting for public festivals and celebrations
and for temporary commercial activities such as carnivals and fairs may be
exempted from the provisions of this article if the building official
determines, through the temporary use permitting process, that the proposed
lighting will not create a hazard or nuisance from glare, light trespass, or
overlighting.
      5.   Lighting for outdoor recreational facilities that are accessory to
community service uses, colleges and university uses, educational facility
uses, parks and open space uses, and religious/private group assembly uses may
be exempted from the minimum standards or exceed the maximum standards of this
article; provided, that the provisions specified in section
14-5G-7, "Exemptions For Special Uses", of this article are met.
      6.   Lighting for outdoor display lots accessory to outdoor storage and
display oriented retail uses may exceed the total outdoor light output
standards specified in section
14-5G-5 of this article; provided, that the provisions specified in section
14-5G-7, "Exemptions For Special Uses", of this article are met. (Ord. 05-4186,
12-15-2005; amd. Ord. 20-4833, 11-17-2020)
14-5G-3: STANDARDS FOR SINGLE-FAMILY AND TWO-FAMILY USES:
The regulations of this section apply to all single-family uses, two-family
uses, and any group household that is located within a single-family or two-
family dwelling.
   A.   Height And Glare Control:
      1.   Light fixtures must be mounted no higher than fifteen feet (15')
above grade.
      2.   All bulbs that exceed two thousand (2,000) lumens must be fully
shielded as installed.
      3.   Bulbs used for floodlights must not exceed two thousand (2,000)
lumens.
   B.   Light Trespass Standards:
      1.   Any floodlights that are visible from any neighboring residential
property must be aimed downward at an angle no higher than forty five degrees
(45°) from vertical.
      2.   Light fixtures used to illuminate flags, statues, or objects mounted
on a pole or pedestal must use a narrow cone of light that does not extend
beyond the illuminated object. Lights that are intended to architecturally
highlight a building or its features must use a limited pattern of light that
does not extend beyond the wall of the building. Bulbs must be shielded from
view of abutting properties and the public right of way.
   C.   Lighting For Private Recreational Facilities: All floodlights used to
illuminate outdoor private recreational facilities, such as swimming pools,
tennis courts, and basketball courts, must be turned off by ten o'clock (10:00)
P.M. Underwater lighting in swimming pools and hot tubs are exempt from this
provision.
   D.   Prohibited Lighting: Laser lights, searchlights, mercury vapor bulbs,
and any other type of lamp capable of producing comparable levels of
ultraviolet radiation per watt are prohibited. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-5G-4: PHYSICAL CONTROLS:
   A.   Height Limitations:
      1.   Light fixtures located within three hundred feet (300') of a
residential zone, Neighborhood Form-Based Zone, riverfront crossings zone, or
the eastside mixed use district must be mounted no higher than twenty five feet
(25') above grade.
      2.   Light fixtures located farther than three hundred feet (300') from a
residential zone, Neighborhood Form-Based Zone, riverfront crossings zone, or
the eastside mixed use district must be mounted no higher than thirty five feet
(35') above grade.
   B.   Glare Control:
      1.   All bulbs that exceed two thousand (2000) lumens must be fully
shielded as installed.
      2.   Unshielded or partially shielded bulbs that are two thousand (2000)
lumens or less must be frosted glass or be installed behind a translucent
cover.
      3.   All under canopy lights or lights mounted in eaves must either be
recessed into the canopy/eave and fully shielded or use flat lenses instead of
drop lenses.
      4.   The city may permit the use of light reflectors, refractors or house
shields as a substitute for fully shielded light fixtures on lower wattage or
low voltage ornamental or pedestrian light fixtures. The shielding on such
fixtures must control for uplighting. These substitute shielding options are
not permitted for general illumination of large areas, such as parking,
service, or outdoor product display areas. Fixtures used to illuminate such
areas must be fully shielded.
   C.   Light Trespass: The trespass standards are intended to prevent light
from one property extending beyond the property line onto adjacent properties.
Compliance with this subsection is achieved with fixture shielding, directional
control designed into the fixture, fixture location, fixture height, fixture
aim, or a combination of these methods.
      1.   Except for lighting of loading areas, service areas, and for
architectural emphasis, floodlighting is prohibited. Floodlights are not
permitted for the illumination of parking or outdoor product display areas.
      2.   Floodlights, when permitted, are exempt from subsection B2 of this
section, but must be aimed no higher than forty five degrees (45°) from
vertical. Floodlights must also comply with subsections C3, C4 and C5 of this
section.
      3.   Lighting fixtures must be located and shielded such that the bulb is
not directly visible from any adjacent residential use or public right of way.
The right of way trespass standard does not apply in the CB-2, CB-5, or CB-10
zones.
      4.   Illumination must not exceed 0.5 initial horizontal foot-candle and
2.0 initial maximum foot-candles as measured at any point along a property
boundary that is adjacent to or across the street from properties that are
zoned residential, CN-1, or CO-1, or is adjacent to or across the street from a
Neighborhood Form-Based Zone. The city may increase the maximum up to 1.0
horizontal foot-candle for building code required lighting on buildings located
on or close to the property line. However, lighting must be located and
shielded in a manner that will be least obtrusive to any abutting residential
properties.
      5.   On any property containing multi-family uses or group living uses,
lighting fixtures must be located and shielded such that the bulbs are not
visible from any residential window on the property.
      6.   Light fixtures used to illuminate flags, statues, or objects mounted
on a pole or pedestal must use a narrow cone of light that does not extend
beyond the illuminated object. Lights that are intended to architecturally
highlight a building or its features must use a limited pattern of light that
does not extend beyond the wall of the building. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005;
amd. Ord. 06-4245, 12-12-2006; Ord. 16-4675, 9-20-2016; Ord. 21-4866, 11-16-
2021)
14-5G-5: TOTAL OUTDOOR LIGHT OUTPUT STANDARDS:
   A.   Maximum Outdoor Light Output:
      1.   Total Outdoor Light Output Defined: The "total outdoor light output"
on a property is the total amount of light, measured in initial lumens, from
all bulbs used in outdoor light fixtures. It includes all lights and luminous
tubing used for display lighting, general illumination, architectural/accent
lighting, and lights used for external illumination of signs, but does not
include lights used to illuminate internally illuminated signs or luminous
tubing used in neon signs. For bulb types that vary in their output as they
age, such as high pressure sodium, fluorescent and metal halide, the initial
lumen output, as defined by the manufacturer, is the value to be considered
when calculating total outdoor light output.
      2.   Applicability: The total outdoor light output on any property that
is subject to the provisions of this article may not exceed the limits in
table 5G-1 of this section, except for those that are exempted in subsection A3
of this section and in section
14-5G-7 of this article. The values in this table are upper limits and not
design goals; design goals should be the lowest light levels that meet the
requirements of the task.
      3.   Exemptions:
         a.   Seasonal decorations, permitted between Thanksgiving and the end
of January, are not counted toward the total outdoor light output.
         b.   In the E2 and E3 districts, properties where the building
coverage is eighty percent (80%) or greater are exempt from the maximum total
outdoor light output standard, but are subject to the limitation on unshielded
fixtures, as stated in
table 5G-1 of this section.
   B.   Lighting Environment Districts: All zones, except public (P) zones, are
grouped into three (3) lighting environment districts that control lighting
output on applicable lots in each zone. Uses, for which the lighting standards
are applicable, located within the public (P) zone must comply with the
lighting requirements of the adjacent zone; those on the border between two (2)
or more zones must comply with the standards of the strictest adjacent zone.
Zones are grouped into the lighting environment districts as follows:
      1.   Low illumination district, E1: Areas of low ambient lighting levels.
This district includes single-family and low density multi-family residential
zones. This district applies to the following zones: ID-RS, ID-RM, RR-1, RS-5,
RS-8, RS-12, RM-12, RNS-12, T3NE, T3NG, T4NS, and T4NM.
      2.   Medium illumination district, E2: Areas of medium ambient lighting
levels. This district includes higher density multi-family zones and lower
intensity commercial and office zones. This district applies to the following
zones: ID-C, ID-I, ID-RP, CN-1, CO-1, PRM, RM-20, RM-44, RNS-20, MU, T4MS, EMU,
and all RFC zones, except the RFC-WR.
      3.   High illumination district, E3: Areas of high ambient lighting
levels. This district includes higher intensity commercial, industrial, and
research zones. This district applies to the following zones: CC-2, CH-1, CI-1,
CB-2, CB-5, CB-10, I-1, I-2, RDP, ORP, and the RFC-WR.
   C.   Measuring Total Outdoor Light Output:
      1.   The maximums in
table 5G-1 of this section are based on a calculation of initial lumens per net
acre. The lot size less the total building coverage of the lot determines the
number of net acres used for this calculation.
      2.   Lumen output from an under canopy or under eave light fixture
mounted fifteen (15) or more feet from any edge of the eave or canopy will be
measured at 0.5 its full value.

zoned residential.
      3.   Laser lights, searchlights, and mercury vapor bulbs are prohibited.
      4.   Use of such lighting is restricted to those hours when the
recreational facility is in use. Lighting for recreational facilities must be
turned off by one hour after conclusion of the recreational activity. For
facilities located in or adjacent to residential zones, the curfew for
recreational facility lighting is eleven o'clock (11:00) P.M. Illumination of
such facilities shall be permitted after eleven o'clock (11:00) P.M. only to
conclude a scheduled event that was unable to conclude before the curfew due to
unusual circumstances.
   B.   Outdoor Display Lots: Lighting for outdoor display lots that are
accessory to outdoor storage and display oriented uses may exceed the total
outdoor light output standards specified in section
14-5G-5 of this article; provided, that the following specific approval
criteria are met. To apply for this exemption, a lighting plan must be
submitted to the city and must be certified as conforming to the standards
listed below by a registered engineer with LC status according to the NCQLP.
      1.   The display lot must be designed to achieve no greater than the

storage tanks, when allowed, must be located no closer to a lot line or any
principal building than is permitted by the international fire code, as
amended. However, for aboveground storage tanks of two hundred seventy six
(276) gallons' capacity or more, the minimum distance between such aboveground
tanks and any residential zone boundary must be at least one hundred feet
(100'). If the aboveground tank is located in an approved vault, the minimum
separation distance from a residential zone boundary may be reduced to no less
than fifty feet (50').
   C.   The underground bulk storage of flammable liquids, when allowed, must
be located in accordance with the international fire code, as amended. However,
the minimum distance between such underground tanks and any residential zone
boundary must be at least ten feet (10').
   D.   The bulk storage of flammable cryogenic fluids in stationary containers
is prohibited in all zones, except in the CI-1, I-1, I-2, RDP, and ORP zones.
In these listed zones, storage of such fluids may be allowed, but only as
specified and strictly regulated by the international fire code, as amended.
   E.   The bulk storage of class I and class II liquids in aboveground tanks
is prohibited in all zones, except in the CI-1, I-1, I-2, RDP, and ORP zones.
In these listed zones, the storage of such liquids may be permitted, but only
as specified and strictly regulated by the international fire code, as amended.
   F.   The bulk storage of liquefied petroleum gas is prohibited in all zones,
except the CI-1, I-1, I-2, RDP, and ORP zones. In these listed zones, the
storage of liquefied petroleum gas may be allowed, but only as specified and
strictly regulated by the international fire code, as amended. (Ord. 05-4186,

14-5I-2: APPLICABILITY:
   A.   Application Required: Unless specifically exempted as specified below,
an application for sensitive areas review must be submitted to and approved by
the city prior to woodland clearing, grading or any development activity on
tracts of land or portions of tracts of land where any regulated sensitive
features specified in subsection B of this section exist. This application
process may occur as part of site plan review, a planned development overlay
rezoning and/or subdivision review.
   B.   Regulated Sensitive Features: Properties containing any of the
following environmentally sensitive features are subject to the regulations of
this article. References to "regulated" sensitive features, such as "regulated
wetlands", "regulated slopes", etc., within the text of this article are
references to the regulated features as listed below. The sensitive areas
inventory map - phase I may be used as a tool to determine the locations of
potential environmentally sensitive areas. However, it is the applicant's
responsibility to investigate and fully delineate such potential sensitive
areas in order to determine whether the sensitive area or feature is subject to
the regulations of this article.
      1.   Jurisdictional Wetlands: Jurisdictional wetlands as regulated by the
U.S. army corps of engineers, or its successor. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
      2.   Stream Corridors:
         a.   Floodways designated on either the current federal emergency
management agency flood boundary and floodway maps for Iowa City and Johnson
County or the Iowa City (1 inch = 100 feet scale) flood boundary and floodway
maps.
         b.   A watercourse, such as a river, stream or drainageway, which is
shown in blue (the blue line) on the most current U.S. geological survey
quadrangle maps. In cases where no floodway is delineated, the blue line will
serve as the centerline within a thirty foot (30') wide stream corridor. If a
watercourse is designated a blue line stream, but does not have a bed and bank
defined by an "ordinary high water mark", as defined in
chapter 9, article E, "Sensitive Lands Definitions", of this title, and a
definite direction of flow, either continuously or intermittently, then said
watercourse will not be considered a regulated stream corridor, provided the
absence of these defining characteristics is verified in the field by a
qualified professional (see section
14-5I-7, "Stream Corridors", of this article for more information). (Ord. 10-
4398, 7-12-2010)
      3.   Regulated Slopes: Slopes of eighteen percent (18%) or greater.
      4.   Wooded Areas:
         a.   Woodlands, two (2) acres in size or greater.
         b.   "Groves of trees", as defined in this title.
      5.   Fully Hydric Soils: Fully hydric soils as designated in the USDA
soil conservation service soil survey of Johnson County, Iowa, as amended.
      6.   Prairie Remnants: Prairie remnants as shown on the Iowa City
sensitive areas inventory map - phase I, as amended.
      7.   Archaeological Sites: Archaeological sites as determined by the
state historic preservation officer or the state archeologist.
   C.   Exemptions: The following uses, activities, and structures are exempt
from the requirements of this article. However, an applicant must first apply
for and obtain an exemption, prior to any woodland clearing, grading or
development activity on a property.
      1.   Emergency/Public Safety: Grading, clearing, removal or other
activities required for emergency situations involving immediate danger to
life, health and safety, or which create an immediate threat to person or
property or create substantial fire hazards are exempt from the requirements of
this article.
      2.   Maintenance/Expansion Of Single-Family Or Two-Family Residential
Uses: Normal maintenance, expansion, exterior remodeling, reconstruction or
replacement of single-family or two-family uses in existence as of December 13,
1995, are exempt from the requirements of this article, provided the new
construction or related activity will not increase the footprint of the
structure and/or paving lying within the sensitive area by more than a
cumulative total of one thousand (1,000) square feet, and also provided there
is no encroachment by said activities, including grading, into a jurisdictional
wetland, a designated sensitive areas conservation tract or protected sensitive
area.
      3.   Construction Of Single-Family Or Two-Family Residential Uses:
Grading, clearing or development activities on a tract of land for the purpose
of construction, landscaping or associated improvements for one single-family
use or one two-family use are exempt from the requirements of this article,
provided the development activities do not exceed a maximum total of twenty
thousand (20,000) square feet in area, and provided there is no encroachment by
said activities into a jurisdictional wetland, a designated sensitive areas
conservation tract or protected sensitive area.
      4.   Groundwater Monitoring Wells And Stormwater Facilities: Normal and
routine maintenance of existing drainage and stormwater management facilities
are exempt from the requirements of this article. This exemption includes
vegetative maintenance for access and stormwater/flood control purposes within
and adjacent to drainageways. Except for temporary storage outside a wetland or
water body, placement of fill or dredge spoils is not exempt under this
subsection C4. Groundwater monitoring wells, when constructed to standards
approved by the city, are exempt.
      5.   Woodland Management Activities: Practices associated with "timber
management standards" as defined by the International Society Of Arboriculture,
or its successor, are exempt from the requirements of this article. Existing
tree farming operations, such as Christmas tree farming, fruit or nut tree
production and tree nurseries, during such time as the land is used for tree
farming operations, are exempt from the requirements of this article.
   D.   Uses, Activities And Structures Allowed Within Protected Sensitive
Areas: The following uses, activities, and structures are allowed within
protected sensitive areas and required buffers where it can be shown that such
a use, activity, or structure will not be detrimental to the functioning of
sensitive areas or associated buffers, or pose a public safety hazard, subject
to city approval, during the applicable sensitive areas review process:
      1.   Parkland, private open space, and trails that provide opportunities
for environmental interpretation and are designed to incorporate features that
protect areas of wildlife habitat, water quality and the natural amenities in
protected sensitive areas and buffers.
      2.   Stream crossings, such as bridges, roads and culverts, or stream
bank stabilization measures, provided they are designed to minimize any
reduction of the flood carrying capacity of the stream caused by such
structures and are in compliance with all federal and state regulations.
      3.   Essential public utilities such as storm and sanitary sewers; water
mains; gas, telephone and power lines; and storm water detention facilities are
permitted if they are designed and constructed to minimize their impact upon
the protected sensitive areas and associated buffers. The design and
construction of utilities should also include measures to protect against
erosion, pollution and habitat disturbance, and result in minimal amounts of
excavation and filling. Upon completion of the installation of the public
facility or line, the sensitive protected areas and associated buffers shall be
restored by those persons responsible for the disturbance. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-
15-2005)
14-5I-3: LEVELS OF SENSITIVE AREAS REVIEW:
   A.   Level I Sensitive Areas Review:
      1.   Except for exempted activities as listed in subsection
14-5I-2C of this article, a level I sensitive areas review is required prior to
development activity on property that contains any regulated sensitive feature
listed in section
14-5I-2 of this article, but for which a level II sensitive areas review is not
required.
      2.   A sensitive areas development plan submitted with the application
for a level I sensitive areas review must delineate any regulated sensitive
areas and associated buffers according to the specific regulations contained in
sections
14-5I-6 through
14-5I-12 of this article and will be approved according to the procedures for a
level I sensitive areas review as set forth in
chapter 8, article B, "Administrative Approval Procedures", of this title.
   B.   Level II Sensitive Areas Review:
      1.   Except for exempted activities listed in subsection
14-5I-2C of this article, a level II sensitive areas review is required prior
to development on properties for which any of the following activities are
proposed:
         a.   The disturbance of a wetland or an associated buffer.
         b.   The removal of portions of a woodland in excess of the woodland
retention requirements contained in section
14-5I-9, "Wooded Areas", of this article.
         c.   The disturbance of more than thirty five percent (35%) of the
critical slopes on a property.
         d.   Disturbance of a protected slope buffer or an altered protected
slope.
         e.   Any development that contains regulated sensitive features and
for which modifications to the underlying zoning or subdivision regulations are
requested.
      2.   The submittal of a sensitive areas development plan is required for
properties containing regulated sensitive areas for which a level II sensitive
areas review is required. Such sensitive areas development plan must delineate
regulated sensitive areas and associated buffers according to the specific
regulations contained in sections
14-5I-6 through
14-5I-12 of this article.
      3.   A level II sensitive areas review is considered a type of planned
development and as such, must comply with the applicable approval criteria set
forth in
chapter 3, article A, "Planned Development Overlay Zone (OPD)", of this title
and will be reviewed according to the approval procedures for a planned
development overlay rezoning as set forth in
chapter 8, article D, "Planning And Zoning Commission Approval Procedures", of
this title.
      4.   If a level II sensitive areas review is required, according to this
subsection, and other regulated sensitive features exist on the property, the
planned development rezoning application must include all evidence and required
information for all regulated sensitive features on the property. (Ord. 05-
4186, 12-15-2005)
14-5I-4: MODIFICATIONS TO ZONING AND SUBDIVISION REQUIREMENTS:
Through the planned development process, certain specified modifications to the
underlying zoning and subdivision standards are allowed to provide for
flexibility in the design of a site. On sites that contain sensitive features,
the planned development process may be used in order to cluster development
away from sensitive features. The types of zoning and subdivision modifications
allowed and the associated site development standards are listed in
chapter 3, article A, "Planned Development Overlay Zone (OPD)", of this title.
If modifications to the underlying zoning or subdivision standards are
requested, a level II sensitive areas review is required, regardless of the
nature of the sensitive features on the site. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-5I-5: COMPLIANCE MEASURES:
   A.   Compliance With Approved Plans Required: Approval of a sensitive areas
development plan is authorization to proceed with development activity
according to the provisions and restrictions set forth in said plan and
associated legal papers, including, but not limited to, compliance with all
construction area limits, conservation easements, and specified construction
practices. Any development activity at variance with the approved plan and/or
associated legal papers shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and
subject to any enforcement action and penalties allowed according to chapter 7,
article C, "Penalties And Enforcement", of this title.
   B.   Recording Requirement: Approved sensitive areas development plans shall
be recorded in the Johnson County recorder's office prior to issuance of any
certificate of occupancy for the property. The recording is intended to provide
notice to subsequent property owners that environmental limitations apply to
the subject property.
   C.   Performance Guarantee: A performance guarantee may be required to
ensure completion of conservation measures, including plantings and other
mitigation or maintenance efforts, as stipulated in this article. Required
performance guarantees must be submitted according to the procedures for
performance guarantees as set forth in title 18, "Site Plan Review", of this
code. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-5I-6: JURISDICTIONAL WETLANDS:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of regulating development in and around wetlands
is to:
      1.   Preserve the unique and valuable attributes of wetlands as areas
where storm water is naturally retained, thereby controlling the rate of
runoff, improving water quality, recharging ground water resources, providing
erosion control and lessening the effects of flooding;
      2.   Promote the preservation of habitat for plants, fish, reptiles,
amphibians or other wildlife;
      3.   Minimize the impact of development activity on wetland areas;
      4.   Provide a greater degree of protection for many wetland areas above
and beyond that provided by the federal and state government; and
      5.   Minimize the long term environmental impact associated with the loss
of wetlands.
   B.   Wetland Regulation By Other Agencies: The approval of a sensitive areas
development plan under the provisions of this article is in addition to the
applicant's need to obtain permits required by other local, state, or federal
agencies, and does not alter the applicant's obligation to satisfy and obtain
all other applicable local, state or federal regulations and permits.
   C.   Wetland Mitigation Plan Required:
      1.   A sensitive areas development plan for property containing a
regulated wetland shall include a wetland mitigation plan demonstrating that
all regulations of this section will be met. Avoiding a delineated wetland area
and minimizing the impact of development on a wetland is strongly encouraged,
and must be investigated before compensatory mitigation will be considered.
      2.   A wetland mitigation plan shall include the following information:
         a.   The boundaries of the delineated wetland and the required natural
buffer area.
         b.   Delineation of a construction area limit and specification of
associated restrictions thereof.
         c.   The type and location of erosion control measures to be placed on
the property prior to any other development activity occurring on the site.
         d.   Certification by a wetland specialist or the U.S. army corps of
engineers, or its successor, regarding the wetland delineation, if required.
         e.   Information regarding the characteristics of the wetland
necessary to determine the allowable buffer reduction as provided in subsection
E, "Wetland Buffer Requirements", of this section if a reduction is requested.
         f.   A storm water management plan demonstrating compliance with the
requirements of the Iowa City storm water regulations and related municipal
design standards.
   D.   Wetland Delineation:
      1.   Prior to any development activity occurring on a site containing a
potential regulated wetland, the property owner must provide a delineation of
the wetland area. Determination of jurisdictional wetlands must be made either
by the U.S. army corps of engineers, or its successor, or by a wetland
specialist. If completed by a wetland specialist, the wetland delineation must
be reviewed and accepted by the U.S. army corps, or its successor. Delineation
of wetland areas must be completed prior to the submittal of a sensitive areas
development plan for review.
      2.   If the property owner certifies that no development activity will
occur within one hundred fifty feet (150') of the apparent edge of a suspected
or potential wetland area on the site, the requirement for delineation by a
wetland specialist or the corps may be waived by the city. In the case of a
waiver, the property owner shall grant an easement running in favor of the
city, an approved conservation group, or other approved organization for the
purpose of retaining the wetland and the surrounding one hundred fifty foot
(150') protection area as undeveloped natural open space.
   E.   Wetland Buffer Requirements:
      1.   An undisturbed, one hundred foot (100') natural buffer shall be
maintained between any development activity and a regulated wetland unless said
development activity is exempted pursuant to subsection
14-5I-2C, "Exemptions", of this article. The required setbacks established for
the base zone shall be measured from the buffer edge, and are in addition to
the required buffer. This setback requirement applies to parking lots as well.
(For example, the RS-5 district requires a 20 foot rear setback, which would be
measured from the outside edge of the required 100 foot buffer. As a result, no
building or parking lot could be located within 120 feet of the wetland.)
      2.   Buffer averaging may be permitted or required where an increased
buffer is deemed necessary or desirable to provide additional protection to one
area of a wetland for aesthetic or environmental reasons. In this situation,
the width of the required buffer around other areas of the wetland may be
reduced by up to fifty percent (50%), but the area of the provided buffer must
be equal to or greater than the total area of the required buffer. Any request
for buffer averaging requires a level II sensitive areas review. Buffers that
have been reduced according to the provisions of subsection E3 of this section
may not be averaged.
      3.   The applicant may request a reduction of the required natural buffer
in certain instances enumerated below. Any request for a reduction in the
natural wetlands buffer requires a level II sensitive areas review. Buffers
that have been averaged according to the provisions of subsection E2 of this
section may not be reduced.
         a.   The required natural buffer may be reduced by up to fifty feet
(50') if it can be demonstrated by a wetland specialist that the wetland:
            (1)   Is less than five (5) acres in area; and
            (2)   Does not contain species listed by the federal or state
government as endangered or threatened, or critical or outstanding natural
habitat for those species; and
            (3)   Does not contain diverse plant associations of infrequent
occurrence or of regional significance; and
            (4)   Is not located within a regulated stream corridor.
         b.   The required natural buffer may be reduced by up to seventy five
feet (75') if it can be demonstrated by a wetland specialist that the wetland:
            (1)   Satisfies the criteria for natural buffer reduction in
subsection E3a of this section; and
            (2)   Does not, in a year of average precipitation, contain
standing water at any time during the calendar year; and
            (3)   Is not a forested wetland; and
            (4)   Does not provide a known habitat for migratory birds of local
or regional significance.
         c.   In addition to the qualifying criteria listed above, the city
shall consider the following factors in determining whether or not to reduce
the required buffer:
            (1)   The proposed land use of the property and its potential
impact on the wetland; and
            (2)   The design and layout of the proposed development in relation
to the wetland; and
            (3)   The physical characteristics of the site and the wetland; and
            (4)   Any other factor related to the short or long term
environmental stability and health of the wetland.
   F.   Design Standards:
      1.   No grading, dredging, clearing, filling, draining, or other
development activity is allowed within a regulated wetland or required buffer
area, unless said activity is part of an approved wetland mitigation plan or is
a use, activity or structure allowed according to subsection
14-5I-2D, "Uses, Activities And Structures Allowed Within Protected Sensitive
Areas", of this article.
      2.   For property not served by a city sanitary sewer system, the
location of septic tanks, soil absorption systems, holding tanks, or any other
element of an on site sewage disposal system must meet the required setbacks
specified in the base zone, as measured from the buffer edge.
      3.   To mitigate negative impacts of development and limit sedimentation,
the direct discharge of untreated surface water from a development site or a
developed area into a wetland may be prohibited. The partial treatment of storm
water runoff through the use or combined use of constructed wetlands, detention
basins, vegetative filter strips, sediment traps or other means before the
storm water runoff reaches a wetland may be considered as part of a wetland
mitigation plan. In such case, the discharge should not increase the rate of
flow or decrease the water quality of the wetlands unless it can be shown by a
wetland specialist that an increase in the rate of flow will enhance rather
than adversely impact the wetland.
      4.   On any lot containing a regulated wetland, erosion control measures,
whether required under title 17, chapter 8, "Grading Ordinance", of this code,
or as part of a wetland mitigation plan approved under the provisions of this
article, must be installed prior to any development activity occurring on the
site.
      5.   The planting of foreign or invasive species, including intrusive
native varieties, in regulated wetland or buffer areas is prohibited. Only
nonintrusive native species shall be used to supplement existing vegetation.
      6.   The removal of foreign or invasive species, including intrusive
native varieties, within a regulated wetland or buffer area may be permitted
when approved as part of an approved wetland mitigation plan.
      7.   Where it is determined that the area occupied by the required buffer
provides little natural protection to the wetland due to previous land
disturbance, enhanced vegetative cover must be provided within the buffer area
to help filter and slow the flow of surface water. The enhanced vegetation
shall consist of species that are known to be noninvasive to wetland areas.
   G.   Compensatory Mitigation: Compensatory mitigation may be permitted only
if it is clearly demonstrated that avoiding and minimizing the impact on a
wetland is unreasonable. A permit for any development activity within a wetland
area is required by the U.S. army corps of engineers or its successor. If a
permit is granted for development activity within a wetland, compensatory
mitigation shall be required based on the following criteria, unless a greater
degree of compensation is required by the corps or its successor:
      1.   Wetlands containing the following characteristics shall be
considered protected, "no build" wetland areas. Compensatory mitigation will be
considered only if the wetland disturbance is relatively small in relation to
the overall wetland and if it can be shown that the disturbance will not have
an adverse impact on the overall wetland. In wetlands with the following
characteristics, if compensatory mitigation is permitted, the required
replacement ratio of comparable habitat replaced to habitat lost shall be at
least three to one (3:1):
         a.   Wetlands containing species listed by the federal or state
government as endangered or threatened, or containing critical or outstanding
natural habitat for those species; or
         b.   Wetlands containing the presence of diverse plant associations of
infrequent occurrence or of regional importance; or
         c.   Wetlands located within regulated stream corridors as defined in
this article.
      2.   The replacement ratio of comparable habitat replaced to habitat lost
shall be at least two to one (2:1) for wetlands not containing the
characteristics listed in subsection G1 of this section, but which do contain
the following characteristics:
         a.   Standing water throughout the calendar year under average
precipitation;
         b.   Forested wetlands; or
         c.   Wetlands providing a known habitat for migratory birds of
regional or local significance.
      3.   Compensatory mitigation for all other regulated wetlands shall be at
a ratio of at least one to one (1:1). If said wetland or the replacement
habitat is enhanced so that it contains one or more of the defining
characteristics listed in subsection G1 or G2 of this section, the required
replacement ratio may be reduced to 0.5:1.
      4.   When compensatory mitigation is proposed, the wetland mitigation
plan described in this section must be prepared by a wetland specialist. A
wetland mitigation plan that includes compensatory mitigation must include the
following components:
         a.   An assessment of the value of the wetland being replaced to
determine the appropriate replacement ratio;
         b.   A clear statement of the goals of the mitigation plan, including
specific statements regarding the expected rate of establishment of a
vegetative cover over specified periods of time;
         c.   Analysis of the soils, substrate and hydrology of the proposed
site of the constructed or expanded wetland in terms of their suitability to
provide a proper growing medium for the proposed vegetation;
         d.   A list of the plant species to be used, which should include only
native, noninvasive species, and their proposed locations. Transplanting as
much of the native vegetation from the original wetland as possible, as well as
the upper six (6) to twelve inches (12") of the soil is encouraged; and
         e.   Provisions for monitoring the condition of the new or enhanced
wetland area for a period of five (5) years, and identification of the party
responsible for replanting in the event of poor initial growth or predation
resulting in a failure of over thirty percent (30%) of the planted stock.
Information collected during the monitoring process must be submitted to the
city annually and include the following:
            (1)   Data on plant species diversity and the extent of plant cover
established in the new or enhanced wetland;
            (2)   Wildlife presence;
            (3)   Data on water regimes, water chemistry, soil conditions and
ground and surface water interactions; and
            (4)   Proposed alterations or corrective measures to address
deficiencies identified in the created or enhanced wetland, such as a failure
to establish a vegetative cover or the presence of invasive or foreign species.
(Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-5I-7: STREAM CORRIDORS:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of regulating development in and around stream
corridors is to:
      1.   Preserve the value of stream corridors in providing floodwater
conveyance and storage;
      2.   Promote filtration of storm water runoff;
      3.   Reduce stream bank erosion; and
      4.   Protect and enhance wildlife habitat.
   B.   Stream Corridor Regulation By Other Agencies: The approval of a
sensitive areas development plan shall be in addition to the applicant's need
to obtain permits required by other local, state or federal agencies, and does
not alter the applicant's obligation to satisfy and obtain all other applicable
local, state or federal regulations and permits.
   C.   Environmental Review Required: A sensitive areas development plan for
property containing a regulated stream corridor must include evidence
demonstrating that all regulations of this section will be met. Such plan must
include the following information: (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
      1.   A delineation of the stream corridor and the required natural buffer
area is required. If, in the course of delineating a blue line stream, it is
determined through field verification by a qualified professional, such as a
geologist, hydrologist, or wetland specialist, that the blue line or a portion
of a blue line on the current U.S. geological survey quadrangle maps does not
represent a watercourse with a bed and bank defined by an "ordinary high water
mark", as defined herein, and a definite direction of flow, either continuously
or intermittently, then said watercourse or portion of a watercourse will not
be considered a regulated stream corridor for purposes of this title. In such
an event, a report prepared by said qualified professional must be submitted to
the city that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the city that the subject
watercourse does not have the aforementioned defining characteristics of a
stream corridor. (Ord. 10-4398, 7-12-2010)
      2.   Delineation of a construction area limit and specification of
associated restrictions thereof.
      3.   Information regarding the characteristics of the stream corridor
necessary to determine the allowable buffer reduction as provided in subsection
D, "Stream Corridor Buffer Requirements", of this section if a reduction is
requested.
   D.   Stream Corridor Buffer Requirements:
      1.   Unless exempt pursuant to subsection
14-5I-2C, "Exemptions", of this article, the following natural buffers must be
maintained along regulated stream corridors. When other regulated sensitive
features are located within a stream corridor, a fifty foot (50') buffer is
required.
         a.   Along the Iowa River, a fifty foot (50') natural buffer must be
maintained between any development activity and the stream corridor, which
includes the floodway.
         b.   Along tributaries to the Iowa River that have a delineated
floodway, a thirty foot (30') natural buffer must be maintained between any
development activity and the stream corridor, which includes the floodway.
These tributaries include, but are not limited to, Ralston Creek, Willow Creek,
Snyder Creek, Clear Creek and Rapid Creek.
         c.   Along tributaries or drainageways that do not have a delineated
floodway, a fifteen foot (15') natural buffer must be maintained between any
development activity and the stream corridor limits.
      2.   The applicant may request a reduction of the required natural buffer
in certain circumstances enumerated below:
         a.   The required natural buffer may be reduced by up to fifty percent
(50%) if the applicant demonstrates that the portion of the buffer being
reduced:
            (1)   Does not contain significant existing vegetative cover, such
as native trees or prairie remnants; and
            (2)   Does not contain other sensitive areas subject to the
requirements of this article; and
            (3)   Enhanced vegetative cover will be provided in the remaining
buffer area.
         b.   The required natural buffer may be reduced by up to one hundred
percent (100%) if the applicant demonstrates that:
            (1)   The property is adjacent to or contains a stream corridor
located in a "developed area of the city"; and
            (2)   The portion of the buffer being reduced does not contain
other sensitive areas subject to the requirements of this article; and
            (3)   Requiring the full stream corridor buffer would preclude
reasonable use of the property; and
            (4)   Enhanced vegetative cover will be provided in any remaining
buffer area, to the extent possible.
         c.   In addition to the qualifying criteria listed above, the city
will consider the following factors in determining whether to reduce the
required buffer:
            (1)   The proposed land use of the property and its potential
impact on the stream corridor;
            (2)   The design and layout of the proposed development in relation
to the stream corridor;
            (3)   The characteristics of the site and the stream corridor; and
            (4)   Any other factors related to the short or long term
environmental stability and health of the stream corridor. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-
15-2005)
14-5I-8: REGULATED SLOPES:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of regulating development on and near steep slopes
is to:
      1.   Promote safety in the design and construction of developments;
      2.   Minimize flooding, landslides and mudslides;
      3.   Minimize soil instability, erosion and downstream siltation; and
      4.   Preserve the scenic character of hillside areas, particularly wooded
hillsides.
   B.   Regulated Slopes Defined:
   ALTERED PROTECTED SLOPES: Any slope of forty percent (40%) or steeper
created by human activity such as cutting or filling, which activity occurred
prior to December 13, 1995, and which slope is not otherwise approved by the
city.
   CRITICAL SLOPES: A slope of twenty five percent (25%), but less than forty
percent (40%).
   PERCENT OF SLOPE: The slope of a designated area determined by dividing the
horizontal run of the slope into the vertical rise of the same slope and
converting the resulting figure into a percentage value.
   PROTECTED SLOPES: Any slope of forty percent (40%) or steeper.
   STEEP SLOPES: A slope of eighteen percent (18%), but less than twenty five
percent (25%).
   C.   Environmental Review Required: A sensitive areas development plan for
property containing regulated slopes must include evidence demonstrating that
all regulations of this section will be met. Such plan must include the
following information:
      1.   Delineation of all steep, critical, and protected slopes and any
required buffer area.
      2.   Submission of a grading plan that is in conformance with title 17,
chapter 8, "Grading Ordinance", of this code.
      3.   Delineation of construction area limits and specification of
associated restrictions thereof.
   D.   Buffer Requirements:
      1.   A buffer will be required around all protected slopes. Two feet (2')
of buffer must be provided for each foot of vertical rise of the protected
slope, up to a maximum buffer of fifty feet (50'). The buffer area is to be
measured from the top, toe and sides of the protected slope. No development
activity, including removal of trees and other vegetation, will be allowed
within the buffer.
      2.   The buffer requirements may be reduced under certain circumstances.
If a buffer reduction is requested, a level II sensitive areas review is
required. A reduction of a protected slope buffer may only be approved if a
geologist or professional engineer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the city
that the proposed development activity can and will be designed to eliminate
hazards and will not undermine the stability of the slope or the buffer area.
   E.   Design Standards For Regulated Slopes:
      1.   Construction areas must be delineated on the sensitive areas
development plan and must indicate the boundaries of all intended development
activities, including grading, excavation, and storage of construction
materials. Accordingly, construction areas must be in concert with required
grading plans. Except for driveways and utilities installation, no grading or
excavation is allowed outside the construction area.
      2.   Except for commercially or industrially zoned properties,
construction areas on lots containing protected slopes must be of a size equal
to at least forty percent (40%) of the minimum lot size required by the zone in
which it is located. (For example, the construction area for a lot in an RS-
5 zone must be at least 3,200 square feet, which is 40 percent of the 8,000
square foot minimum lot size.)
      3.   Designated construction areas must not extend into protected slopes
or protected slope buffers unless expressly permitted according to the
provisions of this section.
      4.   Encroachment of construction areas into steep and critical slopes
must be minimized. If disturbance of more than thirty five percent (35%) of
critical slopes is proposed a level II sensitive areas review is required.
      5.   Any area designated as a natural protected slope (40+ percent) must
not be graded and must remain in its existing state, except natural vegetation
may be supplemented by other plant material.
      6.   Development activities may be allowed within areas containing
"altered protected slopes", as defined in this section. In such cases, a level
II sensitive areas review is required. Approval will be based on the following
criteria:
         a.   A geologist or professional engineer must demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the city that development activity will not undermine the
stability of the slope; and
         b.   The city further determines that the proposed development
activities are consistent with the intent of this article.
      7.   Cut slopes must be constructed to eliminate sharp angles of
intersection with the existing terrain and must be rounded and contoured as
necessary to blend with existing topography to the maximum extent possible. The
city will not accept the dedication and maintenance of cut and fill slopes,
except those within the required street right of way.
      8.   Street rights of way and public utility corridors must be located so
as to minimize cutting and filling.
      9.   To maintain the stability of ungraded areas, existing vegetation
must be retained to the maximum extent possible, and additional plantings to
stabilize the slope may be allowed. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-5I-9: WOODED AREAS:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of regulating development in and around wooded
areas is to:
      1.   Reduce damage to wooded areas, particularly wetlands, steep slopes
and stream corridors;
      2.   Reduce erosion and siltation;
      3.   Minimize destruction of wildlife habitat; and
      4.   Encourage subdivision and site plan design which incorporate groves
and woodlands as amenities within a development.
   B.   Environmental Review Required: A sensitive areas development plan for
property containing regulated wooded areas must include evidence demonstrating
that all regulations of this section will be met. Such plan must include the
following information:
      1.   All "groves of trees" and all "woodlands", as these terms are
defined in this title, must be delineated on the plan. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-
2005)
      2.   The plan must also delineate all woodlands that are to be protected
according to the woodland retention and replacement requirements in subsection
C of this section and all groves that are to be protected. The delineated
woodlands must include the required buffer area or, alternatively, must
delineate the drip line of trees to be retained as specified in subsection C of
this section.
      3.   The total acreage of woodlands must be listed on the plan, along
with the percentage of woodlands to be disturbed and the percentage that will
be retained. (Ord. 13-4530, 5-14-2013)
      4.   Woodland and tree protection methods for proposed development
activity shall be shown on any plan or plat required to be submitted prior to
commencement of development activity. Protection methods should comply with
generally accepted tree protection guidelines and be approved by the city.
      5.   The plan must indicate the location of the planting area for any
replacement trees required under this section. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd.
Ord. 13-4530, 5-14-2013)
   C.   Woodland Retention And Replacement Requirements: Regulated woodlands
must be retained according to the following provisions. The percentage of the
regulated woodland that must be retained is specified in
table 5I-1 of this section according to the underlying base zone.
Table 5I-1: Woodland Retention Requirements
 
Base Zone                                         Retention Requirement
ID, RR-1                                          70 percent
RS-5, RS-8, RS-12, RNS-12, T3NE, T3NG, T4NS, T4NM 50 percent
RM-12, RM-20, RM-44, RNS-20, T4MS                 20 percent
RDP, ORP                                          20 percent
C and I                                           10 percent
 
(Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd. Ord. 21-4866, 11-16-2021)
      1.   The required woodland area to be retained must include a buffer area
that extends fifty feet (50') outward from the trunks of the trees to be
preserved, unless otherwise allowed by subsection C2 of this section. This
buffer area is intended to protect the trees within the specified retention
area. Since trees within this buffer area may be prone to damage during
construction, they may not be included when calculating the required retention
area.
      2.   Alternatively, a fifty foot (50') buffer area need not be provided
if an on site tree survey is completed and the construction limit line is
established at least five feet (5') beyond the drip line of trees to be
preserved. The tree survey must identify the species, size and location of
trees at the perimeter of the woodland to be protected. Said on site tree
survey and a map delineating the drip line of the trees located near the
construction limit line must be submitted to the city for verification by the
city forester or designee. Additional spacing from the drip line (beyond the
minimum 5 feet) may be required if needed to protect the health of trees
specified for protection, as determined by the city forester or designee.
      3.   All efforts shall be made during construction to protect the
woodlands and groves designated for retention, including placement of durable
fencing or other sturdy barrier along the designated construction limit line.
      4.   If the city determines that the required woodland area cannot be
retained due to site constraints or infrastructure requirements, replacement
trees must be planted. At the discretion of the city, replacement trees may
also be allowed in cases where woodlands are determined to be of low quality,
such that planting replacement trees would improve the health of a wooded area
or create a new grove or wooded area of higher quality. One tree must be
planted for every two hundred (200) square feet of woodland removed from the
otherwise required retention area. Existing healthy trees (not located within
the woodland) may be counted as replacement trees, at the discretion of the
city, based on the health, species, maturity, location, and likelihood of
survival during and after construction. Existing trees approved for
preservation will count toward the required replacement trees at the ratio of
substitution stated in
table 5E-2 within article E, "Landscaping And Tree Standards", of this chapter.
(Ord. 13-4530, 5-14-2013)
      5.   Where it is not feasible to replace trees on site, replacement trees
may be planted to supplement reforestation of an off site woodland approved by
the city. Any designated off site woodland must be either publicly owned
property or property subject to a conservation easement. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-
2005; amd. Ord. 13-4530, 5-14-2013)
      6.   Replacement trees must be approved by the city, and to the extent
possible, should be of the same or equivalent species as the trees being
removed, unless it is determined that the trees being removed are of a species
that is considered low quality. In such a case, alternative tree species will
be considered by the city. (Ord. 13-4530, 5-14-2013)
      7.   Replacement trees must meet the specifications set forth in general
tree planting requirements contained in article E, "Landscaping And Tree
Standards", of this chapter, and must be secured by a performance guarantee for
a period of twelve (12) months. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd. Ord. 13-4530,
5-14-2013)
   D.   Design Standards For Wooded Areas:
      1.   Woodlands, groves, and existing trees designated for protection
according to the approved sensitive areas site development plan, shall be
protected from construction activity with durable fencing or other sturdy
barrier approved by the city. Said protective fencing shall be placed a minimum
of five feet (5') beyond the drip line of the tree or trees to be preserved.
Additional spacing of protective fencing from the drip line (beyond the minimum
5 feet) may be required if needed to protect the health of trees specified for
protection, as determined by the city forester or designee. The drip line is an
imaginary circle that could be drawn on the soil around a tree directly under
the tips of its outermost branches. The drip line encompasses the ground area
under the entire spread of the tree canopy.
      2.   Measures must be taken to protect and retain groves of trees, as
defined in this title, to the extent practicable.
      3.   Trees preserved within groves may be counted as replacement trees,
if it is determined that the required woodland retention ratio on a site cannot
be met as allowed in subsection C4 of this section. Preserved trees within
groves may count toward replacement trees at the ratio of substitution stated
in
table 5E-2 within article E, "Landscaping And Tree Standards", of this chapter.
(Ord. 13-4530, 5-14-2013)
      4.   When other environmentally regulated sensitive features are present
in combination with a regulated woodland, the regulations related to all the
sensitive areas contained on the property will be considered, with the most
stringent regulations applying.
      5.   To the extent possible, woodlands located on steep or critical
slopes or within 100-year floodplains must be given the highest retention
priority when meeting the woodland retention and replacement requirements.
      6.   Street right of way, public utility corridors and building sites
should be located so as to minimize their impact on woodlands and groves.
      7.   Where possible, woodlands and groves to be protected should be
located within designated public or private open space, either through
dedication, a conservation easement, or control by a homeowners' association.
(Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd. Ord. 13-4530, 5-14-2013)
14-5I-10: FULLY HYDRIC SOILS:
   A.   Purpose: Fully hydric soils may indicate the potential existence of
jurisdictional wetlands and the probable existence of a high water table. The
purpose of regulating lands that contain fully hydric soils is to recognize the
constraints imposed on urban development projects by potential wetlands or high
water tables. That is:
      1.   Wetlands are protected under state and federal law, and as such, are
considered no build areas unless appropriate and approved mitigation measures
are undertaken.
      2.   High water tables on a property require special construction
practices both for infrastructure such as streets, and for structural
development such as residences.
   B.   Environmental Review Required: A sensitive areas development plan for
property containing regulated hydric soils must include evidence demonstrating
that all regulations of this section will be met. Such plan must include the
following information:
      1.   Delineation of areas on the property where hydric soils exist.
      2.   Report from a wetland specialist regarding whether wetlands exist on
the property.
      3.   Delineation of a construction area limit, if applicable, and
specification of associated restrictions thereof.
   C.   Regulations:
      1.   If fully hydric soils exist on a property where development activity
is proposed, the property owner shall have a wetlands specialist verify whether
wetlands exist on the site. If wetlands are found to exist on the site,
compliance with the wetlands provisions of this article will be required.
      2.   More stringent construction safeguards, as specified by the city,
will be required for streets and storm water management facilities located in
fully hydric soils. Sump pump discharge tiles and elevations of window openings
may also be regulated, as specified by the city.
   D.   Design Standards: To the extent possible, urban development projects
will be designed so that areas of fully hydric soils will be treated as an
environmental asset; used for storm water detention, wetland enhancement or
buffers, protective greenbelts along stream corridors and neighborhood open
space. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-5I-11: PRAIRIE REMNANTS:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of protecting prairie remnants is to:
      1.   Preserve the value of prairie remnants for holding soil in place,
absorbing pollutants and taking up large amounts of moisture. These functions
are particularly important when prairie remnants are located along streambanks,
adjacent to wetlands or on areas of highly erodible soil.
      2.   Protect and enhance the function of prairie remnants to provide
wildlife habitat, ecological diversity and environmental education
opportunities in an urban setting.
   B.   Environmental Review Required: A sensitive areas development plan for
property containing regulated prairie remnants must include evidence
demonstrating that all regulations of this section will be met. Such plan must
include the following:
      1.   Delineation of all regulated prairie remnants on the property; and
      2.   Delineation of a construction area limit and specification of
associated restrictions.
   C.   Prairie Remnant Regulations:
      1.   Development of properties containing prairie remnants one acre in
size or larger that are not associated with other sensitive features will be
designed to retain the maximum amount of prairie remnant possible, while not
precluding reasonable, beneficial use of the property.
      2.   Prairie remnants associated with other sensitive features, such as
stream corridors, wetlands, steep slopes, woodlands or a stand of significant
trees will be treated as environmental assets, and will be considered no build
areas to the extent possible, and used for buffers, filter strips along
waterways, or neighborhood open space. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
14-5I-12: ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of regulating development of lands that contain
archaeological sites is to:
      1.   Assure that sites that contain important information regarding the
prehistory and history of the area are identified, studied, protected, or
properly excavated when appropriate.
      2.   Allow the opportunity for documentation and study of important
prehistoric and historic sites.
      3.   Allow for the consideration of prehistoric and historic sites in the
planning and development of a property to minimize delays when it is determined
that study or excavation of such sites is necessary.
      4.   Provide for the early identification of human burial sites to ensure
that the code of Iowa, as amended, regarding such burial sites is not violated
and to avoid unnecessary delays in subdivision development and subdivision
redesign if such sites are discovered after commencement of development.
   B.   Regulation Of Archaeological Sites By Other Agencies: The approval of a
sensitive areas development plan under the provisions of this section is in
addition to the applicant's obligation to obtain permits required by other
local, state or federal agencies, and does not alter the applicant's obligation
to satisfy and obtain all other applicable local, state or federal regulations
and permits.
   C.   Environmental Review Required: A sensitive areas development plan for
property containing regulated archaeological sites must include evidence
demonstrating that all regulations of this section will be met. Such plan must
delineate any archaeological sites and any required buffer on the property and
must document efforts to retain or preserve significant archaeological sites
and burial grounds. The plan must also delineate a construction area limit, if
applicable, and specify any associated restrictions thereof.
   D.   Notification: When the sensitive areas inventory map - phase I
indicates that an archaeological site is located in the quarter section within
which a site plan, planned development or a subdivision is proposed, the city
will forward the site plan or subdivision plan to the state archaeologist and
the state historic preservation officer for an opportunity to comment. The
state may notify the city if a recorded archaeological site exists within the
area of the site plan, planned development or subdivision. The state will also
notify the city if the site is of such archaeological importance that it
requires further study by the state or a state approved archaeologist. If the
state identifies such site, the Iowa City historic preservation commission or
its successor shall be notified and may proceed toward historic designation of
the site as set forth in
chapter 8, article E, "Historic Preservation Commission Approval Procedures",
of this title.
   E.   Archaeological Study:
      1.   If it is determined by the state that further study of an
archaeological site is necessary, the city may approve a site plan, planned
development or a subdivision, subject to a requirement that the state or a
state approved archaeologist be allowed to study the site and, if appropriate,
complete an excavation of the site for the purpose of documenting the
significance of the site. The state shall have a period of up to thirty (30)
calendar days in which the site is frost free to study and, where appropriate,
excavate the site. This requirement shall not prevent or delay activities which
are approved under the grading ordinance, site plan review, planned development
or subdivision regulations for portions of the property which do not contain
archaeological materials.
      2.   The applicant may choose to hire an archaeologist approved by the
state to complete a study or excavation plan approved by the state. In this
way, the study or excavation work may be completed in a more timely manner.
   F.   Significant Archaeological Sites:
      1.   If the state determines that the property includes a significant
prehistoric or historic site that cannot be studied and excavated within a
thirty (30) calendar day period, the site plan, planned development or a
subdivision plan may be approved subject to an archaeological assessment plan,
which specifies a period of time in which the state or a state approved
archaeologist may document or excavate a site.
      2.   If the site is determined to be of such state or national
significance that it should not be disturbed, an attempt must be made to design
the site plan, planned development or subdivision plan to allow retention of
the site as private or public open space.
   G.   Burial Grounds: When a site contains a human burial ground, the state
archaeologist shall determine the significance of the burial ground and whether
or not the human remains may be disinterred. If the state archaeologist
determines that the human remains should not be disturbed, the portion of the
property containing the burial grounds, plus a twenty foot (20') buffer around
the burial grounds, shall be set aside as permanent, private or public open
space.
   H.   Discovery Of Unrecorded Archaeological Sites: If, during the course of
grading or construction, prehistoric artifacts, historic objects or significant
archaeological materials, such as human remains or a prehistoric human
settlement, are encountered, the city must be notified. The city must notify
the state, which may take steps to excavate and preserve the objects, if
practical, or in the case of human burial grounds, the state archaeologist
shall determine whether or not the human remains can be disinterred. If it is
determined that the human remains cannot be disinterred, the portion of the
property containing the burial ground shall be returned to its preconstruction
condition by those persons responsible for the disturbance. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-
15-2005)

14-5J-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this article is to protect and preserve the rights and
privileges and property of Iowa City and its residents and to protect, preserve
and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort and convenience of its
residents by minimizing flood losses. The provisions of this article are
designed to:
   A.   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows so
that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
   B.   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood or that cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
   C.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public utilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage.
   D.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners to purchase
flood insurance through the national flood insurance program. (Ord. 10-4414,
11-16-2010)
14-5J-2: APPLICABILITY AND INTERPRETATION:
   A.   Application Of Provisions: The regulations within this article apply to
all lands identified in the "Johnson County, Iowa, and incorporated areas flood
insurance rate map", dated February 16, 2007. The "Johnson County, Iowa and
incorporated areas flood insurance study", as amended, is hereby adopted by
reference and is made a part of this article for the purpose of administering
floodplain management regulations.
   B.   Minimum Requirements: The provisions of this article are considered
minimum requirements and will be liberally construed in favor of the governing
body and will not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted
by state statutes.
   C.   Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: It is not intended by this article
to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed
restrictions. However, where this article imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this article shall prevail. Where more specific provisions herein
conflict with other provisions of this title, this article shall prevail. (Ord.
10-4414, 11-16-2010)
14-5J-3: LEGAL AUTHORITY AND FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   Legal Authority: Chapter 455B, code of Iowa, as amended, gives cities
authority to adopt regulations governing development and redevelopment within
flood hazard areas, including designation of flood hazard maps.
   B.   Legislative Findings:
      1.   The flood hazard areas of Iowa City are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort and
convenience of its residents.
      2.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages.
Such uses create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately
elevated or otherwise protected from flooding and the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
      3.   This article relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards, which is consistent with the standards established by the Iowa
department of natural resources or its assignee. (Ord. 10-4414, 11-16-2010)
14-5J-4: COMPLIANCE WITH PROVISIONS; NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS:
   A.   Except as provided in subsection B of this section, no structure or
land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall be located, enlarged,
converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of
this article.
   B.   If a structure that is not in compliance with the provisions of this
article lawfully existed prior to May 2, 1977, and has existed continuously
without abandonment since that time, then improvements may be made to the
structure, notwithstanding the provisions of this article, provided such
improvements do not constitute a substantial improvement as defined in
chapter 9, article F, "Floodplain Management Definitions", of this title.
However, structures, uses, or development that are nonconforming with regard to

14-5J-9: VARIANCES:
The board of adjustment may authorize, upon request, in specific cases, such
variances from the terms of this article that will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this article will result in unnecessary and undue hardship.
To ensure that the spirit of this title is observed and substantial justice
done, no variance to the strict application of any provision of this article
shall be granted by the board unless the applicant demonstrates that all of the
following approval criteria are met. In addition, the applicant must meet all
the provisions and general approval criteria for variances as stated in
chapter 4, article B, "Minor Modifications, Variances, Special Exceptions, And
Provisional Uses", of this title, except subsection
14-4B-2A4 of this title.
   A.   Approval Criteria:
      1.   No variance shall be granted for any development within the floodway
that would result in any increase in flood elevation unless approved by the
Iowa department of natural resources or its assignee.
      2.   Variances shall only be granted upon a showing of good and
sufficient cause, and a determination that the granting of the variance will
not result in increased flood elevation, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances or cause fraud on or
victimization of the public.
      3.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      4.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this article, the
applicant shall be notified, in writing, over the signature of the building
official, that the issuance of a variance will likely result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance.
      5.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Iowa department of natural resources or its assignee.
   B.   Factors For Consideration: When considering applications for variances,
the board of adjustment will consider all relevant factors specified in other
sections of this article in addition to the following factors:
      1.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood elevation or
velocities caused by encroachments.
      2.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
      3.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community, and the risk of losing said services during a flood event.
      4.   The risk assumed by emergency personnel if it is necessary to
evacuate the use/structure during a flood event.
      5.   After consultation with the historic preservation commission, a
determination of whether compliance with the floodplain regulations would
result in a substantial alteration or destruction of defining architectural
characteristics of landmark properties and properties located within historic
or conservation districts.
      6.   Such other factors that are relevant to the purposes of this
article.
   C.   Conditions Of Approval: Upon consideration of the factors and approval
criteria listed in this section, the board of adjustment may attach such
conditions and safeguards to the granting of a variance as it deems necessary
to fulfill the purposes and intent of the provisions of this article. (Ord. 10-
4414, 11-16-2010)
14-5J-10: AMENDMENTS:
The regulations and standards set forth in this article may, from time to time,
be amended, supplemented, changed or repealed. No amendment, supplement, change
or modification shall be undertaken without prior approval of the Iowa
department of natural resources or its assignee. (Ord. 10-4414, 11-16-2010)
14-5J-11: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may
be increased by humanmade or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge
openings restricted by debris. This article does not imply that areas outside
the regulated areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article
does not imply that uses permitted within the regulated areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part
of Iowa City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully
made hereunder. (Ord. 10-4414, 11-16-2010)
ARTICLE K. NEIGHBORHOOD OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS
SECTION:
14-5K-1: Purpose
14-5K-2: Applicability
14-5K-3: Dedication Of Land
14-5K-4: Payment Of Fees In Lieu Of Land Dedication
14-5K-5: Requiring Both Dedication Of Land And Payment Of Fee
14-5K-6: Use Of Funds
14-5K-1: PURPOSE:
The neighborhood open space requirements ensure that adequate usable
neighborhood open space, parks and recreation facilities are provided in a
manner that is consistent with the parks master plan, as amended, by using a
calculable method to equitably apportion the costs of acquiring and developing
land for those purposes. The provisions of this article require development,
which creates increased needs for neighborhood open space ("open space
impact"), to pay a proportionate share of the city's capital improvements to
fulfill said open space impact. Usable neighborhood open space includes
pedestrian/bicycle trails, preferably located within natural greenway systems,
private open space that is publicly accessible, and neighborhood parks that
serve nearby residents. This article is also intended to encourage, wherever
reasonably feasible, the dedication of sensitive areas in conjunction with
usable open space. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd. Ord. 25-4965, 9-2-2025)
14-5K-2: APPLICABILITY:
As a condition of approval for preliminary plats containing residential uses,
the applicant shall dedicate land, pay a fee in lieu of land, or a combination
thereof, for park, greenway, recreational and open space purposes, as
determined by the city and in accordance with the provisions of this article.
(Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd. Ord. 25-4965, 9-2-2025)
14-5K-3: DEDICATION OF LAND:
   A.   Amount Of Land To Be Dedicated: The amount of land dedication shall be
determined by the following formula. This formula is deemed a reasonable
calculation of the additional need for neighborhood open space created by the
subject subdivision.
 
   # of units x PUD x 3/1,000, where
   # of units = Number of new units is determined as noted in the Table 5K- 1;
   PDU = Persons per dwelling unit based on the most recent census; and
   3/1,000 = Acres of active neighborhood open space required per 1,000
persons.

   B.   Dedication Cap: The maximum land dedication requirement is ten percent
(10%) of the total acres of land being developed.
   C.   Nature Of Land To Be Dedicated: Except as otherwise required by the
city, all dedications of land shall meet the following criteria:
      1.   Usability: At least ninety percent (90%) of the land required to be
dedicated shall be located outside of floodways, lakes or other water bodies,
areas with slopes greater than fifteen percent (15%), wetlands subject to
federal or state regulatory jurisdiction and other areas the city reasonably
deems unsuitable for neighborhood open space due to topography, flooding or
other appropriate considerations. Dry bottom storm water detention facilities
and dry creek areas may be credited toward reaching a portion of the required
land dedication when the city determines that such areas are suitable for use
as neighborhood open space. Pedestrian/bicycle trails and private open space
that is publicly accessible may be credited toward reaching the required land
dedication when the city determines that such areas are suitable for use as
neighborhood open space. The city encourages the dedication of lakes, ponds,
creeks, other water bodies, wetlands falling under the jurisdiction of state or
federal agencies and other sensitive areas including woodland areas, both as
ten percent (10%) of and in addition to the dedicated land required by this
article, if sufficient abutting land is dedicated as a usable, public
recreation area or park.
      2.   Unity: The dedicated land shall form a single parcel of land, except
where the city determines that two (2) or more parcels or greenways/trails
would best serve the public interest, given the type and distribution of
neighborhood open space needed to adequately serve the proposed development. If
the city determines that two (2) or more parcels would best serve the public
interest, the city may require that such parcels be connected by a dedicated
strip of land at least twenty feet (20') wide in order to provide access and
continuity between said parcels.
      3.   Location: The dedicated land shall be located so as to reasonably
serve the recreation and open space needs of the residents of the subdivision.
      4.   Shape: If a sufficient amount of land is dedicated to accommodate
recreational facilities and activities, such as fields, courts or playground
equipment, the shape of the dedicated land shall be suitable for such
facilities and activities. Linear open space should be of sufficient width to
accommodate trails and adjacent greenways.
      5.   Access:
         a.   Greenways/Trails: Public access to greenways/trails shall be
provided by a public access easement at least twenty feet (20') in width. In
addition, greenways/trails shall be connected to existing or proposed
greenways/trails on adjacent property.
         b.   Parks: Public access to the dedicated land to be used for parks
shall be provided either by adjoining public street frontage or by a dedicated
public access easement at least fifty feet (50') in width, which connects the
dedicated land to a public street or right of way. The grades adjacent to
existing and proposed streets shall permit reasonable access to the dedicated
land. The parcel shall be safely accessible to pedestrian traffic.
      6.   Responsibility For Site Preparation:
         a.   The city may require the subdivider or developer to grade and
seed those portions of the dedicated land to be improved prior to dedication of
the property and prior to the city's acceptance of the dedication.
         b.   Where the dedicated land is located adjacent to a street, the
subdivider or developer shall remain responsible for the installation of
utilities, sidewalks and other improvements required along that street segment.
         c.   Prior to dedication, the subdivider or developer shall be
responsible for restoring satisfactory ground cover and controlling erosion on
land to be dedicated that has been disrupted as a result of development
activities by the subdivider or developer.
   D.   Procedure For Dedication Of Land:
      1.   The dedication of land shall be reviewed as part of the preliminary
subdivision plat. The subdivider or developer shall designate the area or areas
of land to be dedicated pursuant to this article on the preliminary subdivision
plat. Where wetlands have been delineated on the property, the preliminary
subdivision plat shall also identify the boundaries of such wetlands.
      2.   Upon receipt of the preliminary subdivision plat, the director of
neighborhood and development services (NDS) shall submit a copy to the director
of parks and recreation for review by the parks and recreation commission. The
parks and recreation commission shall submit recommendations concerning the
land to be dedicated to the planning and zoning commission within twenty one
(21) business days of the receipt of a complete application for preliminary
subdivision plat.
      3.   Once the final subdivision plat is approved, and any public
improvements required to be installed by the subdivider or developer within the
land to be dedicated have been installed, approved, and accepted by the city,
and the subdivider or developer has completed site preparation pursuant to
subsection B6 of this section, the subdivider or developer shall provide a
properly executed warranty deed conveying the dedicated land to the city within
two (2) years of final plat approval or by the time the city issues fifty
percent (50%) of the certificates of occupancy for the subdivision, at the
discretion of the city, or as otherwise specified in the subdivider's or
developer agreement.
      4.   The city shall formally accept the dedication of land for open
space, parkland or greenways/trails by resolution. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005;
amd. Ord. 25-4965, 9-2-2025)
14-5K-4: PAYMENT OF FEES IN LIEU OF LAND DEDICATION:
   A.   General: The payment of fees in lieu of dedication of land may occur at
the request of the subdivider or developer with approval by the city, or may be
required by the city. The payment of fees in lieu of land dedication shall be
reviewed and approved as part of the preliminary subdivision plat.
   B.   Request By Subdivider Or Developer:
      1.   If a payment in lieu of open space is requested, the subdivider or
developer must include such request in a letter submitted with the application
for a preliminary subdivision, whichever is applicable.
      2.   The director of neighborhood and development services (NDS) will
forward a copy of the preliminary subdivision plat, along with a copy of the
letter requesting payment of fees in lieu of land dedication to the director of
parks and recreation for review by the parks and recreation commission. The
commission shall submit any and all recommendations concerning the payment of
fees in lieu of dedication to the planning and zoning commission within twenty
one (21) business days of the date a complete application for preliminary
subdivision plat is submitted.
      3.   The planning and zoning commission will consider the request for
payment of fees in lieu of land dedication during the subdivision review
process and forward its recommendations to the city council.
   C.   Determination Of Fees In Lieu Of Dedication Criteria: The city may, at
its discretion, require the payment of fees in lieu of the subdivider
dedicating land, if the city finds that all or part of the land required for
dedication is not suitable for public recreation and open space purposes, or
upon a finding that the recreational needs of the proposed subdivision can be
met by other park, greenway, or recreational facilities planned or constructed
by the city within reasonable proximity to the subdivision. The city shall
consider the following factors in making its determination:
      1.   Recreational and open space elements of the city comprehensive plan,
as amended, and the relation of the subdivision to the proposed open space and
recreational areas;
      2.   Topographic and geologic conditions of the land available for
dedication;
      3.   Size, shape, location of and access to the land available for
dedication;
      4.   The character and recreational needs of the neighborhood where the
subdivision is located;
      5.   The costs of developing open space and recreational areas in the
subdivision;
      6.   The actual or potential development of open space and recreational
areas on land adjacent to the subdivision which will serve the needs of the
subdivision;
      7.   Recommendations of staff, the parks and recreation commission and
the planning and zoning commission; and
      8.   Any other relevant information.
   D.   Time Of Payment: Fees in lieu of dedication must be paid in full by the
subdivider/developer prior to the issuance of the first building permit for a
lot in the subdivision.
   E.   Amount Of Payment: The fee shall be equal to the fair market value of
the land that otherwise would have been required for dedication. The fair
market value of the undeveloped land shall be determined by a qualified real
estate appraiser or by other means acceptable to both the city and the
subdivider or developer. The city and subdivider/developer will equally share
the appraisal costs. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd. Ord. 25-4965, 9-2-2025)
14-5K-5: REQUIRING BOTH DEDICATION OF LAND AND PAYMENT OF FEE:
The city may, at its discretion, require a subdivider to dedicate a portion of
the land required under the formula set forth in this article, and also to pay
a fee in lieu of dedication for the remaining portion of the land by said
formula. The fee for the remaining portion shall be determined by a qualified
real estate appraiser or by other means acceptable to both the city and
subdivider or developer. The city and subdivider/developer will equally share
the appraisal costs. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd. Ord. 25-4965, 9-2-2025)
14-5K-6: USE OF FUNDS:
   A.   The neighborhood open space district boundary map (see figure 5K-1 of
this section), divides the city into neighborhood open space districts. All
payments in lieu of dedication shall be deposited in a special neighborhood
open space account designated by the name of the contributing development. All
payments will be used to acquire or develop open spaces, parks, recreation
facilities and greenways/trails that are located within the neighborhood open
space district containing the subject subdivision and will benefit the
residents of the subdivision for which payment has been made.

   B.   The city must use the payment in lieu of dedication within five (5)
years from the date received. This period will be automatically extended an
additional five (5) years if the subdivider/developer has not constructed at
least fifty percent (50%) of the units within the subdivision for which payment
in lieu of dedication has been made.
   C.   If the city has not spent the funds by the last day of the five (5)
year period or, if extended, by the last day of an additional five (5) years,
the city shall, within ninety (90) days thereafter, mail to the property owner,
at the address on file with the Johnson County treasurer's office, a
proportional refund based on the percentage of the platted lots they own of the
total platted lots in the subdivision. The subdivider's agreement/development
agreement for each subdivision for which the subdivider/developer has made
payments in lieu of dedication shall inform all property owners and successors
in interest to properties in the subdivision of the right to a refund as
provided for herein. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd. Ord. 25-4965, 9-2-2025)

14-6-4: AIRPORT ZONES:
In order to carry out the provisions of this section there are hereby created
and established certain zones which are adopted and described herein, and which
are depicted on the Iowa City airport zoning maps, dated January 15, 2019, and
as thereafter amended by ordinance, which map is adopted by this chapter and
which map is on file in the office of the city clerk, Iowa City, Iowa. Any
structure or tree located in more than one zone is considered to be only in the
zone with the more restrictive height and use limitation. The various zones
hereby established and defined are as follows:
   A.   Approach Overlay Zone (AO) Defined: The airspace above a sloping plane
extending outward from each end of each runway, rising uniformly at a fixed
ratio, and of fixed size, through which aircraft commonly operate when arriving

threshold at the southeast end of the runway and centered on the extended
centerline of the runway, the inner edge of the zone is five hundred feet
(500') wide, expanding uniformly to an outer edge width of three thousand five
hundred feet (3,500'). The altitude of the inner edge is the same as the
altitude of the runway threshold at the centerline, as depicted on the airport
zoning maps. For each thirty four feet (34') of horizontal distance, the floor
of the zone rises from the inner edge one foot (1') (34:1), for a total
horizontal distance of ten thousand feet (10,000').

threshold to the northwest, and centered on the extended centerline of the
runway, the inner edge of the zone is five hundred feet (500') wide, expanding
uniformly to an outer edge width of one thousand five hundred feet (1,500').
The altitude of the inner edge is the same as the altitude of the runway
threshold at the centerline, as depicted on the airport zoning maps. For each
twenty feet (20') of horizontal distance, the floor of the zone rises from the
inner edge one foot (1') (20:1), continuing for a total horizontal distance of
five thousand feet (5,000').

approach overlay zone created herein.
         b.   No person shall establish or maintain any private roadway in any
location that would result in penetration of any AO zone by any portion of any
vehicle that shall be permitted to operate upon such roadway.
   B.   Controlled Activity Runway Protection Zone (CA-RPZ) Defined: An area of
fixed size, underlying the innermost portion (closest to the runway end) of the
AO zone for that runway, descending from the floor of the AO zone to the
ground. The width and length of CA-RPZ may vary, and may be different on each
runway end.

   A.   No notice of proposed construction or alteration is required to be
submitted to the FAA or to the building official or zoning administrator for a
building permit for construction or alteration of any structure when the
building official or zoning administrator has determined that:
      1.   The proposed structure meets the requirements for shielding. Each
and all of the following requirements are required for a determination of
shielding:
         a.   The property upon which the construction or alteration is
proposed is located within the congested area of a city.
         b.   The proposed structure does not lie within any CA- RPZ.
         c.   There exists a structure or structures of a permanent and
substantial nature at least as tall and at least as wide as the proposed
structure, and which lie(s) between the location of the proposed construction
or alteration, and a point on the runway centerline at the threshold of the
closest end of the closest runway of the airport.
         d.   The shielding structure is within five hundred feet (500') of the
structure that is proposed for construction or alteration.
         e.   It is evident beyond a reasonable doubt that the shielded
structure will not adversely affect aerial navigation.
      2.   The proposed structure is an antenna that is no greater than twenty
feet (20') in height, and does not increase the height of an existing antenna
structure.
      3.   The proposed structure is an airport, aerial navigation, or
meteorological device, of a type approved by the FAA, the location and height
of which is fixed by function.
   B.   A notice of proposed construction or alteration is not required for
structures more than twenty thousand feet (20,000') of the nearest point of the
nearest runway. A notice of Alteration is not required for a structure that
does not penetrate an imaginary surface, beginning at the nearest point of the
nearest runway and at the elevation of the runway threshold, rising one foot
(1') in elevation for each one hundred feet (100') of horizontal distance (100:
1). This exception does not apply to structures located in any CA-RPZ.
   C.   There exists an emergency, involving essential public services, public
health, or public safety, that requires immediate construction or alteration,
providing that the applicant complies with the requirements of 14 CFR FAR, part
77.17 (d) 1 . (Ord. 02-4055, 12-10-2002; amd. Ord. 19-4810, 11-4-2019)

14-6-9: NONCONFORMITIES:
   A.   The regulations prescribed herein are not retroactive and shall not be
construed to require the removal of any tree, or the reconstruction or
alteration, or the discontinuation of any use of any structure made
nonconforming by the adoption of this chapter.
   B.   Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction
or alteration, or the intended use of any structure, the construction or
alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date hereof, and which was
conforming prior to the adoption of this chapter, and is completed within one
year thereafter.
   C.   No preexisting nonconforming structure, use, or tree shall be rebuilt,
altered, allowed to grow higher, or be replanted, so as to constitute a greater
airport hazard than it was at the time that these regulations were adopted.
   D.   Whenever the building official or zoning administrator determines that
a nonconforming structure has been abandoned, torn down, physically
deteriorated, damaged, or decayed, to such an extent that its value is no
greater than fifty percent (50%) of the average value of the structure and the
land over the preceding ten (10) years, no building permit or occupancy permit
shall be issued that would allow such structure to exceed the applicable height
and use provisions of this chapter. Any tree so damaged or destroyed shall be
subject to the provisions of subsection
14-6-5G6 of this chapter.
   E.   Not withstanding the previous provisions of this section the owner of
any preexisting nonconforming structure or tree shall be required to permit the
installation, operation, or maintenance thereon of any markers and/or lights as
shall be deemed necessary by the city or county to indicate to the operators of
aircraft, the presence of such structure or tree. (Ord. 02-4055, 12-10-2002)

or enlargement of any use, or for any land clearing, grading, construction,
demolition, or other development activity that would be counter to or
prohibited by the proposed amendment, if no substantial part of the permitted
or licensed use or development activity has begun.

be obtained prior to continuation.
         b.   If, at any time in the sixty (60) day period, the city council
rejects the proposed amendment or if, by the end of the sixty (60) day period,
has not enacted or has rejected the proposed amendment, the suspension shall be
terminated. Review of any suspended applications for a permit under the current
title shall resume, uses or development activity may proceed under permits or
licenses that have already been issued, and unregulated uses or development
activity may proceed.
         c.   No already issued permit or license may be suspended under this
subsection more than once, nor shall any property be subject to suspension
under this subsection within twelve (12) months of a previous suspension
applied to the same property under the same proposed amendment. Said twelve

various phases of the development. The preliminary OPD plan may show a range of
dimensions and need not have the specificity of the final plan.
         b.   A preliminary OPD plan for developments containing regulated
sensitive features must be entitled "Preliminary Sensitive Areas Development
Plan". Such sensitive areas development plans, in addition to illustrating all
the applicable elements for a planned development, must delineate all regulated

approval of the preliminary OPD plan or, if applicable, the preliminary
sensitive areas development plan.
      1.   Staff Review: Upon receipt of a complete application, staff from the
department of planning and community development will review the application
for compliance with the applicable approval criteria as set forth in

planning and zoning commission will schedule one or more public meetings to
receive public comment regarding the application. The commission will then make
a written report of its findings to the city council with a recommendation for
approval, approval with conditions, or denial of the planned development
overlay rezoning. The report shall include findings with regard to the
applicable approval criteria as set forth in
chapter 3, article A, "Planned Development Overlay Zone (OPD)", of this title.
If the planning and zoning commission makes no report within forty five (45)
days from the date a complete application was received, it shall be considered
to have made a report approving the proposed planned development overlay
rezoning.
         b.   Not less than four (4) votes shall be required to recommend
approval of a planned development overlay rezoning.
      3.   City Council Hearing:

planned development overlay to the commission for its recommendation or during
the period while the commission is considering such matter.
         b.   Following the public hearing, the city council shall consider an
ordinance approving the proposed planned development overlay rezoning. In those
instances when the city council has reached an informal consensus on a proposed
planned development overlay rezoning that is contrary to the recommendation of
the planning and zoning commission, the city council will defer formal action
on the matter until a discussion has taken place between the city council and
the planning and zoning commission. In such instances, if the planning and
zoning commission declines the city council's offer to meet, formal action on
the matter may commence forthwith.
      4.   Lapse Of Approval: A preliminary OPD plan or preliminary sensitive
areas development plan shall be valid for no more than twenty four (24) months
unless otherwise specified in the ordinance approving the OPD overlay zone. If
no building permit has been issued for the development within the twenty four
(24) month period, the area of land to which the OPD ordinance applies may be
considered by the city for rezoning.
      5.   Protests And Effect On Development Activity: Since a planned
development overlay rezoning is a type of zoning map amendment (rezoning), a
planned development overlay rezoning is subject to the same provisions for
protest and effect on development activity as for a zoning map amendment as set
forth in subsections
14-8D-5G and H of this article.
   D.   Final OPD Plan Approval:
      1.   Administrative Review And Approval:

are approved as a part of the planned development, no building permit for a
commercial use shall be issued until a minimum of twenty five percent (25%) of
the housing units planned for the area or approved subarea have been completed,
or unless twenty five percent (25%) of the housing units planned for the area
or approved subarea will be built simultaneously.
   E.   Amending Approved OPD Plans Or Sensitive Areas Development Plans:
Requests for substantive changes to an approved preliminary or final OPD or
sensitive areas development plan may not be approved administratively, but must
be submitted as an amendment to such a plan and will be reviewed according to
the procedures for approval of a planned development overlay rezoning, as
specified in this section. A substantive change is any significant change in
the land uses, street locations, or character of the development from what is
shown on the approved OPD plan or sensitive areas development plan or any
variation from the underlying zoning requirements or street standards beyond
the ranges approved on the preliminary OPD plan or preliminary sensitive areas
development plan. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)

      1.   After the recommendation and report of the planning and zoning
commission have been filed, and a written purchase offer has been received from
the applicant, the city council will hold a public hearing on an ordinance to
vacate the subject right of way and on a resolution to dispose of the property
to the applicant. Notice of such hearing, and the time and place of such
hearing must be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in the
city at least seven (7), but not more than twenty (20), days before the public
hearing. In no case shall the public hearing be held earlier than the next
regularly scheduled city council meeting following the published notice. The
city council may set such public hearing before, after, or during the period
when the planning and zoning commission is considering such matter.

SECTION:
14-8E-1: Designation Of Historic Districts, Conservation Districts And Local
Historic Landmarks
14-8E-2: Historic Review
14-8E-3: Certificate Of Economic Hardship
14-8E-1: DESIGNATION OF HISTORIC DISTRICTS, CONSERVATION DISTRICTS AND LOCAL
HISTORIC LANDMARKS:
   A.   Initiation:
      1.   The city council may, on its own motion or on petition, designate by
ordinance areas of the city as historic or conservation districts or may
designate by ordinance local historic landmarks. Any proposed historic landmark
or historic or conservation district initiated by the city council must first
be submitted to the historic preservation commission for its recommendation and
report. Designating a historic district, conservation district, or local
historic landmark is considered an overlay rezoning, and as such, must also,
subsequent to consideration by the historic preservation commission, be
submitted to the planning and zoning commission for its recommendation and
report regarding the rezoning.
      2.   The historic preservation commission may, on its own motion or on
petition, recommend to the city council areas of the city for designation as
historic or conservation districts or properties for designation as local
historic landmarks. Designating a historic district, conservation district, or
local historic landmark is considered an overlay rezoning, and as such, must
also be submitted to the planning and zoning commission for its recommendation
and report regarding the rezoning.
   B.   Historic Landmark Applications:
      1.   Applications for a historic landmark designation must be filed in
the department of planning and community development on application forms
provided by the city. Supporting materials must be submitted as specified on
the application form.
      2.   If the property has been registered on the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP), the NRHP registration form must accompany the
application.
   C.   Historic Preservation Commission Public Hearing:
      1.   Upon receipt of an application for historic landmark designation or
following initiation of a proposal to designate a historic or conservation
district, the historic preservation commission will hold a public hearing on
the proposal.
      2.   The historic preservation commission will give notice of the time,
date, place and subject matter of such public hearing. Such notice shall be
sent by ordinary mail, not less than seven (7) days before the date the hearing
is held, to the owner of record of each property or property interest at the
owner’s last known address as shown in the records of the Iowa City Assessor,
not more than fourteen (14) days prior to the date of mailing. A change in
ownership of any such property which is not reflected in the records of the
Iowa City Assessor during the period those records are searched as above
provided shall not affect the validity of the notice. An affidavit of mailing
will be filed with the city clerk setting forth the date that notice was mailed
and the names and addresses of all property owners notified pursuant to this
subsection.
      3.   Following the public hearing, the historic preservation commission
will consider a motion recommending approval of the proposed district or
historic landmark.
      4.   Upon approval of the motion, the historic preservation commission
will submit an application to rezone the proposed area to historic district
overlay or conservation district overlay, whichever is applicable. For
properties proposed as local historic landmarks, an application for a historic
district overlay rezoning must be submitted.
   D.   State Historic Preservation Office Review: Following the public hearing
before the historic preservation commission, any proposal regarding a local
historic district will be submitted to the state historic preservation office
(SHPO) for review and recommendations. The city will make any recommendations
made by the state historic preservation office available to the public for
viewing during normal business hours at a city government place of public
access. Any proposals regarding conservation districts and/or local historic
landmarks need not be submitted to SHPO.
   E.   Planning And Zoning Commission Review:
      1.   After receipt of the rezoning application and the report and
recommendation of the historic preservation commission, the planning and zoning
commission will schedule one or more public meetings to receive public comment
regarding the proposed district.
      2.   The planning and zoning commission will review the proposed overlay
rezoning based on its relation to the comprehensive plan, as amended, to the
provisions of this title, and to any proposed public improvements and other
plans for the renewal of the area involved. The planning and zoning commission
will recommend approval, denial, or modification of the proposed historic
district or conservation district overlay zone.
      3.   If the planning and zoning commission makes no report to the city
council within forty five (45) days from the date the rezoning application was
received, it shall be considered to have made a report approving the proposed
rezoning.
      4.   A two-thirds (2/3) vote of the members of the commission present at
the meeting, but not less than four (4) votes, shall be required in
consideration of such a rezoning.
      5.   If the planning and zoning commission alters the area of the
proposed district as approved by the historic preservation commission, the
planning and zoning commission must submit a description of the altered
proposed area or the petition describing the area to the state historic
preservation office where required and the historic preservation commission for
review and recommendations concerning the altered proposed district.
   F.   City Council Public Hearing:
      1.   After receiving the report and recommendation of the historic
preservation commission and the planning and zoning commission regarding the
proposed historic district or conservation district overlay zone, the city
council shall, before enacting any proposed historic district or conservation
district overlay zone, hold a public hearing in relation thereto. Notice of
such hearing, and the time and place of such hearing must be published in a
newspaper having a general circulation in the city at least seven (7), but not
more than twenty (20), days before the public hearing. In no case shall the
public hearing be held earlier than the next regularly scheduled city council
meeting following the published notice. The city council may set such public
hearing either before or after the proposed rezoning is submitted to the
planning and zoning commission for its recommendation or during the period
while the planning and zoning commission is considering such matter.
      2.   Following the public hearing, the city council shall consider an
ordinance implementing the proposed historic district or conservation district
overlay zone. The city council may approve or deny the ordinance or may refer
the overlay zoning to the historic preservation commission for modification.
Comments from the state historic preservation office must be received by the
city council prior to approval, denial, or modification of the proposed
rezoning.
      3.   If the city council refers the overlay zoning back to the historic
preservation commission for modification, the commission will follow the
procedures as set forth in this subsection and subsections C, D and E of this
section, with the following exceptions:
         a.   Unless substantial modifications are proposed, the public hearing
before the historic preservation commission may be waived.
         b.   Only property owners affected by the city council's proposed
modification shall be notified by mail of the modification prior to action by
the historic preservation commission.
   G.   Protests And Effect On Development Activity: Since a historic district
or conservation district overlay rezoning is a type of zoning map amendment
(rezoning), such an overlay rezoning is subject to the same provisions for
protest and effect on development activity as for a zoning map amendment as set
forth in subsections
 14-8D-5G and H of this title. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005; amd. Ord. 22-4884, 8-
2-2022)

      1.   Applications for historic review must be filed with the department
of planning and community development on application forms provided by the
city.

application form. (Ord. 05-4186, 12-15-2005)
   B.   Levels Of Historic Review:
      1.   Minor Review:
         a.   A minor review will be conducted if the change proposed in the
application is of a type specifically defined and listed as eligible for minor
review in the "Iowa City Historic Preservation Handbook", as amended.
         b.   Applications for minor review will be reviewed by a designated
commission member or designated staff to the commission. Applications will be
approved upon finding that the proposed change to the property will have no
material effect on the historic character of the property or the historic or
conservation district. Decisions may be appealed to and reviewed by the
historic preservation commission, if so requested by the applicant. If there is
evidence that the proposed change may have a material effect on the historic
character of the property or historic or conservation district, the application
for minor review will be deferred and will be forwarded for major review by the
historic preservation commission.
         c.   A written report of the minor reviews processed shall be made to
the commission at the next scheduled commission meeting.
      2.   Intermediate Review:
         a.   An intermediate review will be conducted if the change proposed
in the application is of a type specifically defined and listed as eligible for
intermediate review in the "Iowa City Historic Preservation Handbook", as
amended.
         b.   Applications for intermediate review will be reviewed jointly by
the designated commission staff and the historic preservation commission chair
or the chair's designee. Decisions may be appealed to the historic preservation
commission, if so requested by the applicant. If the designated commission
staff or the historic preservation commission chair determines that an
application warrants review by the full commission, said application will be
forwarded for major review.
         c.   A written report of the intermediate reviews processed shall be
made to the commission at the next scheduled commission meeting.
      3.   Major Review:
         a.   A major review will be conducted for applications that meet one
or more of the following criteria:
            (1)   The application is for a specific change that does not
qualify for minor or intermediate review; or
            (2)   The application is for minor or intermediate review and has
been recommended for major review by the designated commission staff or the
historic preservation commission chair; or
            (3)   An appeal of a decision regarding a minor or intermediate
review.
         b.   Major reviews will be conducted by the historic preservation
commission. Applications that are denied may be appealed to the city council if
the property is a historic landmark or a property located within a historic
district; or appealed to the board of adjustment if the property is located
within a conservation district. (Ord. 10-4404, 9-7-2010)
   C.   Approval Procedure: Applications for historic review will be reviewed
for compliance with the applicable approval criteria for historic review as set
forth in
chapter 3, article B, "Historic District And Conservation District Overlay", of
this title. Historic review will result in one of the following outcomes:
      1.   If the proposed material change to the property will have no effect
on any architecturally significant feature, or there will be no change in
appearance to a landmark or property located within a historic or conservation
district, a certificate of no material effect will be issued, signed by the
chair of the historic preservation commission or designee and be transmitted
along with the application to the building official and the city clerk.
      2.   If the application is approved or approved with modifications
acceptable to the applicant, a certificate of appropriateness will be issued,
signed by the chairperson or designee and be transmitted along with the
application to the building official and the city clerk.

written decision setting forth the factual basis for the decision and the vote
of each member participating therein. The decision will be issued, signed by
the chairperson or designee, and be transmitted along with the application to
the building official and the city clerk.
   D.   Appeals: Any person aggrieved by any decision of the commission
regarding an application for historic review in a historic district or for a
historic landmark may appeal the action to the city council. Any person
aggrieved by any decision of the commission regarding an application for
historic review in a conservation district may appeal the action to the board
of adjustment. Procedures for such appeals are as follows:
      1.   Any appeal submitted by the applicant must be in writing and must be
filed with the city clerk no later than ten (10) business days after the filing
of the above mentioned decision. An appeal submitted by an aggrieved party,

within a reasonable time, hold a public hearing on the appeal, give the public
notice as required by state law, as well as provide written notice to the
applicant and to the appellant, if different from the applicant, and decide the
appeal within a reasonable time.

board of adjustment, as applicable, may, in conformity with the provisions of
this article or ordinances adopted pursuant thereto, affirm, or upon finding
error, reverse or modify, wholly or partly, the order, requirement, decision or
determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or
determination as ought to be made, and to that end, shall have all the powers

the application for the certificate of economic hardship within sixty (60) days
following receipt of a complete application and all information requested by
the commission.
      2.   The public hearing will result either in approval or denial of the
application for a certificate of economic hardship. The commission will issue a
written decision setting forth the factual basis for the decision and vote of
each member participating therein. The written decision will be issued, signed
by the chairperson or designee, and be transmitted along with the application
to the building official and the city clerk. If the commission finds that
unreasonable economic hardship exists, a certificate of economic hardship will
be issued, specifying the material changes that are authorized thereto.
      3.   For the purpose of developing alternative solutions to the economic
hardship, the historic preservation commission may consult with professional
architects, engineers, contractors, realtors, appraisers or other consultants

development, trespass can result from on site fixtures projecting into
residential portions of the development.
   LUMEN (lm): Measure of brightness of the illumination exiting a bulb, as
provided by the manufacturer.
   LUMINAIRE: The complete lighting unit, including the bulb, the fixture, pole
or armature and other parts.
   NADIR: The vertical line projecting downward to the ground from the center
of the lens of a luminaire.
   NONCUTOFF: A light fixture that does not cut off the upward transmission of
light.
   OUTDOOR LIGHT OUTPUT, TOTAL: The initial total amount of light, measured in
lumens, from all bulbs used in outdoor light fixtures. Includes all lights and
luminous tubing used for display lighting, general illumination, architectural/
accent lighting, and lights used for external illumination of signs, but does
not include lights used to illuminate internally illuminated signs or luminous
tubing used in neon signs. For bulb types that vary in their output as they age
(such as high pressure sodium, fluorescent and metal halide), the initial lumen
output, as defined by the manufacturer, in the value to be considered. (Ord.

ARTICLE F. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT DEFINITIONS
SECTION:
14-9F-1: Definitions
14-9F-1: DEFINITIONS:
As used in
chapter 5, article J, "Floodplain Management Standards", of this title, the
following definitions shall apply. The general definitions contained in article
A of this chapter shall apply to all terms used in
chapter 5, article J of this title that are not defined in this section.
   BASEMENT: Any enclosed area of a building that has its floor or lowest level
below ground level (subgrade) on all sides (see definition of Lowest Floor).
   CLASS 1 CRITICAL FACILITIES: Facilities that must remain accessible during
the 0.2% flood event because they are the base of operations for emergency
responders, are particularly difficult to evacuate during a flood event, or
facilities that provide services essential to the life, health, and safety of
the community. Class 1 critical facilities include police and fire stations,
emergency medical centers, communication centers, hospitals, jails, nursing
homes, and other residential uses for persons with limited mobility and/or
dependency upon life sustaining medical equipment.
   CRITICAL FACILITIES: Structures that store public records; museums and
libraries; schools; and other buildings that store rare and/or valuable items
and information that sustain the history and public records of a community.
These structures are not expected to remain accessible or functioning during a
flood event, though in many instances their functions must resume as soon as
possible after a flood event. Critical facilities also include public
infrastructure such as water distribution and wastewater treatment facilities,
which are expected to remain functioning during a flood event although they may
be temporarily inaccessible or accessible only by watercraft during a flood
event.
   DEVELOPMENT: Any humanmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, the placement of manufactured housing, buildings
or other structures, mining, dredging, streambank erosion control measures,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations. Development is
considered to commence with either the first placement or permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as pouring of a slab or footings,
the installation of pile, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a factory built home on a foundation.
   FLOOD: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas resulting from the overflow of streams or rivers or
from the unusual and rapid runoff of surface waters from any source.
   FLOOD CONTROL STRUCTURAL WORKS: Barriers or storage areas constructed to
control floodwater, modify or redirect a channel.
   FLOOD ELEVATION: The elevation which floodwaters would reach at a particular
site during the occurrence of a specific frequency flood. For instance, the 1%
flood elevation is the elevation of floodwaters with a one percent (1%)
likelihood of occurring in any given year. The 0.2% flood elevation is the
elevation of floodwaters with a two-tenths percent (0.2%) likelihood of
occurring in any given year. In areas of shallow flooding, there is a one
percent (1%) or greater annual chance of flooding to an elevation specified on
the flood insurance rate map.
   FLOOD EVENT:
      500-Year Flood Event: A flood, the magnitude of which has a two-tenths
percent (0.2%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year or which,
on the average, will be equaled or exceeded at least once every five hundred
(500) years.
      100-Year Flood Event: A flood, the magnitude of which has a one percent
(1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year or which, on the
average, will be equaled or exceeded at least once every one hundred (100)
years.
      1% Annual Flood Event: The predicted level of flooding with a one percent
(1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (formerly known as
the 100-year flood event).
      0.2% Annual Flood Event: The predicted level of flooding with a two-
tenths percent (0.2%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year
(formerly known as the 500-year flood event).
   FLOOD HAZARD AREA: Land that is shaded and identified as "AE", "X" or "AH"
on the flood insurance rate map.
   FLOOD HAZARD ELEVATION: In AE zones, the elevation of the 0.2% flood as
profiled in the flood insurance study for Johnson County, Iowa. In areas of
shallow flooding, the elevation of the flood as illustrated on the flood
insurance rate map.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP: The official map prepared as part of (but
published separately from) the flood insurance study which delineates both the
flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: A study initiated, funded and published by the
federal insurance administration for the purpose of evaluating, in detail, the
existence and severity of flood hazards, providing the city with the necessary
information for adopting a floodplain management program and establishing
actuarial flood insurance rates.
   FLOODPLAIN: Any land area susceptible to being inundated by water as a
result of a specific frequency flood. For instance, the 1% floodplain is the
area of land that, in any given year, has a one percent (1%) likelihood of
flooding. The 0.2% floodplain is the area of land that, in any given year, has
a two-tenths percent (0.2%) likelihood of flooding. In areas of shallow
flooding, there is a one percent (1%) or greater annual chance of flooding to a
specified elevation, but a clearly defined channel does not exist, and the path
of flooding is unpredictable.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: An overall program of corrective and preventive
measures for reducing flood damages and for promoting the wise use of
floodplains, including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood
control works, floodproofing and floodplain management regulations.
   FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes or adjustments to structures, including utility and sanitary
facilities, which will reduce or eliminate flood damage to such structures.
   FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to carry and
discharge floodwaters so that confinement of floodwaters to the floodway area
will not result in substantially higher flood elevation.
   FLOODWAY FRINGE: Those portions of the floodplain, other than the floodway,
which can be filled, leveed or otherwise obstructed without causing
substantially higher flood elevations.
   LOWEST FLOOR: The floor of the lowest enclosed area in a building, including
a basement, except when all the following criteria are met:
   A.   The enclosed area is designed to flood to equalize hydrostatic pressure
during floods with walls or openings that satisfy the provisions of subsection
14-5J-7E of this title; and
   B.   The enclosed area is unfinished (not carpeted, drywalled, etc.) and
used solely for low damage potential uses, such as building access, parking or
storage; and
   C.   Machinery and service facilities (e.g., hot water heater, furnace,
electrical service) contained in the enclosed area are located at least one
foot (1') above the flood hazard elevation; and
   D.   The floor is not below grade on all sides.
   MANUFACTURED HOUSING: Any structure designed for residential use which is
wholly or in substantial part, made, fabricated, formed or assembled in
manufacturing facilities for installation or assembly and installation on a
building site. For the purposes of
chapter 5, article J, "Floodplain Management Standards", of this title,
manufactured housing includes factory built homes, mobile homes, manufactured
homes and modular homes and also includes park trailers, travel trailers and
other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty
(180) consecutive days.
   MANUFACTURED HOUSING PARK: A parcel or contiguous parcels of land divided
into two (2) or more manufactured housing lots for rent or sale.

horizontal projection;
   C.   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty
truck; and
   D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as a
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   SHALLOW FLOOD HAZARD AREA: Areas of special flood hazards having shallow
water depths and/or unpredictable flow paths between one and three feet (3'),
and with water surface elevations determined.
   STRUCTURE: Anything constructed or installed on the ground or attached to
the ground, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories, sheds, cabins,
manufactured housing, storage tanks and similar.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the
cost of restoring the structure to its predamaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the assessed or market value as established by an
appraisal paid for at the owner's expense, whichever is greater.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any improvement to a structure that satisfies either
of the following criteria:
   A.   Any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the assessed or market value as
established by an appraisal paid for at the owner's expense, whichever is
greater, of the structure either before the improvement or repair is started
or, if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage
occurred. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is
considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or
other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however,
include any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe conditions for the existing use.
   B.   Any addition which increases the original floor area of a building by
twenty five percent (25%) or more. All additions constructed after May 2, 1977,
shall be added to any proposed addition in determining whether the total
increase in original floor space would exceed twenty five percent (25%). (Ord.

   A.   If the subdivider, its assigns or successors in interest, sell or
convey lots in a subdivision without constructing or installing the public
improvements, the city shall have the right to install and construct such
improvements. The costs of such improvements shall be a lien and charge against
all the lots in the subdivision under the provisions of the code of Iowa, as
amended, except the cost of installing sidewalks which shall be a lien only
against the lot or lots abutting or in front of which sidewalks are installed.
The cost of such improvements need not meet the requirements of notice, benefit
or value as provided by state law for assessing such improvements. The
requirement to construct such improvements is and shall remain a lien from the
date of final plat approval until properly released by the city.
   B.   When required improvements have been installed to the satisfaction of
the city, the city will, upon request, promptly issue to the subdivider, for
recording in the county recorder's office, a good and sufficient release to

certification by the city engineer, in writing, that all of the following
events and/or conditions have been substantially completed:
         a.   Permanent ground cover is established and mowable;
         b.   Erosion and sedimentation are controlled in conformance with the
approved plans and specifications;
         c.   The facilities are complete;
         d.   All land within the tributary area in the development, or a
lesser amount of land as approved by the city engineer, has been developed.

      1.   Upon recommendation of the planning and zoning commission or on its
own motion, the city council may vary, modify or waive the requirements of
chapter 3, "Design Standards And Required Improvements", of this title,
provided one of the following qualifying circumstances are met:
         a.   If the subdivider can demonstrate that strict compliance with the
requirements of chapter 3 of this title would result in extraordinary hardship
because of excessive costs due to nonself-inflicted conditions; and if the
subdivider can demonstrate that strict compliance with the requirements of
chapter 3 of this title would conflict with the objectives of these subdivision
regulations; or
         b.   If a subdivider can demonstrate that strict compliance with the
requirements of chapter 3 of this title would result in subdivision design that
would compromise public health or safety, or could result in the substantial
degradation of natural features even after application of appropriate
provisions of title 14, chapter 5, article I, "Sensitive Lands And Features",
of this code.
      2.   City council may act to vary, modify or waive a requirement only if
it finds that the public safety and interest is protected and that such

   E.   Effect Of Approval: Approval of a preliminary plat by the city council
does not constitute approval of the subdivision but merely authorizes the
subdivider to proceed with the preparation of the final plat. In the event the
city council approves the preliminary plat and the final plat submitted does
not materially and substantially deviate from the preliminary plat and if
inspection by the city reveals that all plans and specifications for
construction of improvements, as required by the city, have been met, the final
plat shall be approved by the city council. Approval of the preliminary plat
shall be effective for a period of twenty four (24) months unless, upon written
request of the owner or subdivider, the city council, by resolution, grants an
extension of time. If the final plat is not filed within twenty four (24)
months, all previous actions of the city council with respect to the plat shall
be deemed null and void. (Ord. 08-4313, 8-26-2008; amd. Ord. 21-4866, 11-16-
2021)
15-2-3: FINAL PLAT:

any stated use restriction or covenant or create any third party beneficiaries
to any noted use restriction or covenant.
      3.   Once the final subdivision plat has been approved by the city
council, a final copy of the digital version of the plat shall be submitted to
the department of public works. Said final digital copy shall be compatible
with the Johnson County geographic information system and city of Iowa City
mapping system. Specific formats, procedures, and methods needed to meet this
requirement will be updated as changes in technology occur.
   C.   Accompanying Documents: The final plat shall also be accompanied by the
following documents:
      1.   Owner's Statement: An acknowledged statement from the owner and the

covenant running with the land, that the city shall not issue a building permit
for any lot in the subdivision until the subdivider installs the public
improvements, except sidewalks, according to plans and specifications approved
by the city engineer and until the city engineer approves subdivision erosion
control measures. If the subdivider desires a building permit prior to
installing the improvements, the owner must deposit with the city finance
department an escrow equal to the cost of improvements plus ten percent (10%)
thereof in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit payable to the city in a
form approved by the city attorney. At the city's discretion, this escrow may
be divided by the number of lots in the subdivision and collected on a per lot
basis prior to the issuance of a building permit. Subdivider must further
agree, as a covenant running with the land, that subdivider will install
sidewalks abutting each lot in the subdivision as set forth in this title, that
the obligation to install the sidewalks remains a lien on the lots abutting the
sidewalk until released by the city and that, in the event subdivider fails to
install the sidewalks, the city may install the sidewalks and assess the total
cost against the property without meeting the requirements of notice, benefit
or value required by state law for assessing improvements.
         b.   The subdivider's agreement shall state that the subdivider,
including its grantees, assignees and successors in interest, agrees that
public services, including, but not limited to, street maintenance, snow and
ice removal and solid waste collection, will not be extended to such
subdivision until the pavement is completed and accepted by the city council by
resolution.
         c.   The subdivider's agreement shall state:
Plat notes and surveyor's notes on plats serve to provide notice of how a
subdivision is expected to develop. Said notes are not intended to create any
vested private interest in any stated use restriction or covenant, or create
any third party beneficiaries to any noted use restriction or covenant. The
City reserves the right, in its sole discretion, subject to any applicable
public notice and approval process required by law, to alter or amend any plat
note, or to sell or vacate any right-of-way, street, alley, park, easement,
open area or other land set apart and dedicated for public use within the plat.
The City further reserves the right, upon request of the owner or successor in
interest, to vacate the plat and/or relocate any easement, alter lot boundaries
or allow said land to be replatted subject to any applicable public notice and
approval process required by law.
         d.   The subdivider's agreement may include other conditions peculiar
to the subdivision as allowed by law.

designated by the city manager.
      2.   Said designee(s) shall examine the application, the plat, the
construction plans, and the legal documents to ensure compliance with the
requirements of this code, state law, and the preliminary plat.
      3.   The costs of engineering examination of final plat and construction
plans shall be paid by the subdivider and shall be the actual costs of the
engineering examination and review as incurred by the city.
      4.   Upon completion of said review staff shall recommend approval or
disapproval of the plat within forty five (45) calendar days of the date the
city received a complete application, or the final plat shall be deemed to be
approved by the staff. The owner or subdivider may, however, agree in writing,
to an extension of time.
      5.   Following staff evaluation, the owner or owner's representative
shall submit copies of the revised final plat as requested by the city with the
signatures of the surveyor and the respective utility companies to the city
clerk.
      6.   After receipt of the recommendation of the staff or after the time
of any extension, the city council shall, by resolution, approve or disapprove
the final plat. The city council must take action on the final plat within
sixty (60) calendar days of submission of a complete application for a final
plat to the city clerk. If the city council does not approve or disapprove the
plat within sixty (60) calendar days, the final plat shall be deemed approved.

15-3-14: Off Site Costs For Public Improvements
15-3-1: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Design of the subdivision shall comply with the standards of this
chapter, provide for the orderly growth and development of the city,
demonstrate consistency with the Iowa City comprehensive plan and any specific
adopted district plans, and take into consideration the natural features of the
site and patterns of adjacent development.
   B.   The subdivider of property shall be responsible for constructing all
public improvements associated with the proposed subdivision according to this
code, unless exempted from such requirements according to the provisions
herein.
   C.   "Public improvements", as defined in this title, shall be constructed
and installed according to the standards established by the city. Copies of
said standards are on file in the office of the city engineer. (Ord. 08-4313,
8-26-2008)
15-3-2: STREETS AND CIRCULATION:
   A.   Connectivity Of Streets, Sidewalks, And Trails: Subdivisions shall
provide for continuation and extension of arterial, collector and local
streets, sidewalks and trails in accordance with the following standards:
      1.   Arterial streets must be located and extended in general accordance
with the metropolitan planning organization of Johnson County arterial street
plan and Iowa City comprehensive plan.
      2.   All streets, sidewalks, and trails should connect to other streets,
sidewalks, and trails within the development, and to the property line to
provide for their extension to adjacent properties. Each subdivision must
contribute to the larger interconnected street pattern of the city to ensure
street connectivity between neighborhoods, multiple travel routes resulting in
the diffusion and distribution of traffic, efficient routes for public and
emergency services, and to provide direct and continuous vehicular and
pedestrian travel routes to neighborhood destinations.
      3.   The road system shall be designed to permit the safe, efficient, and
orderly movement of vehicular and pedestrian traffic; to meet the needs of the
present and future population served; to have a simple and logical pattern and
allow that pattern to continue through adjacent properties; and to respect
natural features and topography.
      4.   Use of cul-de-sacs and other roadways with a single point of access
should be avoided. Cul-de-sacs will be considered where it can be clearly
demonstrated that environmental constraints, existing development, access
limitations along arterial streets, or other unusual features prevent the
extension of the street to the property line or to interconnect with other
streets within or abutting the subdivision.
      5.   Where the area is subject to Article 14-2H (Zones And Standards),
thoroughfares are to create walkable neighborhoods with redundant routes for
vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian circulation. The arrangement of thoroughfares
shall provide for the alignment and continuation of existing or proposed
thoroughfares into adjoining lands where the adjoining lands are undeveloped
and intended for future development, or where the adjoining lands are
undeveloped and include opportunities for such connections.
         a.   Thoroughfare rights-of-way shall be extended to or along
adjoining property boundaries to provide a roadway connection or thoroughfare
stub for development, in compliance with
15-3-4 (Layout Of Blocks And Lots), for each direction (north, south, east, and
west) in which development abuts vacant land.
         b.   All stubs for thoroughfares are to connect with future
thoroughfares on adjoining property and be designed to transition
appropriately.
   B.   Minimum Access Standards: Adequate street access to an area or
neighborhood is required as part of subdivision approval or prior to the
approval of additional subdivision lots. The standards in this subsection are
intended as minimum standards in areas where connectivity is limited by
topography, previous development patterns, or other unusual features and shall
not be used as a means of circumventing the street connectivity standards set
forth in subsection A of this section. The following guidelines will be used by
the city in determining whether additional street access is a prerequisite to
additional lots or developable parcels being approved by the city.
      1.   Additional access may be required if a proposed development will
result in any portion of a street that provides a single means of access to an
area being overburdened with traffic. "Overburdened" shall be defined as a
projected volume which exceeds the midpoint design volume as follows:
         a.   Local street: Five hundred (500) vehicles per day.
         b.   Collector street: Two thousand five hundred (2,500) vehicles per
day.
      2.   Projected traffic volumes shall be determined by using the most
recent average daily traffic count when available, and adding it to projected
traffic generation as determined by the city. In the absence of a recent
traffic count, projected traffic volumes shall be calculated by using projected
traffic generation for both existing and proposed development.
      3.   Additional means of access may also be required if any of the
following conditions exist or will exist if additional lots or developable
parcels are approved:
         a.   There are physical features that may increase the probability of
blockages along the single means of access to the development. These physical
features include, but are not limited to: slopes eight percent (8%) or greater;
floodplains as designated by the federal emergency management agency; a bridged
or culverted roadway; trees adjacent to the roadway with trunk diameter greater
than four inches (4"); a grade separated highway; or a railroad.
         b.   The existing access is insufficient to provide efficient, safe,
and/or cost effective routes for the provision of public and emergency services
for the proposed development.
         c.   The street, which provides a single means of access to the area,
is a local or collector street along which there are existing or proposed
facilities that may increase the probability of pedestrian-motor vehicle
conflicts. These facilities include, but are not limited to, schools, daycare
centers and parks.
         d.   There are land uses located along the subject street that serve
special populations, which may increase the volume of emergency vehicle trips.
These uses include, but are not limited to, adult daycares, facilities serving
elderly persons, or persons with disabilities.
      4.   For a situation requiring additional means of access based on the
above criteria, a single means of access may be permitted as a temporary
condition. A temporary condition is one in which there is secured, written
assurance from the private subdivider that the road, which will provide the
necessary access, will be constructed within three (3) years of development or,
alternatively, said access is scheduled for construction no later than the
third year of the then current capital improvements program of the city.
   C.   Street Types:
      1.   
Table 15-1, "Standards For Street Rights Of Way", of this section provides a
summary of various street types. The information in this table is intended to
provide guidance for the design of the street network within a subdivision,
except for those subdivisions regulated by Article 14-2H (Form- Based Zones And
Standards). When designing a subdivision, street types should be chosen based
on the intended function of the street and anticipated level of traffic. The
city will review the proposed streets and determine the appropriate street type
based on the factors set forth in this section.
      2.   Where a subdivision is regulated by Article 14-2H (Form-Based Zones
And Standards), streets shall meet the following thoroughfare standards.
         a.   Thoroughfares shall conform with allowed thoroughfare types and
shall comply with
14-2H-9 (Thoroughfare Type Standards).
         b.   Thoroughfares that pass from one Form-Based Zone to another may
transition in their streetscape along the thoroughfare's edges. For example, a
thoroughfare in a more urban zone (e.g.,T4 Main Street) with commercial uses
may have wide sidewalks with trees that transitions to narrower sidewalks with
a planting strip in a less urban zone (e.g., T4 Neighborhood Medium) with
residential uses.
         c.   Thoroughfares shall substantially comply with the Form-Based Code
Future Land Use Map in the Comprehensive Plan. Variations from the Future Land
Use Map may be approved for thoroughfares where sensitive areas are present, or
where the following standards are met:
            (1)   Thoroughfare types may be substituted with other thoroughfare
types allowed by the zone, except for the following streets: South Gilbert
Street, Sand Road SE, McCollister Boulevard, Sycamore Street, Sycamore Street
SE, and Lehman Avenue.
            (2)   The alignment of thoroughfares may change where connections
to existing street stubs are retained, the new alignment complies with
15-3-4 (Layout Of Blocks And Lots), and single-loaded streets continue to abut
civic or open space.
            (3)   A Passage (
14-2H-9L) may replace another thoroughfare type shown on the Form-Based Code
Future Land Use Map where all affected design sites retain direct street or
alley access. A passage may be removed or replaced by another thoroughfare type
where all abutting design site(s) retain direct street access.
            (4)   An alley (
14-2H-9K) may be added in compliance with
15-3-4 (Layout Of Blocks And Lots). An alley may be removed from locations
identified on the Form-Based Code Future Land Use Map where the alley is not in
a T4MS zone and all design sites abutting the alley have direct street access
to a street other than the following: McCollister Boulevard and South Gilbert
Street.
   D.   Dedication Of Right Of Way: Land shall be dedicated to the city for all
public street rights of way within the development and for any public street
right of way that is needed for streets that abut or will abut the development.

Notes:
   1.   Loop streets provide access for 12 or fewer dwellings.
   2.   Low volume cul-de-sacs provide access to 10 or fewer single-family
dwellings.
   3.   For residential streets with less than 28 feet of pavement width,
parking is restricted to one side.
   E.   Measurements And Construction Standards:
      1.   All right of way improvements must be designed and constructed
according to the design and construction standards established by the city.
Said standards are on file in the office of the city engineer.
      2.   All street widths shall be measured back of curb to back of curb.
      3.   The minimum outside radius of the pavement of cul-de-sac bulbs and
loop streets is thirty nine feet (39'). A center median is required at the
center of the cul-de-sac bulb with a minimum radius of eleven feet (11'). For
loop streets a median is also required with a minimum width of thirty feet
(30'). In residential areas, center medians for cul-de-sacs and loop streets
are required to be landscaped to at least the S1 standard as described in title
14, chapter 5, article F, "Screening And Buffering Standards", of this code.
The subdivider's agreement shall designate and set forth procedures for
property owners or a homeowners' association to maintain the landscaped area
within the center median of loop streets and cul-de-sacs. Said instrument shall
provide that if said services are not provided as required therein, the city
shall have the right to perform said services, and the cost thereof shall be a
lien and charge against all of the subject lots.
   F.   Street Intersections:
      1.   A maximum of four (4) legs are allowed at any one intersection.
      2.   The distance between street intersections must be at least one
hundred twenty five feet (125') centerline to centerline.
      3.   Intersections of street centerlines shall be between eighty degrees
(80°) and one hundred degrees (100°).
      4.   Corner lots abutting on an arterial or collector street shall have a
minimum radius of fifteen feet (15') at the intersection.
      5.   Dead end streets and alleys are not permitted except at subdivision
boundaries abutting undeveloped areas. In such cases a temporary fire apparatus
accommodating turnaround may be required and, if required, must be constructed
to city specifications.
   G.   Traffic Calming Features:
      1.   The street network, block length, and layout of lots should be
designed in a manner that discourages speeding traffic and unsafe driving
behavior.
      2.   In order to minimize the potential for speeding traffic and create a
safer environment for pedestrians and bicycles, the city may also, in cases
where it is warranted, require traffic calming features to be designed into the
subdivision. These features may include, but are not limited to, discontinuous
streets, curb extensions, raised crosswalks, medians, or traffic circles.
   H.   Street Names: The city reserves the right to deny the use of street
names that are not in the public interest. Street names must be consistent with
the following standards, unless an exception is approved by the city:
      1.   In order to ensure safe and efficient provision of public and
emergency services, each proposed street name shall be distinct from other
street names within the larger metropolitan area;
      2.   Street names that are overly lengthy, difficult to pronounce, or
that may be considered inappropriate or unappealing shall be avoided;
      3.   For new streets, the following rules apply:
         a.   The term "street", should be used for a nondead end roadway
aligned in a north-south direction;
         b.   The term "avenue" should be used for a nondead end roadway
aligned in an east-west direction;
         c.   The term "boulevard", "road", or "drive" may be used for a
roadway that is aligned neither in a north-south nor east-west direction, but
which changes direction or meanders;
         d.   The terms "lane", "court", "circle", "place" should be used for
cul-de-sacs or low volume loop streets.
      4.   Cul-de-sacs or low volume loop streets may use the same name as the
roadway with which it intersects. For example, a cul-de-sac that intersects
with Rose Avenue may be named "Rose Court". However, if more than one cul-de-
sac or loop street intersects with Rose Avenue, an additional "Rose" name may
not be used.
      5.   Similar names may not be used for streets that are in different
locations within the city. For example, the name "Rose Drive" may not be used
in one neighborhood if there is already a "Rose Avenue" in a different
neighborhood.
   I.   Private Streets:
      1.   Private streets in single-family residential areas are not allowed.
      2.   Requests for private streets in multi-family, commercial, and
industrial areas will be considered, provided that connectivity to adjacent
properties is not needed and the responsibilities for maintenance, snow
removal, garbage service, and street sweeping is clearly established according
to the provisions of subsection I3 of this section.
      3.   If private streets are approved, the subdivider must submit a
legally binding instrument setting forth the procedures to be followed for
maintaining private streets and providing garbage service, snow removal, street
sweeping, and for financing these services. Such costs shall be shared by all
owners of property located within the subdivision, or designated portion
thereof, through the use of an owners' association or other entity satisfactory
to the city. Said instrument shall provide that if said services are not
provided as required therein, the city shall have the right to perform said
services, and the cost thereof shall be a lien and charge against all of the
owners of lots so designated in the subdivision.
   J.   Cost Sharing For Pavement Overwidth: In the event arterial or collector
streets are required in a subdivision, the city shall pay for the excess
pavement required over that required for a twenty eight foot (28') wide local
street. The city engineer shall calculate the excess cost. Such cost sharing
shall be according to the procedure set forth by the city manager. Any payment
for pavement overwidth by the city shall be pursuant to state law.
   K.   Cost Sharing For Street Upgrades:
      1.   At the discretion of the city, subdivisions may be approved that
access existing public streets that do not meet city standards, provided the
subdivider contributes toward the future reconstruction cost of bringing the
segment of the subject street that abuts the subject property to city
standards. When determining whether such an approval will be granted, the city
will evaluate the street based on factors such as roadway surface, sight
distance, anticipated traffic levels, and pedestrian/bicycle facilities. If the
city permits a development to access a street that does not meet city
standards, the subdivider shall contribute to the cost as follows:
         a.   Local Streets: Local streets are streets that serve as access to
property and carry insignificant amounts of through traffic. Therefore, the
subdivider shall pay one hundred percent (100%) of the cost of upgrading a
local street to city standards for that segment of the street that abuts the
subject property. If the subdivider controls land on only one side of a local
street, they will be required to contribute fifty percent (50%) of the cost of
upgrading the subject street segment to city standards. The city will expect
the subdivider of property on the other side of the street to contribute the
other fifty percent (50%) of the costs at such time as that land is subdivided/
developed. Costs to reconstruct the street will be determined by the city
engineer.
         b.   Collector Streets: Collector streets are streets that collect
traffic from a subdivision or neighborhood, and direct it to and from the
arterial street. The function of a collector street is fifty percent (50%)
access to property, and fifty percent (50%) through traffic. Therefore, the
subdivider will be required to contribute fifty percent (50%) of the cost to
upgrade a collector street to city standards for that segment of the street
that abuts the subject property, with the city contributing the other fifty
percent (50%). If a subdivider controls land on only one side of the collector
street, they will be required to contribute twenty five percent (25%) of the
total cost for the subject street segment. The city will expect the subdivider
on the other side of the collector street to contribute the other twenty five
percent (25%) of the cost at such time as that land is subdivided/developed.
Costs to reconstruct the street to city standards will be determined by the
city engineer.
         c.   Arterial Streets: Arterial streets have the primary function of
carrying traffic through and between neighborhoods. The function of an arterial
street is twenty five percent (25%) access to property, and seventy five
percent (75%) through traffic. Therefore, the subdivider will be required to
contribute twenty five percent (25%) of the cost to upgrade an arterial street
to city standards for that segment of the street that abuts the subject
property, with the city contributing the other seventy five percent (75%). If a
subdivider controls land on only one side of the arterial street, they will be
required to contribute 12.5 percent of the total cost of the subject street
segment. The city will expect the subdivider on the other side of the arterial
street to contribute the other 12.5 percent of the cost at such time as that
land is subdivided/developed. Costs to reconstruct the street to city standards
will be determined by the city engineer. (Ord. 08-4313, 8-26-2008; amd. Ord.
21-4866, 11-16-2021)
15-3-3: SIDEWALKS, TRAILS, AND PEDESTRIAN CONNECTIONS:
Public sidewalks, trails, and pedestrian connections shall be constructed in
the public right of way according to the following standards:
   A.   Sidewalks, trails, and pedestrian connections shall be constructed
according to city standards. Said standards are on file in the office of the
city engineer.
   B.   Five foot (5') wide concrete sidewalks must be constructed along both
sides of all local and collector streets, except for connections to existing
sidewalks as provided in subsection D of this section. For low volume and loop
streets, as described in
table 15-1 of section
15-3-2 of this chapter, the required sidewalk width may be reduced to four feet
(4').
   C.   Along arterial streets, a five foot (5') sidewalk is required on one
side of the street and an eight foot (8') sidewalk on the other side, except as
allowed in subsection D of this section. The city will determine on which side
of the street the eight foot (8') sidewalk will be placed. When an eight foot
(8') sidewalk is required, the city, at its discretion, will either pay for the
excess pavement required for the developer to install an eight foot (8')
sidewalk rather than a five foot (5') sidewalk, or collect the estimated cost
of the five foot (5') sidewalk from the developer and apply said cost to
construction of an eight foot (8') sidewalk by the city. Any payment of excess
pavement costs by the city shall be pursuant to state law.
   D.   In cases where the proposed sidewalk provides a connection between
existing sidewalks that are less than the required width, the proposed sidewalk
may be constructed to match the width of the adjacent sidewalks. However, this
modification is not allowed in cases where one end of the proposed sidewalk
will provide a connection to future sidewalks for new development. In such a
case, the sidewalk should be tapered to provide a transition between differing
sidewalk widths. The city will determine where along the street the transition
should occur.
   E.   All sidewalks and trails must connect to other sidewalks and trails
within the development and to the property line to provide for their extension
to adjacent properties.
   F.   The subdivider will be responsible for the construction of a public
sidewalk along the frontage of private open space, public open space required
to be dedicated to the city according to title 14, chapter 5, article K,
"Neighborhood Open Space Requirements", of this code and along the frontage of
other outlots as necessary for a continuous sidewalk system to be created.
   G.   In residential subdivisions, blocks longer than six hundred feet (600')
must have midblock pedestrian connections between adjacent streets, unless said
connection is deemed to be unnecessary and is waived by the city. At the time
of subdivision, these connections must be platted as minimum fifteen foot (15')
wide easements; if the connecting sidewalk is greater than five feet (5') in
width, the easement must be at least twenty feet (20') wide. Within this
easement a sidewalk must be constructed to city standards that is equal in
width to the sidewalks to which it provides a connection. If the midblock
sidewalk connects to sidewalks of two (2) different widths, the midblock
sidewalk must be equal in width to the wider sidewalk. The area and sidewalk
within the pedestrian easement must be maintained by adjacent property owners
according to the subdivider's agreement in a manner similar to maintenance
requirements for public sidewalks.
   H.   Where a trail extension, as identified in the comprehensive plan or an
adopted trails plan, is located on the subject property, the city may require
an easement or alternatively, may require dedication of an outlot for the
trail. Construction of the trail or portion of a trail may also be required in
instances where said trail or portion of a trail primarily serves the needs of
the proposed subdivision/development. In this situation, the trail will be
treated as a public improvement. Dedication of land for a trail extension shall
count toward the open space requirement for the development, provided said land
is consistent with the standards for open space as set forth in title 14,
chapter 5, article K of this code and provided said land dedication is
acceptable to the city. (Ord. 08-4313, 8-26-2008)
15-3-4: LAYOUT OF BLOCKS AND LOTS:
   A.   Blocks:
      1.   Blocks should be limited in size and be laid out in a pattern that
ensures the connectivity of streets, provides for efficient provision of public
and safety services, and establishes efficient and logical routes between
residences and nonresidential destinations and public gathering places.
      2.   Block Lengths:
         a.   Except as required by Article 14-2H (Form-Based Zones And
Standards), to provide multiple travel routes within and between neighborhoods,
block faces along local and collector streets should range between three
hundred (300) and six hundred feet (600') in length and for residential
subdivisions have a width sufficient to accommodate two (2) tiers of lots.
Longer block faces may be allowed in cases of large lot commercial, industrial,
or rural residential development, or where topography, water features, or
existing development prevents shorter block lengths, although midblock
pedestrian connections may be required (see section 15-3-3 of this chapter).
Block faces are measured from centerline to centerline.
         b.   Where the area is subject to Article 14-2H (Form-Based Zones And
Standards), the block network shall substantially comply with the Form-Based
Code Future Land Use Map in the Comprehensive Plan and shall meet the following
standards:
            (1)   Individual block lengths and the total block perimeter shall
comply with the standards in
Table 15-3-4A-1 (Block Size Standards). Where a block contains multiple Form-
Based Zones, the most intense zone is to be used to establish the standards for
block size. Blocks may exceed the maximum allowed length if a compliant passage
(
14-2H-9L) is provided to break up the block.

Key: _ . . _  Block Perimeter _ . . _ Design Site
         (2)   Blocks shall be a minimum width to result in two (2) halves of
developable design sites in compliance with the minimum design site depth
standards of the allowed building types in the Form-Based Zone. When the zone
has a range of minimum design site depths, the applicant may show the shortest
minimum design site depth with an acknowledgement that the selected depth may
not accommodate the full range of building types allowed by the zone. A single
half is allowed when adjoining an existing half-block.
         (3)   The size, shape, length, location, and design of blocks may vary
from the Future Land Use Map where required to accommodate sensitive areas, or
where the variation complies maintains street connectivity, complies with
Table 15-3-4A-1 (Block Size Standards, minimizes changes to Form-Based Zones on
each block, and adjusts all blocks affected by the proposed change(s). Where
this affects the location, shape, or design of civic space, the variation shall
maintain civic space of a similar size in a nearby location within the
subdivision.
      3.   Block faces along arterial streets should be at least six hundred
feet (600') in length. Intersecting collector streets should be spaced in a
manner that provides adequate connectivity between neighborhoods, but also
maintains the capacity of the street for the safe and efficient movement of
traffic. Longer block faces may be required along high capacity or higher speed
arterial streets where the interests in moving traffic outweigh the
connectivity between areas of development. The city may approve shorter block
faces in high density commercial areas or other areas with high pedestrian
counts.
      4.   Cul-de-sacs may not exceed nine hundred feet (900') in length. The
length of a cul-de-sac is measured from the centerline of the street from which
it commences to the center of the bulb.
      5.   Adjustments To Block Size Standards:
         a.   The individual block lengths and the total block perimeter
standards of each zone in this section may be adjusted as part of the
subdivision process. In considering an adjustment, the Director of Neighborhood
and Development Services shall find that the proposed adjustment meets the
following criteria:
            (1)   Demonstrates that one or more of the following special
circumstances apply to the property, which make it impractical to comply with
the block size standards:
               (A)   The adjustment is needed to avoid a regulated sensitive
area.
               (B)   The adjustment is needed to reduce the amount of grading
needed due to the property's existing topography.
               (C)   The adjustment is needed because the alignment of an
existing street that must be extended creates a configuration that makes
compliance impractical.
               (D)   The adjustment is needed because the abutting neighborhood
is designed with longer blocks that impact the proposed development. The new
blocks abutting the existing longer blocks cannot accommodate new streets and
pedestrian passages are infeasible.
               (E)   The adjustment is needed because a single-loaded street or
passage has been determined to be undesirable for the block to protect the
sensitive nature of public parkland.
               (F)   The adjustment is needed because visibility and access to
public parks, civic uses, and natural open spaces are provided through other
means besides a single-loaded street.
            (2)   The adjustment will not be detrimental to the public health,
safety, or welfare or be injurious to other property or improvements in the
vicinity and in the zone in which the property is located.
            (3)   The adjustment requested is in conformity with the intent and
purpose of the regulation modified.
            (4)   The requested adjustment complies with other applicable
statutes, ordinances, laws, and regulations.
   B.   Lots:
      1.   Lots must be platted in a manner that will allow development that
meets all requirements of title 14, "Zoning Code", of this code. Lots and
design sites must be of sufficient size to accommodate an adequate buildable
area and area for required setbacks, off street parking, and service facilities
required by the type of use and development anticipated.
      2.   Lots with multiple frontages must be platted large enough to
accommodate front setback requirements along street side lot lines.
      3.   If a property with frontage along an arterial street is proposed to
be subdivided, developed or redeveloped for any multi-family, group living,
commercial, institutional or industrial use, a cross access easement must be
provided by the property owner to all adjoining properties that front on the
same arterial street that are or may be developed as multi-family, group
living, commercial, institutional use, or industrial uses according to the
cross access standards set forth in section
14-5C-7 of this code.
      4.   In residential areas, double and triple frontage lots shall be
avoided. Where such lots are necessary to overcome specific disadvantages of
topography, land features, or access restrictions, the following standards
apply:
         a.   Lots with multiple frontages shall be one hundred twenty five
percent (125%) of the required lot area for the zone in which the lot is
located. The additional required lot area shall be used to increase the depth
of the lot between street frontages. Corner lots with only two (2) frontages
are exempt from this requirement, however, said corner lots should be platted
with enough land area to accommodate the required front setback area along both
frontages.
         b.   Double and triple frontage lots where dwellings will have side or
rear building facades oriented toward an arterial street shall provide a
minimum twenty foot (20') wide landscaped buffer area along the arterial street
frontage. The buffer area shall be planted with a mixture of coniferous and
deciduous vegetation approved by the city forester. The vegetation shall be
required along with other public improvements for the property. Lots where
dwellings will have front building facades oriented toward an arterial street
are exempt from this requirement. If a buffer area was required during
subdivision, no solid fences will be allowed within this buffer area. This
restriction must be noted in the subdivider's agreement and on the plat. On
corner lots, the landscaping within the buffer must be planted and maintained
to comply with intersection visibility standards.
      5.   Side lot lines shall approximate right angles to straight street
lines or be approximately radial to curved street lines, except where a
variation will provide a better street and lot layout. For purposes of this
subsection, "approximate right angles" means angles between eighty degrees
(80°) and one hundred degrees (100°).
      6.   Residential lots shall not be designed with irregular shapes such as
a flag or panhandle shape where the structure on the lot may be hidden from the
street behind another structure.
      7.   In residential subdivisions, lots must be arranged to allow easy
access to public open space. The subdivision layout should be designed so that
the location and access to public open space is readily apparent to the public.
Subdivision layouts where public open space is surrounded by private lots that
back up to the public open space are discouraged. Techniques, such as single
loaded streets along park edges or along segments of park edges and well marked
trail easements are to be utilized to satisfy this requirement.
   C.   Provisions To Minimize The Effect Of Highway Noise: Subdivisions
adjacent to or within three hundred feet (300') of the Interstate 80 and/or the
Highway 218 rights of way shall comply with the following provisions, intended
to reduce the effect of highway noise on residential areas:
      1.   Any portion of a residential lot that is within three hundred feet
(300') of the Interstate 80 or Highway 218 right of way shall be identified as
a noise buffer, and no residential structure will be permitted within this
three hundred foot (300') buffer area. The buffer area shall be planted with a
mixture of coniferous and deciduous vegetation approved by the city forester.
The vegetation shall be required along with other public improvements for the
property. Existing trees and vegetation may be used to comply with this
requirement as approved by the city forester. Accessory structures and yards
are permitted within the three hundred foot (300') buffer area provided the
required vegetative buffer is maintained.
      2.   The three hundred foot (300') buffer for residential structures may
be reduced with approval by the city if the subdivider constructs an earthen
berm, decorative wall, or other similar structure and demonstrates that the
highway noise just outside the proposed residential structures will be no more
than sixty (60) dB.
      3.   The three hundred foot (300') buffer for residential structures may
also be reduced with approval by the city if the subdivider demonstrates that
existing topography results in highway noise being no more than sixty (60) dB
just outside the proposed residential structures.  (Ord. 08-4313, 8-26-2008;
amd. Ord. 21-4866, 11-16-2021; Ord. 25-4953, 5-6-2025)
15-3-5: NEIGHBORHOOD OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Intent And Purpose: The neighborhood open space requirements are
intended to ensure provision of adequate usable neighborhood open space, parks
and recreation facilities in a manner that is consistent with the parks master
plan, as amended, by using a fair and reasonably calculable method to equitably
apportion the costs of acquiring and/or developing land for those purposes.
Active, usable neighborhood open space includes pedestrian/bicycle trails
preferably located within natural greenway systems, private open space that is
publicly accessible, and neighborhood parks that serve nearby residents.
   B.   Dedication Of Land Or Payment Of Fees In Lieu Of Land Required: The
dedication of land shall be reviewed as part of the preliminary subdivision
plat. As a condition of approval for preliminary plats containing residential
uses, the applicant shall dedicate land or pay a fee in lieu of land, or a
combination thereof, for park, greenway, recreational and open space purposes,
as determined by the city and in accordance with the provisions of title 14,
chapter 5, article K, "Neighborhood Open Space Requirements", of this code.

Mailboxes should be located in a manner that provides safe access for
residents, e.g., does not require residents to cross heavily trafficked
streets. Driveways shall be allowed no closer than twelve feet (12') from the
location of a clustered mailbox as measured along the curb line of the fronting
street. Mailboxes must be located in a manner that will not violate the city's
intersection visibility standards. Locations and design must be approved by the
city and the United States postal service. Depending on the size and location
of the clustered mailbox, the city may require a vehicular pull over lane built
to city specifications.
   C.   Mailbox clusters shall be located on a concrete pad built to city
specifications. To provide for pedestrian access, a five foot (5') wide
concrete sidewalk shall be provided from the mailbox cluster to the adjacent
public street and sidewalk. An accessible route shall be provided according to
ADA standards for accessible design. In situations where there are a large
number of mailboxes, the cluster site should be designed and located as an
attractive and integrated component of the neighborhood (e.g., covering or
shade structure, landscaping, setbacks, parking or vehicle access) in order to
ensure that it does not detract from properties immediately adjacent to it. The
cost of installation, including, but not limited to, box units and concrete pad
and sidewalk access shall be borne by the developer, and subsequent maintenance
shall be the responsibility of the homeowners' association and/or the United

to the average two (2) month billing for the account holder's account. The
average two (2) month billing shall be based upon the actual billings during
the prior twelve (12) month billing periods. If the account holder already has
a combined deposit on file with the City, that deposit amount will
proportionally reduce the delinquency deposit. The delinquency deposit can be
waived if the account holder enrolls in SurePay.

and consent shall be deemed given for such access when service is requested and
when an account holder receives city utility services.
      3.   Notwithstanding the above, when an individual account holder is
billed under two (2) or more accounts for water, wastewater and/or solid waste
service at two (2) or more separate locations, a delinquency in payment for
service provided at any one or more of the locations shall be cause for the
city to discontinue service at all service locations for that account holder
regardless of whether the accounts for service at those other locations are
delinquent.
   B.   Restoration Of Service; Fees And Charges:
      1.   Upon payment of all due and payable water, wastewater and solid
waste service charges, including fees and penalties, the city shall cause the

such persons previously occupying the premises have vacated the premises as
verified, in writing, by the rental property owner or manager.
      2.   All payments required to restore the account holder's service shall
be in the form of cash, money order or a cashier's check, or credit card.
      3.   It shall be prohibited for any person to restore or attempt to
restore water, wastewater or solid waste service at a location where those
services have been discontinued unless and until the city authorizes such
restoration.
      4.   The director of finance is authorized to adopt and promulgate
billing and collection procedures for water, wastewater and solid waste service
accounts, including records. Such procedures shall be approved by the city
manager and city attorney.

16-3A-8: FEES AND BILLING PROCEDURE UPON CHANGE IN TENANT ACCOUNT:
   A.   When a tenant notifies the city that the tenant is moving from the
property receiving city utility service, and the city has received no
authorization for service to a new tenant, the city shall automatically place
the account into the name of the property owner. Billings generated during the
first fifteen (15) calendar days after a rental property account has been put
into the owner's name shall include charges for actual water and wastewater
use; no minimum charges or solid waste charges will be included. In such
instances, the meter(s) need not be removed, and no service fee shall be
charged. When an owner receives a bill for water, wastewater and/or solid waste
service for the interim period between tenants, the owner may determine that
the bill should be paid by the tenant and inform the tenant of the tenant's
responsibility to pay the bill. Upon written notification from the owner, the
city will transfer the billed amount to the new tenant's account.
   B.   If an owner determines that a tenant is responsible for city services
to a property, and the owner has not authorized the city to provide services,
the owner may request, in writing, that the city provide a posting notice
regarding incomplete service application and the city's intention to
discontinue service within five (5) calendar days of that notice. If the tenant
fails to complete the service application, the city shall discontinue service
as otherwise provided in this chapter. (1994 Code)

16-3B-8: PROJECT SPECIFIC TAP ON FEE FOR THE SCOTT BOULEVARD TRUNK SEWER
PROJECT:
   A.   General Project Description:
      1.   The Scott Boulevard trunk sewer, completed in 1998, serves the
southeasterly area of the city of Iowa City. The Scott Boulevard trunk sewer
includes sanitary sewer ranging in size from eight inch (8") to sixty six inch
(66") and totaling approximately twelve thousand (12,000) linear feet. Also
included is the removal of the Heinz Lift Station and the Village Green Lift
Station. Areas currently not within the city's boundary, when annexed, will be
served by this trunk sewer.
      2.   The city council determined that installation of the project would
facilitate development of the southeast side of Iowa City as designated in
figure 1 of this section.
      3.   Certain agreements regarding the payment of tap on fees have been
negotiated between the city of Iowa City as follows:
         a.   Subdivider's agreement recorded at book 1840, page 108, records
of the Johnson County recorder between the city and village partners in
connection with the subdivision of Village Green part 13 and applying to
Village Green part 13 and remaining portions of Village Green as described
therein.
         b.   Agreements recorded at book 2371, page 178, book 2391, page 199

the Scott Six Industrial Park.
         c.   Conditional zoning and subdivider's agreements applying to
Windsor Ridge Addition, parts 1 through 14.
   B.   Actions Taken By City Council In Approving The Project:
      1.   On November 8, 1994, the city council adopted resolution 94-339
authorizing an agreement with MMS Consultants to design the Scott Boulevard
trunk sewer project. On June 17, 1997, the city council held a public hearing
on the plans, specifications, form of contract, and cost estimate. Following
the public hearing the city council passed resolution 97-204 approving the
plans and specifications of the project and authorizing advertisement for bids.
The city council awarded the project construction contract to Barbarossa and
Sons, Inc., on July 15, 1997, by resolution 97-244. The city council accepted
the work for the project improvements on July 7, 1998, by resolution 98-223.
      2.   The city council authorized the issuance of sewer revenue bonds as
interim financing to pay the construction costs of the project by resolution
97-181.
   C.   Total Project Cost: The total actual cost of the project, as certified
by the city engineer, is three million one hundred ninety two thousand five
hundred eighty two dollars twenty one cents ($3,192,582.21). This includes nine
hundred four thousand three hundred ninety four dollars twenty four cents
($904,394.24) in interest costs.
   D.   Total Area Benefited: The project benefits a total of one thousand
eight hundred eighty (1,880) acres (see figure 1 of this section).
   E.   Building Permits: All tap on fees must be paid prior to connection to
the city's sanitary sewer. No building permits, final subdivision plats or
final approval of planned area developments shall be issued for any parcel or
tract of land located in the benefited area until the property owner or
building permit applicant pays the tap on fee for that parcel or tract.
   F.   Schedule Of Fees: The tap on fee for the benefited area shall be one
thousand six hundred ninety eight dollars eighteen cents ($1,698.18) per acre.
The fee reflects the actual costs of the benefits associated with the area and
is in addition to any other project specific tap on fees established.
   G.   Agreements With Developers: The city may, in its discretion, enter into
agreements with developers subdividing property in the benefited area, to allow
equalization of the tap on fees among the lots in the subdivision, including
agreement for the prepayment of tap on fees and development sequencing. Such
agreements shall not in any way alter the requirements regarding building
permits set forth in subsection E of this section.
   H.   Properties Exempt From Project Specific Tap On Ordinance:
      1.   Existing platted subdivisions as of July 7, 1998, previously
assessed for sanitary sewer service provided by the Heinz Lift Station and the

16-3B-10: PROJECT SPECIFIC TAP-ON FEE FOR THE SCOTT PARK TRUNK SEWER PROJECT:
   A.   General Project Description:
      1.   The Scott park trunk sewer project ("project") provides gravity
sanitary sewer to areas northeast of Court Street and Scott Boulevard to
Rochester Avenue. This trunk sewer is an extension of sanitary sewer to areas
that previously could not be served by gravity sewer and was made possible by
the upgrade of the Court Hill trunk sewer. The project included the
construction of fourteen (14) manholes and three thousand two hundred fifty
(3,250) linear feet of sanitary sewer pipe ranging from eight inches (8") to
eighteen inches (18") in diameter.
      2.   The city council determined that the project would facilitate
development of the northeast side of Iowa City as designated in figure 1 of
this section and encourage compact, contiguous development in the area with
sanitary sewer service provided at a reasonable cost.
   B.   Actions Taken By City Council In Approving The Project:
      1.   On August 19, 2003, the city council held a public hearing on the
plans, specifications, form of contract, and cost estimate. Following the
public hearing the city council passed resolution 03-213 approving the project
and fixing the date for bids. The city council awarded the project construction
contract to Bockenstedt Excavating, Inc., on September 23, 2003, via resolution
03-297. The city council accepted the work for the project on May 18, 2004, via
resolution 04-147.
   C.   Total Project Cost: The total actual cost of the project, as certified
by the city engineer, is two hundred twenty two thousand seven hundred sixty
nine dollars sixty two cents ($222,769.62).
   D.   Total Area Benefited: The project benefits a total of 189.21 acres (see
figure 1 of this section).
   E.   Building Permits: All tap-on fees must be paid prior to connection with
the city's sanitary sewer. No building permits shall be issued for any parcel
or tract of land located in the benefited area until the property owner or
building permit applicant pays the tap-on fee for that parcel or tract.
   F.   Schedule Of Fees: The tap-on fee for the benefited area shall be one
thousand thirty eight dollars twenty six cents ($1,038.26) per acre. The fee
reflects the actual costs of the benefits associated with the area and is in
addition to any other project specific tap-on fees established.
   G.   Agreements With Developers: The city may, in its discretion, enter into
agreements with developers subdividing property in the benefited area to allow
equalization of the tap-on fees among the lots in the subdivision, including
agreement for the prepayment of tap-on fees and development sequencing. Such
agreements shall not in any way alter the requirements regarding building
permits set forth in subsection E of this section.
   H.   Properties Exempt From Project Specific Tap-On Fee Ordinance: This
project serves 10.03 acres of existing development. No tap-on fees will be
charged to residents in this area, which includes the addresses on Hummingbird
Lane south of Lower West Branch Road.

16-3E-3: COMPLIANCE REQUIRED; GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Wastewater Treatment By Industrial Users: Industrial users shall
provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this article
and shall achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment
standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment
regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level
acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated and maintained at the
industrial user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities
and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be
acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such
plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent
acceptable to the city under the provisions of this article. Any subsequent
changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported
to and be acceptable to the city prior to the industrial user's initiation of
the changes. (1978 Code §33-30.11; amd. Ord. 96-3731, 4-23-1996)
   B.   Holding Tank Waste Transporter Permit Required:
      1.   Holding tank waste transporters, also known as waste haulers, may
not contribute to the POTW unless a written permit has first been applied for
and approved by the director or designee. In addition, holding tank waste
transporters contributing waste from industrial operations shall also first
obtain prior written approval from the director or designee for each load/
contribution to the POTW. The director may adopt written procedures to govern
the issuance of said permits and load approvals, and may establish forms for
application, load approval, manifest permit requirements, and other forms as
reasonably necessary.
      2.   Direct discharge of hazardous waste to the POTW by holding tank
waste transporters, by dedicated pipe, or by rail is prohibited.
      3.   Any holding tank waste transporter who violates the provisions of
this article or any director's procedures or directives applicable to said
permit and approval requirements shall be subject to the penalty provisions
contained in section
16-3E-16 of this article, and shall also be subject to other POTW remedial
actions including temporary or permanent suspension or rescission of the
transporter's or contributor's permit. (Ord. 96-3731, 4-23-1996)
16-3E-4: PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:

      1.   Upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment
standards for a particular industrial subcategory, if the federal standard is
more stringent than limitations imposed under this article for sources in that
subcategory, said federal categorical standards shall immediately supersede the
limitations imposed under this article. This also applies to those federal
categorical standards promulgated by EPA after the effective date hereof.
      2.   Where the city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent
removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the city may
apply to the approval authority for modification of specific limits in the
federal pretreatment standards. The city may then modify pollutant discharge
limits in the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in
40 CFR part 403, section 403.7, as amended, are fulfilled and prior approval
from the approval authority is obtained. (1978 Code §33-30.12)
   B.   Specific Standards:
      1.   An industrial user may not contribute to the POTW any substance
which may cause pass-through of any substance or any other product, such as
residues, sludges or scums, which may cause the POTW effluent to be unsuitable
for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no
case shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in
noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations
developed under section 405 of the act, as amended, with any criteria,
guidelines or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant
to the solid waste disposal act, the clean air act, the toxic substances
control act, all as amended, or with state criteria applicable to the sludge
management method being used.

limitations:
            (1)   The total time during which the pH values are outside the
required range of pH values shall not exceed seven (7) hours and twenty six
(26) minutes in any calendar month; and
            (2)   No individual excursion from the range of pH values shall
exceed sixty (60) minutes.
         b.   The director may adjust the requirements set forth in subsection
B4a of this section with respect to the length of individual excursions from
the range of pH values if a different period of time is appropriate, based upon
the treatment system, the plant configuration or other technical factors.
         c.   For purposes of this subsection B4, an "excursion" is an
unintentional and temporary incident in which the pH value of discharge
wastewater exceeds the range set forth in the applicable effluent limitations
guidelines.
      5.   No industrial user shall discharge any wastewater causing the POTW
treatment plant influent wastewater temperature to exceed forty degrees Celsius
(40°C) or one hundred four degrees Fahrenheit (104°F).

compliance with applicable pretreatment standards, any industrial user subject
to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the director a
report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the
discharge from the regulated process which are limited by pretreatment
standards and requirements, together with the average and maximum daily flow
for these process units in the industrial user's facility which are limited by
such pretreatment standards or requirements. The report shall state whether the
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent
basis and, if not, what additional operation and maintenance and/or
pretreatment is necessary to bring the industrial users into compliance with
the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. This statement shall be
signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user and certified to
by a qualified professional, as required by subsection
 16-3E-6B10 of this article. (1978 Code §33-30.16)
   C.   After the compliance date of such pretreatment standard or in the case
of a new source or after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, each
significant noncategorical industrial user or any industrial user subject to a
pretreatment standard shall submit to the director during the months of June
and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment permit or by
the director, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in
the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards. The report shall
include all parameters for which the POTW has not sampled and analyzed
pollutants directly. In addition, this report shall include a record of
measured daily flows during the reporting period, and shall be signed and
certified by a qualified professional and an authorized representative of the
user, as required by subsection
16-3E-6B10 of this article. At the discretion of the director and in
consideration of factors such as local high or low flow rates, holidays or
budget cycles, the director may agree to alter the months during which the
above reports are to be submitted. (Ord. 96-3762, 12-17-1996)
   D.   Information required by this section and section
16-3E-6 of this article and records of monitoring activities and results must
be retained by the industrial user for a minimum of three (3) years, or longer
in the case of unresolved litigation or when requested by the approval
authority. (1978 Code §33-30.16)
16-3E-8: DILUTION INSTEAD OF TREATMENT:
   A.   Dilutions Restricted: No industrial user shall increase the use of
process water or in any way attempt to dilute discharge as a partial or
complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the
limitations contained in this article, with the federal categorical
pretreatment standards or with any other pollutant specific limitation
developed by the city or state, except where expressly authorized to do so by
an applicable standard or limitation. (1978 Code §33-30.17)
   B.   Mass Limitations:
      1.   The director may revise a permit to impose mass limitations on
industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements or in other cases where the imposition of mass
limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the report required by subsection
16-3E-7B of this article shall indicate the mass of pollutants in the effluent
of the industrial user regulated by pretreatment standards. These reports shall
contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the
flow and the nature and concentration or the production and mass, where
requested by the director, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by
the applicable pretreatment standards. Monitoring, sampling, reporting,
notification and recordkeeping shall be as prescribed in the applicable
pretreatment standard.
      2.   All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures
established by the EPA pursuant to section 304(g) of the act, as amended, and
contained in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test
procedures approved by the EPA. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with
the techniques approved by the EPA. (1978 Code §33-30.18)
16-3E-9: MANHOLES AND SAMPLING EQUIPMENT:
When required by the director, an industrial user shall install a suitable
control manhole together with such necessary meters, samplers and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and
measurement of the flows. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the director. The manhole shall be installed by the user at its expense and
shall be maintained by the user in such a manner as to be safe and accessible
at all times. Costs incurred by the city for sampling, data recovery and
analysis shall be assessed to the industrial user. (1978 Code §33-30.19)
16-3E-10: ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES:
   A.   Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental discharge
of hazardous quantities of pollutants, prohibited materials or other substances
regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of
prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's and/or
industrial user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing appropriate
disposal facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall
be submitted to the city for review and shall be approved by the city before
construction of the facility. All existing industrial users shall complete such
a plan within three hundred sixty five (365) calendar days following the
effective date hereof. No industrial user who commences contribution to the
POTW after the effective date hereof shall be permitted to introduce pollutants
into the POTW system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved
by the city. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall
not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the
industrial user's facility, as necessary, to meet the requirements of this
article.
   B.   In the case of an accidental discharge, including slug discharges, the
industrial user shall immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the
incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume and corrective actions. A written notice shall be
permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board or other prominent
place advising employees of the person or office and phone number to call in
the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees
who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the
emergency notification procedure. Within five (5) calendar days following an
accidental discharge, the industrial user shall submit to the director a
detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures
to be taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such
notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage
or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW,
fish kills or any other damage to person or property, nor shall such
notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties or other
liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law. (1978
Code §33-30.20)
   C.   Each industrial user shall notify the POTW immediately of changes that
occur at the facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge, thereby
allowing the POTW to reevaluate the need for a slug control plan or actions to
prevent such discharges. (Ord. 17-4687, 1-17-2017)
16-3E-11: UPSET PROVISION:
   A.   Interpretation: An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance or careless or
improper operation.
   B.   Effect Of An Upset: An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to
an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if
the requirements of subsection C of this section are met.
   C.   Conditions Necessary For A Demonstration Of Upset: An industrial user
who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate,
through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant
evidence, that:
      1.   An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause of
the upset. (1978 Code §33-30.21)
      2.   The facility was, at the time, being operated in a prudent and
professional manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures. (Ord. 17-4687, 1-17-2017)
      3.   The industrial user has submitted the following information to the
city within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within 5
days):
         a.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance.
         b.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue.
         c.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of the noncompliance.
   D.   Burden Of Proof: In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user
seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   E.   Reviewability Of EPA Consideration Of Claims Of Upset: In the usual
exercise of prosecutorial discretion, EPA enforcement personnel should review
any claims that noncompliance was caused by an upset. No determinations made in
the course of the review constitute final EPA action subject to judicial
review. Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination
on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance
with categorical pretreatment standards.
   F.   User Responsibility In Case Of Upset: The industrial user shall control
production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance
with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its
treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of
treatment is provided. This requirement applies to the situation when, among
other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced,
lost or fails. (1978 Code §33-30.21)
16-3E-12: BYPASS:
   A.   Bypass Not Violating Applicable Pretreatment Standards Or Requirements:
An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if the bypass
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses
are not subject to the provisions of subsections B and C of this section.
   B.   Notice:
      1.   If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, the
industrial user shall submit prior notice to the city, if possible, at least
ten (10) calendar days before the date of the bypass.

deposited in the operation and maintenance fund each month an amount sufficient
to meet the current expenses of the month plus an amount equal to one-twelfth
(1/12) of expenses payable on an annual basis, such as insurance. After the
first day of the month, further deposits may be made from the revenue fund to
this account, to the extent necessary to pay current expenses accrued and
payable and to the extent that funds are not available in the surplus fund.
   B.   Sinking Fund: Money in the revenue fund shall next be disbursed to make
deposits into a separate and special fund to pay principal of and interest on
the bonds and parity bonds. The fund shall be known as the wastewater treatment
revenue bond and interest sinking fund ("sinking fund"). The minimum amount to
be deposited in the sinking fund in any month shall be an amount equal to one-
sixth (1/6) of the installment of interest coming due on the next interest
payment date on the then outstanding bonds and parity bonds, plus one-twelfth
(1/12) of the installment of principal coming due on such bonds on the next
succeeding principal payment date until the full amount of such installment for
both interest and principal is on hand. Money in the sinking fund shall be used
solely for the purpose of paying principal of and interest on the bonds and
parity bonds, as the same shall become due and payable.
   C.   Reserve Fund:
      1.   Money in the revenue fund shall next be disbursed to maintain a debt
service reserve in an amount equal to at least the lesser of:
         a.   The maximum amount of principal and interest coming due on the
bonds and parity bonds in any succeeding fiscal year; or
         b.   Fifteen percent (15%) of the original principal amount of bonds
outstanding at any time.
      2.   Such fund shall be known as the wastewater treatment revenue debt
service reserve fund ("reserve fund"). The reserve fund shall be fully funded
in the required amount from proceeds of the bonds. If it is necessary to
replenish the reserve fund, in each month there shall be deposited in the
reserve fund an amount equal to twenty five percent (25%) of the monthly amount
required by this article to be deposited in the sinking fund; provided however,
that when the amount on deposit in the reserve fund shall be not less than the
minimum required above, no further deposits need be made into the reserve fund
except to maintain said reserve fund at such level. Money in the reserve fund
shall be used solely for the purpose of paying principal at maturity of or
interest on the bonds and parity bonds when insufficient money is available in
the sinking fund. Whenever it becomes necessary to use money in the reserve
fund, the payments into the reserve fund required above shall be continued or
resumed until the reserve fund is restored to the required minimum amount.
   D.   Improvement Fund:
      1.   Money in the revenue fund shall next be disbursed to maintain a fund

to the extent of all remaining monies in the revenue fund.
      2.   The minimum amount to be deposited in the improvement fund each
month shall be twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00); provided however, that
when the amount of said deposits in said improvement fund shall equal or exceed
two million dollars ($2,000,000.00), no further monthly deposits need be made
into the improvement fund except to maintain it at such level. Money in the
improvement fund not otherwise specially limited by other provisions of this
article shall be used solely for the purpose of paying principal of or interest
on the bonds or parity bonds when there is insufficient money in both the
sinking fund and the reserve fund and, to the extent not required for the
foregoing, to pay the cost of extraordinary maintenance expenses or repairs,
renewals and replacements not included in the annual budget of revenues and
current expenses, payment of rentals on any part of the wastewater treatment
works, payments due for any property purchased as a part of the treatment works
and for capital improvements to the treatment works. Whenever it shall become
necessary to use money in the improvement fund, the payments required above
shall be continued or resumed until the improvement fund is restored to the
required minimum amount.
   E.   Subordinate Obligations: Money in the revenue fund may next be used to
pay principal of and interest on, including reasonable reserves therefor, any
other obligations which, by their terms, shall be payable from the revenues of
the wastewater treatment works but subordinate to the bonds and parity bonds
and which have been issued for the purposes of extensions and improvements to
the treatment works or to retire the bonds or parity bonds in advance of
maturity or to pay for extraordinary repairs or replacements to the treatment
works.
   F.   Surplus Revenue:
      1.   All money thereafter remaining in the revenue fund at the close of
each month may be deposited in any of the funds created by this article, may be
used to pay for extraordinary repairs or replacements to the wastewater
treatment works or may be used to pay or redeem the bonds or parity bonds or
any of them or for any lawful purpose.
      2.   Any monies transferred from the above accounts to meet revenue
shortages must be returned to their respective accounts during the next fiscal
year. (1978 Code §33-40.26)

authorized enforcement agency may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge
access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial
danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the
MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may
take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or
waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
      2.   Suspension Due To Detection Of Illicit Discharge: Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this section may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the proposed
termination of its MS4 access. A person commits an offense if the person
reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this subsection,
without the prior approval of the authorized enforcement agency.
   I.   Industrial Or Construction Activity Discharges: Any person subject to
an industrial or construction activity NPDES Iowa department of natural
resources stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such

discharges to the MS4.
      1.   Notice Of Intent (NOI) Submittal: The operator of a facility,
including construction sites, required to have an NPDES permit to discharge
stormwater associated with such activity, shall submit a copy of the notice of
intent (NOI) to the authorized enforcement agency at the same time the operator
submits the original (NOI) to the Iowa department of natural resources (IDNR)
and EPA as applicable. The copy of the notice of intent may be delivered to the
authorized enforcement agency either in person or by mailing to:
   NOI To Discharge Storm Water
   City Hall - Engineering Division
   410 E. Washington St.
   Iowa City, IA 52240
      2.   Notice Of Intent (NOI) Offense: A person commits an offense if the
person operates a facility that is discharging stormwater with industrial or
construction activity without having submitted a copy of the notice of intent
to do so to the authorized enforcement agency.
   J.   Compliance Monitoring:
      1.   Applicability: This subsection applies to all facilities that have
stormwater discharges associated with industrial or construction activity.
      2.   Access To Facilities:
         a.   The authorized enforcement agency shall be permitted to enter and
inspect facilities subject to regulation under this section as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this section. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement
agency.
         b.   Facility operators shall allow the authorized enforcement agency
ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the
conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of
any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.
         c.   The authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to set up
on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility's storm water discharge.
         d.   The authorized enforcement agency has the right to require the
discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All
devices used to measure storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
         e.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the authorized enforcement agency
and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by
the operator.
         f.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement agency
access to a permitted facility is a violation of this section. A person who is
the operator of a facility with an NPDES permit to discharge storm water
associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the
authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for
the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this section.
         g.   If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to
any part of the premises from which storm water is discharged, and it is able
to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
section, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this section
or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety,
and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek
issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
   K.   Use Of Best Management Practices: Authorized enforcement agency will
adopt requirements identifying best management practices for any activity,
operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or
contamination of storm water, the storm drainage system, or waters of the U.S.
The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall
provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge
of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drainage
system or watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural
BMPs. Further, any owner, operator, tenant, or person responsible for a
property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural
and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions
of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated
with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance
with the provisions of this subsection. These BMPs shall be part of a storm

Department of Housing and Inspection Services a "designated agent" located in
the County and empowered to represent a property owner(s) in matters concerning
compliance with the Iowa City Housing Code and as defined in section
17-5-3 of this chapter. Failure to designate and register a designated agent is
a violation of this chapter and may result in revocation of a rental permit.
(1978 Code §17-3)
17-5-16: CERTIFICATE OF STRUCTURE COMPLIANCE AND RENTAL PERMIT:
   A.   Certificate And Permit Required For Rental Property: It shall be a
violation of this Code for any person to let to another any dwelling, dwelling
unit, duplex, multiple dwelling, rooming unit, type III dwelling unit, or
rooming house, except the owner occupant who lets to no more than one tenant,
unless:
      1.   The owner or operator holds a valid certificate of structure
compliance, issued by the City, applicable to those portions of the specific
structure used for residential rental purposes.
      2.   The owner or operator holds a valid rental permit, issued by the
City in the name of the owner or operator, applicable to those portions of the
specific structure used for residential rental purposes.
The one tenant exception provided herein is limited to one tenant per dwelling
unit regardless of the number of owner occupants. By way of illustration, if
there are two (2) owner occupants in a single-family dwelling, a rental permit
is required if there are two (2) or more tenants.
   B.   Certificate Of Structure Compliance:
      1.   Scope Of Certificate; Transfers; Contents: The certificate of
structure compliance shall be a permanent document, except as noted below,
which, when issued, shall satisfy the requirements of sections 17-5-17 and 17-
5-18 of this chapter. The certificate shall be transferable at the time of a
change in ownership and shall remain a part of the Iowa City property file as a
matter of public record. The certificate, in and of itself, shall not be
interpreted as granting the owner or operator the privilege of letting the
structure for residential occupancy but must be accompanied by a valid rental
permit. The certificate of structure compliance shall state the date of
issuance, type of structure for which the certificate is being issued and
street address of the structure to which it is applicable. All dwelling units
and rooming units being let for rent and occupancy without a valid certificate
of structure compliance or application for the same on file with the City and
fees paid may be ordered vacated.
      2.   Application For Certificate: The owner or operator shall file, in
duplicate, an application for a certificate of structure compliance with the
Department of Housing and Inspection Services on application forms provided by
the inspector.
      3.   Issuance Of Certificate: When the provisions of sections
17-5-17 and
17-5-18 of this chapter have been complied with by the owner or operator, the
Department of Housing and Inspection Services shall issue a certificate of
structure compliance upon payment of a fee, the amount of which shall be set by
resolution of the City Council.
      4.   Revocation Of Certificate: The certificate of structure compliance
shall be permanent, except when there has been fraud, collusion or illegality
in the inspection process applicable to this certificate of structure
compliance or when there exists a material and substantial noncompliance with
section
17-5-17 or
17-5-18 of this chapter which directly affects the health and/or safety of the
occupants therein. The inspector or any other individual who believes that
there exists grounds for revocation may petition the Appeals Board to revoke
the certificate of structure compliance. The burden of proof shall be upon the
party seeking the revocation. The owner or operator of the affected property
shall be properly notified of the petition for revocation and shall be notified
of the date, place and time of the Appeals Board's consideration of the
petition and may appear and defend. Upon final determination by the Appeals
Board, a certificate of structure compliance may be modified to reflect the
compliance of each dwelling unit and/or rooming unit with sections
17-5-17 and/or
17-5-18 of this chapter or may be revoked in whole or in part.
   C.   Rental Permit:
      1.   Scope Of Permit; Transfers; Contents: A rental permit shall be a
document indicating compliance with section
17-5-19 of this chapter at the time of issuance and shall be valid for a
specified period of time. The document shall be transferable from one owner or
operator to another at any time prior to its expiration, termination or
revocation. The owner or operator shall notify the Department of Housing and
Inspection Services of any change of interest or ownership in the property
within thirty (30) calendar days of any conveyance or transfer of interest
affecting the property and provide the name and address of all persons who have
acquired an interest therein. In the event that the Department of Housing and
Inspection Services has not been notified of such conveyance or transfer within
the designated period of time, the rental permit shall be transferred from one
owner or operator to another only upon payment of a fee, the amount of which
shall be established by resolution of the City Council which shall be assessed
to the new owner or operator. The rental permit shall state the date of
issuance, the address of the structure to which it is applicable, the name of
the new owner or operator to which it is applicable, and its new expiration
date. The rental permit shall also state the maximum occupancy and the
telephone number for the property owner or designated agent. All dwelling units
and rooming units being let for rent and occupancy without a valid rental
permit may be ordered vacated.
      2.   Application For Permit: The owner or operator shall file, in
duplicate, an application for rental permit with the Department of Housing and
Inspection Services on application forms provided by the inspector.
      3.   Issuance Of Permit:
         a.   When all provisions of section
17-5-19 of this chapter have been complied with by the owner or operator, the
Department of Housing and Inspection Services shall issue a rental permit upon
payment of all permit and reinspection fees, the amounts of which shall be
established by resolution of the City Council. However, unless the Director
determines there is good cause, the rental permit shall not be issued if there
are any open building permits on the property, if there are any unpaid
judgments entered against the owner in a Municipal infraction for a Code
violation on the property or on any other rental property of the owner, or if
the owner has failed to cure a violation on the property or on any other rental
property of the owner as ordered by the court.

single-family or other residential unit, executed lease for a single-family or
other residential unit, and marriage license.

have authority to hear an appeal of a decision to deny or revoke a rental
permit, grant a variance, or grant any other relief.
      4.   Expiration Of Permit; Extensions: Rental permits shall be valid
through the expiration date contained thereon. However, extensions shall be
granted to cover any time period between the stated expiration date and the
period of time permitted by the inspector to remedy any violations cited
subsequent to a maintenance inspection, provided a rental application is on
file with fees paid, up to a maximum of twelve (12) months.
      5.   Required Procedures Prior To Commencement Of Rental Permit
Sanctions:

sanctions, written notice shall be given by the City to the owner or owner's
designated agent of the premises at which the Code violations occurred. The

further Code violations. The notice of the meeting is to be sent by regular

will be to obtain a Code compliance settlement agreement in which relevant
parties, including the owner or owner's designated agent and the tenant(s),

resolve issues.

APPENDIX B
GUIDELINES FOR ELIMINATING LEAD BASED PAINT HAZARDS
These guidelines are derived from documents published by the Iowa department of
public health childhood lead poisoning prevention program entitled "eliminating
lead based paint hazards".
      1.   Remove lead based paint carefully! You should never dry scrape or
dry sand lead based paint on the inside or outside of your home. Always mist
surfaces with water before scraping or sanding them. Use a tarp or piece of
plastic to catch paint chips when you are working on the outside of your house.
This will keep paint chips from falling on the soil. If you are working
outside, close windows to prevent lead dust from entering the home.
      2.   Do not sandblast or waterblast lead based paint on the outside of
your home. You do not want the paint chips to end up all over your yard or the
neighbor's yard. Sandblasting and waterblasting is safe only if you have a
special machine that will catch the paint chips.
      3.   Remove furniture, drapes, and if possible, carpet from the room you
will work in before starting work. Cover the floor and furniture that cannot be
removed from the room with a sheet of six (6) mil plastic. Seal each room from
the rest of the house with plastic while working in it. Be careful not to track
dust and paint chips into other areas of the home.
      4.   Wear a negative pressure, half mask respirator with a magenta
(purple) HEPA filtration canister. You can buy these respirators at auto parts
stores (used for brake and clutch work). The respirator will say "HEPA Filters
- Asbestos Approved". Be sure to read the instructions for positive and
negative face fit tests and for cleaning the respirator. If the respirator does
not fit properly, it will not protect you. It will also not protect you if it
is dirty. These masks do not protect against organic vapors from heat guns or
paint strippers. So, use heat guns and paint strippers only where there is good
ventilation. This will help disperse any organic vapors from the strippers or
from heating the paint.
      5.   Replace the filters on the respirator if they are damaged. You
should also replace them if it gets hard to breathe. This means that the
filters are plugging. Wash the face piece (without the filters) with mild soap.
Store the respirator in a bag outside of the work area.
      6.   If you have asthma, emphysema, or heart problems, do not try to wear
a respirator. Take off the respirator immediately if you feel short of breath.
If you have a perforated eardrum that has not been repaired, this respirator
will not protect you from inhaling lead dust.
      7.   If you will be using a heat gun, make sure it is a low temperature
heat gun that operates below one thousand one hundred degrees Fahrenheit
(1,100°F).
      8.   Do not eat, drink, or smoke until you have left the work area and
thoroughly washed your hands and face. Take a shower, wash your hair, and
change clothes before coming in contact with others.
      9.   Keep pregnant women and children out of the room if you are working
on a small project. A small project would be working on only a few surfaces in
one room at a time. For larger projects, keep pregnant women and children out
of the home until you complete the job.
      10.   After you complete the job, wash all surfaces thoroughly with any
household detergent. Vacuum with a HEPA vacuum or a regular vacuum with
microfilter bags. Shampoo carpets using a machine that pumps liquid into the
carpet and pulls it back out.
      11.   Place paint chips, dust, and pieces of wood in a plastic bag at the
end of each day. Put this with your garbage that will go to the landfill.
After you complete work to eliminate lead based paint hazards, you must
maintain the remaining lead based paint in good condition. You should also
frequently clean the house. Wash floors, window sills, areas between the
windows, and other places where dust and dirt accumulate at least once a week.
Check the condition of lead based paint frequently. You need to repair paint
when it begins to deteriorate. (Ord. 08-4315, 9-9-2008)
17-5-24: FEES:
The Department of Housing and Inspection Services is authorized to assess
permit and reinspection fees, the amounts of which shall be established by

flood event of the area served by any drains to be installed.
         f.   Location of any buildings or structures on the property where the
proposed grading is to be performed, together with any buildings or structures
on property adjacent to the proposed grading to the extent the buildings or
structures are within fifteen feet (15') of the proposed grading. In addition,
location of any property which may be substantially and materially affected by
the proposed grading shall also be noted and shown on the plans.
         g.   Existing trees that are to be retained pursuant to section
17-8-10 of this chapter. Specifications shall contain information covering
construction and material requirements.
         h.   Plans and proposed methods for the prevention and control of soil
erosion for the proposed work.
   F.   Engineered Grading Requirements:
      1.   For engineered grading, it shall be the responsibility of the civil
engineer to design the grading plan using sound engineering practices and to
incorporate all recommendations from the soils and geology reports into the
grading plan. The civil engineer shall also be responsible for the professional
inspection during the grading process and final approval of the grading when
completed. This responsibility includes, but need not be limited to, inspection
and approval as to the establishment of line, grade and drainage of the grading
area. The civil engineer is the coordinating agent between any responsible
party doing the actual grading work and the building official. Further, the
civil engineer shall be responsible for the preparation of revised plans and
the submission of an updated grading plan upon completion of the work. Finally,
the civil engineer shall submit a statement of compliance pursuant to
subsection
17-8-14A of this chapter.
      2.   Soils and geology reports shall be required as specified in
subsections H and I of this section. During grading, the civil engineer shall
submit all necessary reports, compaction data and soils and geology
recommendations to the building official.
      3.   The civil engineer's inspection and approval concerning the adequacy
and preparation of ground for the proposed grading operations shall include,
but need not be limited to, the adequacy of the ground to receive fill, testing
for required compaction, stability of all finish slopes, the design of buttress
fills, where required, the stability of cut slopes with respect to geological
matters and the need for subdrains or other ground water drainage devices.
      4.   The building official shall review the grading project at the
various stages of the work in order to monitor compliance with the approved
plans.
   G.   Regular Grading Requirements:
      1.   The building official may require inspection and testing by an
approved testing agency of any proposed or approved grading operation. Any such
required inspection or testing shall be carried out at the building official's
direction.
      2.   When the building official has cause to believe that geologic
factors may be involved in the proposed or regular grading activities, the
grading operation will be required to conform to "engineered grading"
requirements as defined in this chapter.
   H.   Soils Report:
      1.   The soils report required by subsection C of this section shall
include data regarding the nature, distribution and strength of existing soils,
conclusions and recommendations for grading procedures and design criteria for
corrective measures, including buttress fills, if needed.
      2.   Recommendations included in the report shall be incorporated in the
grading plans or specifications unless the building official has waived all or
some of the recommendations or has approved revised recommendations.
   I.   Geology Report:
      1.   The geology report required by subsection C of this section shall
include an adequate description of the geology of the site and conclusions and
recommendations regarding the effect of geologic conditions on the proposed
development.
      2.   Recommendations included in the report shall be incorporated in the
grading plans or specifications unless the building official has waived all or
some of the recommendations or has approved revised recommendations. (1978 Code
§8-17; amd. 1994 Code)
   J.   Issuance: The provisions of section 105.3.1 of the building code, as
amended, are applicable to grading permits. The building official may require
that the grading operations and project designs be modified if delays occur
which result from weather generated problems not considered at the time the
permit was issued. (Ord. 04-4146, 11-16-2004)
   K.   Fees: All fees associated with each required permit shall be paid to
the city as established by resolution of the city council. (1978 Code §8-17;
amd. 1994 Code)
17-8-6: ASSURANCE OF PERFORMANCE:
   A.   When the grading permit is issued, the building official may require
cash escrow, certificate of deposit, performance bonds or an irrevocable letter
of credit in order to assure that the work will be completed in accordance with
the approved plans and specifications and to assure all hazardous conditions
are eliminated. Said cash escrows, certificate of deposit, performance bonds or
letters of credit shall be in an amount equal to one hundred ten percent (110%)
of the grading project, but in no event shall the required amount exceed ten
thousand dollars ($10,000.00) or the cash equivalent.
   B.   It is the intent of this section that cash escrow, certificate of
deposit, performance bonds or irrevocable letters of credit shall not be deemed
as a substitution for performance of the work, but that such instruments shall
stand solely as security to assure compliance with the grading requirements
herein. (1978 Code §8-17; amd. 1994 Code)
17-8-7: CUTS:
   A.   Compliance Required: Unless otherwise recommended in the approved
engineering, soils and/or geology report, cuts shall conform to the provisions
of this section.
   B.   Slope: The slope of cut surfaces shall be no steeper than is safe for
the intended use and shall be no steeper than the ratio of three and five-
tenths horizontal to one vertical (3.5:1) unless the owner or responsible party
furnishes a soils or a geology report or both, stating that an investigation of
the site reveals that a cut at a steeper slope will nonetheless be stable and
will not create a hazard to life or to property.
   C.   Drainage And Terracing: Drainage and terracing shall be provided as
required by section
17-8-11 of this chapter. (1978 Code §8-17)
17-8-8: FILLS:
   A.   Compliance Required: Unless otherwise recommended in the approved
engineering, soils and/or geology report, fills shall conform to the provisions
of this section.
   B.   Fill Location: Fill slopes shall not be constructed on natural slopes
steeper than three and five-tenths horizontal to one vertical (3.5:1), except
where the civil engineer determines the slope to be stable.
   C.   Preparation Of Ground: The ground surface shall be prepared to receive
fill by removing vegetation, noncomplying fill, topsoil and other unsuitable
materials and by scarifying the surface to provide a bond with the new fill.
Where slopes are steeper than five horizontal to one vertical (5:1) and the
height of the fill location is greater than ten feet (10'), the ground surface
shall be prepared by benching into material deemed competent for such benching
by a civil engineer. The bench under the top of fill on a slope steeper than
five horizontal to one vertical (5:1) shall be at least ten feet (10') wide.
The area beyond the top of fill shall either be sloped for sheet overflow or a
paved drain provided. When fill is to be placed over a cut, the bench under the
top of fill shall be at least ten feet (10') wide. However, in such event, the
cut shall be approved by a civil engineer as a suitable foundation for fill.
   D.   Fill Material: Vegetative materials shall not be permitted in fills
except in the top one foot (1') of fill. Except as permitted by the building
official, no rock or similar irreducible material shall be placed within two
feet (2') of the finished grade. Where an excessive amount of irreducible
material is found, it may be placed in the fill in horizontal layers not
exceeding four feet (4') in thickness. Each layer shall be leveled and smoothed
by choking the surface of the irreducible material with soil or fine fragments
of rock. (1978 Code §8-17)
   E.   Compaction: All fills on slopes of six horizontal to one vertical (6:1)
or steeper shall be compacted to a minimum of ninety percent (90%) of maximum
density as determined by section J107 of the building code or equivalent ASTM
standards, as amended. (Ord. 04-4146, 11-16-2004)
   F.   Slope: The slope of fill surfaces shall be no steeper than is safe for
the intended use. Fill slopes shall be no steeper than three and five-tenths
horizontal to one vertical (3.5:1) unless the owner or responsible party
furnishes a soils or a geology report or both, stating that the site has been
investigated and that based on their best information, knowledge and belief,
fill at a slope steeper than three and five-tenths horizontal to one vertical
(3.5:1) will nonetheless be stable and will not create a hazard to life or
property.
   G.   Drainage And Terracing: Drainage and terracing shall be provided for
all fills. Areas above fill slopes and all terrace surfaces shall be graded and
finished, as required by section
17-8-11 of this chapter. (1978 Code §8-17)
17-8-9: SETBACKS:
   A.   General Requirements: Cut and fill slopes shall be set back from site
boundaries in accordance with this section. Setback dimensions shall be
horizontal distances measured perpendicular to the site boundary. Setback
dimensions shall be as shown in figure J108.1 of the 2003 international
building code, as amended. (Ord. 04-4146, 11-15-2004)
   B.   Top Of Cut Slope: The top of cut slope shall be made no closer to a
site boundary line than one-fifth (1/5) of the vertical height of cut, with a
minimum of two feet (2') and a maximum of ten feet (10'). The setback may need
to be increased for any required interceptor drains.
   C.   Toe Of Fill Slope: The toe of fill slope shall be made no closer to the
site boundary line than one-half (1/2) the height of slope, with a minimum of
two feet (2') and a maximum of twenty feet (20'). Where a fill slope is to be
located near the site boundary and the adjacent off site property is already
developed, special precautions may be required if, in the opinion of the
building official, such precautions are necessary to protect the adjoining
property from damage. These precautions may include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      1.   Additional setbacks.
      2.   Provision for retaining walls or slough walls.
      3.   Mechanical or chemical treatment of the fill slope surface to
minimize erosion.
      4.   Provisions for the control of surface waters.
   D.   Modification Of Slope Location: The building official may approve
alternate setbacks. The building official may also require an investigation and
recommendation by a civil engineer if, in the opinion of the building official,
such investigation is reasonably necessary to demonstrate the grading has
complied with the intent of this section. (1978 Code §8-17)
17-8-10: TREE PROTECTION:
Trees that are to be retained shall be protected from injury during any grading
work. Woodland and tree protection measures shall be shown on the grading plan
and should comply with the Iowa City tree protection guidelines. (Ord. 95-3703,
12-19-1995)
17-8-11: DRAINAGE AND TERRACING:
   A.   Compliance Required: Unless otherwise indicated on the approved grading
plan, drainage facilities and terracing shall conform to the provisions of this
section for cut or fill slopes steeper than six horizontal to one vertical (6:
1).
   B.   Terrace:
      1.   In order to control surface drainage and debris, terraces at least
six feet (6') in width shall be established at not more than thirty foot (30')
vertical intervals on all cut or fill slopes. Where only one terrace is
required, it shall be established at midheight. For cut or fill slopes greater
than sixty feet (60') and up to one hundred twenty feet (120') in vertical
height, one terrace at approximately midheight shall be twelve feet (12') in
width. Terrace widths and spacing for cut and fill slopes greater than one
hundred twenty feet (120') in height shall be designed by the civil engineer
and approved by the building official. Suitable access shall be provided to
permit proper cleaning and maintenance.
      2.   Swales or ditches on terraces shall have a minimum gradient of three
percent (3%) and must be stabilized with an approved erosion free channel. Said
swales or ditches shall also have a minimum depth at the deepest point of one
foot (1') and a minimum width of five feet (5') unless a civil engineer can
demonstrate a smaller channel is appropriate. (1978 Code §8-17)
      3.   The capacity of a swale or ditch shall be adequate to convey the
100-year flood event for the tributary area. (1978 Code §8-17; amd. 1994 Code)
   C.   Subsurface Drainage: Cut and fill slopes shall be provided with
subsurface drainage, where such drainage is reasonably necessary to achieve
stability.
   D.   Disposal:
      1.   All drainage facilities shall be designed to carry waters to the
nearest approved drainageway. Erosion in the area of discharge shall be
prevented by installing nonerosive down drains or other devices, as needed.
      2.   Building pads shall have a drainage gradient of two percent (2%)
from the building pad toward approved drainage facilities, unless waived by the
building official.
      3.   The gradient from the building pad may be one percent (1%) if all of
the following conditions exist throughout the permit area:
         a.   Proposed fills are no greater than ten feet (10') in maximum
depth.
         b.   Proposed finish cuts or fill slope faces have a vertical height
no greater than ten feet (10').
         c.   Existing slope faces which have a slope face steeper than ten
horizontally to one vertically (10:1) shall have a vertical height no greater
than ten feet (10').
   E.   Interceptor Drains: Interceptor drains shall be installed along the top
of all cut slopes where the tributary drainage has been channelized and there
is a potential for continued erosion. (1978 Code §8-17)
17-8-12: GRADING INSPECTION:
   A.   General Requirements: All grading operations for which a permit is
required shall be subject to inspection by the building official. When required
by the building official, special inspection of grading operations and special
testing shall be performed in accordance with the provisions of chapter 17 of
the international building code, as amended. (Ord. 04-4146, 11-16-2004; amd.
Ord. 06-4202, 4-4-2006)
   B.   Notification Of Noncompliance: If, in the course of fulfilling their
responsibilities under this chapter, the civil engineer or the testing agency
finds that the grading work is not being done in conformance with this chapter
or does not conform to the approved grading plans, the discrepancies shall be
reported to the owner of the property. If the discrepancies continue, the civil
engineer or the testing agency is responsible for reporting said discrepancies
to the building official.
   C.   Transfer Of Responsibility For Approval: If the civil engineer or the
testing agency of record is changed during the course of any grading work, the
work shall be stopped until the replacement has agreed to accept responsibility
for the work and the work is within the competence of the testing agency and/or
the civil engineer. (1978 Code §8-17; amd. Ord. 06-4202, 4-4-2006)
17-8-13: COMPLETION OF WORK:
   A.   Final Reports: Upon completion of the rough grading work and at final
completion of the grading work, the building official shall require the
following reports, drawings and supplements thereto to be filed in the building
official's office:
      1.   Certification from the civil engineer that the grading work was
completed in substantial compliance with the final approved grading plan, as
updated or revised.
      2.   An updated or revised grading plan prepared by the civil engineer,
showing all revisions approved by the building official. This plan shall
include ground surface elevations, lot drainage patterns and locations and
elevations of all surface and subsurface drainage facilities installed.
   B.   Notification Of Completion: The owner, responsible party or person
requesting the permit shall notify the building official when the grading
operation is ready for final inspection. Final approval shall not be given
until all required reports have been submitted and until all grading work has
been completed in accordance with the final approved grading plans, including
installation of all drainage facilities and their protective devices and all
erosion control measures. Upon granting final approval, the building official
shall authorize the release of any escrows to the depositor and issue a
certificate of compliance. (1978 Code §8-17; amd. Ord. 06-4202, 4-4-2006)
17-8-14: HAZARDS:
Whenever the building official determines that any existing excavation,
embankment or fill on private property has become a hazard to human life,
endangers property or adversely affects the safety, use or stability of a
public way or drainage channel, the property owner or the responsible party for
the affected property shall, after receipt of notice, in writing, from the
building official, take corrective action to repair or eliminate such
excavation, fill or embankment so as to eliminate the hazard or dangerous
conditions. Said repairs or corrective actions shall, in all respects, be in
compliance with the requirements of the building code, as amended, and shall be
satisfactorily completed within the time period specified in the notice.
Failure to take corrective actions shall be deemed a public offense and shall
be subject to the remedies set out in applicable state and local law for
abatement of nuisances 1 . (1978 Code §8-17; amd. Ord. 06-4202, 4-4-2006)
 
Notes
1 1. See title 6, chapter 1 of this code.
17-8-15: CONSTRUCTION SITE EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL:
   A.   Purpose And Intent:
      1.   The national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit
program administered by the Iowa department of natural resources (IDNR)
requires that agencies meeting certain demographic and environmental impact
criteria obtain from the IDNR an NPDES permit for the discharge of storm water
from a municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4). The city of Iowa City has
been issued such a permit. The city's MS4 permit is on file at the office of
the city clerk and is available for public inspection during regular office
hours.
      2.   The NPDES program requires certain individuals engaged in earth
disturbing activities related to construction on one acre of land or more to
submit an application to the IDNR for an NPDES general permit #2. The NPDES
program and the city's MS4 require the city to adopt an ordinance requiring
proper soil erosion and sediment control on all sites less than one acre if the
earth disturbing activities are part of a larger common plan of development
that would disturb one acre or more. Notwithstanding any provision of this
section, every applicant bears final and complete responsibility for compliance
with a state NPDES general permit #2, a city construction site runoff (CSR)
permit, and any other requirement of state or federal law or administrative
rule.
      3.   As a condition of the city's MS4 permit, the city is obliged to
undertake primary responsibility for administration and enforcement of the
NPDES program by adopting a construction site runoff control ordinance designed
to achieve the following objectives:
         a.   Any person, firm, sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation,
state agency or political subdivision (applicant) required by law or
administrative rule to apply to the IDNR for an NPDES general permit #2 shall
also be required to obtain from the city a permit in addition to and not in
lieu of the NPDES general permit #2; and
         b.   The city shall have primary responsibility for inspection,
monitoring and enforcement procedures to promote applicants' compliance with
state NPDES general permits #2 and CSR permits.
      4.   No state or federal funds have been made available to assist the
city in administering and enforcing the NPDES program. The city shall fund its
application, inspection, monitoring and enforcement responsibilities entirely
by fees imposed on the owners of properties which are made subject to the
program by virtue of state and federal law, and/or other sources of funding
established by a separate ordinance.
   B.   Applicability:
      1.   All persons required by law or administrative rule to obtain an
NPDES general permit #2 from the IDNR, and persons who will be conducting any
earth disturbing activity on a site less than one acre in size if the earth
disturbing activities are part of a larger common plan of development that
would disturb one acre or more, are required to obtain a CSR permit. "Earth
disturbing activity" means any activity that results in a movement of earth or
a change in the existing soil cover (both vegetative and nonvegetative) or the
existing topography. Earth disturbing activity includes, but is not limited to,
clearing, grading, filling, excavation or addition or replacement of impervious
surface.
      2.   Applications for CSR permits shall be made on forms approved by the
city which may be obtained from the city.
      3.   An applicant for a CSR permit shall pay fees as follows:
         a.   Prior to the issuance of a CSR permit in connection with a
building permit on a platted lot, the applicant shall submit an application
permit fee to the housing and inspection services department in an amount
established by resolution of the city council. If more than three (3)
inspections are required by the terms of this section with respect to said
permit, the applicant shall bear the cost of such inspections, which shall be
the actual cost of the inspections by the city.
         b.   There shall be no permit fee required prior to the issuance of
CSR permits other than those issued in connection with building permits on
platted lots, but the applicant shall bear the cost of reviews and inspections
required by the terms of this section with respect to said permits, which shall
be the actual cost of the reviews and inspections by the city.
      4.   An applicant in possession of an NPDES general permit #2 issued by
the IDNR shall immediately submit to the city full copies of the materials
described below as a basis for the city to determine whether to issue a CSR
permit:
         a.   Applicant's NPDES general permit #2 notice of intent (NOI); and
         b.   Applicant's plans, specifications and materials in support of
applicant's application for the NPDES general permit #2; and
         c.   A storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) prepared in
accordance with this section.
      5.   Every SWPPP submitted to the city in support of an application for a
CSR permit shall:
         a.   Comply with all current minimum mandatory requirements for SWPPPs
promulgated by the IDNR in connection with issuance of an NPDES general permit
#2; and
         b.   Comply with all mandatory minimum requirements pertaining to the
joint application form, "Protecting Iowa Waters", filed with the IDNR and U.S.
army corps of engineers; and
         c.   Comply with all other applicable local, state or federal permit
requirements in existence at the time of application; and
         d.   Include within the SWPPP a signed and dated certification by the
person preparing the SWPPP that the SWPPP complies with all requirements of
this section.
      6.   Every SWPPP submitted to the city in support of an application for a
CSR permit shall contain the provisions of the general permit #2, plus the
following additional provisions:
         a.   All SWPPPs shall comply with Iowa statewide urban design and
specifications (SUDAS) standard design criteria as amended; and
         b.   Address that stockpiles of soil or other materials subject to
erosion by wind or water are covered, vegetated, or otherwise effectively
protected from erosion and sedimentation in accordance with the amount of time
the material will be on site and the manner of its proposed use; no stockpiling
is allowed in the street; and
         c.   Assure that all temporary erosion and sediment controls shall be
maintained until the city has determined that the site has been permanently
stabilized; and
         d.   Limit potential for damage to sensitive environmental areas such
as water bodies, plant communities, rare, threatened and/or endangered species
habitat, wildlife corridors, greenways, etc.; and
         e.   Provide for design and construction methods to stabilize steep or
long continuous slopes; and
         f.   Include measures to control sediment, and the quantity and
quality of storm water, leaving a site during and after construction; and
         g.   Provide for stabilization of waterways and outlets directly
impacted by permitted construction; and
         h.   Protect storm sewer inlets and infrastructure from sediment
loading/plugging; and
         i.   Specify precautions to be taken to contain sediment when working
in or crossing water bodies; and
         j.   Account for stabilization of disturbed areas, including utility
construction areas, as soon as possible; and
         k.   Protect adjacent and outlying roads from sediment and mud from
construction site activities, including tracking; and
         l.   Provide for disposal of collected sediment and floating debris.
      7.   Issuance by the city of a CSR permit shall be a condition precedent
for the issuance of a city building permit or site plan approval.
      8.   For so long as a construction site is subject to an NPDES general
permit #2 or a CSR permit, the applicant shall provide the city with current
information as follows:
         a.   The name, address and telephone number of the person on site
designated by the owner who is knowledgeable and experienced in erosion and
sediment control and who will oversee compliance with the NPDES general permit
#2 and the CSR permit;
         b.   The name(s), address(es) and telephone number(s) of the
contractor(s) and/or subcontractor(s) that will implement each erosion and
sediment control measure identified in the SWPPP.
         c.   An on site location for storage and retrieval of the current
SWPPP.
         d.   Applicant's failure to provide current information shall
constitute a violation of this section.
      9.   If the applicant for the NPDES general permit #2 and the CSR permit
is not the same individual as the owner/builder on the site, then the applicant
has the option to include the owner/builder as a copermittee. Copermittees have
the same obligations and responsibilities as the original applicant. Absent
written confirmation of transfer of responsibility signed by both the parties
and provided to the city at the office of the enforcement official, the
original applicant remains obligated and responsible for permit compliance on
any parcel of the site, whether the parcel has been sold or not.
      10.   Upon receipt of an application for a CSR permit, the city shall
either find that the application complies with this section and issue a CSR
permit in accordance with this section, or that the application fails to comply
with this section, in which case the city shall provide a written report
identifying noncompliant elements of the application.
   C.   Inspection:
      1.   All inspections required under this section shall be conducted by a
designated person from the city, hereinafter referred to as the "enforcement
officer".
      2.   The applicant shall notify the city when all measures required by
applicant's SWPPP have been accomplished on site, whereupon the city shall
conduct an inspection for the purpose of determining compliance with this
section, and shall within a reasonable time thereafter report to the applicant
either that compliance appears to have been achieved, or that compliance has
not been achieved, in which case the city shall provide a written report
identifying the conditions of noncompliance. The applicant shall immediately
commence corrective action and shall complete such corrective action within a
time frame deemed reasonable by the city. Failure to take corrective action in
a timely manner shall constitute a violation of this section.
      3.   Unless otherwise approved by the city, construction shall not occur
on the site at any time when the city has identified conditions of
noncompliance.
      4.   Unless approved by the city, construction activities undertaken by
an applicant prior to resolution of all discrepancies specified in the written
report shall constitute a violation of this section.
      5.   The city shall not be responsible for the direct or indirect
consequences to the applicant or to third parties for noncompliant conditions
undetected by inspection.
   D.   Monitoring:
      1.   Upon issuance of a CSR permit, the applicant has an absolute duty to
monitor site conditions and to report to the enforcement officer any change of
circumstances or site conditions which the applicant knows or should know pose
a risk of storm water discharge in a manner inconsistent with applicant's
SWPPP, NPDES general permit #2 and/or CSR permit.
      2.   Such report shall be made by the applicant to the enforcement
officer immediately upon knowledge of site condition changes, but in any event
within twenty four (24) hours of the change of circumstances or site
conditions.
      3.   Failure to make a timely report shall constitute a violation of this
section.
      4.   Any third party may also report to the city site conditions which
the third party reasonably believes pose a risk of stormwater discharge in a
manner inconsistent with applicant's SWPPP, NPDES general permit #2 and/or CSR
permit.
      5.   Upon receiving a report pursuant to the previous subsections of this
section, the enforcement officer shall conduct an inspection of the site as
soon as reasonably possible and thereafter may issue a written stop work order
to the applicant, directing the applicant to take no further action with
respect to the SWPPP, NPDES general permit #2 and/or CSR permit, other than
corrective action provided for hereinafter. The enforcement officer shall
provide the applicant with a written report identifying the conditions of
noncompliance. The applicant shall immediately commence corrective action and
shall complete such corrective action within a time frame deemed reasonable by
the city. Failure to take corrective action in a timely manner shall constitute
a violation of this section, whereupon the enforcement officer shall
immediately commence enforcement actions specified in subsection E of this
section.
      6.   The enforcement officer shall conduct at least one unannounced
inspection during the course of construction to monitor compliance with the
NPDES general permit #2 and the CSR permit. If the inspection discloses any
noncompliance, the enforcement officer shall provide the applicant with a
written report identifying the conditions of noncompliance. The applicant shall
immediately commence corrective action and shall complete such corrective
action within a time frame deemed reasonable by the city. Failure to take
corrective action in a timely manner shall constitute a violation of this
section, whereupon the enforcement officer shall immediately commence
enforcement actions specified in subsection E of this section.
      7.   The city shall not be responsible for the direct or indirect
consequences to the applicant or to third parties for noncompliant conditions
undetected by inspection.
   E.   Enforcement:
      1.   Violation of any provision of this section may be enforced by civil
action including an action for injunctive relief. (Ord. 06-4202, 4-4-2006)
      2.   Violation of any provision of this section may also be enforced as a
municipal infraction or environmental infraction within the meaning of section
364.22, pursuant to the city's municipal infraction ordinance. A municipal
infraction shall be punishable by a penalty as provided for in subsection

guarantee.
   D.   When a performance guarantee is required, there shall also be provided
a prescribed period of time within which improvements must be completed.
   E.   Where a performance guarantee is not required upon issuance of a
