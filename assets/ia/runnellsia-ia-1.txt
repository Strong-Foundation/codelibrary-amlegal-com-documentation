41.14Â Â Â FIREWORKS.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 727.2)
1.Â Â Â Definitions.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â â€œConsumer fireworksâ€ means any device, other than a novelty, or
theatrical pyrotechnic article, intended to produce visible or audible effects
by combustion, deflagration, or detonation, as described in Chapter 3 of the
American Pyrotechnics Association (â€œAPAâ€) Standard 87-1. Fireworks are further
described as Fireworks UN0336 (formerly Common Fireworks and now referred to in
this standard as Consumer Fireworks,) or Fireworks UN0335 (formerly Special
Fireworks and now referred to in this standard as Display Fireworks.) Fireworks
may also be described as Fireworks UN0337 if examination and testing in
accordance with Title 49 CFR, Â§173.56 is performed that warrants that
classification. For purposes of this section, the term â€œfireworksâ€ includes any
explosive composition, or combination of explosive substances, or article
prepared for the purpose of producing a visible or audible effect by
combustion, explosion, deflagration, or detonation, and includes blank
cartridges, firecrackers, torpedoes, skyrockets, roman candles, or other
fireworks of like construction and fireworks containing any explosive or
flammable compound, or other device containing any explosive substance. The
term â€œfireworksâ€ does not include gold-star producing sparklers on wires which
contain no magnesium or chlorate or perchlorate, flitter sparklers in paper
tubes that do no exceed one-eighth of an inch in diameter, toy snakes which
contain no mercury, or caps used in cap pistols.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â â€œNovelty fireworksâ€ means a device containing small amounts of
pyrotechnic or explosive composition, as described in American Pyrotechnics
Association (APA) Standard 87-1. Such devices produce limited visible or
audible effects. These items must be approved by DOT, and are normally classed
as 1.4G. A different classification may be assigned based on testing and
examination as specified in Title 49 CFR, Â§173.56. Certain novelties which meet
the criteria specified in Section 3.2 are not regulated as explosives, and
approval by DOT is not required for those specific items. Novelty fireworks
typically produce a much weaker explosion and sound. A few examples include:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Party Poppers. Once a string is pulled to activate the charge,
confetti is thrust into the air and produces a report.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Snaps. A small paper bag typically filled with gravel and a few
milligrams of silver fulminate will produce a report when thrown at a hard
surface or stepped on.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Flying Lanterns or Sky Lanterns. These paper lanterns float into
the sky when lit. They emit a slight glow and are very commonly used at
weddings and celebrations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Paper Tanks and Vehicles. When lit, these small paper vehicles emit
sparks that cause them to move around on the ground and commonly produce a loud
bang at the end.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Ground Bloom Flowers. A small cylinder that spins on the ground and
changes color, spinning in such a way that it resembles a flower. Could be
described as a large â€œjumping jack.â€
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Snakes or Blake Snakes. A small compressed pellet that, when lit,
expands into a long snake-like object.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â â€œDisplay fireworksâ€ means pyrotechnic devices for professional use in
the entertainment industry similar to consumer fireworks in chemical
composition and construction but not intended for consumer use. Such articles,
meeting the lift and effect powder weight limits for similar consumer fireworks
but not labeled as such and containing only chemicals listed in table 4.3-1 may
be approved under the provisions of this standard and classified as Articles,
Pyrotechnic, 1.4G, UN0431. Theatrical pyrotechnic devices may be classed by DOT
as Articles, Pyrotechnic, 1.4S, UN0432 or as Articles, Pyrotechnic, 1.3G,
UN0430 on the basis of examination and testing as specified in Title 49 CFR,
Â§173.56. Examples include:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Aerial shell.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Salute.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â All other fireworks that are not considered novelty or consumer.
2.Â Â Â Firework Sales General Requirements.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The sale of consumer fireworks shall be regulated by the State Fire
Marshal who shall establish dates of permitted sales, the minimum requirements

licenses. No person, retailer, consumer group, or otherwise shall sell any
consumer fireworks without possessing a consumer fireworks seller license as
required under Chapter 100 of the Code of Iowa and providing evidence of the
State required minimum amounts of insurance per occurrence and in the
aggregate.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The sale of fireworks within the permanent primary structures, as
defined by the State Fire Marshal, shall be allowed between June 1 and July 8
and December 10 and January 3 each year, all dates inclusive. The sale of
fireworks from temporary structures, as defined by the State Fire Marshal,
shall be allowed between June 13 and July 8 each year, both dates inclusive.
This subsection does not prohibit the sale by a resident, dealer, manufacturer,
or jobber of such fireworks as are not prohibited by City or State law; or the
sale of any kind of fireworks if they are to be shipped out of State; or the
sale or use of blank cartridges for a show or theatre, or for signal purposes
in athletic sports or by railroads or trucks for signal purposes, or by a
recognized military organization. This subsection does not apply to any
substance or composition prepared and sold for medicinal or fumigation
purposes.
3.Â Â Â Fireworks Discharging General Requirements. It is the intention that
citizens be allowed to enjoy the use of novelty and consumer fireworks. It is
in the best interest of public safety that these restrictions are included to
prevent or limit injuries and fires caused by fireworks and their use in and
around individuals, large gatherings or events, structures, and the
environment.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No person under the age of 18 shall discharge a DOT 1.4 class firework

for its operation and the consequences thereof. No person shall discharge a
fireworks device in a reckless manner or manner likely to cause death, injury,
fire, or property damage.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â No person shall discharge a fireworks device outside the following
dates and hours:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â From July 1 until July 10 and from December 31 until January 1 and;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Between the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. and from 8:00 a.m. to
1:00 a.m. respectively.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â It shall be unlawful to alter, remove, or discharge components of a
fireworks device from its intended method of discharging.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Sky lantern open flame devices are not permitted to be released within
the City limits, except if tethered by a retrievable rope so long as the person
discharging has control over the sky lantern.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â The City hereby adopts National Fire Protection Associationâ€™s (NFPA)
standard for the use of display or theatrical fireworks and pyrotechnics and
all rules and regulations apply.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Disorderly house ordinance is in effect at all times.

Â Â Â K.Â Â Â No person shall discharge or allow the use of fireworks, including
novelty, consumer, or display types, within the proximity of others, or in
areas where large public gatherings are present.
Â Â Â L.Â Â Â Proximity for definition of this subsection shall mean within 10 feet
of another individual, building or structure, or vehicle, unless a further
distance is specifically given.
Â Â Â M.Â Â Â Notwithstanding the above paragraphs, no person shall discharge a
fireworks device at any time upon declaration from the Fire Chief or peace
officer that discharging a fireworks device is temporarily banned due to severe
dry weather conditions that create heightened fire dangers. Any such
declaration shall be posted calculated to bring such declaration to the notice
of the residents of the City. Any declaration issued by the Fire Chief or the
County shall take effect immediately upon its being posted and shall be
effective until rescinded by a declaration from the issuing entity indicating a
termination of the ban.
4.Â Â Â Display Fireworks. Notwithstanding the above paragraph, the City may, upon
application in writing, grant a permit for the display of display fireworks by
a City agency, fair association, amusement park, and other organizations or
groups of individuals approved by City authorities when such display fireworks
will be handled by a competent operator. No permit shall be granted hereunder
unless the operator or sponsoring organization has filed with the City evidence
of insurance in the following amount.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Personal injuryÂ Â Â $250,000.00 per person.

ownership, or rental agreements. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the
property owner or agent to ensure that their rental properties have valid
rental inspection certificates. Failure to acquire or renew the required rental
inspection certificates may result in notice being sent to the property owner
that the specified address is an illegal rental. This action may include
posting notice on the property as an illegal rental with door hangers, yard
signage, or similar signs, and providing notice to the tenant that the property
they occupy has not been approved by the City as a legal rental property.
3.Â Â Â New Units. New construction projects, which have received a final
inspection and have passed and hold a full certificate of occupancy within the
last two years from the adoption date of the ordinance codified in this chapter
and has all required owner or agent information on file with the City, shall be
considered to be in compliance with the rental inspection certificate and fee
requirements for a period of two years from the adoption date.
4.Â Â Â Required Owner or Agent Information. Owners of residential rental property
within the City, who reside within 75 miles, shall provide the City with their
physical addresses, telephone numbers, and e-mail addresses, if available.
Owners of residential rental property within the City who reside outside of the
aforementioned areas, shall provide the City with the name and contact
information of an individual over the age of 18 who shall reside within the
aforementioned areas, and who shall be designated as agent for scheduling
inspections, receiving notices, and services of process. A new owner shall
provide the information required in this subsection within five days from the
date of any change in ownership. Failure to give said notice will render the
rental inspection certificate null and void. Re-inspection and the associated
fees shall be required to reinstate the rental inspection certificate. The
previous owner shall disclose this requirement to a new owner.
5.Â Â Â Failure to register the rental property within six months of adoption of
this chapter will result in the property owner being required to be inspected
and to pay all fees at time of registration.
153.07Â Â Â RENTAL INSPECTION.
The City shall seek to inspect all apartment houses, congregate residences,
rental dwellings, and sleeping units and common areas within the City every two
years. As part of the inspection process, the City may determine to expand or
shorten the time frame to the next scheduled inspection with the exception of
any apartment home or congregate residence requiring State or federal licensing
or certification, which shall be exempt from fees and inspection. This does not
include receiving subsidies for rent, heat, water, and other assistance from
these agencies.
1.Â Â Â Factors that may influence the City to inspect more or less in frequency
may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Age and condition of dwelling.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Inspection history.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Tenant and management complaints
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Natural disasters such as flooding.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Timely inspection scheduling, follow-up and fee payment by owner.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â In house inspection and maintenance program by owner that includes
specific life and safety provisions.
2.Â Â Â It is the responsibility of the property owner or agent to ensure that
their rental properties have a valid rental inspection certificate. However,
the City may schedule inspection appointments with the owner or agent of the
property by regular mail, facsimile, or e-mail, a minimum of 30 days in advance
of the inspection. It shall be the owner or agentâ€™s responsibility to notify
all tenants of the inspection date and time, in accordance with Iowa law.
3.Â Â Â Inspections shall not be conducted with a minor as the sole representative
of the owner or agent. Inspections shall not be conducted against the will of
the tenant without the building owner or agent being present. Inspections shall
not be conducted without prior notice to the tenant, as required by Iowa law.
4.Â Â Â When receiving or responding to complaints from rental property tenants,
the City will typically intervene only if the tenant has presented their
concerns in writing to the owner or agent with a seven day notice to respond,
and the owner or agent has failed to respond, with the exception of life or
fire safety issues such as smoke detectors, blocked exits, exposed wiring, or
similar.
5.Â Â Â Issuance or renewal of a rental inspection certificate may be denied or
revoked if the applicant, or a subsidiary firm, partnership, or corporation
owns one or more properties within the City in which the applicant or owner has
been notified of violations of the City Code, but has not corrected said
violations prior to City enforcement or abatement, including but limited to
failure to have current rental inspection certificates. Violations of the
International Property Maintenance Code (IPMC) as adopted in Section
150.10 shall be deemed violations of the City Code. Specifically, three or more
nuisance violations that occur within a 12 month period may cause the issuance
or renewal of a rental inspection certificate to be denied or revoked. The
Building Official or designated employee may then choose to deny or revoke the
issuance or renewal of one, some, or all rental inspection certificates in the
name of the applicant or owner for violations of the City Code, whether or not
the violations occurred on each property owned by that person or entity.
6.Â Â Â All fees shall be collected prior to inspection.
7.Â Â Â Every rental inspection certificate issued under the authority of this
chapter shall be displayed or made available by the owner for a tenant to
examine, before any dwelling unity may be rented, leased, or otherwise
occupied.
8.Â Â Â The following shall be inspected to ensure that basic fire safety
procedures are in place:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Smoke detectors.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Fire Extinguishers. Fire extinguishers shall be in each rental dwelling
unit and be tagged annually by an approved testing agency. There shall be one
fire extinguisher for each 75 ft. of developed length of corridor or hallway.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Sprinklers. Sprinklers shall be tested annually by an approved testing
agency. Test results shall be sent to City Hall and placed in the property
file.

exists in a building or upon a premises a condition that is contrary to or in
violation to this code that makes the building or premises unsafe, dangerous,
or hazardous, the Building Official may enter the building or premises at
reasonable times to inspect or to perform the duties imposed by this code,
provided that if such building or premises be occupied that credentials be
presented to the occupant and entry requested. If such building or premises be
unoccupied, the Building Official shall first make a reasonable effort to
locate the owner or other person having charge or control of the building or
premises and request entry. If entry is refused, the Building Official shall
have recourse to the remedies provided by law to secure entry.
153.09Â Â Â OCCUPANCY VIOLATIONS.
Whenever any building or structure or equipment therein regulated by this code
is being used contrary to the provisions of or does not meet the requirements
of this Code of Ordinances, the Building Official may order repairs to remedy
said infraction or may order such use discontinued and the structure, or
portion thereof, vacated by notice served on any person causing such use to be
continued. Such person shall discontinue the use or remedy the infraction
within the time prescribed by the Building Official after receipt of such
notice to make the structure or portion thereof comply with the requirements of
this code.
153.10Â Â Â EXPIRATION.
Every certificate of use issued by the Building Official under the provisions
of this code shall expire and become null and void two years after the date of
issuance, unless suspended or revoked by separate action as provided for
herein. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner, or their assigned
agent to maintain an active and valid certificate. If a certificate of use is
allowed to expire, the property owner or their assigned agent shall be required
to pay all outstanding fines and fees including double the regular inspection
fees within 60 days of the expiration date of the certificate of use to regain
eligibility for rental housing and be issued a current certificate of use. The
Building Official may extend the certificate to an expiration date of three
years depending on inspection history. New construction dwelling units at the
determination of the Building Official may be granted an expiration of up to
three years.
153.11Â Â Â SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION.
The Building Official may, in writing, suspend or revoke a Certificate of Use
issued under the provisions of this code whenever the certificate is issued in
error or on the basis of incorrect information supplied, or in violation of any
ordinance or regulation or any of the provisions of this code. In order to
renew action on a Certificate of Use upon suspension or revocation, the owners,
agents, or others shall pay all outstanding fines and fees and shall pay double
the original inspection fee.
153.12Â Â Â EVICTION.
Tenants can and shall be evicted from the premises by the Building Official
after proper notice or violations. Shall it become necessary for the Building
Official to proceed with eviction procedures, all legal and actual cost
associated with the action shall be paid in full by the owners, agents, or
others prior to any tenants being allowed to reoccupy the structure. If the
owners, agents, or others fail to pay all cost after the third notice, the City
shall have the right to apply a lien on said property and all cost associated
with the action.
153.13Â Â Â GOVERNMENT EXEMPT.

156.02Â Â Â STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSE.
1.Â Â Â The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 364 of the Code of
Iowa, as amended, delegated the power to cities to exercise any power and
perform any function it deems appropriate to protect and preserve the rights,
privileges, and property of the city or of its residents, and to preserve and
improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort, and convenience of its
residents.
2.Â Â Â Findings of Fact.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation
which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by:
(i) The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
3.Â Â Â Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Section 156.02(2)(A) of this chapter with provisions designed to:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows so
that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
156.03Â Â Â GENERAL PROVISIONS.
1.Â Â Â Lands to Which Ordinance Apply. The provisions of this chapter shall apply
to all lands and uses which have significant flood hazards. The Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) for Polk County and Incorporated Areas, City of Runnells, Panel
19153C0415F, dated February 1, 2019, which were prepared as part of the Polk
County Flood Insurance Study, shall be used to identify such flood hazard areas
and all areas shown thereon to be within the boundaries of the base flood shall
be considered as having significant flood hazards. The Polk County Flood
Insurance Study is hereby adopted by reference and is made a part of this
ordinance for the purpose of administering floodplain management regulations.
2.Â Â Â Rules for Interpretation of Flood Hazard Boundaries. The boundaries of the
Special Flood Hazard areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the
official Flood Insurance Rate Map. When an interpretation is needed as to the
exact location of a boundary, the Administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation. The Council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged
that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by
the Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
3.Â Â Â Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure
shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
4.Â Â Â Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provision of this chapter shall prevail. All other chapters inconsistent with
this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
5.Â Â Â Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
6.Â Â Â Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated special flood hazard areas will be
free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on
the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
7.Â Â Â Severability. If any section, clause, provisions, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court or competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.
156.04Â Â Â ADMINISTRATION.

necessary (e.g., drawings or a site plan) for the purpose of this chapter.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Action on Permit Application. The Administrator shall, within a
reasonable time, make a determination as to whether the proposed floodplain
development meets the applicable standards of this chapter and shall approve or
disapprove the application. For disapprovals, the applicant shall be informed,
in writing, of the specific reasons therefore. The Administrator shall not
issue permits for variances except as directed by the Council
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Construction and Use to Be as Provided in Application and Plans.
Floodplain Development Permits based on the basis of approved plans and
applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in
such approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement or
construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. The applicant shall be
required to submit certification by a professional engineer or land surveyor,
as appropriate, registered in the State of Iowa, that the finished fill,
structure floor elevations, floodproofing, or other flood protection measures
were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to
the use or occupancy of any structure.
156.05Â Â Â FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT STANDARDS.
1.Â Â Â General Floodplain Standards. All development must be consistent with the
need to minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance
standards. Where base flood elevations have not been provided in the Flood
Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to
determine (i) whether the land involved is either wholly or partly within the
floodway or floodway fringe and (ii) the base flood elevation. Until a
regulatory floodway is designated, no development may increase the Base Flood
Elevation more than one foot. The applicant will be responsible for providing
the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to
make such determination. Review by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources is
not required for the proposed construction of new or replacement bridges or
culverts where (i) the bridge or culvert is located on a stream that drains
less than two square miles, and (ii) the bridge or culvert is not associated
with a channel modification that constitutes a channel change as specified in
567-71.2(2) of the Iowa Administrative Code.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All development within the special flood hazard areas shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Residential Structures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â All new or substantially improved residential structures shall have
the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum of one foot above the
base flood elevation. Construction shall be upon compacted fill which shall, at
all points, be no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation and extend
at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the limits of any structure erected
thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such as piers or extended foundations)
may be allowed where existing topography, street grades, or other factors
preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods used must be adequate to
support the structure as well as withstand the various forces and hazards
associated with flooding.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All new residential structures located in areas that would become
isolated due to flooding of surrounding ground shall be provided with a means
of access that will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the base flood.
However, this criterion shall not apply where the Administrator determines
there is sufficient flood warning time for the protection of life and property.
When estimating flood warning time, consideration shall be given to the
criteria listed in 567-75.2(3) of the Iowa Administrative Code.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Non-residential Structures. All new or substantially improved non-
residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level. When
floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State of
Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and
other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the
base flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â All New and Substantially Improved Structures:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Fully enclosed areas below the "lowest floor" (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, and
low damage potential storage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
electric meter, electrical service panel box, hot water heater, heating, air
conditioning, ventilation equipment (including ductwork), and other similar
machinery and equipment elevated (or in the case of non-residential structures,
optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
plumbing, gas lines, water and gas meters, and other similar service utilities
either elevated (or in the case of non- residential structures, optionally
floodproofed to) a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation or
designed to be watertight and withstand inundation to such a level.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Factory-built homes:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the structure
is a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame
ties to ground anchors. Anchorage systems may include, but are not limited to,
use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors as required by the State
Building Code.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Utility and Sanitary Systems:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located or
designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system as well
as the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment facilities
(other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood protection
equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water
supply treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with
a level of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood
elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Storage of materials and equipment that are flammable, explosive or
injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited unless elevated a
minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation. Other material and
equipment must either be similarly elevated or (i) not be subject to major
flood damage and be anchored to prevent movement due to flood waters or (ii) be
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Flood control structural works such as levees, flood walls, etc. shall
provide, at a minimum, protection from the base flood with a minimum of 3 ft.
of design freeboard and shall provide for adequate interior drainage. In
addition, the Department of Natural Resources shall approve structural flood
control works.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Watercourse alterations or relocations must be designed to maintain the
flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion. In addition,
the Department of Natural Resources must approve such alterations or
relocations.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and subdivisions)
shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and shall have
adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage. Development
associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation of public
utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this Ordinance.
Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all lots with
a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the base
flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50 lots (whichever
is less) shall include base flood elevation data for those areas located within
the Special Flood Hazard Area.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Accessory Structures to Residential Uses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Detached garages, sheds, and similar structures that are incidental
accessory to a residential use are exempt from the base flood elevation
requirements where the following criteria are satisfied.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential. Its size shall not exceed 600 square feet in size. Those portions of
the structure located less than one foot above the base flood elevation must be
constructed of flood-resistant materials.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage potential
purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure shall not
be used for human habitation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building
site so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The structure shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â The structure's service facilities such as electrical and heating
equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above the base
flood elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â The structureâ€™s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of Subparagraph
156.06(1)(D)(1) of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Exemption from the base flood elevation requirements for such a
structure mat result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of
the structure and its contents.
Â Â Â L.Â Â Â Recreational Vehicles.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of Paragraph
156.05(1)(E) of this chapter regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built
homes when the following criteria are satisfied.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less
than 180 consecutive days, and,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than
180 consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements
of Paragraph 156.05(1)(E) of this chapter regarding anchoring and elevation of
factory-built homes.
Â Â Â M.Â Â Â Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be buried in the streambed
and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due to
channel degradation and meandering.
Â Â Â N.Â Â Â Maximum Damage Potential Development. All new or substantially improved
maximum damage potential development shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated a minimum of one foot above the elevation of the 500-year
flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed
to such a level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer
registered in the State of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods
used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact
and uplift forces, and other factors associated with the two-tenths percent
annual chance flood; and that the structure, below the two-tenths percent
annual chance flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water. A record of the certification indicating
the specific elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to
which any structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
Where 500-year flood elevation data has not been provided in the Flood
Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to
compute such data. The applicant will be responsible for providing the
Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make
such determinations.
2.Â Â Â Special Floodway Provisions. In addition to the General Floodplain
Standards, development within the floodway must meet the following applicable
standards. The floodway is that portion of the floodplain which must be
protected from developmental encroachment to allow the free flow of flood
waters. Where floodway data has been provided in the Flood Insurance Study,
such data shall be used to define the floodway. Where no floodway data has been
provided, the Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to provide a
floodway delineation. The applicant will be responsible for providing the
Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make
such determination.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No development shall be permitted in the floodway that would result in
any increase in the base flood elevation. Consideration of the effects of any
development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption that an equal
degree of development would be allowed for similarly situated lands.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All development within the floodway shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â No development shall affect the capacity or conveyance of the channel
or floodway of any tributary to the main stream, drainage ditch, or any other
drainage facility or system.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Structures, buildings, recreational vehicles, and sanitary and utility
systems, if permitted, shall meet the applicable General Floodplain standards
and shall be constructed or aligned to present the minimum possible resistance
to flood flows.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Structures, if permitted, shall have a low flood damage potential and
shall not be for human habitation.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Storage of materials or equipment that are buoyant, flammable,
explosive, or injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. Storage
of other material may be allowed if readily removable from the floodway within
the time available after flood warning.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Watercourse alterations or relocations (channel changes and
modifications) must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within
the altered or relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations
must be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Any fill allowed in the floodway must be shown to have some beneficial
purpose and shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Pipeline river or stream crossings shall be buried in the streambed and
banks or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due to channel
degradation and meandering or due to the action of flood flows.
156.06Â Â Â VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
1.Â Â Â The Council may authorize upon request in specific cases such variances
from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the public interest
where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of
this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances granted must meet
the following applicable standards.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection
for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the applicant
shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator that: (i)
the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage and
(ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
2.Â Â Â Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Council Shall be Based. In passing
upon applications for variances, the Council shall consider all relevant
factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or downstream
to the injury of others.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
City.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for
the proposed use.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for the area.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood water expected at the site.
Â Â Â L.Â Â Â The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
Â Â Â M.Â Â Â Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this chapter.
3.Â Â Â Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above, the Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as
it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such conditions may
include, but not necessarily be limited to:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Limitation of periods of use and operation.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes, levees,
and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the Department of
Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative to achieving
the purpose of this chapter.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the flood
protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration, rate
of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated with
the regulatory flood. The Council shall require that the applicant submit a
plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
156.07Â Â Â NONCONFORMING USES.
1.Â Â Â A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before
the passage or amendment of this chapter, but which is not in conformity with
the provisions of this chapter, may be continued subject to the following
conditions:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any future use
of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless
it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary, building, or safety codes or regulations or
the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
designation.
2.Â Â Â Except as provided in Section 156.07(1)(B), any use which has been
permitted as a variance shall be considered a conforming use.
156.08Â Â Â PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
the requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this
chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction
thereof be fined not more than $500.00 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days.
Nothing herein contained prevent the City from taking such other lawful action
as is necessary to prevent or remedy violation.
156.09Â Â Â AMENDMENTS.
The regulations and standards set forth in this chapter may from time to time
be amended, supplemented, changed, or repealed. No amendment, supplement,
change, or modification shall be undertaken without prior approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.

master plan and development guidelines and standards in which the land uses,
transportation elements, building densities, arrangements, and types are set
out in a unified plan, which may provide greater flexibility of land use,
transfer of development rights within the PUD, bulk regulations, and building
locations than the conventional zoning district may permit. The PUD District is
intended to: maximize benefits from the use of open spaces; maximize
aesthetics; encourage certain architectural standards for buildings; permit
mixed uses and diversity of bulk regulations without endangering the health,
safety, welfare, and land value of surrounding and internal properties. A PUD
may consist of a mix of land uses of residential building types, commercial,
and limited industrial, provided such Planned Unit Development is compatible
with the Comprehensive Plan of the City.
3.Â Â Â Minimum Size, Land Use, and Maximum Density. A PUD shall consist of at
least 10 acres, land use types compatible with the Comprehensive Plan of the
City, and the density of the PUD shall not be in excess of the density
permitted by this section and compatible with the Comprehensive Plan. A Planned
Unit Development may include multiple-family or two-family dwellings in areas
designated as R-1 zoning in the Comprehensive Plan, if the proposed land use is
compatible with land uses adjoining and outside the PUD, and the dwelling unit
density of the PUD is not greater than 10 percent greater than the maximum
density permitted by the underlying zoning as set forth in this subsection.
4.Â Â Â Master Plan. As part of a proposed Planned Unit Development rezoning of
land in the City, a master plan shall be prepared and 15 copies submitted to
the City which shows the generalized overall land use plan for development of
the area of the proposed PUD and shall include the following information:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A vicinity map of sufficient scale to show site boundaries and the
zoning of adjacent properties within 1,000 feet.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Dimensions, legal descriptions, acreage, existing zoning, land use, and
ownership of the area of the proposed PUD; and existing zoning, land use, and
ownership of contiguous properties within 200 feet. The master plan shall be
submitted on paper sheets of 24 inches by 36 inches.

how they can be mitigated.
5.Â Â Â Rules, Regulations, and Guidelines for Land Use and Performance. In
conjunction with the submittal of a master plan illustrating the location of
each development â€œparcel,â€ there shall be prepared rules, regulations and
guidelines for the development of the PUD, and such matters shall be part of

the Zoning Administrator or other delegated City personnel, and receipt of the
PUD proposal, shall consider the presentation and give special attention to the
following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Compatibility with Comprehensive Plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Land use and density.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Building types, functions, architecture, buffers and arrangement.

Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Access to and from the site, and traffic circulation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â General relationship to surrounding area.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The Planning and Zoning Commission may approve or disapprove the PUD
master plan and associated development rules, regulations, and guidelines as
submitted, or may require the developer to modify, alter, adjust, or amend the
proposed master plan and associated rules, regulations, and guidelines, as the
Commission deems necessary, in order to preserve the harmonious intent and
purpose of this chapter and the Comprehensive Plan of the City.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â An application for approval of PUD shall be deemed a petition for
rezoning to the PUD District, but prior to an affirmative report from the
Commission the applicant shall file the necessary petition as prescribed in
Changes and Amendments, Section
165.39.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Before any report is forwarded to the City Council by the Planning and
Zoning Commission pertaining to an application submitted for a PUD, said
Commission shall determine if such proposal is compatible with the
Comprehensive Plan or if such proposal represents a substantial change to the
Comprehensive Plan. The Commission shall hold a public hearing, giving notice
as provided by law for a rezoning.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â After a complete review by the Planning and Zoning Commission, a
written recommendation and report giving reasons as to their action shall be
filed with the City Council.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Within a period of 60 days after the City Council has received a report
from the Planning and Zoning Commission, together with the proposed master
plan, and rules, regulations, and guidelines of the PUD development, a public
hearing shall be held by the City Council in accordance with the provisions of
Section
165.34. The City Council shall then approve or deny the application, in
accordance with Section
165.35.
7.Â Â Â Recording of Master Plan and Associated Rules, Regulations, and
Guidelines. The ordinance providing for the rezoning of property to the PUD
District and the associated master plan, rules, regulations, and guidelines as
approved by the City Council shall be recorded at the Office of the County
Recorder and shall be binding on the property owners, their heirs, successors,
or assigns.
8.Â Â Â Modifications. Any proposed modifications in the approved PUD shall first
be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Said proposed modifications
along with a report from the Commission shall then be forwarded to the City
Council with appropriate recommendations. The City Council shall then take such
appropriate action on the proposed modification and their decision shall be
final. No modification may be considered that is more than a 10 percent
increase in density or change of uses on the site without a public hearing as
required of a rezoning procedure. A public hearing may be required before the
City Council on any modification, if determined by the Council. All
modifications and adjustments shall be recorded at the Office of the County
Recorder as required of the original rezoning.

165.22Â Â Â HOME OCCUPATIONS.
1.Â Â Â Statement of Intent. It is recognized that while a home occupation in and
of itself is an acceptable use within a residential area, it is when those uses
take on a more commercial character that conflicts arise. This section is
intended to protect residential districts from potential adverse impacts of
activities defined as home occupations and to ensure that home occupations do
not have a negative impact upon the residential area in which they are located;
to permit residents of the community a broad choice in the use of their homes
as a place of livelihood in the production or supplementing of personal and
family income; to restrict incompatible uses; and to establish criteria and
develop standards for the use of residential structures or dwelling units for
home occupations. It is not the intent to eliminate certain home-based
businesses and occupations which may be compatible with the residential areas.
2.Â Â Â Criteria. The following are the criteria for Home Occupations.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No Exterior Display. There shall be no exterior display except for a
sign, as specified in Paragraph D below.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Residential Design Features. The building shall include no features of
design not customary for residential use.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Residential Character. The building or premises occupied shall not be
rendered objectionable or detrimental to the residential character of the
neighborhood due to exterior appearance or by the emission of dust, gas, noise,
odor, smoke, or in any other way.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Signs. Any sign utilized by a home occupation in a residential district
shall be limited to one building-mounted sign which shall not exceed one square
foot in area.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Equipment. Any merchandise or stock in trade sold, repaired or
displayed shall be stored entirely within the residential structure or in an
accessory building.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Employment. The home occupation shall be carried on by a member of the
family residing in the dwelling unit, employing not more than two nonresident
persons outside the immediate family residing on the premises. Additional
employees may be permitted as required by law, or may be permitted through the
variance process by the Board of Adjustment.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Traffic and Parking. Traffic generated by the home occupation shall not
be objectionable to the neighboring residents. Off-street parking shall be
adequate to accommodate the parking demand generated by the home occupation.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Structural Additions. Any additions to the residence for the expansion
of a home occupation are prohibited.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Rental Unit. If the home occupation is to be conducted in a rental
unit, a written statement from the property owner giving his or her permission
is required.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Noncompliance. Any home occupation which does not abide by the terms of
this section shall be punishable under this Code of Ordinances.
3.Â Â Â Registration Required. All home occupations require a completed
registration form to be filed with the City in order to assure compliance with
the terms of this Zoning Code. There is no fee associated with registration.
Approval by the City must be issued prior to the commencement of any home
occupation use. All home occupations shall be reviewed every two years and
shall be subject to reconsideration by the Board of Adjustment if at any time
the Code Enforcement Officer determines that the conduct has become detrimental
to the neighborhood.

Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Office facilities for accountant, architect, engineer, lawyer,
clergyman, or other similar professional occupations.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Office facilities for telecommuters, sales representatives,
manufacturerâ€™s representatives, and other similar trades or occupations when
traffic generated complies with the traffic and parking criteria as stated in
Subsection 2.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Home sewing or tailoring.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Studio for an artist, photographer, writer, or composer.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Telephone answering.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Catering and home cooking and preserving for the purpose of selling the
product.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Tutoring or giving lessons, limited to four students simultaneously.

â€œpermittedâ€ or â€œprohibitedâ€ shall use and abide by the variance process through
the Board of Adjustment. The Board shall take into account concerns by
neighbors and the possible negative impacts of the residential character of the
neighborhood. The Board may place any restrictions on the home occupation and
the Board shall be critical when evaluating requests for additional employees.
7.Â Â Â Changes to the Operation or Selling of Property. Home occupation permits
do not continue with the land and are not transferrable. Any change to the
operation of the home occupation requires a re-registration.
165.23Â Â Â NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND STRUCTURES.
1.Â Â Â Nonconforming Uses of Land and Structures. Within the various districts
established by the Zoning Ordinance, as amended, there exist uses of land and
structures that were lawfully in existence prior to the adoption of the Zoning
Code, or amendments thereto, but which do not conform to the current provisions
of the Zoning Code, as amended. These uses are defined for purposes of the
Zoning Code as â€œnonconforming uses.â€ It is the intent of the Zoning Code to
avoid undue hardship to the owners of nonconforming uses by permitting
nonconforming uses to continue until they are removed. However, nonconforming
uses are declared by the Zoning Code to be incompatible with conforming uses in
the districts involved and to have an adverse impact on orderly development or
on the market value of properties with conforming uses.
2.Â Â Â Nonconforming Use of Land. The nonconforming use of land upon which no
structure is erected or constructed may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged, increased, or extended to
occupy a greater area of land than was occupied immediately before the use
became nonconforming.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â No such nonconforming use shall be moved, in whole or in part, to any
other portion of the lot or parcel that was not occupied by such use
immediately before the use became nonconforming.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
continuous period of three months, any subsequent use of such land thereafter
shall conform to the district regulations for the district in which such land
is located. However, if the nonconforming use is a seasonal use, to the extent
that the use consistently is not operated during an off-season time period each
year, then the off-season time period shall not be considered a period when the
use has ceased for purposes of this subsection.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â If any such nonconforming use is changed to or replaced by a conforming
use, the use shall not thereafter be changed back to the nonconforming use.
3.Â Â Â Nonconforming Use of Structures. The nonconforming use of a structure, or
of a structure and land in combination, may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No structure devoted to such nonconforming use shall be enlarged,
extended, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered, unless the subsequent
use of the structure and land in combination is brought into conformity with
the district regulations for the district in which the structure and land are
located.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If any such nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and land in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for a continuous period of three
months, any subsequent use of such structure, or structure and land in
combination, thereafter shall conform to the district regulations for the
district in which the structure and land is located. However, if the
nonconforming use is a seasonal use, to the extent that the use consistently is
not operated during an off-season time period each year, then the off-season
time period shall not be considered a period when the use has ceased for
purposes of this subsection.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If any nonconforming structure is destroyed by any means to an extent
of 50 percent or more of its market value at the time of destruction, then such
structureâ€™s nonconforming status shall terminate, and if such structure is
reconstructed the subsequent use of the structure and land in combination shall
conform to the district regulations for the district in which the structure and
land is located.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â If any nonconforming structure is destroyed by any means to an extent
of less than 50 percent of its market value at the time of destruction, such
structure may be reconstructed provided that the reconstruction project must be
commenced within six months from the date of partial destruction and must be
diligently prosecuted to completion.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
4.Â Â Â Repairs and Alterations.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Ordinary repairs and alterations may be made to nonconforming
structures, provided that no structural alterations may be made to such
nonconforming structures. A nonconforming residential building may be repaired
or altered to improve livability and health conditions, provided that no change
in the number of dwelling units is permitted.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If any official charged with protecting the public safety declares any
building or part thereof to be unsafe and orders that action be taken for the
restoring of such building to a safe condition, nothing in the Zoning Code
shall be interpreted to prohibit such action.
5.Â Â Â Unlawful Uses are Not Nonconforming Uses. The nonconforming use
regulations of this section are applicable only to uses of land and structures
that were lawfully in existence prior to the adoption of the Zoning Code, or
amendment thereto, but which do not conform to the current provisions of the
Zoning Code, as amended. Any use of land, use of structure, or use of a
structure and land in combination that, immediately prior to the adoption of
the Zoning Code or amendment thereto, was not a lawful use under the previous
zoning regulations, shall not be authorized to have nonconforming status under
this section.
6.Â Â Â Annexation. The nonconforming use regulations of this section are
applicable to all structures and uses of land and structures that were lawfully
in existence prior to the annexation of the subject property into the City, but
which would be prohibited or restricted after annexation under the provisions
of the Zoning Code, or amendments thereto.

these regulations. Said officer may be provided with the assistance of such
other persons as the Council may direct. If the Zoning Administrator finds that
any of these regulations are being violated, such officer shall notify in
writing the person responsible for such violations, indicating the nature of
the violation and ordering the action necessary to correct it. The Zoning
Administrator shall order discontinuance of illegal buildings or structures or
of additions, alterations, or structural changes thereto; discontinuance of any
illegal work being done; or shall take any other action authorized by these
regulations to insure compliance with or to prevent violation of its
provisions.

each be charged with a separate offense and upon conviction suffer the
penalties provided.
165.27Â Â Â OTHER REMEDIES.
If any building or structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered,
repaired, or land is used in violation of these regulations, the City may, in
addition to other remedies, institute injunction, mandamus, or other
appropriate lawful action necessary to prevent, correct, or abate such
violation.
165.28Â Â Â CONSTRUCTION COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATE.
A construction compliance certificate shall be obtained from the Zoning
Administrator before any building or structure shall be erected, reconstructed,
or structurally altered to increase the exterior dimensions, height, or floor
area, or remodeled to increase the number of dwelling units or accommodate a
change in use of the building or premises or part thereof. The construction
compliance certificate shall state that the proposed construction complies with
all provisions of these regulations, and no subsequent modifications shall be
made to plans or to actual construction that would be in violation of these
regulations. The construction compliance certificate shall be accompanied by a
site plan drawn to scale, showing existing and proposed structures, uses, open
spaces, parking and loading facilities and other features affecting the use of
the property.
165.29Â Â Â OCCUPANCY COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATE.
Subsequent to the effective date of these regulations, no change in the use or
occupancy of land or any change in use of occupancy in an existing building,
other than for single-family dwelling purposes, shall be made, nor shall any
new building be occupied for any purpose other than a single-family dwelling
until an occupancy compliance certificate has been issued by the Zoning
Administrator. Every occupancy compliance certificate shall state that the new
occupancy complies with all provisions of these regulations and no subsequent
modifications shall be made to the occupancy, use, or method of operation that
would be in violation of these regulations. All construction and occupancy
compliance certificates shall be covered by a weatherproof material and shall
be affixed to a sturdy sign, and displayed between the curb line and sidewalk
at all times during construction. Failure to do so shall be a violation of this
Code.
165.30Â Â Â APPLICATION FOR COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATE.
Applications for compliance certificates shall be made prior to beginning
construction or assuming occupancy on fully completed application forms
obtained from the Zoning Administrator, accompanied by such plans and

165.35Â Â Â STAY OF PROCEEDINGS.
An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from,
unless the Zoning Administrator from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the
Board, after the notice of appeal is filed with said official, that by reason
of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his or her opinion, cause
imminent peril to life and property. In such cases, proceedings shall not be
stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board or

165.36Â Â Â BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT: POWERS AND DUTIES.
The Board shall have the following powers and duties.
1.Â Â Â Administrative Review. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is error in order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the
administrative official in the enforcement of these regulations.
2.Â Â Â Special Exceptions; Conditions Governing Applications and Procedures. To
hear and decide only such special exceptions as the Board is specifically
authorized to pass on by the terms of these regulations, to decide such
questions as are involved in determining whether special exceptions should be
granted, to grant special exceptions with such restrictions and conditions as
are appropriate under these regulations, and to deny special exceptions when
not in harmony with the purpose and intent of these regulations. A special
exception shall not be granted by the Board unless and until the following
requirements are satisfied:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Application and Hearing Procedures. The following procedures shall
apply to all requests for special exceptions before the Board:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A written application for a special exception must be submitted
indicating the section of this chapter under which the special exception is
sought and stating the grounds upon which it is requested.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Notice shall be given at least seven days in advance of a public
hearing on the application by posting notice in a conspicuous place at City
Hall.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear and
participate at the public hearing, either in person or by agent or attorney.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â In granting any application for a special exception, the Board
shall set forth its decision in writing, and the written decision shall contain
findings that the Board is empowered under the applicable section of this
chapter to grant the special exception and that the granting of the special
exception will not adversely affect the public interest.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â A $100.00 non-refundable application fee shall accompany each
application.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Conditions to Authorization. In granting any special exception, the
Board may prescribe such restrictions and conditions with respect to the
permitted use as the Board deems reasonable to further the objectives of these
regulations. Violations of such restrictions and conditions, when made a part
of the terms under which the special exception is granted, shall be deemed a
violation of these regulations. Except as specifically provided in a decision
by the Board to grant a special exception, the permitted use shall conform to
all applicable regulations of the district or districts in which it is located.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Time Limitations. The Board may prescribe a time limit within which the
action for which the special exception is required to commence or terminate, or
both. Failure to commence or terminate, or both, such action within the
prescribed time limit set shall void the special exception.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Reversion. If the use authorized under an approved special exception is
not initiated within one year of approval of the special exception, or if the
use authorized under an approved special exception is discontinued or abandoned
for a continuous period of one year, then the right to maintain or continue the
special exception shall terminate by operation of law without any further
action by the Board.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Practical Difficulties. Provided all of the foregoing requirements of
Subsection A are satisfied, the Board shall have the power to authorize, in any
zoning district, exceptions to any setback area, length, width, height, yard,
size, or projection limitations or to the minimum required number of off-street
parking or loading spaces; provided such an exception may be granted only
where:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Such exception does not exceed 50 percent of the particular
limitation or number in question; or such exception is from a yard requirement
to permit an addition to an existing legal nonconforming building, and such
addition extends no further into the required yard than the existing building;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The exception relates entirely to a use classified by applicable
district regulations as either a principal permitted use, a permitted accessory
use, a permitted sign, or to off-street parking or loading areas accessory to
such a permitted use;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The exception is reasonably necessary due to practical difficulties
related to the land in question that prohibit the use of the subject property
in a manner reasonably similar to that of other property in the same district,
including, but not limited to, exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of
the subject property, exceptional topographical conditions, location of public
utilities or public improvements on or adjacent to the subject property, or
other extraordinary or exceptional situation;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Such practical difficulties cannot be overcome by any feasible
alternative means other than an exception; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The exception is in harmony with the essential character of the
neighborhood of the land in question.
3.Â Â Â Variances; Conditions Governing Applications and Procedures. To hear and
decide requests for variances under the terms of these regulations, to decide
such questions as are involved in determining whether variances should be
granted, to grant variances with such restrictions and conditions as are
appropriate under these regulations, and to deny variances when not in harmony
with the purpose and intent of these regulations. A variance shall not be
granted by the Board unless and until the following requirements are satisfied:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Application and Hearing Procedures. The following procedures shall
apply to all requests for variances before the Board:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A written application for a variance must be submitted stating the
grounds upon which it is requested.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Notice shall be given at least seven days in advance of a public
hearing on the application by posting notice in a conspicuous place at City
Hall.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear and
participate at the public hearing, either in person or by agent or attorney.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â In granting any application for a variance, the Board shall set
forth its decision in writing, and the written decision shall contain findings
of fact in support of the decision.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â A $100.00 non-refundable application fee shall accompany each
application.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Required Findings. The Board may grant a variance from the terms of
these regulations only if the Board determines that the applicant has
established that the subject property was acquired in good faith and where by
reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of the property, or
where by reason of exceptional topographical conditions or other extraordinary
or exceptional situation, the strict application of the terms of these
regulations actually prohibits the use of the subject property in a manner
reasonably similar to that of other property in the same district, and where
the Board is satisfied under the evidence before it that a literal enforcement
of the provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship,
and so that the spirit of these regulations shall be observed and substantial
justice done. To establish unnecessary hardship, a property owner must show all
of the following elements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The land in question cannot yield a reasonable return from any use
permitted by the regulations of the district in which the land is located.
Failure to yield a reasonable return may only be shown by proof that the owner
has been deprived of all beneficial or productive use of land in question. It
is not sufficient merely to show that the value of the land has been
depreciated by the regulations or that a variance would permit the owner to
maintain a more profitable use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances not of the
ownerâ€™s own making, which unique circumstances must relate specifically to the
land in question and to general conditions in the neighborhood.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The use to be authorized by the variance will not alter the
essential character of the locality of the land in question.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Conditions to Authorization. In granting any variance, the Board may
prescribe such restrictions and conditions with respect to the permitted use as
the Board deems reasonable to further the objectives of these regulations.
Violations of such restrictions and conditions, when made a part of the terms
under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of these
regulations. Except as specifically provided in a decision by the Board to
grant a variance, the permitted use shall conform to all applicable regulations
of the district or districts in which it is located.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Reversion. If the use authorized under an approved variance is not
initiated within one year of approval of the variance, or if the use authorized
under an approved variance is discontinued or abandoned for a continuous period
of one year, then the right to maintain or continue the variance shall
terminate by operation of law without any further action by the Board.
165.37Â Â Â DECISIONS OF THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
In exercising the above mentioned powers, the Board may, so long as such action
is in conformity with the terms of these regulations reverse or affirm, wholly
or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination as
ought to be made, and to that end shall have powers of the administrative
official from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of three members of
the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or
determination of the administrative official, or to decide in favor of the
applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this chapter,
or to effect any variation in application of this chapter.
165.38Â Â Â APPEALS FROM THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
Any person or any board, taxpayer, department, or bureau of the City aggrieved
by any decision of the Board may seek review by a Court of Record of such
decision, in the manner provided by the laws of the State and particularly by
Chapter 414, Code of Iowa.
165.39Â Â Â CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.
The regulations imposed and the districts created by this chapter may be
amended from time to time by the Council, but such amendments shall not be made
without public hearing before the Council and after a report has been made upon
the amendment by the Commission. At least seven daysâ€™ notice of the time and
place of such hearing shall be posted as required by Code of Iowa. In case the
Commission does not approve the change or, in the case of a protest filed with
the Council against a change in district boundaries signed by the owners of 20
percent or more either of the area of the lots included in such proposed
change, or of those immediately adjacent thereto and within the 200 feet of the
boundaries thereof, such amendment shall not be passed except by the favorable
vote of three-fourths of all members of the Council. Amendments need only refer
to the legally described land involved and need not refer to the Code section
to be valid. Such referral to only the legal description will not invalidate
the map or this chapter other than to change the zoning of the land described.
165.40Â Â Â APPLICATION FOR CHANGE OF ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
Any person may submit to the Council an application requesting a change in the
zoning district boundaries as shown on the official zoning district map. Such
application shall be filed with the Clerk, accompanied by a fee of $150.00,
plus $10.00 an acre, plus $3.00 per notification letter, and shall contain the
following information:
1.Â Â Â The legal description and local address of the property.
2.Â Â Â The present zoning classification and the zoning classification requested
for the property.
3.Â Â Â The existing use and proposed use of the property.
4.Â Â Â The names and addresses of the owners of all property within 200 feet of
the property for which the change is requested.
5.Â Â Â A statement of the reasons why the applicant feels the present zoning
classification is no longer valid.
6.Â Â Â A plat showing the locations, dimension, and use of the applicantâ€™s
property and all property within 200 feet thereof including streets, alleys,
railroads, and other physical features. All fees shall be deposited to the
general revenue fund of the City. Failure to approve the requested change shall
not be deemed cause to refund the fee to the applicant.
165.41Â Â Â OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING.
1.Â Â Â The requirements and regulations of this section shall apply to any
development or redevelopment of and within the City.
2.Â Â Â Statement of Intent. It shall be the intent of this section to prevent
traffic congestion and to provide for proper traffic safety by preserving the
public thoroughfares for the unimpaired movement of pedestrian and vehicular
traffic. Therefore, it shall be recognized that the requirements of this
section are minimum and that in certain uses of land, these requirements my be
inadequate. Where review of the site plans and intended land use indicate
through the application of proven standards or experienced statistics that the
requirements herein are inadequate for the specific land use adaptation, a
greater requirement for off-street parking space is justified and may be
required to preserve the intent of this section.
3.Â Â Â Off-Street Loading Space Requirements.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â In any zoning district in connection with every building or part
thereof hereafter erected, having a gross floor area of 10,000 square feet or
more, which is to be occupied by manufacturing, storage, warehouse, goods
display, retail store, wholesale store, market, hotel, hospital, mortuary,
office buildings, or other similar commercial or industrial uses which require
the receipt or distribution by vehicles of material or merchandise, there shall
be provided and maintained on the same lot with such building, at least one
off-street loading space, and for multiple tenant commercial or retail shopping
centers, one additional such loading space for each 20,000 square feet or major
fraction thereof of gross floor area so used in excess of 10,000 square feet,
provided the total number of loading spaces is not required to be more than the
total number of occupying tenants.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Each loading space shall not be less than nine feet in width and 19
feet in length for loading spaces not requiring loading dock access, and 12
feet in width and 50 feet in length for loading dock access for trucks. All
loading areas shall be designed in a manner acceptable to the City and provide
adequate space for loading access.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Such loading area may occupy part of a required yard or court
space, except required open space under Section
165.21(4) of this ordinance, and provided the loading area and access roadways

section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Loading yards and loading docks shall be located and buffered from
general public view, public streets, public buildings, recreation facilities,

where it is determined said loading areas are considered offensive to more
restrictive uses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â All loading yards and accesses to loading yards and loading docks
shall be paved with asphaltic or Portland cement concrete pavement in
accordance with surfacing requirements set forth in this chapter.

175.04Â Â Â PROCEDURE.
1.Â Â Â Whenever the owner of any tract or parcel of land within the jurisdiction
of this chapter wishes to subdivide or plat the same, said owner shall cause to
be prepared a preliminary plat of said subdivision, and shall submit 14 copies
of said preliminary plat and other information to the City Clerk. The
preliminary plat shall contain such information and data as is outlined in
175.08 thereof.
2.Â Â Â The Clerk shall immediately refer copies of the preliminary plat to the
Commission and to the City Engineer. The City Engineer shall carefully examine
said plat as to its compliance with this Code of Ordinances, the existing
street system, and good engineering practices, and shall, as soon as possible,
submit their findings to the Commission.
3.Â Â Â After receiving the Engineerâ€™s report, the Commission shall study the
preliminary plat and other material for conformity to these regulations. The
Commission may confer with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the
kind and extent of such improvements to be made. Before approving a preliminary
plan, the Commission may (at its discretion) hold a public hearing on the
proposed plat, notice of which shall be given by publication in a local
newspaper of general circulation, or by posting notices on the tract, or by
sending notices to affected property owners by mail. Such notice shall be given
within seven days prior to the public hearing. The Commission shall file with
the Council recommendations for approval or rejection of such preliminary plat
within 45 days after the date of submission of said plat and Engineerâ€™s report
to the Commission. Upon receiving recommendations of the Commission, the
Council shall consider the same and if the plat is found to conform to the
provisions of this chapter, they shall approve the preliminary plat.
4.Â Â Â The approval of the preliminary plat by the Council shall be null and void
unless the final plat is presented to the Council within 180 days after date of
said preliminary plat approval.
5.Â Â Â Approval of the final plat and final acceptance of improvements shall be
given by resolution of the Council which shall direct the Mayor and Clerk to
certify the resolution which shall be affixed to the plat. Procedure for
approval of the final plat shall be as outlined in Section
175.05(5) of this chapter.
175.05Â Â Â CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS FOR IMPROVEMENTS.
In addition to the standards set forth in this chapter, all minimum
improvements outlined in this chapter shall be constructed in accordance with
the current edition of the Iowa Statewide Urban Standards for Public
Improvements.
175.06Â Â Â DESIGN STANDARDS.
The standards and details of design herein contained are intended only as
minimum requirements so that the general arrangement and layout of a
subdivision may be adjusted to a wide variety of circumstances. However, in the
design and development of a plat, the subdivider shall use standards consistent
with the site conditions so as to assure an economical, pleasant, and durable
neighborhood.
1.Â Â Â Streets.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Comprehensive Plan. All proposed plats and subdivisions shall conform
to the Comprehensive Plan. All proposed plats and subdivisions shall also
conform to additional proposed street plans as set out by the City.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Continuation of Existing or Planned Streets. Proposed streets shall
provide for continuation or completion of any existing streets (constructed or
recorded) or any streets which are a part of an approved preliminary
subdivision plan, in adjoining property, at equal or greater width, but not
less than 60 feet in width, and in similar alignment, unless variations are
recommended by the Commission.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Circulation. The street pattern shall provide ease of circulation
within the subdivision as well as convenient access to adjoining streets,
thoroughfares, or unsubdivided land as may be required by the Commission. In a
case where a street will eventually be extended beyond the plat, but is
temporarily dead-ended, an interim turnaround may be required.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Street Intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right
angles as possible.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Cul-de-Sac. Whenever a cul-de-sac is permitted, such street shall be no
longer than 600 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround
having a street property line radius of at least 52 feet in the case of
residential subdivisions. The closed end of a commercial or industrial street
shall be provided with a turnaround having a street property line radius of at
least 55 feet. The right-of-way width of the street leading to the turnaround
shall be a minimum of 60 feet. The property lines at the intersection of the
turnaround and the lead-in portion of the street shall be rounded at a radius
of not less than 150 feet; or equal straight approach lines. The pavement width
for turnarounds shall be a minimum radius of 40 feet for residential and 45
feet for commercial or industrial. A turnaround diameter greater than the
minimum may be required by the Commission if it is deemed necessary.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Street Names. All newly platted streets shall be named in a manner
conforming to the prevailing street naming system. A proposed street that is
obviously in alignment with other existing streets, or with a street that may
logically be extended although the various portions be at a considerable
distance from each other, shall bear the same name. Names of new streets shall
be subject to the approval of the Commission and Council in order to avoid
duplication or close similarity of names.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Physical and Cultural Features. In general, streets shall be platted
with appropriate regard for topography, creeks, wooded areas, and other natural
features which would lend themselves to attractive treatment.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Half Streets. Dedication of half streets will NOT be permitted. Where
there exists a dedicated or platted half street or alley adjacent to the tract
of land to be subdivided, the other half shall be platted if deemed necessary
by the Commission.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Alleys. Alleys may be required in business areas and industrial
districts for adequate access to block interiors and for off-street loading and
parking purposes. Except where justified by unusual conditions, alleys will not
be approved in residential districts. Dead-end alleys shall be provided with a
means of turning around at the dead end thereof.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Easements. Easements for utilities shall be provided along rear or side
lot lines or along alleys, if needed. Whenever any stream or important surface
water course is located in an area that is being subdivided, the subdivider
shall, at his own expense, make adequate provision for widening the channel so
that it will properly carry the surface water, and shall provide and dedicate
to the City an easement along each side of the stream, which easement shall be
for the purpose of widening, improving, or protecting the stream and for the
purpose of installation of public utilities. The waterway easements shall be
approved by the City Engineer. The total width of the easement shall be
adequate to provide for these purposes, and said easement shall be a minimum of
50 feet on each side of the centerline of the stream or water course.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Neighborhood Plan. If any overall plan has been made by the Commission
for the neighborhood in which the proposed subdivision is located, the street
system of the latter shall conform in general thereto.
Â Â Â L.Â Â Â Land Not Platted. Where the plat to be submitted includes only part of
the tract owned by the subdivider, the Commission may require topography and a
sketch of a tentative future street system of the unsubdivided portion.
Â Â Â M.Â Â Â Major Thoroughfares. Where a new subdivision, except where justified by
limiting conditions, involves frontage on a heavy traffic way, the street
layout shall provide motor access to such frontage by one of the following
means:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A parallel street supplying frontage for lots backing onto the
traffic way.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A series of cul-de-sacs or short loops entered from and planned at
right angles to such a parallel street, with their terminal lots backing onto
the highway.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â An access drive separated by a planting strip from the highway to
which a motor access from the drive is provided at points suitably spaced.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â A service drive or alley at the rear of the lots. Where any one of
the above mentioned arrangements is used, deed covenants or other means shall
prevent any private residential driveways from having direct access to the
traffic way.
Â Â Â N.Â Â Â Dedication. A deed to the City shall be given for all streets before
the same will be accepted by the City for maintenance.
Â Â Â O.Â Â Â Railroads. If a railroad is involved, the subdivision plan should:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Be so arranged as to permit, where necessary, future grade
separations at highway crossings of the railroad.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Border the railroad with a parallel street at a sufficient distance
from it to permit deep lots to go back onto the railroad, or form a buffer
strip for park, commercial, or industrial use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Provide cul-de-sac at right angles to the railroad so as to permit
lots to back thereunto.
Â Â Â P.Â Â Â Street Widths. Streets shall be classified as arterial, collector, or
local according to the comprehensive plan. Street widths for arterials and
collectors must conform to the SUDAS Design Standards Manual according to
classification. Local streets shall be a minimum width of 26 feet from and to
the backs of curbs.
Â Â Â Q.Â Â Â Street Grades. Street grades shall be conforming with the requirements
set forth in the SUDAS Design Standards Manual. The following table describes
the maximum grades permitted as a percent.
MAXIMUM GRADES (percent)
Â 
        Arterials   Collectors  Local
Terrain Major Minor Major Minor
Flat    5     5     5     6     6
Rolling 6     6     7     7     8
Hilly   6     7     8     8     9
Â 
The above maximum grades are based on terrain and the type of roadway. Where
topography or circumstance demands that grades be steeper than the allowed
maximum, a recommendation shall be obtained from the Jurisdictional Engineer.
Â Â Â R.Â Â Â Private Streets. Private streets shall be permitted in the R-3 District
for condominium developments, pertinent to the following requirements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Minimum width of 26 feet from back of curb to back of curb must be
used where access is provided to more than 24 units.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A private street which is closed at one end shall be no longer than
600 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a cul-de-sac or
hammerhead turnaround.
2.Â Â Â Blocks.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Length. No block shall be longer than 1,320 feet. The distance of 1,320
may be reduced by the City if it is considered to be excessive in its
particular application.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Block Corner Radius. At street intersections, block corners shall be
rounded with a radius of not less than 15 feet, unless at any one intersection
a curve radius has been previously established, then such radius shall be used
as standard.
3.Â Â Â Lots.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Corner Lots - Widths. Corner lots shall have a minimum width of 80 feet
in order to permit adequate building setbacks on both front and side streets.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Double Frontage Lots/Prohibited. Double frontage lots, other than
corner lots, shall be prohibited except where such lots back onto a major
street or highway or except in the case of large commercial or industrial lots.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Side Lot Lines. Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles
to the street or radial to curved streets.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Lot Size. All lots shall conform to the lot dimensions and area minimum
as set forth in the applicable zoning district. Where public sewer is not
available and for the purpose of complying with minimum health standards, lots
which cannot be reasonably served by an existing public sanitary sewer system
shall have a minimum width of 100 feet, measured at the building line, and an
area of not less than an acre.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Flat Lots. Flag lots shall not be created, except where approved by
site plan. Existing flag lots shall be re-subdivided prior to issuance of a
building permit.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Street Access. Each lot shall have satisfactory access to an existing,
paved public street, by means of frontage or easement.
4.Â Â Â Improvements.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â General. The subdivider shall install and construct all improvements
required by this chapter. All required improvements shall be installed and
constructed in accordance with the SUDAS, under the supervision of the Council
and to its satisfaction. Inspection shall be provided by the City, at the

and accepted by formal resolution of the Council. Before passage of said
Resolution of Acceptance, the City Engineer shall report that said improvements
meet all City specifications and ordinances or other requirements, and all
agreements between the subdivider and the City; and the City Attorney shall
report that the subdivision owner has filed in proper form a maintenance bond
(or bonds) to cover all construction being dedicated to the City. Maintenance

subdivider will post, a performance bond or certified check with the Council
guaranteeing that said improvements will be constructed within a period of one
year from Councilâ€™s acceptance of the final plat. However, if a performance
bond is posted, final acceptance of the plat will not constitute final
acceptance by the City of any improvements to be constructed. Improvements will
be accepted only after their construction has been completed all in accordance
with the rules above outlined. No maintenance work will be done by the City and
no public funds will be expended in the subdivision until such improvements
have been completed and accepted by the City.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Resubdivisions. The Council may waive the requirements for the
construction and installation of some or all of the foregoing improvements in
cases of resubdivisions where only the size, shape and arrangement of lots is
