Organization shall establish a comprehensive hazard mitigation program, which
includes both long-term and short-term components:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Hazard Mitigation Plan.Â Â The long-term component shall be prepared and
adopted by resolution of the Board of Supervisors and the respective City
Council as the Hazard Mitigation of the County-Wide Multi-Hazard Plan, for the
purpose of enhancing long-term mitigation against future disasters. The hazard
mitigation plan shall identify and map the presence, location, extent and
severity of natural, man- made, or civil hazards, such as:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Severe flooding;
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Wildland and urban fires;
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Seismic hazards such as ground shaking and deformation, fault
rupture, liquefaction, and dam failure;
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Slope instability, mudslides, landslides and subsidence;
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Tornadoes and other high winds;
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Technological hazards, such as oil spills, natural gas leakage and
fires, hazardous and toxic materials contamination, nuclear power plant and
radiological accidents, other industrial accidents, and ground, air, and rail
transportation accidents;
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Civil incidents such as riots, terrorist actions, and crowd control
issues.
Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â The safety element shall determine and assess the communityâ€™s
vulnerability to such known hazards and shall propose measures to be taken both
before and after a major disaster to mitigate such hazards.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Short-Term Action Program.Â Â A short-term hazard mitigation program
shall be included in the Recovery Plan. It shall be comprised of hazard
mitigation program elements of highest priority for action, including
preparation and adoption of separate ordinances dealing with specific hazard
mitigation and abatement measures, as necessary. Such ordinances may require
special site planning, land use and development restrictions or structural
measures in areas affected by flooding, urban/wildland fire, wind, seismic or
other natural hazards, or remediation of known technological hazards such as
toxic contamination.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Post-Disaster Actions. Following a major disaster, the Recovery Task
Force shall participate in the Multi-Agency Hazard Mitigation Team with FEMA
and other entities, as called for in Section 409 of the Stafford Act and
related federal regulations. As appropriate, the Recovery Task Force may
recommend to the Board of Supervisors and the affected City Councils that the
County and affected Cities participate in the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program,
authorized in Section 404 of the Stafford Act in order to partially offset
costs of recommended hazard mitigation measures.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â New Information. As new information is obtained regarding the presence,
location, extent, and severity of natural or technological hazards, or
regarding new mitigation techniques, such information shall be made available
to the public, and shall be incorporated as soon as practical possible within
the Linn County Multi- Hazard Emergency Operations Plan and the Recovery Plan
through amendment.
37.11Â Â Â RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION STRATEGY.
Â Â Â At the earliest practicable time following the declaration of local
emergency in a major disaster, the Recovery Task Force shall prepare a
strategic program for recovery and reconstruction.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Functions. To be known as the Recovery Strategy, the proposed strategic
program shall identify and prioritize major actions contemplated or under way
regarding such essential functions as business resumption, economic
reinvestment, industrial recovery, housing replacement, infrastructure
restoration, and potential sources of financing to support these functions.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Review. The Recovery Strategy shall be forwarded to the Board of
Supervisors and the affected City Councils for review and approval following
consultation with FEMA, other governmental agencies, and business and citizen
representatives. The Recovery Strategy shall provide detailed information
regarding proposed and ongoing implementation of initiatives necessary to the
expeditious fulfillment of critical priorities and will identify amendment of
any other plans, codes or ordinances that might otherwise contradict or
otherwise block strategic action. The Recovery Task Force shall periodically
report to the Board of Supervisors and the affected City Councils regarding
progress toward implementation of the Recovery Strategy, together with any
adjustments which may be called for by changing circumstances and conditions.

46.02 Cigarettes and Tobacco
Â 
46.01Â Â Â CURFEW.
Â Â Â The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote
the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and
specifically to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults
responsible for minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors
committed after the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences
and criminal activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.

reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that
responsible adultâ€™s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful

adult responsible for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or
conduct or whereabouts of the minor.

secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically
accompanied by a law enforcement officer or a person employed by the facility
where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to
providing nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate
juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the personâ€™s
parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but
not for longer than six (6) hours without the oral or written order of a judge
or magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â â€œPublic placeâ€ includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys, and sidewalks dedicated to public use and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises, whether publicly or privately owned,
that are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited
commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is
permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has
access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is

specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have
custody or control of a minor.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Curfew Established. It is unlawful for any minor to be or remain upon

tall or other growths declared to be noxious by the City Council by resolution.
(Ord. 05-2016 - Aug. 16 Supp.)
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â â€œWeed Commissionerâ€ refers to an individual duly appointed by motion or
resolution of the City Council or the Commissionerâ€™s deputy or designee to
carry out the functions set out in this chapter.
52.02Â Â Â COMMISSIONER: DIRECTION AND CONTROL.
Â Â Â The Commissioner, subject to direction and control by the City Council,
shall supervise the control and destruction of all noxious weeds or growths
whenever found in the City including those growing within the limits of
cemeteries, along streets and highways as well as railroad right-of-way or
property. The Commissioner may enter upon any land in the City at any time for
the performance of the Commissionerâ€™s duty, and shall hire the labor and
equipment necessary, subject to the approval of the City Council.
52.03Â Â Â DECLARATION AS A NUISANCE.
Â Â Â Any noxious weeds or growths found growing in any lot or tract of land in
the City are hereby declared to be a public nuisance, and it is unlawful to
permit any such weeds or growths to grow or remain in any such place. Each
owner and each person in the possession or control of any lands shall cut,
burn, or otherwise destroy, in whatever manner may be prescribed by the City
Council or Commissioner, all noxious weeds or growths thereon as defined in
this chapter at such times in each year and in such manner as shall be
prescribed by order of the City Council or Commissioner, and shall keep said
lands free from such growth of any weeds or growths that shall render the
streets or highways adjoining said land unsafe for public travel.
52.04Â Â Â ENTERING LAND TO DESTROY WEEDS OR GROWTHS: NOTICE.
Â Â Â In case of a substantial failure by the owner or person in possession or
control of any land to comply with any order of destruction pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter, the Weed Commissioner, the Weed Commissionerâ€™s
deputies, and employees acting under the Weed Commissionerâ€™s direction shall
have full power and authority to enter upon any land within the City for the
purpose of destroying noxious weeds or growths. Such entry may be made without
the consent of the landowner or person in possession or control of the land but
actual work of destruction shall not be commenced until five days after the
service of a notice in writing on the landowner and/or on the person in
possession or in control of the land. The notice shall state the facts as to
failure of compliance with the City program of weed or growth destruction order
or orders made by the City Council and shall be served in the same manner as an
original notice except as hereinafter provided. The notice may be served by the
Weed Commissioner, the Weed Commissionerâ€™s deputies, or any person designated
in writing by the Weed Commissioner and filed in the office of the City Clerk;
provided, however, service on persons living temporarily or permanently outside
of the City may be made by sending the written notice of noncompliance by
certified mail to said person at the last known address to be ascertained, if
necessary, from the last tax list in the County Treasurerâ€™s office. Where any
person owning land within the City has filed a written instrument in the office
of the County Auditor designating the name and address of its agent, the notice
herein provided may be served on that agent. In computing time hereunder, the
time begins from the date of mailing as evidenced by the certified mail
receipt.
52.05Â Â Â FAILURE TO COMPLY.
Â Â Â In case of a substantial failure to comply by the date prescribed in any
order of destruction of weeds or growths made pursuant to this chapter, the
Weed Commissioner or the deputies may, subsequent to the time after service of
the notice provided for in Section
52.04, enter upon the land and cause the weeds or growths to be destroyed or
may impose a maximum penalty of a $10.00 fine for each day, up to ten days,
that the owner or person in control of the land fails to comply. If a penalty
is imposed and the owner or person in control of the land fails to comply, the
Weed Commissioner shall cause the weeds or growths to be destroyed, the actual
cost and expense of cutting, burning or otherwise destroying the weeds or
growths, along with the cost of serving notice and special meetings or
proceedings, if any, shall be paid by the City and together with the additional
assessment to apply toward costs of supervision and administration, be
recovered by an assessment against the tract of real estate on which the weeds
or growths were growing. Any fine imposed shall be recovered by a similar
assessment.
52.06Â Â Â EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS: USE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.
Â Â Â The City Council may appropriate moneys for the purpose of purchasing weed
or growth eradicating equipment and materials to carry out the duties of the
Commissioner for use on all lands in the City, public or private, and for the
payment of the necessary expenses and compensation of the Commissioner, and the
Commissionerâ€™s deputies, if any. When equipment or materials so purchased are
used on private property within the corporate limits of the City by the
Commissioner, the cost of materials used and an amount to be fixed by the City
Council for the use of the equipment shall be returned by the County Treasurer
upon the collection of the special assessment taxed against the property. In
the certification to the County Treasurer by the City Clerk, this apportionment
shall be designated along with the special tax assessed.
52.07Â Â Â LOSS OR DAMAGE TO CROPS OR PROPERTY.
Â Â Â The loss or damage to crops or property incurred by reason of such
destruction shall be borne by the title holder of said real estate, unless said
real estate shall be sold under contract whereby possession has been delivered
to the purchaser, in which event such purchaser shall bear such loss or damage,
excepting where a contract has been entered into providing a different
adjustment for such loss or damage.
52.08Â Â Â ASSESSMENT OF COSTS: HEARING PRIOR TO ASSESSMENT.
Â Â Â When the Commissioner destroys any weeds or growths under the authority of
this chapter, after failure of the landowner responsible to destroy such weeds
or growths pursuant to the order of the City Council or Commissioner, the cost
of destruction shall be assessed against the land and collected from the
landowner responsible in the following manner:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Semiannually, or as necessary, after the Weed Commissioner has
completed the destruction of weeds or growths by reason of noncompliance by
persons responsible therefor, the Commissioner shall determine as to each tract
of real estate the actual cost of labor and materials used by the Commissioner
in cutting, burning, or otherwise destroying said weeds or growths, the cost of
serving notice and special meetings or proceedings, if any. To the total of all
such sums expended, the Commissioner shall add an amount equal to 25 percent
thereof to compensate for the cost of supervision and administration and assess
the resulting sum against said tract of real estate by a special tax, which
shall be certified to the County Auditor and County Treasurer by the City
Clerk, and shall be placed upon the tax books and collected, together with
interest and penalty after due, in the same manner as other unpaid taxes. Such
tax shall be due on March 1 after such assessment, and shall be delinquent
after March 30. When collected, said funds shall be paid into the fund from
which said costs were originally paid.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Before making any such assessment, the City Council shall prepare a
plat or schedule showing the several lots, tracts of land, or parcels of ground
to be assessed, which shall be in accord with the assessorâ€™s records and the
amount proposed to be assessed against each of the same for destroying or
controlling weeds or growths during the fiscal year.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The City Council shall thereupon fix a time for the hearing on such
proposed assessments, which time shall not be later than December 15 of the
year, and at least 20 days prior to the time thus fixed for such hearing shall
give notice thereof to all concerned that such plat or schedule is on file, and
the amounts as shown therein will be assessed against the several lots, tracts
of land or parcels of ground described in said plat or schedule at the time
fixed for such hearing, unless objection is made thereto. Notice of such
hearing shall be given by one publication in the official newspaper of the City
or by posting a copy of such notice on the premises affected and by mailing a
copy by certified mail to the last known address of the person owning or
controlling said premises. At such time and place the owner of said premises or
anyone liable to pay such assessment may appear, with the same rights given by
law before boards of review in reference to assessments for general taxation.
52.09Â Â Â DUTY OF CITY PERSONNEL.
Â Â Â It is the duty of all City personnel to make complaints to the Weed
Commissioner or City Council whenever they observe property that is believed to
be in violation of this chapter. This should be done within the time to prevent
the blooming and maturing of noxious weeds or growths of the unlawful growth of
weeds or growths, if possible.

injured who at the time of such attack or injury, was committing a willful
trespass or was committing or attempting to commit other criminal conduct while
on the premises occupied by the owner or keeper of such animal, or was at the
time of the injury or attack, teasing, tormenting, abusing or physically
assaulting the animal.

or the property of someone other than its owner, thereby creating a hazard to
persons or property, such animal may, in the discretion of the Mayor or the
Police Chief, be destroyed if it cannot be confined or captured. The City shall
be under no duty to attempt the confinement or capture of a dangerous animal or
vicious animal found at large, nor shall it have a duty to notify the owner of
such animal prior to its destruction. If the animal can be confined, it will be
taken to the Cedar Valley Humane Society and held for a period of not less than
ten days, at the ownerâ€™s expense, to be observed for any illness or aggressive
behaviors. At the end of the ten-day period, the case will be reviewed by the
City Council to determine the disposition of the animal.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Upon the complaint of any individual that a person is keeping,
sheltering or harboring a dangerous animal or vicious animal on premises in the
City, the Mayor or Police Chief shall cause the matter to be investigated and
if after investigation, the facts indicate that the person named in the
complaint is keeping, sheltering or harboring a dangerous or vicious animal in
the City, the officer shall order the person named in the complaint to safely
remove such animal from the City or destroy the animal within three (3) days of
the receipt of such an order. Such order shall be contained in a notice to
remove the dangerous or vicious animal, and shall be served personally or by
certified mail. Such order and notice to remove the dangerous or vicious animal
shall not be required where such animal has previously caused serious physical
harm or death to any person or animal, in which case the officer shall cause
the animal to be immediately seized and impounded or destroyed if seizure and
impoundment are not possible without the risk of serious physical harm or death
to any person or animal.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The order to remove a dangerous animal or vicious animal issued by the
officer may be appealed to the Council. In order to appeal such order, written
notice of appeal must be filed with the Clerk within three (3) days after
receipt of the order contained in the notice to remove dangerous or vicious
animal. Failure to file such written notice of appeal shall constitute a waiver
of right to appeal the order of the officer.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The notice of appeal shall state the grounds for such appeal and shall
be delivered personally or by certified mail to the Clerk. The hearing of such
appeal shall be scheduled within seven (7) days of the receipt of notice of
appeal. The hearing may be continued for good cause. After such hearing, the
Council may affirm or reverse the order of the officer. Such determination
shall be contained in a written decision and shall be filed with the Clerk
within three (3) days after the hearing or any continued session thereof.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â If the Council affirms the action of the officer, the Council shall
order in its written decision that the person owning, sheltering, harboring or
keeping such dangerous or vicious animal remove such animal from the City or
destroy it. The decision and order shall immediately be served upon the person
against whom rendered in the same manner as the notice of removal. If the
original order of the officer is not appealed and is not complied with within
three (3) days or the order of the Council after appeal is not complied with
within three (3) days of its issuance, the officer is authorized to seize,
impound or destroy such dangerous animal or vicious animal. Failure to comply
with an order of the officer issued pursuant to this chapter and not appealed,
or of the Council after appeal constitutes a simple misdemeanor.

Â Â Â It is unlawful for a person to keep livestock within the City, except in
compliance with the Cityâ€™s zoning regulations.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the keeping of domestic
chickens or ducks shall be permitted in all residential zoning districts so
long as such keeping is in compliance with this subsection and all other
applicable City ordinances unless, despite compliance with the following, the
presence of any particular chickens endanger the health, safety, peace, quiet,
comfort, enjoyment of, or otherwise become a public nuisance to nearby
residents or occupants or places of business:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Chickens or Ducks must be confined in a coop or fowl house not less
than 18 inches in height or, in the alternative, within a fenced pen area.
Chickens or Ducks must be kept within the coop, the fowl house, or the fenced
pen area at all times unless removed for a temporary time for the safety of the
chicken or duck.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The coop, the fowl house, or the fenced pen area must be of such a
design to be reasonably expected to prevent entry by dogs, cats, or other
animals and shall be completely enclosed.

well ventilated.

there is no accumulation of moisture.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Any coop, fowl house, or fenced pen area shall be kept clean,

ducks caused by dogs, cats, or other animals, domestic or wild, whether such
animals are licensed by the City or not. Further, injury or death of a chicken
or duck caused by an animal is not, in and of itself, sufficient grounds for
the City to determine that the animal is a vicious animal pursuant to Chapter
55 of this Code of Ordinances. Any dead chicken or duck, not caused by
slaughtering, shall be disposed of immediately upon discovering in a manner so
as to not cause a nuisance pursuant to Chapter 50 of this Code of Ordinances.

family dwelling occupied and used as such by the permittee.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The applicant has provided notice to the residents of all
immediately adjacent dwellings of the applicant's intent to obtain a permit'
and
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The applicant has successfully completed an approved class in

plowing operations, so as to obviate the occurrence or continuance of a special
hazard caused by the said condition.

notice shall also state that the failure of the owner, lienholders or claimants
to exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property within the
time provided shall be deemed a waiver by the owner, lienholders and claimants
of all right, title, claim and interest in the vehicle or personal property and
that failure to reclaim the vehicle or personal property is deemed consent to
the sale of the vehicle at a public auction or disposal of the vehicle to a
demolisher and to disposal of the personal property by sale or destruction. If
the abandoned vehicle was taken into custody by a private entity without a
police authorityâ€™s initiative, the notice shall state that the private entity
may claim a garage keeperâ€™s lien as described in Section 321.90 of the Code of
Iowa, and may proceed to sell or dispose of the vehicle. If the abandoned
vehicle was taken into custody by a police authority or by a private entity
hired by a police authority, the notice shall state that any person claiming
rightful possession of the vehicle or personal property who disputes the
planned disposition of the vehicle or property by the police authority or
private entity or of the assessment of fees and charges provided by this
section may ask for an evidentiary hearing before the police authority to
contest those matters. If the persons receiving notice do not ask for a hearing
or exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property within the
ten-day reclaiming period, the owner, lienholders or claimants shall no longer
have any right, title, claim, or interest in or to the vehicle or the personal
property. A court in any case in law or equity shall not recognize any right,
title, claim, or interest of the owner, lienholders or claimants after the
expiration of the ten-day reclaiming period.

Â Â Â If it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identity and
addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders, notice by one
publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the
vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice
under Section
80.03. The published notice may contain multiple listings of abandoned vehicles
and personal property but shall be published within the same time requirements
and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed notice in Section
80.03.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3b])
80.05Â Â Â FEES FOR IMPOUNDMENT.
Â Â Â The owner, lienholder, or claimant shall pay all towing and storage fees as
established by the storage facility, whereupon the vehicle shall be released.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3a])
80.06Â Â Â DISPOSAL OF ABANDONED VEHICLES.
Â Â Â If an abandoned vehicle has not been reclaimed as provided herein, the
police authority or private entity shall make a determination as to whether or
not the motor vehicle should be sold for use upon the highways, and shall
dispose of the motor vehicle in accordance with State law.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[4])
80.07Â Â Â DISPOSAL OF TOTALLY INOPERABLE VEHICLES.
Â Â Â The City or any person upon whose property or in whose possession is found
any abandoned motor vehicle, or any person being the owner of a motor vehicle
whose title certificate is faulty, lost or destroyed, may dispose of such motor
vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without notification
procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more wheels or
other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable. The police
authority shall give the applicant a certificate of authority. The applicant
shall then apply to the County Treasurer for a junking certificate and shall
surrender the certificate of authority in lieu of the certificate of title.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.90[2e])
80.08Â Â Â PROCEEDS FROM SALES.
Â Â Â Proceeds from the sale of any abandoned vehicle shall be applied to the
expense of auction, cost of towing, preserving, storing, and notification
required, in accordance with State law. Any balance shall be held for the owner
of the motor vehicle or entitled lienholder for ninety (90) days, and then
shall be deposited in the State Road Use Tax Fund. Where the sale of any
vehicle fails to realize the amount necessary to meet costs the police
authority shall apply for reimbursement from the Department of Transportation.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[4])

Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The mechanical failure must be repaired by the customer within
fourteen (14) days of its discovery or receipt of notification by the City of
the extraordinary usage, whichever is earlier.
Â Â Â Â Â Â For purposes of this ordinance, mechanical failures occur when a
component no longer meets performance specifications. Mechanical failures can
include deformation, yielding, crack initiation, excessive spalling, corrosion,
extreme environmental conditions, etc. (i.e. water line breaks, internal
component failures in toilets, water heater failures) Items that are not
considered mechanical failures include leaving the faucet running, irrigating
lawns, or any other operational failure caused by the owner and/or tenant.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C. Â Â Â No adjustment shall be made unless the water consumed in the month
of extraordinary use exceeds 150% the customer's average monthly usage. Average
monthly usage for the purposes of this section shall be calculated utilizing a
one year rolling average of the volume of water used by the customer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D. Â Â Â Any reduction shall be limited to the three monthly billing periods
preceding the date that the repairs are made to the customer's plumbing system.

ordinary mail of this decision and the amount owed. The customer may appeal the
Administers decision to the City Council by written request mailed or delivered
to the City Clerk within 10 days of the date of the Administrator's notice to
the customer. The appeal will be placed on the City Council's agenda as soon as
practical and the City Clerk shall notify the customer by ordinary mail of the
date of hearing at least, five (5) days prior to the date of the hearing.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â In the event that the customer demonstrates qualification for a
reduction in the customer's utility charges under the foregoing guidelines, and
is granted a reduction by the City Administrator or the City Council on appeal,
then water portion the monthly utility bill for which reduction is sought shall
be reduced by 25% with such reduction being provided to the customer as a
credit toward the customer's next monthly bill issued after City Administrator
or City Council's decision.

Â 
94.01Â Â Â REQUIRED CONDITIONS.
Â Â Â Except as hereinafter provided, private wells and water systems shall not be
maintained by any individual or property owner, nor shall any new wells be
established within the City limits. Private wells and water systems shall be
allowed only if one or more of the following conditions are established by the
applicant to the satisfaction of the City:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Existing Well. The well or water system was in existence prior to March
22, 2004, and duly registered with the City, which registration specified the
location of the well, by address and legal description, the name and address of
the property owner of the well, the name and address of all individuals using
the well, and the address and legal description of all properties serviced by
the well.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Location. No part of a tract of ground from which a private well or
water system is proposed shall be within 300 feet of a City water main.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Undue Hardship. The property owner or individual applying for a private
well permit shall show that denying the permit and not allowing the private
well or water system will cause the individual or property owner undue
hardship. Undue hardship in this case means that the particular tract of land
is so topographically situated that connection to the City water main system
would be unfeasible and that the particular conditions causing the
unfeasibility of the connection are in no way caused or contributed to by the
property owner or permit applicant. The Council shall rule on all questions of
undue hardship and their decision shall be final.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Shallow Well. A shallow well, sometimes known as a â€œsand point,â€ may be
authorized by the Council upon the applicantâ€™s entering into an agreement or
covenant, running with the land, with the City that such shallow well shall not
be connected to any part of the municipal water system.
94.02Â Â Â PERMIT FOR NEW WELL.
Â Â Â All individuals who desire to construct or maintain a new private well or
water system within the City must first make application to the Clerk for a
private well permit. The Council shall establish the contents of the permit
application by resolution. No permit for a new well or water system shall be
granted unless one or more of the required conditions under Section
94.01 are established and the well meets all applicable City, County, State and
Federal rules, regulations and laws.
94.03Â Â Â ANNUAL RENEWAL OF PERMIT.
Â Â Â Every well, including existing wells and future wells, shall be tested
annually, and results of the tests filed with the Clerk. An individual well
owner may cause to have a sample of the well water taken to the nearest
authorized testing agency for testing, and a copy of such test results shall be
filed with the Clerk. Every well shall be tested annually during the month of
September of each year, and the test results shall be filed with the Clerk on
or before the first day of October of each year. If a well owner fails to
comply with this annual test requirement, the Clerk shall send a notice to the
well owner at the last known address, advising the well owner no annual test
results have been filed with the Clerk. The notice shall further specify that
if the well owner does not properly test the well and file the test results
with the Clerk within sixty (60) days after the date of mailing of the notice,
the City shall declare the well abandoned, and the owner shall forthwith
terminate use of the well as required under Section
94.08 of this chapter. In the event a well owner has timely filed the annual
test results with the Clerk or timely filed test results after notice and the
test results show compliance with all applicable health and safety standards as
required by appropriate City, County, State and Federal rules, regulations and
laws, the Clerk shall renew the original permit for an additional one-year
period.
94.04Â Â Â NONRENEWAL OF ANNUAL PERMIT.
Â Â Â In the event a well owner receives annual test results that indicate lack of
compliance with appropriate City, County, State and Federal rules, regulations
and laws, the well owner shall immediately advise the City of the test results
and immediately correct the problems and bring the well up to applicable
standards. The well owner shall have an additional ninety (90) days after
October 1 of each year to correct any problems shown by the annual test. If
applicable standards cannot be met or if the problems are not timely corrected,
no renewal permit shall be issued and the well owner shall forthwith terminate
use of the well as required under Section
94.08.
94.05Â Â Â REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
Â Â Â If at any time it is determined that a private well or water system does not
meet applicable City, County, State or Federal rules, regulations or laws, the
permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall automatically terminate without
further notice to the well owner. The well owner shall have ninety (90) days to
correct the problems so that applicable standards are met. In the event
applicable standards cannot be met, the well shall be abandoned and the well
owner shall forthwith terminate use of the well as required by Section
94.08. In the event a private well or water system is not used for any
consecutive nine-month period of time, then at the expiration of the current
private well permit period, the permit shall not be renewed unless the well
owner shows good cause for the non-use and all provisions of this chapter for a
new well are complied with.
94.06Â Â Â HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS; RIGHT OF INSPECTION.
Â Â Â All private wells and private water systems for which permits are granted
pursuant to this chapter shall meet all applicable City, County, State and
Federal rules, regulations and laws. All permit holders, as a condition of
receiving a permit, grant to the City the right to enter the well ownerâ€™s
property solely to inspect and test any private well maintained upon the permit
holderâ€™s property. In the event the private well or water system so inspected
and tested by the City does not meet applicable standards, the City shall
notify the well owner in writing of the failure to meet applicable standards.
The well owner shall have ninety (90) days from the date of mailing the notice
to correct the problems. If the owner fails to timely correct the problems, the
permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall terminate without further notice
to the well owner, and the well owner shall forthwith terminate use of the well
as required under Section
94.08. In the event a private well or water system cannot be brought up to
applicable standards in the time period allowed herein, and the well owner is
not otherwise connected to the Cityâ€™s water system, the well owner shall
connect to the City water system within 180 days in accordance with this Code
of Ordinances.
94.07Â Â Â PERMIT FEES.
Â Â Â The following fee schedule applies to permits for private wells and water
systems:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Initial Permit. No fee is charged for the initial registration permit
for an existing well.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Annual Renewal Permit. There is no fee for each annual renewal permit,
provided the well owner does the test at the ownerâ€™s own expense. In the event
a well owner fails to have the well tested as required pursuant to this chapter
and the City makes the test, the costs of testing shall be charged to the well
owner, and the well owner shall pay an annual permit fee of ten dollars
($10.00).
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Permit Fees for New Wells. Any person desiring to install a new well or
water system shall make application to the Clerk for a permit, and prior to
start of construction shall pay the following permit fees:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â For a new â€œsand pointâ€ or shallow well, a fee of $5.00;
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â For a new well to be used for a supply of potable water, a fee of
$10.00; and in addition, the well owner shall file with the Clerk a certificate
from a State authorized laboratory that a State bacteriological test has been
made on the water and the water supply is potable.
All permit fees shall be paid to the Clerk at the time the application is
filed. In the event the permit is not granted, the application fee shall be
returned to the applicant.
94.08Â Â Â TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT.
Â Â Â In the event any private well or water system is no longer being used, due
to failure to comply with applicable standards, the well ownerâ€™s connection to
the City water system, or other reasons, the well owner or property owner shall
cut off the service mains to the well and the well abandoned in such manner as
to preclude its further use. The termination of use shall be done by the owner
in accordance with standards and guidelines of the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources.

Â Â Â When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the ownerâ€™s
expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.

Â Â Â All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHâ€™s are determined from
periodic grab samples).

The responsibility for providing proper solid waste management and those
services that avail the generator of the opportunity for proper solid waste and
recyclable materials management rests with cities or the County. Private and
public service providers transport solid waste and recyclable materials to
support this management system. Landfill disposal of recyclable corrugated
cardboard is unnecessary. Recyclable corrugated cardboard is easily
identifiable, can be readily recycled locally, and facilities and resources are
reasonably available in Linn County for the recycling and reuse of corrugated
cardboard. Recyclable corrugated cardboard should be precluded from landfill
disposal so as to extend landfill capacity, which is a limited resource. This
chapter supports the landfill ban of recyclable corrugated cardboard in the
County by requiring the separation and recycling of recyclable corrugated
cardboard.

cutting back of limbs to stubs larger than 3 inches in diameter within the
treeâ€™s crown to such a degree so as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure
the tree. Trees severely damaged by storms or other causes, or certain trees
under utility wires or other obstructions where other pruning practices are
impractical may be exempted from this chapter at the determination of the City
Council. Unless specifically authorized by the City Tree Board, no person shall
intentionally damage, cut, carve, transplant, or remove any tree on public
property; attach any rope, wire, nail, advertising poster, or other contrivance
to any tree on public property; allow any gaseous liquid or solid substance
that is harmful to such trees to come in contact with them or with their roots;

Tree Board, Street Superintendent, City Administrator, or any of their
designees, while engaging in or participating in any planting, cultivation,
mulching, pruning, spraying, removing or inspecting any street trees, park
trees or other trees, shrubs, or other plantings on public property as
specified in this chapter; provided, however, nothing herein shall be construed
as an attempt to prohibit the pursuit of any remedy, legal or equitable, in any
court of competent jurisdiction for the protection of property rights by the
owner of any property within the City.
151.12Â Â Â FUNDS RECEIVED FOR DAMAGES OR LOSS OF TREES.
Â Â Â Any funds received or collected by the City for damage or loss of street or
park trees shall be placed in a City Tree Fund and designated for the purchase
of replacement street and park trees.
151.13Â Â Â APPEALS.
Â Â Â A decision of the Tree Board may be appealed to the City Council. All
appeals must be made in writing, addressed to the Mayor and copies to the
Chairperson of the Tree Board. The Council is required to hold a hearing on the
appeal within 35 days of the receipt of said appeal. Written notice of the

Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Intent. This Code shall be construed to secure its expressed intent,
which is to ensure public health, safety, and welfare insofar as they are
affected by the continued occupancy and maintenance of rental dwelling
structures and premises. Rental dwelling structures and premises that do not
comply with these provisions shall be altered or repaired to provide a minimum
level of health and safety as required in this Code. It is hereby further
declared that the purpose of this Code is to provide procedures for the
registration, maintenance, inspection, and certification of dwelling units for
use as rental housing.
161.02Â Â Â APPLICABILITY.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â General. The provisions of this Code shall apply to all matters
affecting or relating to structures and premises, as set forth in Section
161.01(2). Where, in a specific case, different sections of this Code specify
different requirements, the most restrictive shall govern.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Maintenance. Equipment, systems, devices, and safeguards required by
this Code or a previous regulation or Code under which the structure or
premises was constructed, altered, or repaired shall be maintained in good
working order. No owner, operator, or occupant shall cause any service,

strength, stability, or proper operation of an existing fixture, structure, or
equipment, or for the public safety, health, and general welfare, not
specifically covered by this Code, shall be determined by the Code Official.
161.03Â Â Â DEFINITIONS.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â "Designated agent" means a person designated when the owner does not
live within a 100-mile radius of the rental dwelling unit. Said designated
agent does live within a 100-mile radius of the rental unit and must have the
authority to act on the owner's behalf to accept notices and to authorize
repairs as required.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â "Manufactured home" means a factory-built structure, built under
authority of 42 U.S.C. Sec. 5403, and which is required by Federal law to
display a seal from the United States Department of Housing and Urban
Development, and which was constructed on or after June 15, 1976. If a
manufactured home is placed in a mobile home park, the home must be titled and
is subject to the mobile home square foot tax. If a manufactured home is placed
outside of a mobile home park, the home is to be assessed and taxed as real
estate. A manufactured home shall not be constructed with a permanent hitch or
other device allowing it to be moved other than for the purpose of moving to a
permanent site, and which does not have permanently attached to its body or
frame any wheels or axles. A mobile home constructed to the Federal
Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards is not a manufactured home
unless it has been converted to real property and is taxed as a site-built
dwelling as is provided in Code of Iowa Section 435.26. For the purpose of any
of these regulations, manufactured homes are considered the same as a single-
family detached dwelling. Â Â 
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â "Mobile home" means a vehicle without motive power used or so
constructed as to permit its being used, as a conveyance upon the public
streets and highways and so designed, constructed, or reconstructed as will
permit the vehicle to be used as a place for human habitation by one or more
persons; but also includes any vehicle with motive power not registered as a
motor vehicle in Iowa. A mobile home is not built to a mandatory building code,
contains no Federal or State seals, and was built before June 15, 1976. If a
mobile home is placed outside of a mobile home park, the home is to be assessed
and taxed as real estate.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â "Mobile home park" means any site, lot, field, or tract of land under
common ownership upon which two or more occupied mobile homes, manufactured
homes, modular homes, or a combination of the homes are harbored, either free
of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any building, structure, tent,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the equipment of such
mobile home park. The term mobile home park shall not be construed to include
mobile homes, buildings, tents, or other structures temporarily maintained by
an individual, educational institution, or company on said person's own
premises and used exclusively to house said person's own labor or students.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â "Owner" means the person, trust, or firm which is the deed holder as
recorded at the Linn County Assessor's Office. For mobile homes, the owner is
the title holder as recorded by the Linn County Treasurer's Office.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â "Rental" means any dwelling that requires a payment, in money or
services, to be made to the owner or designated agent for the possession and
use thereof.

162.06 Establishment of Floodplain
District
Â 
162.01Â Â Â STATUTORY AUTHORITY.
Â Â Â The Legislature of the State of Iowa has, in Chapter 414, Code of Iowa, as
amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure
safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
162.02Â Â Â FINDINGS OF FACT.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation,
which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by:
(i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain, causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards, which is consistent with the standards established by the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources.
162.03Â Â Â STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
Â Â Â It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and preserve the rights,
privileges and property of the City and its residents and to preserve and
improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and convenience of its
residents by minimizing those flood losses described in Section 162.02(1) of
this chapter, with provisions designed to:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Reserve sufficient flood plain area for the conveyance of flood flows
so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial- improvement.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Protect individuals from buying lands that may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.

structure has been substantially damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred. The term does not, however, include any project for
improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications that have been identified by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions. The term also does not include any alteration of

162.05Â Â Â GENERAL PROVISIONS.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter apply to
all lands within the jurisdiction of the City which are located within the
boundaries of the Floodplain District as established in Section
162.06.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Rules for Interpretation of Floodplain District. The boundaries of the
Floodplain District areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the
official Flood Insurance Rate Map. When an interpretation is needed as to the
exact location of a boundary, the Administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation. The City Council shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
made by the Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no
structure shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered
without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations that apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provision of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with
this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated Floodplain District areas will be
free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on
the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
162.06Â Â Â ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT.
Â Â Â The areas within the jurisdiction of the City having special flood hazards
are hereby designated as a Floodplain District and shall be subject to the
standards of the Floodplain District (as well as those for the underlying
zoning district). The Floodplain District boundaries shall be as shown on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Linn County and Incorporated Areas, City of
Lisbon, Panel 199113C470D, dated April 5, 2010.
162.07Â Â Â STANDARDS FOR FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT.
Â Â Â All uses must be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and meet
the following applicable performance standards. Where 100-year flood data has
not been provided on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The applicant will
be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with
sufficient technical information to make such determination.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â All Development. All development within the Floodplain District shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Obtain all other necessary permits from federal, state and local
governmental agencies including approval when required from the Iowa Department
of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Residential Buildings. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the 100-year flood level. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
100-year flood level and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers) may be allowed subject to favorable consideration by the Board of
Adjustment, where existing topography, street grades, or other factors preclude
elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods used must be adequate to support
the structure as well as withstand the various forces and hazards associated
with flooding. All new residential structures shall be provided with a means of
access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the 100-year flood.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level. When
floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer or architect licensed in the
State of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are in
accordance with accepted standards of practice for withstanding the flood
depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and other factors
associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the base flood

elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Storage of Materials and Equipment. Storage of equipment and materials
that are flammable, explosive, or injurious to human, animal, or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the 100- year flood
level. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or: (i)
not subject to major flood damage and anchored to prevent movement due to
floodwaters; or (ii) readily removable from the area within the time available
after flood warning.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as
levees, flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from a 100-
year flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide
for adequate interior drainage. In addition, structural flood control works
shall be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Watercourse Alternations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must
be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations must be
approved by the Department of Natural Resources.

Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Variances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The City Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in specific
cases such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary
hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance
coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of
the Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Factors Upon Which the Decision to Grant Variances Shall Be Based.
In passing upon applications for Variances, the Board shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights
or velocities caused by encroachments.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability
of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the City.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â The availability of alternative locations not subject to
flooding for the proposed use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development
and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for the area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.

restrictions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees. and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the
flood protection elevation or the particular area, flood velocities, durations,
rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated
with the regulatory flood. The Board of Adjustment shall require that the
applicant submit a plan or document certified by a licensed profession engineer
in the State of Iowa that the floodproofing measures are consistent with the
regulatory flood protection elevation and associated flood factors for the
particular area.
162.09Â Â Â NONCONFORMING USES.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful
before the passage or amendment of this chapter, but which is not in conformity
with the provisions of this chapter, may be continued subject to the following

Â Â Â The intent of the Planned Unit Development District (R-6) is intended and
designed to provide a means for the development of large tracts of ground on a
unit basis, allowing greater flexibility and diversification of land uses and
building locations than the conventional single lot method provided in other
sections of this chapter in A-1, R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, and R-5 Districts. It is
the intent of this section that the basic principles of good land use planning,
including an orderly and graded relationship between various types of uses, be
maintained and that the sound zoning standards as set forth in this chapter and
statutes concerning population density, adequate light and air, recreation and
open space, and building coverage be preserved.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Procedure. The owner or owners of any tract or tracts of adjoining land
comprising an area not less than one and one-half acres, may submit to the City
Council a petition requesting a change to the R-6 zoning district
classification. The petition shall be accompanied by a plan for the use and
development of the entire tract of land. The development plan shall be referred
to the Planning and Zoning Commission for study and report. The Commission
shall review the conformity of the proposed development with the standards of
the Comprehensive Plan, and with recognized principles of architectural design,
land use planning and landscape architecture. The Commission may approve the
plan as submitted or, before approval, may require that the applicant modify,
alter, adjust, or amend the plan as the Commission deems necessary to the end
that it preserves the intent and purpose of this chapter, to promote the public
health, safety, morals and the general welfare, or disapprove of the plan if it
does not substantially conform with the requirements of this chapter or the
Comprehensive Plan. The development plan as approved by the Commission shall
then be reported to the City Council, whereupon the City Council may approve or

ownership, proposed bylaws of a homeownerâ€™s association fully defining the
functions, responsibilities and operating procedures of the association shall
be included.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Performance bond, which shall insure to the City that the dedicated
public streets, utilities, and other common development facilities shall be
completed by the developer within the time specified in the final development
plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Covenant to run with the land, in favor of the City and all persons

not been dedicated to the City.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Any additional agreements required by the Council at the time of
preliminary plat approval.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â A final plat shall be submitted with each stage of the final
development plan. The plat shall show buildings lines, lots and/or blocks,
common land, streets, easements, and other applicable items required by the

Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Review by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The final development
plan and required documents shall be reviewed by the Commission for compliance
with the R-6 District standards and substantial compliance with the preliminary
plan. The Commissionâ€™s recommendations and report on the final development plan
shall be referred to the Council for final approval. The final development plan
and final plat shall be approved by the Council before any building permit is
issued.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Permitted Principal Uses and Structures. Permitted principal and
accessory land uses, lot area, yard and height requirements shall be as set out
below, which shall prevail over conflicting requirements of this section of the
Zoning Ordinance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Buildings shall be used only for residential purposes; occupant
garages, occupant storage and similar accessory uses; noncommercial
recreational facilities; and community activities including churches and
schools.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The minimum lot and yard requirements of the zoning district in
which the development is located shall not apply, except that minimum yards
specified in the district shall be provided around the boundaries of the
development. Individual buildings shall not be placed any closer than 10 feet
to each other, at their closest point of contact. The Council may require open
space or screenings be located along all or a portion of the development
boundaries. The height requirements of the zoning district in which the
development is located shall apply within 125 feet of the development boundary.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â All public streets, water mains, sanitary sewer and storm sewer
facilities shall comply with appropriate ordinances and specifications of the
City.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â â€œCommon land,â€ as used in this section, refers to land retained in
private ownership for the use of the residents of the development, or to land
dedicated to the general public.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Any land gained within the development because of the reduction in
lot sizes, below minimum zoning ordinance requirements, shall be placed in
common land to be dedicated to the City or retained in private ownership to be
managed by a homeownerâ€™s association.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The requirements of Section
165.25(14) relating to off-street parking and loading, shall apply to all R-
6 Districts.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â The final development plan shall comply with the density
requirement.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Maximum Number of Dwelling Units. The maximum number of dwelling units
permitted in an R-6 District shall be determined by dividing the net
development area by the minimum lot area per dwelling unit required by the
zoning district or districts in which the area is located, then multiplied by
115 percent. (In the R-3 District, the one-family requirement shall apply.) Net
development area shall be determined by subtracting the area set aside actually
proposed for streets from the gross development area. The area of land set
aside for common land, open space, or recreation shall be included in
determining the number of dwelling units permitted. The maximum number of
multiple dwelling units permitted in the R-6 development shall be determined by
the zoning district in which the development is located as shown on the
following table:
Â 
Zoning District Percentage of Total Dwelling Units Permitted as Multiples
A-1             10
R-1             25
R-2             50
R-3             100
R-4             100
R-5             100
Â 
If the development area contains two or more different zoning classifications,
the number of dwelling units permitted shall be determined in the direct
proportion to the area of each zoning classification contained in the entire
tract.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Development Plan. The Council may make the approval of the development
plan, contingent upon the completion of construction and improvements within a
reasonable period of time; provided, however, in the determination of such
period, the Council shall consider the scope and magnitude of the development
project and any schedule of construction and improvements submitted by the
developer. Failure to complete all construction and improvements within said
Â Â Â period of time shall be deemed sufficient cause for the Council to rezone
the unimproved property to the classification effective at the time of the
original submission of the development plan, unless an extension is recommended
by the Commission and approved by the Council for due cause shown. Any proposed
change in the development plan after approval by the Council shall be
resubmitted and considered in the same manner as the original proposal. The
term â€œunimproved propertyâ€ means all property situated within a stage or stages
of the final development plan upon which the installation of improvements has
not been commenced.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Improvements. In no event shall the installation of any improvements be
commenced in the second or subsequent stages of the final development plan
until such time as 90 percent of infrastructure improvements including streets
and utilities have been completed in any prior stage of such plan.

165.26Â Â Â APPLICATION OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Regulations to Be Uniformly Applied. The regulations set by this
chapter shall apply uniformly within each district to each class or kind of
structure or land, except as hereinafter provided.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â All Uses and Structures to Conform. No building, structure, or land
shall hereafter be used or occupied, and no building or structure or part
thereof shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or
structurally altered unless in conformity with all of the regulations herein
specified for the district in which it is located.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Height, Density, or Yards Shall Not Be Violated. No building or other
structure shall hereafter be erected or altered to exceed the height, to
accommodate or house a greater number of families, or to have narrower or
smaller rear yards, front yards, side yards, or other open space than herein
required or in any other manner contrary to the provisions of this code.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Separate Yards, Open Space, and Off-Street Parking Required. No part of
a yard, other open space, off-street parking, or loading space required about
or in connection with any building, for the purposes of complying with this
code, shall be included as a part of a yard, open space, or off-street parking,
or loading space similarly required for any other building.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Minimum Yards and Lot Areas Shall Not Be Reduced. No yard or lot
existing at the time of passage of this code shall be reduced in dimension or
area below the minimum requirements set forth herein. Yards or lots created
after the effective date of the Zoning Code shall meet at least the minimum
requirements established by this chapter.
165.27Â Â Â NONCONFORMING USES.
Â Â Â If within the districts established by this chapter or amendments that may
later be adopted there exist lots, structures, and uses of land and structures
that were lawful before this code was passed or amended, but which would be
prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this code or future
amendments, it is the intent of this code to permit these nonconformities to
continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. Such uses
are declared by this code to be incompatible with permitted uses in the
districts involved.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Further Intent. It is further the intent of the code that
nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, or extended, or be used
as grounds for adding other structures, signs or uses prohibited elsewhere in
the same district.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Undue Hardship. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall
be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of
any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this code and upon which actual
building construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction is
hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent
position and fastened in a permanent manner, except that the demolition or
removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to
rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual
construction, provided that work shall be diligently carried on until
completion of the building involved.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Nonconforming Lots of Record.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted,
notwithstanding limitation imposed by other provisions of this code, a single-
family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single
lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this code. Such
lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other
lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lots
fail to meet the requirements for area or width or both that are generally
applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and other
requirements not involving area or width or both, of the lot shall conform to
the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of
area, width, and yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the
Board of Adjustment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots
with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of
passage or amendment of this code, and if all or part of the lots do not meet
the requirements for lot width and area as established by this code, the land
involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this
code, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold which does not meet
lot width and area requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any
division of the parcel be made which leaves remaining any lot with width or
area below the requirements stated in this chapter.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Nonconforming Uses of Land. Where, at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of the Zoning Code, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer
permissible under the terms of the Zoning Code as enacted and amended, such use
may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
following provisions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged, increased, or extended
to occupy a greater use of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of the Zoning Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of the Zoning Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than 180 days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to
the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which such land
is located.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Nonconforming Structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of the Zoning Code which could not be
built under the terms of the Zoning Code by reason of restrictions on area, lot
coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or its
location on the lot, such structure may be so continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way that increases
its nonconformity.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more
than 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall
not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
The determination of the replacement cost must be determined by a licensed
property appraiser.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Nonconforming Uses of Structures. If a lawful use of a structure or of
structure and premises in combination exists at the effective date of adoption
or amendment of the Zoning Code which would not be allowed in the district
under the terms of this code, the lawful use may be continued so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter
in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this code, but no such use shall be extended to occupy
any land outside such building.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming
use provided that the Board of Adjustment, either by general rule or by making
findings in the specific case, shall find that proposed use is equally
appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming
use. In permitting such change, the Board of Adjustment may require appropriate
conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located and the
nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â When a nonconforming use of a structure, land, or structure and land
in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for 12 consecutive months, the
structure thereafter shall not be used except in conformance with regulations
of the district in which it is located.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Where nonconforming use status applied to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Repairs or Maintenance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming
use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary
repairs, or on repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or
plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten percent of the current replacement
value of the building provided that the cubic content of the building as it
existed at the time of passage or amendment of the Zoning Code shall not be
increased.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Nothing in this code shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening of
or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of
such official.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Uses Under Exception Provisions Not Nonconforming. Any use for which a
special exception is permitted as provided in this chapter shall not be deemed
a nonconforming use, but shall without further action be deemed a conforming
use in such district.
165.28Â Â Â ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
Â Â Â An Administrative Officer designated by the City Council shall administer
and enforce this chapter. Such officer may be provided with the assistance of
such other persons as the City Council may direct.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Violations. If the Administrative Officer shall find that any of the
provisions of this chapter are being violated, the Administrative Officer shall

Said permit shall state that the proposed structure complies with all
provisions of the Zoning Code. A permit shall be required for all external
alterations on existing buildings and structures that enlarge the perimeter or
area of the building or structure or alter the number or size of windows or

regular employee of the City. The Secretary shall conduct all official
correspondence subject to this chapter at the direction of the Board, shall
send out all notices required by this chapter, keep the minutes of the Boardâ€™s
proceedings, and keep a file on each case that comes before the Board. For all
appeals and applications, the Secretary shall issue the proper forms, see that
information maps and plats are compiled and ready for the Boardâ€™s review,
notify any property owner and other interested parties by mail of the time and
place of the hearing, and any other duties as determined by the Board.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â No member of the Council, Planning and Zoning Commission, or any
City employee shall serve as a member on the Board of Adjustment.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Proceedings of the Board of Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment shall

provisions of this chapter. Meetings shall be held at the call of the
Chairperson and at such other times as the Board may determine. The Chairperson

Board of Adjustment shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of
each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote indicating such
fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions,
all of which shall be a public record and be immediately filed in the office of
the Administrative Officer and shall be a public record.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Finality of Decisions and Necessary Vote. All decisions and findings of
the Board on any appeal or upon any application for a variance or conditional
use, after a public hearing, shall in all instances, be the final
administrative decision and shall be subject to judicial review as by law may
be provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A quorum for a meeting of the Board of Adjustment shall consist of
at least three of the five members being present. A quorum shall be necessary
for a meeting to be considered an official meeting, which allows the Board to
take action on any issue before it.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The concurring vote of three members of the Board shall be necessary
to reverse an order, requirement, decision, or determination of the Zoning
Administrator, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which
it is required to pass under this chapter, or to effect any variation in the
application of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Any issue that receives less than three concurring votes of the
members present at an official meeting shall be considered defeated.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Appeals from the Board of Adjustment. Any person or persons, or any
board, taxpayer, department, board or bureau of the City aggrieved by any
decision of the Board of Adjustment may seek review by a court of record within
30 days of such decision, in the manner provided by the laws of the State and
particularly by Chapter 414, Code of Iowa.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Fee. Such amount as may be established from time to time by resolution
of the Council, shall be paid to the Administrative Officer at the time an
appeal, variance, conditional use, or revised site plan is filed, which the
Zoning Administrator shall forthwith pay over such fees to the credit of the
General Fund of the City.
165.31Â Â Â POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
Â Â Â The Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers and duties:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Administrative Review. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by
the Administrative Officer in the enforcement of the Zoning Code.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Appeals to the Board of Adjustment. Appeals to the Board of Adjustment
may be made concerning interpretation or administration of this chapter may be
taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau of
the City affected by any decision of the Administrative Officer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Such appeals shall be taken within a reasonable time, not to exceed
60 days by filing with the Administrative Officer and with the Secretary of the
Board of Adjustment a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The
Administrative Officer shall forthwith transmit to the Board all paper
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time not exceeding 30
days from the date of appeal for the hearing, give public notice thereof as
well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a
reasonable time, not exceeding 15 days from the date of the hearing. At the
hearing any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Stay of Proceeding. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of
the action appealed from, unless the Administrative Officer from whom the
appeal is taken certifies to the Board of Adjustment, after the notice of
appeal is filed with such officer, that, by reason of facts stated in the
certificate, a stay would, in the opinion of such officer, cause imminent peril
to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than
by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Board of Adjustment or by a
court of record on application, on notice to the Administrative Officer from
whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Special Exceptions; Conditions Governing Applications; Procedures. The
Board of Adjustment shall be granted the power to: (i) hear and decide only
such special exceptions as the Board of Adjustment is specifically authorized
to pass on by the terms of this chapter; (ii) decide such questions as are
involved in determining whether special exceptions should be granted; and (iii)
grant special exceptions with such conditions and safeguards as are appropriate
under this chapter, or deny special exceptions when not in harmony with the
purpose and intent of this chapter. A special exception shall not be granted by
the Board of Adjustment unless and until:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A written application for a special exception is submitted
indicating the section of this chapter under which the special exception is
sought and stating the grounds on which it is requested.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Notice shall be given at least 7 but not more than 20 days in
advance of the public hearing by publication in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City and shall be mailed to all property owners within a
distance of 150 feet of the affected property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person, or
by agent or attorney.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The Board of Adjustment shall make a finding that it is empowered
under the section of this chapter described in the application to grant the
special exception, and that the granting of the special exception will not
adversely affect the public interest.
Â Â Â In granting any special exception, the Board of Adjustment may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter.
Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the special exception is granted, shall be deemed a violation of
this chapter and punishable under Section
165.33 of this chapter. The Board of Adjustment shall prescribe a time limit
within which the action for which the special exception is required shall be
begun or completed, or both. Failure to begin or complete, or both, such action
within the time limit set shall void the special exception.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Variances; Conditions Governing Applications; Procedures. To authorize
upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this chapter as
will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to the special
conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would
result in unnecessary hardship. A variance from the terms of this chapter shall
not be granted by the Board of Adjustment unless and until:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A written application for a variance is submitted demonstrating
that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to
the land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the
same district under the terms of this chapter;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant
any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands,
structures, or buildings in the same district. No nonconforming use of
neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same district, and no
permitted use of lands, structures, or buildings in other districts shall be
considered grounds for the issuance of a variance; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Notice of public hearing shall be given as in Section
165.31(4)(B), and in accordance with the State of Iowa Open Meetings Law
(Chapter 21 of the Code of Iowa).
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person, or
by agent or by attorney.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The Board of Adjustment shall further make a finding that the
reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance, and
that the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the
reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The Board of Adjustment shall make findings that the requirements of
Section
165.31(5)(A) have been met by the applicant for a variance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The Board of Adjustment shall further make a finding that the
granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of this code, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise
detrimental to the public welfare.
Â Â Â In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter. Violations of such
conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the
variance is granted shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and punishable
under Section
165.33 of this chapter. Under no circumstances shall the Board of Adjustment
grant a variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this chapter
in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by
the terms of this chapter in said district.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Effective Date of Decision of the Board of Adjustment. Decisions of the
Board of Adjustment shall become effective no less than 21 days following such
decision.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Review by Council. The Council may review variances granted by the
Board of Adjustment before their effective date. The Council may remand a
decision to grant a variance to the Board of Adjustment for further study. The
effective date of the variance shall be delayed for 30 days from the date of
the remand.
165.32Â Â Â INTERPRETATION OF PROVISIONS.
Â Â Â In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter
shall be held to be minimum requirements, adopted for the promotion of the
public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. Wherever the requirements of
this chapter are at variance with the requirements of any other lawfully
adopted rules, regulations, ordinances, deed restrictions, or covenants, the
most restrictive or that imposing higher standards, shall govern.
165.33Â Â Â VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
Â Â Â Any person, firm, or corporation who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or
fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter, whether directly,
indirectly, or through employees or agents, shall be in violation of this
chapter and may be required to pay all costs and expenses involved in the
prosecution of the violation. Alternatively, any person, firm, or corporation
who shall violate or fail to comply with the provisions of this chapter shall
be guilty of a municipal infraction pursuant to Section 364.22 Code of Iowa.
Each day such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The owners or tenant of any building, structure, land or part thereof,
and any architect, builder, contractor, agent, or other person who commits,
participates in, assists in, or maintains a violation or fails to comply with
any provision of this chapter may each be charged with a misdemeanor or
municipal infraction and upon conviction suffer the penalties provided herein
in the event a misdemeanor is charged and the penalties contained in Section
364.22, Code of Iowa, if a municipal infraction is charged. Each day such
violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If any building or structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed,
altered, repaired, converted, or maintained, or if any building, structure or
land is used in violation of this chapter, the City may, in addition to other
remedies, institute an injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate lawful action
necessary to prevent, correct, or abate such violation.
165.34Â Â Â CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.
Â Â Â The regulations imposed and the districts created by this chapter may be
amended from time to time by the Council, but no such amendments shall be made
without public hearing before the Council and after a report upon the amendment
from the Planning and Zoning Commission. If the Planning and Zoning Commission
makes no report within 30 days from the date of passage of the Councilâ€™s motion
referring the matter to the Planning and Zoning Commission, the City Council
may proceed with a public hearing without such report or recommendation. At
least 7 but no more than 20 daysâ€™ notice of the time and place of such hearing
shall be published in a newspaper having general circulation in the City. In
the event the Planning and Zoning Commission recommends disapproval of the
change or, in the event of a protest against such change filed with the Council
and signed by the owners of 20 percent or more either of the area of the lots
included in the proposed change or of those immediately adjacent in the rear
thereof extending the depth of one lot or not to exceed 300 feet therefrom, or
of those directly opposite thereto, extending the depth on one lot or not to
exceed 300 feet from the street frontage of such opposite lots, such amendment
shall not be passed except by the favorable vote of at least three-fourths of
all the members of the Council.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Form of Application. An application for rezoning shall contain the
following items:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The legal description and local address of the property.

Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â A plat or site plan showing the locations, dimensions, and use of
the applicantâ€™s property and all property within 300 feet thereof, including

the following information:

170.01Â Â Â SHORT TITLE.
Â Â Â This chapter shall be known as the Subdivision Ordinance of the City of
Lisbon, Iowa.
170.02Â Â Â PURPOSE.
Â Â Â These regulations are adopted for the following purposes:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â To protect and provide for the public health, safety, and general
welfare of the City.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â To guide the future growth and development of the City in accordance
with the comprehensive plan.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â To provide for adequate light, air, and privacy, to secure safety from
fire, flood, and other danger, and to prevent overcrowding of the land and
undue congestion of population.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â To protect the character and the social and economic stability of all
parts of the City and to encourage the orderly and beneficial development of
the community through appropriate growth management techniques assuring the
timing and sequencing of development in existing neighborhoods and
nonresidential areas with adequate public facilities, to assure proper urban
form and open space separation of urban areas, to protect environmentally
critical areas and areas premature for urban development.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â To protect and conserve the value of land throughout the City and the
value of buildings and improvements upon the land, and to minimize the
conflicts among the uses of land and buildings.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â To guide public and private policy and action in order to provide
adequate and efficient transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks,
playgrounds, recreation, and other public requirements and facilities.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â To provide the most beneficial relationship between the uses of land
and buildings and the circulation of traffic throughout the City, having
particular regard to the avoidance of congestion in the streets and highways
and the pedestrian traffic movements appropriate to the various uses of land
and buildings, and to provide for the proper location and width of streets and
building lines.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â To establish reasonable standards of design and procedures for

map, and land use plan, and the capital budget and program of the City.
170.04Â Â Â APPLICATION.
Â Â Â Every owner of any tract or parcel of land who has subdivided or shall
hereafter subdivide or plat said tract or parcel into two or more parts, for
the purpose of laying out an addition, subdivision, building lot, or lots,

Code of Iowa, within two miles from the corporate limits of the City, shall
cause plats of such area to be made in the form, and containing the

and Zoning Commission when the proposed subdivision contains no more than three
lots and no road or other public improvements are involved.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The requirement for a preliminary plat and final plat may be waived by
the Planning and Zoning Commission for the sale or exchange of small parcels of
land to or between owners of adjacent parcels and where all of the following
exist or occur:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Such sale or exchange of a parcel of land does not create any
additional lots or parcels.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Such sale or exchange constitutes less than 33 percent of the
enlarged lot before such transfer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The owners of the parcels of land submit a site plan that
demonstrates that all site and structures requirements for the zoning district
in which the parcels of land are located can be maintained after the sale or
exchange of property. Further, if the site plan is not prepared by a registered
land surveyor or engineer, the parcels must be staked to show the existing and
proposed property lines so that City inspectors may verify dimensions of said
site plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â No other zoning ordinance violations would occur or are then
occurring on either parcel of land.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Such subdivision of land is not in conflict with any other State of
Iowa or lawful City regulations regarding subdivision of land.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The new parcels of land are combined on one deed and if possible
only one parcel number is secured for each of the new parcels created.

Where the provisions of the easement, covenant, or private agreement or
restriction impose duties and obligations more restrictive or standards that
are higher than the requirements of these regulations, or the determinations of
the Planning and Zoning Commission or the Council in approving a subdivision or

review the plat and attachments thereto. If the plat is found to conform to the
ordinances and standards of the City and the Comprehensive Plan and other duly
adopted plans, all as of the date of approval of the preliminary plat, and is
found to substantially conform to the preliminary plat, the Council shall
approve the plat, and shall cause its approval to be entered on the plat as
required by law. Action on the final plat by the Council shall be taken within
60 days of the date of filing the plat with the City Clerk. If the action is to
disapprove the plat, the reasons therefor shall be set forth in the official
records of the Council and such decision shall be provided to the subdivider.

disapproval shall be expressed in writing and shall point out wherein said
proposed plat is objectionable.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â In the event that said plat is found to be acceptable and in accordance
with these regulations, the Council shall accept same.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The passage of a resolution by the Council accepting the plat shall
constitute final approval of the platting of the area shown on the final plat,
but the subdivider or owner shall cause such plat to be recorded within 180
days from the date of the passage of the resolution, in the office of the
County Recorder of the County where the land to be subdivided is located, and
shall file satisfactory evidence of such recording in the office of the Clerk
before the City shall recognize the plat as being in full force and effect.

dated by the surveyor and bearing the surveyorâ€™s Iowa registration number or
seal, and a sealed certification of the accuracy of the plat by the registered
land surveyor who drew the plat.
Â Â Â 19.Â Â Â If a portion of the subdivision is to have access on a State or County
jurisdiction road, a written and signed statement acknowledging and permitting
the access by the duly authorized officials of the appropriate jurisdiction is
required.
Â Â Â 20.Â Â Â Specification and engineering construction drawings shall be provided

of Iowa may be recorded in lieu of the consent of the mortgage or lienholder.
When a mortgage or lienholder consents to the subdivision, a release of
mortgage or lien shall be recorded for any areas conveyed to the City or
dedicated to the public.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â An opinion by an attorney-at-law who has examined the abstract of title
of the land being platted. The opinion shall state the names of the proprietors
and holders of mortgages, liens or other encumbrances on the land being platted

Prior to such certification, â€œas-builtâ€ plans for all improvements shall have
been provided to the City Engineer. In lieu thereof, the City Clerk may certify
that a performance bond guaranteeing completion has been approved by the City
Attorney and filed with the Clerk, or that the Council has agreed that the City
will provide the necessary improvements and installations and assess the costs
against the subdivider of future property owners in the subdivision.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â If private streets or other private improvements have been approved, an
agreement in the form of a covenant running with the land, in a form approved
by the City Attorney, providing for the construction or reconstruction of any
improvements to meet City Standards, and the assessment of all costs to the
property owners in the event of annexation and dedication and acceptance shall
be required.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â The encumbrance bond, if any.
170.25Â Â Â RESUBDIVISION OF LAND.
Â Â Â The following requirements shall govern the resubdividing of land.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â For any change in a map of an approved or recorded subdivision plat, if
such change affects any street layout shown on such map, or area reserved for
public use indicated on the map, or any lot line, or if it affects any map or
plan legally established prior to the adoption of any regulations controlling
subdivisions, such parcel shall be approved by the same procedure, rules, and
regulations for a subdivision.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows
one or more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are
indications that such lots will eventually be resubdivided into smaller
building sites, the Commission and Council may require that such parcel of land
allow for future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent
streets. Easements providing for the future opening and extension of such
streets may be made a requirement of the plat.
170.26Â Â Â AUTHORIZATION TO INSTALL IMPROVEMENTS.
Â Â Â The approval of the preliminary plat shall constitute authorization by the
Council for the installation of improvements as required by this ordinance, and
as shown on the preliminary plat; provided, no such improvement shall be
constructed or installed until and unless the plans, profiles, cross sections,
and specifications for the construction of such improvement have been submitted
to, and approved in writing by the City Engineer.
170.27Â Â Â COMPLETION AND ACCEPTANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Â Â Â Before the Council will approve the final plat, all of the foregoing
improvements shall be constructed and accepted by formal resolution of
acceptance, the City Engineer shall report that said improvements meet all City
specifications and ordinances or other City requirements, and the agreements
between the subdivider and the City, and are free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances on the property and public improvements thus dedicated.
170.28Â Â Â PERFORMANCE BOND.
Â Â Â The Council in its discretion may waive the requirement that the applicant
complete and dedicate all public improvements prior to approving the final
plat, and that, as an alternative, the applicant post a bond at the time of
application for final plat approval in the amount estimated by the Council as
sufficient to secure to the City the satisfactory construction, installation,
and dedication of the uncompleted portion of required improvements. In
addition:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Such performance bond shall comply with all statutory requirements and
shall be satisfactory to the City Attorney as to form, sufficiency, and manner
of execution as set forth in these regulations.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The period within which required improvements must be completed shall
be specified by the Council in the resolution approving the final plat, shall
be incorporated in the bond, and shall not exceed one year from date of final
approval.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The performance bond shall be approved by the Council as to the amount
and surety and conditions satisfactory to the Council. The Commission may, upon
proof of difficulty, recommend to the Council extension of the completion date
set forth in such bond for a maximum period of one additional year. The Council
may at any time during the period of such bond accept a substitution of
principal or sureties on the bond.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The applicant shall build and pay for all costs of temporary
improvements required by the Council and shall maintain same for the period
specified by the Council. Prior to construction of any temporary facility or
improvement, the developer shall file with the City a separate suitable bond
for temporary facilities, which bond shall insure that the temporary facilities
will be properly constructed, maintained and removed.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â For subdivisions for which no performance bond has been posted, if the
improvements are not completed within the period specified by the Council in
the resolution approving the plat, the approval shall be deemed to have
expired. In those cases where a performance bond has been posted and required
improvements have not been installed within the terms of such performance bond,
the City may declare the bond to be in default and require that all the
improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the building development
at the time the bond is declared to be in default.
170.29Â Â Â RELEASE OR REDUCTION OF PERFORMANCE BOND.
Â Â Â The performance bond may not be released or reduced except as follows:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The Council will not accept dedication of required improvements, or
release or reduce a performance bond, until the City Engineer has submitted a
certificate stating that all required improvements have been satisfactorily
completed and until the applicantâ€™s engineer has certified to the City through
submission of detailed â€œas-builtâ€ plans of the subdivision indicating location,
dimensions, materials, and other information required by the city, that all
public improvements are in accordance with construction plans for the
subdivision.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â A performance bond may be reduced upon actual dedication of public
improvements and then only to the ratio that the public improvement dedicated
bears to the total public improvements for the plat.
170.30Â Â Â INSPECTION.
Â Â Â All improvements shall be inspected to ensure compliance with the
requirements of this chapter. The cost of such inspection shall be borne by the
developer and shall be the actual cost of the inspection to the City. The
subdivider shall notify the City not less than 24 hours in advance of readiness
for required inspections. To ensure that costs are economical for developers
and that construction is being done to Code requirements and standards, the
following testing procedures will be required on the installation of all
improvements in new subdivisions:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Compaction tests are required on sanitary sewer main trench backfill:
ASTM D1557; three tests per 200 LF of trench where compacted or ordinary
backfill is specified; at each 200 LF, two of the tests shall be at
intermediate depths as directed by the City Engineer and the other test at the
surface.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Compaction tests are required on water main and storm sewer trench
backfill: ASTM D1557; two tests per 200 LF of trench where compacted or
ordinary backfill is specified; at each 200 LF, one of the tests shall be at an
intermediate depth as directed by the City Engineer and the other test at the
surface.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Backfill material shall be tested for each water and sanitary sewer
service line that crosses the proposed roadway at an intermediate depth and at
the surface. Pavement subgrade shall also be tested approximately every 400 LF
of road length with one test on each side. The following is a tabulation of the
required number of tests for each type of utility line:
Â 
ITEM                             TEST PER ITEM
Sanitary Sewer Main              3 tests per 200 LF
Water Main and Storm Sewer       2 tests per 200 LF
Sanitary Sewer Service Crossings 2 tests per crossing
Water Service Crossings          2 tests per crossing
Pavement Subgrade                2 tests per 400 LF
Â 
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â A tandem axle unit will perform a wheel load test. The vehicle will
apply 12,000 to 16,000 pounds of weight for each rear axle. This load test
shall be required immediately preceding the performance of paving work or the
construction of base and is to determine uniformity of subgrade resistance.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â If the compaction on pavement subgrade does not meet requirements, the
developer may propose corrective treatments, including granular subsurfacing,
lime or fly ash treatment, or geogrid. This is to be approved and inspected by
the City Engineer. Costs incurred for the alternate method are at the
developerâ€™s expense.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The developer shall select a qualified independent testing laboratory
to perform the compaction tests, as approved by the City Engineer. If the
developer does not select the independent testing laboratory, the City shall
choose for them. In either case, the compaction test laboratory is to invoice
the developer directly for this service. It is the developerâ€™s responsibility
to pay for all inspections.
170.31Â Â Â RECORDING OF PLAT.
Â Â Â No subdivision plat, resubdivision plat or street dedication within the City
or within two miles of the corporate limits of the City, as provided in Section
354.9, Code of Iowa, shall be filed for record with the County Recorder, or
recorded by the County Recorder, until a final plat of such subdivision,
resubdivision, or street dedication has been reviewed and approved in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Upon the approval of the final
plat by the Council, it shall be the duty of the subdivider to immediately file
such plat with the County Auditor and County Recorder, as required by law. Such
approval shall be revocable after 90 days, unless such plat has been duly
recorded and evidence thereof filed with the City Clerk within such 90 days.
170.32Â Â Â MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Â Â Â Improvements shall be maintained and a maintenance bond provided as follows:
The owner and subdivider shall be required to maintain all improvements on the
individual subdivided lots and provide for snow removal on streets and
sidewalks, if required, until acceptance of said improvements by the Council.
If there are any occupied residences on a street not dedicated to the City, the
City may, on 12 hoursâ€™ notice, plow the street or effect emergency repairs and
charge same to the owner and subdivider.
170.33Â Â Â MAINTENANCE BOND REQUIRED.
Â Â Â The owner and subdivider of the land being platted shall be required to
provide to the City proper maintenance bonds satisfactory to the City so as to
insure that for a period of two years from the date of acceptance of any
improvement the owner and subdivider shall be responsible to maintain such
improvement in good repair.
170.34Â Â Â DEFERRAL OR WAIVER OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
Â Â Â Required improvements may be deferred or waived as follows:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The Council may defer or waive at the time of final approval, subject
to appropriate conditions, the provision of any or all such improvements as in
its judgment are not requisite in the interests of the public health, safety,
and general welfare, or which are inappropriate because of inadequacy or lack
of connecting facilities.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Whenever it is deemed necessary by the Council to defer the
construction of any improvement required herein because of incompatible grades,
future planning, inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities, or for other
reasons, the applicant shall pay the applicantâ€™s share of the costs of the
future improvements to the City prior to the approval of the final plat, or the
applicant may post a bond insuring completion of said improvements upon demand
of the City.
170.35Â Â Â IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.
Â Â Â The subdivider shall, at his or her expense, install and construct all
improvements required by this chapter. All required improvements shall be
designed, installed, and constructed in accordance with the design and
construction standards established for such improvements by the City, and as
shown on the approved preliminary plat.
170.36Â Â Â STANDARDS PRESCRIBED.
Â Â Â The standards set forth in this chapter shall be considered the minimum
standards necessary to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
170.37Â Â Â CONFORMANCE TO APPLICABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS.
Â Â Â In addition to the requirements established herein, all subdividers shall
comply with the following laws, rules and regulations:

with the above guides, or policy and purposes of these regulations.
170.38Â Â Â MONUMENTATION.
Â Â Â Monuments shall be in conformance with the following requirements:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Prior to the offering of the plat or any subdivision for record, the
surveyor shall confirm the prior establishment of permanent control monuments
at each controlling corner on the boundaries of the parcel or tract of land
being subdivided. If no permanent control monuments exist, the surveyor shall
place the monuments. Control monuments shall be constructed of reasonably
permanent material solidly embedded in the ground and capable of being detected
by commonly used magnetic or electronic equipment. The surveyor shall affix a
cap of reasonably inert material bearing an embossed or stencil cut marking of
the Iowa registration number of the surveyor to the top of each monument which
the surveyor places.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â At least a minimum number of two (2) survey control monuments are
required to be placed before the recording of a subdivision provided the
surveyor or engineer includes in his or her statement a declaration that
additional monuments shall be placed before a date specified in the statement
or within one year from the date the subdivision is recorded, whichever is
earlier.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Control monuments shall be placed at the following locations:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â At every corner and angle point of every lot, block, or parcel of

subdivision with an existing or created right-of-way line of any street,
railroad, or other way.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â At every point of curve, tangency, reversed curve, or compounded
curve on every right-of-way line established.
When the placement of a monument required by this chapter at the prescribed
location is impractical, a reference monument shall be established near the
prescribed location. If a point requiring monumentation has been previously
monumented, the existence of the monument shall be confirmed by the surveyor.
170.39Â Â Â LAND SUITABILITY.
Â Â Â No land shall be subdivided which is found to be unsuitable for subdividing
by reason of flooding, ponding, poor drainage, adverse soil conditions, adverse
geological formations, unsatisfactory topography, or other conditions likely to
be harmful to the public health, safety, or general welfare, unless such
unsuitable conditions are corrected to the satisfaction of the City. If land is
found to be unsuitable for subdivision for any of the reasons cited in this
section, the Council shall state its reasons in writing and afford the
subdivider an opportunity to present data regarding such unsuitability.
Thereafter, the Council may reaffirm, modify, or withdraw its determination
regarding such unsuitability.
170.40Â Â Â BLOCK AND LOT STANDARDS.
Â Â Â The following standards shall apply to the layout of blocks and lots in all
subdivisions, and to the extent possible, in all resubdivisions:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The size and shape of all lots shall comply with all requirements of
the Zoning Ordinance for the zone in which the lot is located.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â All lots shall abut a public street, or upon an approved private
street, with a minimum frontage of at least 35 feet measured as a straight line
between the two front lot corners.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Reversed frontage lots are prohibited. Double frontage lots shall only
be permitted where abutting a major street and a minor street, and such lots
shall front only on the minor street.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â All lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or
radial to curved street lines, except where, in the judgment of the Council, a
variation to this provision will provide a better street and lot layout.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all
buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the general
storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid
concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent lots.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Building lines conforming with zoning standards shall be known on all
lots within the platted area. Where the subdivided area is not under zoning
control, the Council may require building lines in accordance with the needs of
each subdivision.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of
appropriate depths. Exceptions shall be permitted in blocks adjacent to
arterial streets, railroads, or waterways.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â No residential block shall be longer than 1,300 feet or shorter than
300 feet measured from street line to street line. The width of blocks should
be arranged so as to allow two tiers of lots, with utility easement. Exceptions
shall be permitted in blocks adjacent to arterial streets, railroads, or
waterways.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Pedestrian crosswalks, not less than 10 feet wide, may be required by
the Council through the center of blocks more than 700 feet in length.
Pedestrian crosswalks shall not exceed 12 percent in grade unless steps of an
approved design are to be constructed.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â In blocks over 700 feet in length, the Council may require a public
way or an easement at least 10 feet in width, at or near the center of the
block, for use by pedestrians.
170.41Â Â Â STREETS, GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
Â Â Â The improvements set forth below shall be considered the minimum
improvements necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. Under
some circumstances the City may require, as a condition for approval of the
plat, dedication and improvement of a street having width greater than
necessary to meet the needs of the platted area, but necessary to complete the
City street system as it relates to both the area being platted and other
areas. In such event, the City will pay the subdivider the difference in cost
of improving the wider street and the street width reasonable to meet the
foreseeable needs of the subdivision taken alone. The streets shall, upon final
approval and acceptance by the City, become the property of the City. The
following standards shall apply to all streets to be located within the
subdivision:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The subdivider of land being subdivided shall provide the grading of
the entire street right-of-way, alley, or public place and provide appropriate
paving, including curb and gutter on all streets. All streets or alleys shall
be of such width and shall be so constructed as to meet the standards of the
City.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â No subdivision shall be approved unless the area to be subdivided has
frontage on and access from an existing street.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Street grade shall align to existing streets, and all grades for
streets shall be as approved by the City or as provided for herein.
170.42Â Â Â TOPOGRAPHY AND ARRANGEMENT.
Â Â Â Streets shall be in conformance with the following requirements related to
topography and arrangement:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography. All streets
shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as possible of the building sites at,
or above, the grades of the streets. Grades of streets shall conform as closely
as possible to the original topography. A combination of steep grades and
curves shall be avoided.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Streets shall provide for the continuation of arterial and collector
streets from adjoining platted areas, and the extension of such streets into
adjoining unplatted areas. Where a plat encompasses the location for an
arterial or collector street proposed in the Comprehensive Plan, the plat shall
provide for such street.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â All arterials shall be properly related to special traffic generators
such as industries, business districts, schools, churches, and shopping
centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and proposed
land uses.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Local streets should be designed to discourage through traffic while
safely connecting to collector or arterial streets.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract
to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions,
or unless in the opinion of the Council such extension isÂ not necessary or
desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with
theÂ existing layout or advantageous future development of adjacent tracts.
170.43Â Â Â ACCESS TO STATE OR COUNTY JURISDICTIONAL ROADS.
Â Â Â Whenever any part of a subdivision is designed with access to a road under
State or County jurisdiction, permission for access to such roads shall be
obtained from the appropriate jurisdiction and such access shall be designed
according to the standards of the appropriate jurisdiction.
170.44Â Â Â ACCESS TO ARTERIAL STREETS.
Â Â Â Where a subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed arterial
street, the Council may require that lot access to such streets be limited by
one of the following means:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Lots shall be designed so as to back onto the primary arterial and
front onto a parallel municipal service street; no access shall be provided
from the arterial street, and screening shall be provided in a strip of land
along the rear property line of such lots.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â A series of cul-de-sacs entered from and designed generally at right
angles to such a parallel street, with the read lines of their terminal lots
backing onto the arterial street.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â A frontage or service road, separated from the primary arterial by a
planting or grass strip and having access thereto at suitable points.
170.45Â Â Â STREET NAMES.
Â Â Â Streets that are or will become extensions of existing streets shall be
given the same name as existing streets. New street names shall not be the same
or sound similar to existing street names. All street names shall be at the
approval of the Council. Street name signs are to be placed at all
intersections within or abutting the subdivision, the type and location of
which are to be approved by the Council. The City shall install all street name
signs. The owner and subdivider shall deposit with the City at the time of
final subdivision approval, the estimated cost of installation of each street
sign required by the Council.
170.46Â Â Â STREET LIGHTS.
Â Â Â Installations of street lights shall be required in accordance with design,
construction, and specification standards approved by the Council.
170.47Â Â Â DEAD-END AND PRIVATE STREETS.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Dead-end streets are prohibited, except where a street is planned to
continue past the subdividerâ€™s property, a temporary dead end may be allowed. A
T- or L-shaped turnaround shall be provided on all temporary dead-end streets,
with the notation on the subdivision plat that land outside normal street
right- of-way shall revert to abutters when the street is continued. The length
of dead-end streets may be limited by the Council.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Private streets, not dedicated to the City, shall be avoided. The
Council may approve a private street where unusual conditions make a private
street desirable, provided adequate covenants or other legal documents ensure
that the City will not have or need to assume any maintenance or other
responsibility for such street.
170.48Â Â Â STREET DESIGN STANDARDS.
Â Â Â In order to provide for streets of suitable location, width, and improvement
to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access to police,
firefighting, snow removal, sanitation, and street maintenance equipment, and
to coordinate streets so as to compose a convenient system and avoid undue
hardships to adjoining properties, the following design standards for streets
are required:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse
curves on municipal arterial and collector streets, and 25 feet on municipal
local streets.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point
by more than 10 degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius
adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than 100 feet for municipal
service and collector streets, and of such greater radii as the council shall
determine for special cases.
170.49Â Â Â MINIMUM ROADWAY AND RIGHT-OF-WAY STANDARDS.
Â Â Â Minimum roadway and right-of-way standards shall be as follows (wider
rights-of-way and roadways may be required where deemed appropriate by the City
Engineer and the Council):
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Municipal arterial streets shall have a right-of-way width of not less
than 80 feet and a roadway width of not less than 49Â feet.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Municipal collector streets shall have a right-of-way width of not less
than 66 feet and a roadway width of not less than 31 feet.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Municipal local streets shall have a right-of-way of not less than 60
feet and a roadway width of not less than 28 feet.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Cul-de-sacs shall meet all the requirements for local streets and, in
addition, shall provide a turnaround with the outer edge of paving at a 40-
foot radius and the right-of-way at a 60-foot radius.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Streets that connect with other streets, or loop streets, are
preferable for maintenance, fire protection, and circulation. Every effort
shall be made to minimize the use of cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed
500 feet in length. The provisions set forth herein shall be adhered to.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Street grades, wherever feasible, shall not exceed the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Municipal arterial streets â€“ 8 percent.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Municipal collector streets â€“ 10 percent.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Municipal local streets â€“ 12 percent.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â All changes in street alignment shall be connected with horizontal
curves, and all changes in street grade shall be connected by vertical curves
of minimum length in feet designed in accordance with AASHTO â€œGreen Bookâ€
provisions. Any changes in street grade shall conform to design and
construction standards as adopted by the Council.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â No street grade shall be less than one-half (1/2) of one percent,
unless extreme conditions warrant.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â After sewer, water, and other utilities to be located underground
within the right-of-way have been installed by the owner and subdivider, the
owner and subdivider shall construct curbs and gutters and shall surface or
cause to be surfaced, roadways according to design and construction standards
as adopted by the Council.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â The pavement slab shall be constructed of the following materials:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Nonreinforced Portland cement concrete conforming to the Iowa
Department of Transportation C-4 mix or M-4,Â as applicable; orÂ 
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Full depth asphaltic concrete hot mix conforming to theÂ Iowa
Department of Transportation standards for Type A surface course. Four inches
of granular base material may be substituted for one inch of asphaltic concrete
hot mix. The granular base material shall be a minimum of four inches thick and
a maximum of 12 inches thick. The granular base material must conform to the
Iowa Department of Transportation standards for crushed stone special backfill.

Local                 7                        9
*Â Â Â Thickness requirements for arterials are intended as a guide only.
Specific projects will be designed on the basis of soil conditions and
projected traffic loading.
Â 
Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â The curb and gutter shall be constructed of Portland cement concrete
to a thickness as required for respective street classification.
Â Â Â 13.Â Â Â The curbs and gutter cross section shall consist of 6-inch vertical
curb with a 2-foot, 6-inch concrete gutter which includes the curb. Where the
street paving is integral Portland cement concrete, then there shall be no
separation between the curb and gutter section and the paving. A four-inch roll
over curb is an acceptable alternative on local streets only and is subject to
approval of the Council.
Â Â Â 14.Â Â Â A minimum of one set of concrete test cylinders for each 100 cubic
yards of paving but no less than one set per day, shall be made. A test shall
consist of twoÂ test cylinders. Slump and air content tests shall be made and
the results recorded along with appropriate test cylinder information.
Cylinders shall be laboratory cured, and conform with ASTM specification C31
and C39.
Â Â Â 15.Â Â Â The subgrade shall be scarified to a depth of 12 inches below the
pavement, and compacted to 95%Â of Standard Proctor Density for Portland cement
concrete pavement and to 95% of Standard Proctor Density for Asphaltic cement
concrete pavement.
Â Â Â 16.Â Â Â The subgrade in fill shall be 95%Â of Standard Proctor Density.Â 
Â Â Â 17.Â Â Â Successful density tests shall be conducted per every 150 linear feet
of street subgrade andÂ at locations to be selected by the City Engineer.Â 
170.50Â Â Â EXCESS RIGHT-OF-WAY.
Â Â Â Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards designated in these
regulations shall be required whenever, due to topography, additional width is
necessary to provide adequate earth slopes as specified in the design and
construction standards as adopted by the Council.
170.51Â Â Â RAILROADS AND LIMITED ACCESS HIGHWAYS.
Â Â Â Railroad rights-of way and limited access highways where so located as to
affect the subdivision of adjoining lands shall be treated as follows:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â In residential districts a buffer strip at least 25 feet in widthÂ in
addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be
provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way, or limited access highway. This
strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the plat:
Landscape Buffer. The placement of structures hereon is prohibited.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â In districts zoned for business, commercial, or industrial uses the
nearest extended parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad shall,
wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure suitable
depth for commercial or industrial sites.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Streets parallel to the railroad when intersecting a street which
crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a
distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance
shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for
future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
170.52Â Â Â INTERSECTIONS.
Â Â Â The following standards shall apply to the design of intersections:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Streets shall intersect as nearly at right angles as possible; and no
street shall intersect any other street at less than 75 degrees. An oblique
street should be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately
at right angles for at least 100 feet therefrom. No more than two streets shall
intersect at any one point unless specifically approved by the Council.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet shall be
prohibited, except where topography, or other physical conditions make such
jogs unavoidable. Where streets intersect major streets, their alignment shall
be continuous. Intersection of major streets shall be at least 800 feet apart.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two municipal service
streets shall be at least 25Â feet; and minimum curb radius at an intersection
involving arterial and collector streets shall be at least 30 feet and as
approved by City Engineer.Â Â Abrupt changes in alignment within a block shall
have the corners cut off in accordance with standard engineering practice to
permit safe vehicular movement.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever practical.
In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a leveling area
shall be provided having not greater than a four percent rate at a distance of
75 feet, measured from the nearest back of curb line of the intersection
street.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing
vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting
visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation, including
streets, in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the
extent deemed necessary to provide an adequate sight distance.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall be
three percent or less.
170.53Â Â Â BRIDGES.
Â Â Â Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined by the Council,
shall be constructed at the full expense of the applicant without reimbursement
from the City. The sharing expense for the construction of bridges not of
primary benefit to the applicant as determined by the Council, will be fixed by
special agreement between the Council and the owner and subdivider. Said cost
shall be charged to the owner and subdivider pro rata as the percentage of land
developed and so served.
170.54Â Â Â ALLEYS.
Â Â Â The following design standards for alleys shall be required of all
subdividers:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Alleys shall not be providedÂ in residential districts but mayÂ be
provided in commercial and industrial districts unless an alternate plan for
service area is provided.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Alleys within commercial and industrial zones shall have a right-of-
way of not less than 20 feet and a roadway width of not less than 16 feet.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided,
but where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit safe
vehicular movement.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable,
shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead end, as
determined by the Council.
170.55Â Â Â STREET DEDICATIONS AND RESERVATIONS.
Â Â Â The following provisions shall apply to street dedications and reservations.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Street systems in new subdivisions shall be laid out so as to eliminate
or avoid new perimeter half-streets. Where an existing half-street is adjacent
to a new subdivision, the other half of the street shall be improved and
dedicated by the subdivider. The Council may authorize a new perimeter street
where the subdivider improves and dedicates the entire required street right-
of-way width within the subdivision boundaries.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Half-streets are prohibited, except where an existing platted half-
street abuts the subdivision, a platted half-street to complete the street
shall be required according to the provisions stated herein.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow street or when City
plans or zoning setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening
a road that would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the owner
and subdivider shall be required to improve and dedicate at the owner and
subdividerâ€™s expense such areas for widening or realignment of such roads. Such
frontage roads and streets shall be improved and dedicated by the owner and
subdivider at the owner and subdividerâ€™s expense to the full width as required
by these subdivision regulations. Land reserved for any street purposes may not
be counted in satisfying yard or area requirements of the zoning regulations
whether the land is to be dedicated to the City in fee simple or an easement is
granted to the City.
170.56Â Â Â DRIVEWAYS.
Â Â Â The following standards shall apply to residential driveways:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A single driveway shall be 16 feet in width at the street.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â A double driveway shall be 24 feet in width at the street.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Driveway pavement between the back of street curb and the sidewalk
constructed of Portland cement concrete shall be a minimum of 6 inches thick
and shall contain three reinforcing steel bar of five eighths inch diameter in
the longitudinal and transverse directions spaced evenly in either direction.
The outer reinforcing steel bars shall be placed approximately 6 inches from
the edge of pavement. All reinforcing steel bars shall be continuous and shall
be centered in the pour.
(Ord. 06-2023 - Dec. 23 Supp.)
170.57Â Â Â STORM SEWERS AND DRAINAGE.
Â Â Â The Commission shall not recommend for approval any plat of a subdivision
which does not make adequate provision for storm or flood water runoff channels
or basins. The storm water drainage system shall be separated and independent
of any sanitary sewer system. A copy of design computations shall be submitted
along with the plans. The following requirements shall apply to the provision
of storm sewers and drainage:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Provide adequately sized storm sewers and sump pump drain lines to
receive discharge from foundation drains or sump pumps. Sump pump drain lines
shall be installed at the back of curbs on both sides of the roadway unless RCP
storm sewer pipe has been installed which could collect and convey sump pump
drainage. Sump pump drain lines will be required unless it can be shown by the
developer that they are not needed to the satisfaction of the Council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Minimum sump pump collection pipe size receiving discharge from
twoÂ or more sump pumps is 6-inch diameter pipe.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Provide 4-inch PVC sleeve for drain lines when located below street
pavement or at developerâ€™s option extend 4-inch drain line from storm sewer or
collector pipe to property line.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Determine runoff using the Rational Formula or by other method as
approved by the City Engineer.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Use 5-year storm frequency and the Rainfall Intensity-Duration-
Frequency Curve to determine intensity for storm sewer system design except as
follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Use 100-year storm frequency for culvert design under roadways where
roadway embankment blocks drainageway.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Use 100-year storm frequency for storm sewers draining sump area in
roadways and private lands unless drainage easements are provided for all areas
inundated during 100-year storm.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Provide unobstructed 100-year storm frequency storm water flood
paths through platted areas subject to development to convey runoff from
upstream areas of the watershed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â A culvert or other drainage facility shall in each case be large
enough to accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area,
whether inside or outside the subdivision. The Council shall determine the
necessary size of the facility, based on the provisions of the construction
standards and specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential water
shed development permitted by applicable zoning regulations.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â City will consider storm water detention/retention; storm water
detention design using Soil Conservation Service Technical Release No. 55,
Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, or other method as approved by City
Engineer.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â In areas where existing downstream drainage systems have inadequate
capacities, the use of storage basins may be required to prevent flooding.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â City will consider open channel storm water drainage when required pipe
diameter is greater than 48 inches.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Storm pipes to accommodate flow into intake based on 5-year storm
frequency runoff without surcharging intake. The minimum storm pipe size is 15
inches.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Inlets shall be provided so that surface water is not carried across or
around any intersection, or for a distance of more than 600 feet in the gutter.
When calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a point, no
further allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point, and basins shall be
used to intercept flow at that point. Surface water drainage patterns shall be
shown for each and every lot and block.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â The applicant may be required by the Council to carry away by pipe or
open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist either previously to, or
as a result of the subdivision. Such drainage facilities shall be located in
the road right-of-way where feasible, or in perpetual unobstructed easements of
appropriate width, and shall be constructed in accordance with the construction
standards and specifications.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â The Council shall also study the effect of each subdivision on
existing downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision.
City drainage studies together with such other studies as shall be appropriate
shall serve as a guide to needed improvements. Where it is anticipated that the
additional runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will overload
an existing downstream drainage facility, the Council may withhold approval of
the subdivision until provision has been made for the recovery of the cost for
the improvement of said potential condition in such sum as the Council shall
determine. No subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be
provided to an adequate drainage water course or facility.
Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â The Council may, when it deems it necessary for the health, safety, or
welfare of the present and future population of the area and necessary to the
conservation of water, drainage, and sanitary facilities, prohibit the
subdivision of any portion of the property which lies within the flood plain of
any stream or drainage course.
Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â The Council may, when it deems necessary for the public health,
safety, or welfare adopt by resolution such construction standards as it deems
appropriate for the design and installation of storm water facilities. Said
construction standards shall be adhered to as if they were a part of this
chapter.
170.58Â Â Â DEDICATION OF DRAINAGE EASEMENTS.
Â Â Â The following shall apply to the dedication of drainage easements:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel, or stream, there shall be provided a storm water easement or drainage
right-of-way and of such width to convey storm water flow from a 100-year
stormÂ event.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impractical
the inclusion of drainage facilities within the street rights-of-way, perpetual
unobstructed easements at least 15 feet in width for such drainage facilities
shall be provided across property outside the street lines and with
satisfactory access to the road to convey storm water flow from a 100-year
storm event. Drainage easements shall be carried from the street to a natural
watercourse or to other drainage facilities.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private land
outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and
indicated on the plat.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The applicant shall dedicate, either in fee or by drainage or
conservation easement of land on both sides of existing watercourses, to a
distance to be determined by the Council.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Low-lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or overflowing
during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for dedication, shall be
preserved and retained in their natural state as drainage ways. Such land or
lands within established drainage ways shall not be computed in determining the
area requirement of any lot.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The sewers shall, upon inspection, approval, and acceptance by the
City, become the property of the City. In the storm sewer design phase,
consideration shall be given to alternatives and principles of storm water
management, or the provisions of storm water management plan if such plan has
been adopted by the City.
170.59Â Â Â WATER FACILITIES.
Â Â Â The subdivider of land being platted shall install and construct a water
main system to adequately serve all lots or parcels of land within the platted
area, with due regard to the present and reasonably foreseeable needs of the
entire area, and shall connect the same to the Cityâ€™s existing water mains.
Water facilities shall be provided as follows:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Where a public water main is accessible the subdivider shall install
adequate water mains, water facilities, and fire hydrants, all of which shall
be subject to City specifications and the regulations of the IowaÂ Department of
Natural Resources.Â Â Minimum Size ofÂ water main shall be 8 inches in diameter.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Water main extensions shall be approved by the City. All mains shall be

mains.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Under some circumstances the City may require, as a condition for
approval of the plat, installation of a water main that is larger than
necessary to meet the needs of the platted area, but necessary to complete the
City water distribution system as it relates to both the area being platted and
other areas. In such event, the City will pay the subdivider the difference in
cost of pipe and installation between the larger water main and the diameter of
water main reasonable to meet the foreseeable needs of the area.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â The water mains shall, upon inspection, approval, and acceptance by the
City, become the property of the City.
170.60Â Â Â INDIVIDUAL WELLS AND CENTRAL WATER SYSTEMS.

applicant may choose one of the following alternatives, subject to the consent
of the Council:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Install a central sewage system, operated and maintained by the
benefited property owners. Where plans for future public sanitary sewage
systems exist, the applicant shall install the sewer lines, laterals, and mains
to be in permanent conformance with such plans and ready for connection to such
public sewer mains.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Install individual disposal systems.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Under some circumstances the City may require, as a condition for
approval of the plat, installation of a sanitary sewer that is larger than
necessary to meet the needs of the platted area, but necessary to complete the
City sanitary sewer system as it relates to both the area being platted and
other areas. In such event, the City will pay the subdivider the difference in
cost of pipe and installation between the larger sewer and the diameter of
sewer reasonable to meet the foreseeable needs of the area. The above mentioned

Â Â Â The following shall apply to the provision of utilities:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The Council may require that all utility facilities, including (but not
limited to) gas, electric power, telephone, and cable television cables, be
located underground throughout the subdivision. All anticipated utility
facilities existing and proposed throughout the subdivision shall be shown on
the preliminary plat. Underground service connections to the street property
line of each platted lot shall be installed at the subdividerâ€™s expense. At the
discretion of the Council, the requirement for service connections to each lot
may be waived in the case of adjoining lots to be retained in single ownership
and intended to be developed for the same primary use.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Easements shall be provided as follows: Where alleys are not provided,
or where otherwise required by the present or future placement of public

170.67Â Â Â PARKS AND SCHOOL SITES RESERVED.
Â Â Â When a tract being subdivided includes lands proposed to be parks or school
sites in the Comprehensive Plan or other official plan of the City, the
subdivider shall indicate such areas on the plat.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Proposed park sites shall be reserved for two years, giving the City or
other authorized public agency the option to purchase the land at the appraised
raw land value established by a certified land appraiser prior to the
subdivision. The purchase price shall also include one-half of the cost for
grading and paving, including curbs, of the portion of any streets that are
contiguous to the site and any taxes and interest incurred by the subdivider
between the date of reservation and date of purchase by the public agency.
Should the park site not be purchased within two years, the subdivider may then
amend the final plat.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Proposed school sites shall be reserved for two years giving the
appropriate school district the option to purchase land at the appraised raw
land value established by a certified land appraiser prior to the subdivision.
The purchase price shall also include one-half of the cost for grading and
paving, including curbs, of the portion of any streets that are contiguous to
the site and any taxes and interest incurred by the subdivider between the date
of reservation and date of purchase by the school district. Should the school
sites not be purchased within two years, the subdivider may then amend the
final plat.
170.68Â Â Â IMPROVEMENTS WITHIN UNINCORPORATED JURISDICTION.
Â Â Â In order to facilitate the proper and orderly growth in accordance with the
comprehensive plan of the City, the following provisions shall apply:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The two miles referred to herein shall include all property lying
within two miles of the corporate limits of the City. For subdivisions located
within two miles of the corporate limits of the City, the procedures for review
and approval and standards stated herein shall be the same as set for
subdivisions within the City under this chapter, except that the preliminary
and final plats shall also be submitted to the Linn County or Cedar County
Board of Supervisors in accordance with Section 354.9(2), Code of Iowa.Â 
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The City may waive its right to review of the subdivision by a
resolution of the Council, or waive the requirements of any of its standards or
conditions for approval of subdivisions by a resolution which, in either case,
said resolution shall be recorded with the plat in accordance with Section
354.9(2), Code of Iowa.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â In areas outside of the corporate limits for which the City has
established subdivision review which are overlapped by the area of another
municipality, the city closest to the boundary of the subdivision shall have
the authority to review of the subdivision in accordance with Section 354.9(3),
Code of Iowa.
170.69Â Â Â ADMINISTRATION.
Â Â Â The following shall apply to the granting of variations or exceptions:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Where the Council finds that extraordinary hardships or particular
difficulties regarding the physical development of land may result from strict
compliance with these regulations, it may make variations or exceptions to the
regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest
secured, provided that findings for such variation or exceptions to these
regulations are based upon the evidence that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in
the neighborhood in which the property is located.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The conditions upon which the request for a variation is based are
unique to the property for which the variation is sought, and are not
applicable, generally, to other property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire
to make more money out of the property.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â In granting variations and exceptions, the Council may require such
conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the
standards or requirements of these regulations.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â A petition for any such variance shall be submitted in writing by the
developer between the time when the preliminary plat is filed and the final
plat is approved. The petition shall state fully the grounds for the
application and all of the facts relied upon by the petitioner.
170.70Â Â Â ENFORCEMENT.
Â Â Â No plat or subdivision within the City or within two miles thereof shall be
filed or recorded with the County, nor shall any plat or subdivision have any
validity until it complies with the provision of these regulations, has been
approved by the Council as herein set forth; and further, no more than two
building permits for each separate tract existing at the time of the effective
date of these regulations shall be issued unless the tract has been platted in
accordance with these regulations; except that this provision shall not limit
the number of building permits that may be issued for accessory buildings as
defined by applicable land use regulations such as zoning and restricted
residence regulations or additions or improvements to a main or accessory
building already legally located upon said tract.
170.71Â Â Â PENALTIES.
Â Â Â Any person who shall dispose of or offer for sale any lot or lots within the
area of jurisdiction of this ordinance, until the plat thereof has been
approved by the Council, and recorded as required by law, shall forfeit and pay
$100.00 for each lot or part of lot sold, disposed of, or offered for sale.
Nothing contained herein shall in any way limit the Cityâ€™s right to any other
remedies available to the City for the enforcement of this chapter.
170.72Â Â Â VOID PLAT.
Â Â Â If a plat is recorded withoutÂ going through reviewÂ by the City, it can be
voided byÂ the Court at the request of the City.
170.73Â Â Â INTERPRETATION.
Â Â Â In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these regulations
shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public
health, safety, and general welfare. These regulations shall be construed
broadly to promote the purposes for which they are adopted.
170.74Â Â Â SAVING PROVISION.
Â Â Â These regulations shall not be construed as abating any action now pending
under, or by virtue of, prior existing subdivision regulations, or as
discontinuing, abating, modifying, or altering any penalty accruing or about to
accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, firm, or corporation, or
as waiving any right of the City under any section or provision existing at the
time of adoption of these regulations, or as vacating or annulling any rights
obtained by any person, firm, or corporation by lawful action of the City
except as shall be expressly provided for in these regulations.
170.75Â Â Â CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.
Â Â Â This chapter or any provision of this chapter may be changed by the Council,
provided, however, that such changes or amendments shall not become effective
until after a public hearing has been held, public notice of which shall have
been published at least once, not less than 4 or more than 20 days before the
date of the hearing. Such proposed amendments shall first be submitted to the
Commission for study and recommendation before the hearing is held. The
Commission shall forward its recommendation to the Council within 30 days after
receipt. If the Commission fails to make such a recommendation within 30 days,
the Council may proceed to hold the hearing on the proposed amendment.
170.76Â Â Â CHAPTER NOT TO LIMIT OTHER ORDINANCES.
Â Â Â Nothing contained herein shall serve to abrogate, limit, repeal, or
otherwise modify any other ordinance or regulation except as expressly set
forth herein. If any provision of this chapter conflicts with the provisions of

173.06Â Â Â OPEN SPACE, LANDSCAPING, PARKING AND ARCHITECTURAL REQUIREMENTS.
Â Â Â The requirements set forth in this section for open spaces, landscaping,
parking and architectural standards shall apply to any development or
redevelopment except one and two family dwellings.
Â Â Â  1.Â Â Â Open Space Required. On each lot, except for one and two family
dwellings, there shall be provided 25 percent of open space.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Said open space shall be unencumbered with any structure, or off-
street parking or roadways and drives, and shall be landscaped and maintained
with grass, trees and shrubbery. When the entire lot is not developed, the open
space requirement shall be based in proportion to the area of the improved
portion of the lot.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Each principal structure of an apartment or office complex on same
site shall be separated from any other principal structure in the complex by an
open space of not less than sixteen (16) feet.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Landscaping Required. Any development, except one and two family
dwellings, shall provide the following minimum number and size of landscape
plantings based on the minimum required open space for the development. The
following is the minimum requirement of trees and shrubs, by number and size,
and type of ground cover. Street trees planted in public street right-of-way
subject to approval by the City shall not be counted toward fulfillment of the
minimum site requirements set forth below. Plant species to be used for
landscaping shall be acceptable to the City that are not considered a nuisance
or undesirable species, such as trees with thorns, cottonwood or cottonbearing
poplars, elm trees prone to Dutch Elm Disease, box elder, ash, and silver
maple. Existing trees and shrubs to be retained on site may be counted toward
fulfillment of the landscaping requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Minimum requirements at the time of planting - Two (2) trees minimum
or one (1) tree of the following size per 1,500 square feet of open space,
whichever is greater: 40 Percent 1Â½" - 2" caliper diameter. Balance 1" - 1Â½"
caliper diameter. (Evergreen trees shall not be less than three (3) feet in
height.)
Â Â Â Â Â Â BÂ Â Â Minimum requirements at the time of planting - 6 shrubs, or 1 shrub
per 1,000 square feet of open space, whichever is greater.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â To reduce erosion all disturbed open space areas shall have ground
cover of grass or native vegetation which is installed as sod, or seeded,
fertilized and mulched.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Buffer Required. The following conditions shall require a buffer which
shall be a landscaped area, wall, or other structure intended to separate and
obstruct the view between two adjacent zoning districts, land uses or
properties:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any other zoning district, other than an Agricultural A-1 District,
that abuts any residential district shall require a buffer as described in this
section. The buffer shall be provided by the non-residential use when adjoining
a residential district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All Industrial Districts that abut any other district shall provide
a buffer as required by this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Any storage area, garbage storage, junk storage or loading docks,
and loading areas, in any District shall be screened from public street view by
a buffer.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Buffers. Buffers required under the provisions of this section or
elsewhere in the Zoning Ordinance shall be accomplished by any one or approved
combination of the following methods:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Buffer Wall: A buffer wall shall not be less than six (6) feet in
height; constructed of a permanent low maintenance material such as concrete
block, cinder block, brick, concrete, precast concrete or tile block; the
permanent low-maintenance wall shall be designed by an architect or engineer
for both structural adequacy and aesthetic quality; weather resistant wood may
be used as a substitute material if designed with adequate structural integrity
and permanency and approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City
Council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Landscape Buffer: A landscape buffer shall not be less than twenty-
five (25) feet in width, designed and landscaped with earth berm and
predominant plantings of evergreen type trees, shrubs and plants so as to
assure year around effectiveness; height of berm and density and height of
plantings shall be adequate to serve as a solid and impenetrable screen. A
chain link fence may exist for security purposes, but is not considered a part
of the landscape screening to satisfy the intent of this requirement.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Burden of Provision of Buffer. The burden of provision and selection of
the buffer shall be as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where two different zoning districts, requiring a buffer between
them, are developed, the above requirement is not retroactive and a buffer is
not required. If a buffer is desired, it shall be provided by mutual agreement
between adjacent property owners. However, in the event of any or all of the
improved property is abandoned, destroyed, or demolished, for the purpose of
renewal or redevelopment, that portion of such property being renewed or
redeveloped, shall be considered vacant and subject to the requirements herein.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where one of two different zoning districts requiring a buffer
between them is partly developed, the developer of the vacant land shall assume
the burden, unless otherwise specified herein.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Where both zoning districts, requiring a buffer between them, are
vacant or undeveloped, the burden shall be assumed by the developer of the land
that is improved or developed, except for agricultural uses and unless
otherwise specified herein.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Waiver of Buffer Requirements. Where the line between two districts,
requiring a buffer, follows a street, right-of-way, railroad, stream, or other
similar barrier, the requirement for a buffer may be waived by the City Council
provided such waiver does not permit the exposure of undesirable
characteristics of land use to public view.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Surfacing Requirements. All off-street parking and loading areas and
access roadways shall have a durable and dustless surface paved with asphaltic
or Portland cement concrete pavement or pervious pavement in accordance with
the requirements as herein set forth. Off- street parking of automobiles, vans,
campers, trucks, trailers, tractors, recreational vehicles, boats, construction
equipment, and any other mobile vehicles equipped for street and highway travel
shall be on an asphaltic or Portland cement concrete paved off-street parking
area as required herein and not parked or stored within the landscaped open
space area of the front yard between the building and public street right- of-
way, except, however, the storage of a recreational vehicle, a camper, and boat
within the side or rear yard upon an unpaved area shall be permitted. All off-
street parking areas and associated driveways, access roadways and frontage
roads, except driveways for single family residences, shall be constructed with
permanent, integrally attached 6" high curbing or curbing of alternate height
acceptable to the City (prefabricated portable curb stops shall not be
considered an acceptable alternate), and shall be so graded and drained as to
dispose of all surface water accumulation within the area; and shall be so
arranged and marked as to provide for orderly and safe loading or unloading and
parking and storage of self-propelled vehicles. The curbing requirements may be
waived if it is determined that surface drainage can be adequately handled by
other means. All approaches from the back of the street curb to the sidewalk
shall be constructed of at least six (6) inches of Portland Concrete. The
Portland Concrete approach shall contain three reinforcing steel bar of five
eighths inch diameter in the longitudinal and transverse directions spaced
evenly in either direction. The outer reinforcing steel bars shall be placed
approximately 6 inches from the edge of pavement. All reinforcing steel bar
shall be continuous and shall be centered in the pour." The minimum thickness
of pavement of the parking area shall be as follows:
(Ord. 08-2023 - Dec. 23 Supp.)
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Portland Cement Concrete shall have a minimum thickness of five (5)
inches.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Asphaltic Cement Concrete shall have a minimum thickness of six (6)
inches.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Pervious pavement will be subject to review and approval by the
City.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Material utilized in the subgrade shall be well drained and not
susceptible to frost boils. The part of the parking utilized for driveways and
access roadways shall be specifically designed to accommodate the type and load
bearing capacity of traffic anticipated. Driveways for attached townhouse style
residences on private property shall be Portland cement concrete or asphaltic
concrete with minimum thickness of five (5) inches and six (6) inches,
respectively, with a sufficiently compacted and well- drained subgrade base and
not greater than eighteen (18) feet in width.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Landscaping, Screening and Open Space Requirements. It is desired that
all parking areas be aesthetically improved to reduce obtrusive characteristics
that are inherent to their use. Therefore, wherever practical and except for
single and two family detached and townhouse style residential parking in
driveways, parking areas shall be effectively screened from general public view
and contain shade trees within parking islands where multiple aisles of parking
exist. Not less than five (5) percent of the interior parking area shall be
landscaped within parking islands.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Off-Street Parking Access to Public Streets and Internal Traffic
Circulation. Off-street parking or loading facilities shall be designed so as
to permit entrance and exit by forward movement of the vehicle for all uses,
except single-family detached or row dwellings which shall permit backward
movement from a driveway. The backing or backward movement of vehicles from a
driveway, off-street parking or loading area onto an arterial street or highway
shall be prohibited for all uses. Driveway approach returns shall not extend
beyond the side lot line as extended, unless such driveway is of joint usage by
the adjoining lots, and driveway approaches at roadway not greater than
established in the Iowa Statewide Urban Design and Specifications. The number
of ingress/egress access points to public streets from off-street parking areas
approved by the City and located to limit vehicular conflicts, provide
acceptable location of driveway accesses to public streets, preserve proper
traffic safety, and, as possible, not impair movement of vehicular traffic on
public streets. The permitted number of ingress/egress driveway approaches to
public streets for an off-street parking lot shall be dependent upon the
projected future average daily traffic (ADT) for the public street and, as
possible, public street accesses shall be located in alignment with driveway
approaches gaining access to the same public street from property on approaches
gaining access to the same public street from property on the opposite side of
the street. The design of off- street parking and loading facilities shall
provide traffic circulation for the internal forward movement of traffic within
the parking lot, so designed, as not to impair vehicular movement on public
streets, or backing of vehicles from an off-street parking or loading area to a
public street.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Handicap Accessible Parking Requirements. Provision of handicapped
parking spaces within off-street parking areas shall be in accordance with
applicable Federal, State and local regulations, properly identified with
signage and provided with accessible ramps and walks in accordance with Federal
and State regulations, and comply with the following parking space minimum
requirements:
Total Parking Spaces in Lot Required Minimum Number of Handicapped Spaces
10 to 25                    1
26 to 50                    2

401 to 500                  9
501 to 1000                 â€ 
1001 and over               â€¡
Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â€  Two percent (2%) of total
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¡ Twenty (20) spaces plus one for each 100 over 1000
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Access space or aisle adjacent to handicap accessible parking space
shall be a minimum five (5) feet wide. One in every eight handicap accessible
spaces, but not less than one shall be served by an access space or aisle eight
(8) feet wide minimum and shall be designated "van accessible."
Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â Traffic Analysis Requirements. Any project which contains 100 dwelling
units or 1,000 average day trips as listed for uses in the Trip Generation
Handbook; Institute of Transportation Engineers, current edition, shall submit
a traffic analysis which provides necessary information to determine the affect
that the project will have upon the surrounding traffic. At a minimum the
traffic analysis shall contain project trip generation directional distribution
of project trips, traffic assignment, and capacity analysis, including
identification of congestion and turning-movement conflicts.
Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â Waiver of Requirements. The City Council reserves the right to waive
or modify to a lesser requirement any provision or requirement of off-street
parking and loading areas contained in this chapter, provided a report on such
change is received from the Planning and Zoning Commission and City
Administrator, provided adequate area exists for future expansion, and further
provided said waiver or modification does not adversely affect the intent of
these regulations to adequately safeguard the general public and surrounding
property. Exceptions will only be considered for those uses where special
circumstances warrant a change and whereby the modification or waiver is
determined to be in the best interest of the general public.
Â Â Â 13.Â Â Â Architectural Standards. As part of the submittal of a site plan for
development within any of the zoning districts and for any of the uses except
one and two family dwellings, architectural plans for buildings shall be
submitted for review and approval by the City Council after recommendation from
the Planning and Zoning Commission. Documentation to be submitted shall include
building elevations showing the building's design and a description of
structural and exterior materials to be used. The following standards shall be
considered by the City to review architectural plans:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Multiple-Family Dwellings in All Districts. The architecture of
multiple-family buildings shall be designed in a manner compatible with
adjoining residential uses in the neighborhood. Architectural design for
multiple-family buildings shall include exterior building materials, exterior
details and texture, treatment of windows and doors, and a variety in the wall
and roof design to lessen the plainness of appearance that can be
characteristic of large residential buildings. Multiple-family buildings with
single plane walls and boxy in appearance shall not be considered acceptable
unless the use of exterior materials such as brick provides the elements
necessary to enhance the building's physical appearance and eliminate its
plainness of appearance. Adequate treatment or screening of negative aspects of
buildings (loading docks, loading areas, outside storage areas, garbage
dumpsters and HVAC mechanical units) from any public street and adjoining
properties shall be required. Buildings shall be designed or oriented not to
expose loading docks, or loading areas to the public.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Non-Residential Uses in the "R" Districts. Any building used for a
permitted non-residential use in "R" Districts shall be designed and
constructed with architecture and use of materials compatible with the
residential uses within the neighborhood. Buildings located on a residential
street in an "R" District shall be residential in character, and exterior
materials shall be wood, brick, and/or brick veneer. The architectural design
shall be approved by the City.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â All Uses Within the Commercial Districts. Architectural design and
use of materials for the construction of any building shall be approved by the
City. Buildings within the Commercial Districts shall have as a primary element
of the building exterior fascia glass, brick, concrete panels, textured
concrete block, architectural steel or stone panels, or cement fiber composite
siding, with all sides of any building built consistent in design and use of
materials. No wood, masonite, visible asphaltic exterior wall or roof material,
aluminum or steel siding, nonarchitectural sheet metal non-textured concrete
block, stucco, E.I.F.S. (Exterior Insulation and Finish System) or other
similar materials shall constitute a portion of any building except as a trim
material, unless the City Council after receiving a recommendation from the
Planning and Zoning Commission, shall determine said material when used as a
primary element, does not distract from the physical appearance of the
building. Adequate treatment or screening of negative aspects of buildings
(loading docks, loading areas, outside storage areas, garbage dumpsters and
HVAC mechanical units) from any public street and adjoining properties shall be
required. Building shall not be designed or oriented to expose loading docks,
nonresidential use overhead doors or loading areas to the public.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â All Uses Within Industrial Districts. Architectural design and use
of materials for construction of any building in the Industrial Districts shall
be reviewed as part of the site plan proposal and shall be approved by the
City. While it is not the purpose of this section to dictate, specify, or
restrict the use of building materials and structural elements, the use of
appropriate exterior materials to enhance the appearance of a building is
encouraged by the City. The exclusive use of sheet metal as an exterior
building material shall not be considered acceptable for buildings facing
public streets. The exterior material of the building's front elevation shall
be comprised of brick, concrete panels, textured concrete block, architectural
steel or stone panels, or cement fiber composite siding, or other similar
material. Loading areas, loading docks, storage areas, and garbage dumpsters
shall be located, screened or oriented to minimize their exposure to view from
public streets.
173.07Â Â Â ZONING PERMITS.
Â Â Â No zoning compliance permit or building permit shall be issued for the
construction of any structure that is subject to the provisions of this
chapter, until a site plan has been submitted for review covering the land upon
which said structure is to be erected, and further, approved by City Council
for such development in accordance with this chapter.
173.08Â Â Â FEES.
Â Â Â The City Council shall establish a schedule of fees, charges, and expenses
and a collection procedure for site plan approval and other matters pertaining
to this chapter. The schedule of fees shall be posted in the office of the City
Clerk, and may be altered or amended only by the City Council. Until all
applicable fees, charges, and expenses have been paid in full, no action shall
be taken on any application or appeal.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Applicant shall be responsible for just and reasonable costs incurred
by the City for review of preliminary and final site plans deemed necessary by
the City to insure proper conformance with City ordinances and site plan
regulations.
173.09Â Â Â VALIDITY OF APPROVAL.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A site plan shall become effective upon certification of approval by
the City Council.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The City Council approval of any site plan required by this chapter
shall remain valid for one (1) year allowing one (1) year extension with
approval of City Council upon recommendation of the Commission after the date
of approval, after which time the site plan shall be deemed null and void if
the development has not been established or actual construction commenced. For
the purpose of this chapter "actual construction" shall mean that the permanent
placement of construction materials has started and is proceeding without undue
delay. Preparation of plans, securing financial arrangements, issuance of
building permits, letting of contracts, grading of property, or stockpiling of
materials on the site shall not constitute actual construction.
173.10Â Â Â SITE PLAN AMENDMENT.
Â Â Â Any site plan may be amended in accordance with the standards and procedures
established herein, including payment of fees, provided that the Zoning
Administrator may waive such procedures for those minor changes hereinafter
listed. Such minor changes shall not be made unless the prior written approval
for such changes is obtained from the Zoning Administrator. No fees shall be
required for such minor changes.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Moving building walls within the confines of the smallest rectangle
that would have enclosed each original approved building(s). Relocation of
building entrances or exits, shortening of building canopies.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Changing to a more restrictive commercial or industrial use, provided
the number of off-street parking spaces meets the requirement of the Lisbon
Zoning Ordinance. This does not apply to residential uses.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Changing angle of parking or aisle provided there is no reduction in
the amount of off-street parking as originally approved.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Substituting plant species provided a landscape architect, engineer or
architect certifies the substituted species is similar in nature and screening
effect.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Changing type and design of lighting fixtures provided an engineer or

property boundary.
Â Â Â 6Â Â Â Increasing peripheral yards.
173.11Â Â Â APPLICABILITY TO EXISTING DEVELOPMENT.
Â Â Â The requirements of this chapter shall not apply to the placement of any
structure for which building permits have been issued as of the date of the
adoption of this ordinance codified by this chapter (March 5, 2012), provided
that if such building permit shall expire, then a new building permit shall not
be issued until the requirements of this chapter have been met. Provided
further, that if an existing structure is to be reconstructed, enlarged,
expanded, or otherwise increased:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â In the case of building uses, in an amount 50% or greater of its
existing ground coverage and/or total floor space; or
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â In the case of non-building uses or non-building portion of uses, in
the amount 50% or greater of the existing developed non-building site area,
then the provisions of this chapter shall apply.
173.12Â Â Â ENFORCEMENT.
Â Â Â No zoning ordinance certification, occupancy permit or building permit shall
be issued by the City or have any validity until the site plan has been
approved in the manner prescribed herein.
173.13Â Â Â CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.

Â Â Â The â€œOFFICIAL COPYâ€ of the Code of Ordinances must be kept by the City Clerk
and should be identified as the â€œOFFICIAL COPY.â€
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â DISTRIBUTION.
Â Â Â Other copies of the Code of Ordinances should be made available to all
persons having a relatively frequent and continuing need to have access to
ordinances which are in effect in the City as well as reference centers such as
the City Library, County Law Library, and perhaps the schools.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â SALE.
Â Â Â The sale or distribution of copies in a general fashion is not recommended
as experience indicates that indiscriminate distribution tends to result in
outdated codes being used or misused.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â RECORD OF DISTRIBUTION.
Â Â Â The City Clerk should be responsible for maintaining an accurate and current
record of persons having a copy of the Code of Ordinances. Each official,
elected or appointed, should return to the City, upon leaving office, all
documents, records and other materials pertaining to the office, including this
Code of Ordinances.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 372.13[4])
NUMBERING OF ORDINANCES AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
It is recommended that a simple numerical sequence be used in assigning
ordinance numbers to ordinances as they are passed. For example, if the
ordinance adopting the Code of Ordinances is No. 163, we would suggest that the
first ordinance passed changing, adding to, or deleting from the Code be
assigned the number 164, the next ordinance be assigned the number 165, and so
on. We advise against using the Code of Ordinances numbering system for the
numbering of ordinances.
RETENTION OF AMENDING ORDINANCES
Please note that two books should be maintained: (1) the Code of Ordinances;
and (2) an ordinance book. We will assist in the maintenance of the Code of
Ordinances book, per the Supplement Agreement, by revising and returning
appropriate pages for the Code of Ordinances book as required to accommodate
ordinances amending the Code. The City Clerk is responsible for maintaining the
ordinance book and must be sure that an original copy of each ordinance
adopted, bearing the signatures of the Mayor and Clerk, is inserted in the
ordinance book and preserved in a safe place.
SUPPLEMENT RECORD
A record of all supplements prepared for the Code of Ordinances is provided in
the front of the Code. This record will indicate the number and date of the
ordinances adopting the original Code and of each subsequently adopted
ordinance which has been incorporated in the Code. For each supplemented
ordinance, the Supplement Record will list the ordinance number, date, topic,
and chapter or section number of the Code affected by the amending ordinance. A
periodic review of the Supplement Record and ordinances passed will assure that
all ordinances amending the Code have been incorporated therein.
DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPLEMENTS
Supplements containing revised pages for insertion in each Code will be sent to
the Clerk. It is the responsibility of the Clerk to see that each person having
a Code of Ordinances receives each supplement so that each Code may be properly
updated to reflect action of the Council in amending the Code.
AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
The Code of Ordinances contains most of the laws of the City as of the date of
its adoption and is continually subject to amendment to reflect changing
policies of the Council, mandates of the State, or decisions of the Courts.
Amendments to the Code of Ordinances can only be accomplished by the adoption
of an ordinance.
