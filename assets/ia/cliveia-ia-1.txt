   All general ordinances of the City passed prior to the adoption of this Code
are hereby repealed, except such as are included in this Code or are by
necessary implication herein reserved from repeal (subject to the saving
clauses contained in the following sections), and excluding the following
ordinances which are not hereby repealed: tax levy ordinances; appropriation

   No ordinance relating to railroad crossings with streets and other public
ways, or relating to the conduct, duties, service, or rates of public utilities
shall be repealed by virtue of the adoption of this Code or by virtue of the
preceding section, excepting as the City Code may contain provisions for such
matters, in which case, this Code shall be considered as amending such
ordinance or ordinances in respect to such provisions only.
1-2-3 COURT PROCEEDINGS.
   1.   Prior Acts. No new ordinance shall be construed or held to repeal a
former ordinance, whether such former ordinance is expressly repealed or not,
as to any offense committed against such former ordinance or as to any act
done, any penalty, forfeiture, or punishment so incurred, or any right accrued
or claim arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect
any such offense or act so committed or so done, or any penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment so incurred or any right accrued or claim arising, before the new
ordinance takes effect, save only that the proceedings thereafter shall conform
to the ordinance in force at the time of such proceeding, so far as
practicable. If any penalty, forfeiture, or punishment may be mitigated by any
provision of a new ordinance, such provision may be, by consent of the party
affected, applied to any judgment announced after the new ordinance takes
effect.
   2.   Extend to all Repeals. This section shall extend to all repeals, either
by express words or implication, whether the repeal is in the ordinance making
any new provisions upon the same subject or in any other ordinance.
   3.   Current Pending Actions. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be
construed as abating any action now pending under or by virtue of any general
ordinance of the City herein repealed, and the provisions of all general
ordinances contained in this Code shall be deemed to be continuing provisions
and not a new enactment of the same provisions; nor shall this chapter be
deemed as discontinuing, abating, modifying, or altering any penalty accrued or
to accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, firm, or corporation,
or as waiving any right of the City under any ordinance or provision thereof in
force at the time of the adoption of this Code.
1-2-4 SEVERABILITY CLAUSE.
   If any section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause, or
phrase of this Code or any part thereof or any portion adopted by reference
therein, is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or invalid or
ineffective by any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not
affect the validity or effectiveness of the remaining portions of this Code, or
any part thereof or any portion adopted by reference therein. The Council
hereby declares that it would have passed each section, subsection,
subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase thereof irrespective of the
fact that any one or more sections, subsections, subdivisions, paragraphs,
sentences, clauses, or phrases be declared unconstitutional, invalid, or
ineffective.
1-2-5 INDEMNITY.
   The applicant for any permit or license under this Code, by making such
application, assumes and agrees to pay for all injury to or death of any person
or persons whomsoever, and all loss of or damage to property whatsoever,
including all costs and expenses incident thereto, however arising from or
related to, directly, indirectly or remotely, the issuance of the permit or
license, or the doing of anything thereunder, or the failure of such applicant,
or the agents, employees, or servants of such applicant, to abide by or comply
with any of the provisions of this Code or the terms and conditions of such
permit or license; and such applicant, by making such application, forever
agrees to indemnify the City and its officers, agents, and employees, and
agrees to save them harmless from any and all claims, demands, lawsuits, or
liability whatsoever for any loss, damage, injury, or death, including all
costs and expenses incident thereto, by reason of the foregoing. The provisions
of this section shall be deemed to be a part of any permit or license issued
under this Code or any other ordinance of the City whether expressly recited
therein or not.
1-2-6 PERSONAL INJURIES.
   When action is brought against the City for personal injuries alleged to
have been caused by its negligence, the City may notify, in writing, any person
by whose negligence it claims the injury was caused. The notice shall state the
pendency of the action, the name of the plaintiff, the name and location of the
court where the action is pending, a brief statement of the alleged facts from
which the cause arose, that the City believes that the person notified is
liable to it for any judgment rendered against the City, and asking the person
to appear and defend. A judgment obtained in the suit is conclusive in any
action by the City against any person so notified, as to the existence of the
defect or other cause of the injury or damage, as to the liability of the City
to the plaintiff in the first named action, and as to the amount of the damage
or injury. The City may maintain an action against the person notified to
recover the amount of the judgment together with all the expenses incurred by
the City in the suit.

Relief
 
1-4A-1 DEFINITION.
   For use in this chapter, the term “repeat offense” means a recurring
violation of the same section of this Code.
1-4A-2 VIOLATIONS, PENALTIES, AND ALTERNATIVE RELIEF.
   1.   Municipal Infraction. A violation of this Code of Ordinances or any
ordinance or code herein adopted by reference or the omission or failure to
perform any act or duty required by the same, with the exception of those
provisions specifically provided under State law as a felony, an aggravated
misdemeanor, or a serious misdemeanor, or a simple misdemeanor under Chapters
687 through 747 of the Code of Iowa, is a municipal infraction punishable by
civil penalty as provided herein. † 2
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.22[3])
   2.   Environmental Violation. A municipal infraction that is a violation of
Chapter 455B of the Code of Iowa, or of a standard established by the City in
consultation with the Department of Natural Resources, or both, may be
classified as an environmental violation. However, the provisions of this
section shall not be applicable until the City has offered to participate in
informal negotiations regarding the violation or to the following specific
violations:
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.22[1])
      A.   A violation arising from noncompliance with a pretreatment standard
or requirement referred to in 40 C.F.R. §403.8.
      B.   The discharge of airborne residue from grain, created by the
handling, drying, or storing of grain, by a person not engaged in the
industrial production or manufacturing of grain products.

handling, drying, or storing of grain, by a person engaged in such industrial
production or manufacturing if such discharge occurs from September 15 to
January 15.
   3.   Schedule of Civil Penalties. Unless another civil penalty is provided
elsewhere in this Code for a specific violation, a municipal infraction is a
civil offense punishable as provided in the following schedule of civil
penalties:
      A.   Schedule of maximum civil penalties:
         First offense         $750.00
         Subsequent offenses   $1,000.00
   4.   Each Day a Separate Offense. Each day that a municipal infraction
occurs or is permitted to exist constitutes a separate offense.
   5.   Alternative Relief. Seeking a civil penalty as authorized in this
chapter does not preclude the City from seeking alternative relief from the
court in the same action. Such alternative relief may include, but is not
limited to, an order for abatement or injunctive relief.
   6.   Alternative Penalties. This chapter does not preclude a peace officer
from issuing a criminal citation for a violation of this Code of Ordinances or
regulation if criminal penalties are also provided for the violation. Nor does
it preclude or limit the authority of the City to enforce the provisions of
this Code of Ordinances by criminal sanctions or other lawful means.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.22[12])

   2.   To grant a variance in a specific case and from a specific provision of
Title 10 of this Code, subject to appropriate conditions and provided that the
Board makes findings of fact based on the following:
      A.   That there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships, not
of the applicants own doing and not purely economic in nature, in carrying out
the strict letter of any notice or order and that such difficulties or
hardships are not generally applicable to other properties; and
      B.   That the effect of the application of the provisions would be
arbitrary in the specific case; and
      C.   That in granting a variance, such variance would not adversely
impact the intended spirit and intent of the provisions of the Code in

such additional time does not endanger the health, safety, and welfare of the
occupants, neighbors, and general public; and
   5.   To direct that legal action be brought to enforce the provisions of
Title 10 of this Code when such action is deemed necessary and appropriate due

shall have been filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a
stay would, in the opinion of the Department, cause imminent peril to life or
property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a
restraining order which may be granted by the Board or court of record on
application, on due cause shown.

consider such proposal, it shall publish notice and hold a public hearing
thereon. Thereafter, at least 30 days after such hearing, the Council, by

owner to ensure that this provision is not violated. Exceptions to this rule
may be applied for by way of a City approved temporary site plan amendment.
      I.   Mobile food units shall serve patrons which are on foot only; no
drive-up service to the unit itself shall be provided or allowed.
      J.   The mobile food unit must be located on a paved surface, unless
approved as part of a public property special event permit or through a
temporary site plan amendment.
      K.   No mobile food unit may be located on a vacant property or lot with
a vacant building. Exceptions to this rule may be granted by City staff after a
review of the particular property and the vendor has been able to make
arrangements to ensure safe and sanitary conditions. This would include, but is
not limited to: employee access to restrooms, adequate access for fire and
police personnel/vehicles, and that the site in general is free from hazards or
dangerous conditions.
      L.   No mobile food unit may operate within 100 feet of a permanent
restaurant or business offering food or beverage services unless they receive
expressed written consent of the restaurant or business owner.
      M.   All mobile food units shall maintain a minimum separation from
buildings, five feet for State IA Class I and II units and 15 feet for State IA
Class III and IV units, as measured to the closest building element including
awnings or canopies, tents, or membrane structures. Location of the food unit
shall not impede pedestrians entering or exiting a building.
      N.   The window or area where a patron orders and receives their purchase
shall be located so as to not require a patron to stand, or create a line that
may cause pedestrians to be in the public right-of-way, vehicle travel lane,
including parking lot drive aisles, or similar situation that may create a
potential safety hazard. Adequate safe space for patrons waiting for their
order must be available on the property where the mobile food unit is located.
      O.   With the exception of pushcarts as allowed herein, no mobile food
unit shall be placed on a public or private sidewalk. Pushcarts may locate on
or adjacent to a private sidewalk or public sidewalk, including the Clive
Greenbelt Trails, only as part of an approved public property special event
permit. However, a minimum 48-inch open walkway must be maintained for passing
pedestrians. The placement of the pushcart shall be in such a manner so as to
minimize encroachment into the 48-inch walkway by patrons waiting in line for
service from the pushcart.
      P.   Signs are limited to those that are attached to the exterior of the
mobile unit and must be mounted flat against the unit and not project more than
six inches from the exterior of the unit. No freestanding signs, banners,
flags, or similar items are allowed. Off premises signs directing patrons to
the mobile food unit are prohibited.
      Q.   During business hours, the mobile food vendor shall provide a trash
receptacle for use by customers.
      R.   The mobile food vendor shall keep the area around the mobile food
unit clear of litter and debris at all times.
      S.   All mobile food units shall be located in such a manner as to not
create a safety hazard, such as blocking emergency access to buildings and the
site, obstructing access to fire hydrants, impeding entering and exiting from a
building, creating a visual impediment for the motoring public at drive
entrances, intersections, pedestrian crossings, or similar movement and access.
   9.   Property Owner/Lessee Responsibility. By allowing the mobile food unit
on their property, the property owner or lessee jointly and severally with the
vendor are responsible for compliance with this chapter and to ensure the
safety of pedestrians and access of emergency vehicles to and around the site.
Failure to do so could result in the property owner or lessee being party to
any enforcement actions or penalties allowed by law.
4-3-5 UNLAWFUL ACTS.
   1.   Fraudulent Representation/Harassment. No licensee shall falsely or
fraudulently misrepresent the quality, character, or quantity of any article,
item, or commodity offered for sale, or sell any unwholesome or tainted food or
foodstuffs. No licensee shall harass, intimidate, coerce, or threaten any
individual to induce a sale.
   2.   Failure to Maintain Licenses and Permits. Failure of any applicant to
maintain the appropriate County, State, and federal licenses and permits,
during the term of the local license or permits, shall be considered an
unlawful act and subject to revocation or any other penalties available to the
City.
4-3-6 SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF LICENSE.
   1.   Any license issued under the provisions of this chapter may be
suspended or revoked by the City as follows:
      A.   Grounds. The Clerk or Clerk’s designee may suspend or revoke any

      B.   Notice of Suspension or Revocation; Right to Appeal. The Clerk or
Clerk’s designee shall cause notice of the license revocation to be served in
person by a City official or by mail to the licensee’s local address, which
notice shall specify the reason(s) for such action, at which time operations of
the licensee must cease within the corporate limits of the City. The licensee
may appeal the revocation of the license to the Council at its next regularly
scheduled meeting by filing with the Clerk a written request for an appeal to
the Council at least seven days prior to the meeting. The Council may affirm,
modify, or reverse the decision of the Clerk to revoke such license. If a
license is revoked, no refund of any license fee paid shall be made. Upon the
revocation of a license, the licensee is not eligible for the issuance of a new
license under this chapter for a period of one year from the date the license
revocation is served in person or deposited in the U.S. mail.
4-3-7 PENALTY.
   Unless another penalty is expressly provided by this chapter for any
particular provision or section, any person violating any provision of this
chapter or any rule or regulation adopted herein by reference shall, upon

after-hours businesses within the City. The Council finds that the existence of
after-hours businesses, which allow the on-premises consumption of alcohol
during early morning hours, in the greater Des Moines metropolitan area has
caused detrimental effects on the health, safety, welfare, and quality of life
of residents, visitors, and upon cities in general. Based on these findings,
the Council has deemed it necessary to enact the following regulations for
after-hours businesses in the City.

mail to the last known address of the licensee or permittee.
4-7-14 ENFORCEMENT ALTERNATIVES.

law, or who commits an act prohibited by this chapter or State law, may be

to the penalty procedures of Section
4-7-13 of this chapter.
4-7-15 CAUSES FOR SUSPENSION, REVOCATION, OR CIVIL PENALTY.

suspension and closure order along with a brief statement of the facts and
reasons for the decision to suspend to persons who are required to comply with
the order. Such notice shall state that the matter of temporary suspension and
closure will be heard by the Council at the first regularly scheduled Council
meeting after expiration of five calendar days from the temporary suspension/
closure. The suspension and order of closure is effective when issued and will
remain effective until the Council reviews the facts, circumstances, and
reasons for the temporary suspension and closure.

the Clerk. Such hearing shall be placed on the Council agenda for the next
regularly scheduled Council meeting after expiration of five calendar days from
the temporary suspension and closure.

4-9-1 PURPOSE.
   State licensed massage therapists and businesses offering massage therapy
services perform an important service in addressing the health and wellbeing of
our citizens. Unfortunately, there are businesses that advertise the provision
of massage therapy or other therapeutic services, but are engaged in various
illegal activities which may include prostitution or human trafficking. This
chapter is not intended to discourage a legitimately licensed massage therapist
or massage therapy business from providing their services in the City. The
purpose of this chapter is to identify and address businesses that engage in
the practice of massage therapy without a license or are involved in illegal
activities which may include prostitution or human trafficking. Businesses
providing massage therapy yet conducting various types of illegal activity are
harmful to the City and the image of the massage therapy profession. The
implementation of this chapter will better enable the City to proactively
screen, monitor, and remove businesses that are engaged in illegal activity.
4-9-2 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following words and phrases have the
meanings herein set forth, unless it is apparent from the context that a
different meaning is intended.
   1.   “License” means permission granted by competent authority to exercise a
certain privilege that, without such authorization, would constitute an illegal
act. The document that confers permission for an individual to engage in
massage therapy shall be issued by the Iowa Board of Massage Therapy for State
licenses; business licenses shall be issued by the City.
   2.   “Massage patron” means any person who receives, or pays to receive, a
massage or massage services from a massage therapist for value.
   3.   “Massage therapist” means a person licensed to practice the health care
service of the healing art of massage therapy under Chapter 152C of the Code of
Iowa.
   4.   “Massage therapy” means performance for compensation of massage,
myotherapy, massotherapy, bodywork, bodywork therapy, or therapeutic massage
including hydrotherapy, superficial hot and cold applications, vibration, body
cleansing and topical applications, or other therein which involves
manipulation of the muscle and connective tissue of the body, excluding osseous
tissue, to treat the muscle tonus system for the purpose of enhancing health,
muscle relaxation, increasing range of motion, reducing stress, relieving pain,
or improving circulation.
   5.   “Massage therapy business” means any place of business, whether the
physical property is owned, leased, or managed by a company or individual,
wherein any of the treatments, techniques, or methods of treatment referred to
in the definition of massage therapy of this section are administered,
practiced, used, given, or applied.
   6.   “Reflexology” means manipulation of the soft tissues of the human body
which is restricted to the hands, feet, or ears, performed by persons who do
not hold themselves out to be massage therapists or to be performing massage
therapy.
4-9-3 LICENSE REQUIRED.
   No person shall operate a massage therapy business within the City, either
exclusively or in connection with another business, without being licensed as
provided in this chapter.
4-9-4 LICENSE FEE.
   1.   New Massage Therapy Businesses in City.
      A.   The license fee for a massage therapy business in the City, as well
as additional fees per employee, contractor, or individual providing therapy
services at the business (“additional therapist fee”), shall be set by the
license fee schedule approved by the Council, which license fee schedule may be
modified from time to time with the approval of Council. The license fee and
additional therapist fee shall be paid when the application is filed and when a
therapist is added to the business.
      B.   The license, if granted, and not revoked or suspended, shall be
valid so long as the business does not change more than 51 percent of the
ownership, business name, or the service provided. An annual review shall be
initiated by the Clerk, with assistance from the Police Department, to confirm
business ownership, business name, service(s) provided and accurate and up-to-
date State licenses for the employees, contractors, or agents performing
massage therapy.
   2.   Existing Massage Therapy Businesses Within the City.
      A.   For a massage therapy business applying for licensure in the initial
year of this chapter’s effective date (July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019) the
licensing fee identified in Subsection 1 of this section is waived. If an
application properly submitted during the first year of this chapter is
approved, and the massage therapy business remains in continuous operation,
renewal fees for a massage therapy business license will be waived. A massage
therapy business grandfathered in under this section will not be required to
pay for the additional therapist fee for each additional employee, contractor,
agent, or therapist not included in their original application.
      B.   An annual review shall be initiated by the Clerk, with assistance
from the Police Department, to confirm business ownership, business name,
service(s) provided and accurate and up-to-date State licenses for the
employees, contractors, or agents performing massage therapy.
   3.   A separate license shall be obtained for each place of business. The
licensee shall display the license in a prominent place in the licensed
business at all times.

will be required to notify the Clerk of changes in massage therapist staffing,
contracting, therapists, ownership, or business management.

perform massage therapy denied, revoked, or suspended in any city, state,
county, or any country and the reason for the denial, revocation, or
suspension.
   6.   A government issued photo ID of the applicant, owner, manager, and all
employees, contractors, agents, or persons present on the premises who are or

conducting a background check. If it is determined that a nationwide background

enforcement agency may be used in lieu of this background check.
   8.   Any application for a license shall be accompanied by proof of
insurance executed by an insurance company authorized to do business in the

after considering all of the information provided and obtained in the
background check, shall either grant or deny the license. If a business has
been granted a license by another unit of municipal or county government in the
State, the licensing requirement may be waived.
4-9-7 CONDITIONS GOVERNING ISSUANCE.
   1.   No license shall be issued if the applicant or any of its owners,
managers, employees, contractors, or agents has a criminal conviction for a sex
crime as defined by Chapter 709 of the Code of Iowa, or for prostitution as

a hazard to persons or property, such animal may, in the discretion of the
Police Chief, be destroyed if it cannot be confined or captured. The City shall

individual that a person is keeping, sheltering, or harboring a dangerous
animal in the City, the Police Chief shall cause the matter to be investigated,
and if after investigation, the facts indicate that such person is keeping,

order such person to safely remove such animal from the City, and permanently
place the animal with an organization or group allowed under Section
5-7A-3 of this chapter to possess dangerous animals, or destroy the animal,
within three days of the receipt of such order. Such order shall be contained
in a notice to remove the dangerous animal, which notice shall be given in
writing to the person keeping, sheltering, or harboring the dangerous animal,
and shall be served personally or by certified mail. Such order and notice to
remove the dangerous animal shall not be required where the dangerous animal
has previously caused serious physical harm or death to any person, in which
case, the Police Chief shall cause the animal to be immediately seized and
impounded or killed if seizure and impoundment are not possible without risk of
serious physical harm or death to any person.
   3.   Right to Appeal; Seizure of Animal. The order to remove a dangerous
animal, issued by the Police Chief, may be appealed to the Animal Review Board

or entity owning, sheltering, harboring, or keeping such dangerous animal,
remove such animal from the City, permanently place such animal with an
organization or group allowed under Section
5-7A-3 of this chapter to possess dangerous animals, or destroy it. If the
original order of the Police Chief is not appealed and is not complied with
within three days, or if the order of the Animal Review Board after appeal is
not complied with within three days of its issuance, the Police Chief is
authorized to seize and impound such dangerous animal. An animal so seized
shall be impounded for a period of seven days. If, at the end of the
impoundment period, the individual or entity against whom the decision and
order of the Animal Review Board was issued has not petitioned the State
District Court for a review of said order, the City shall cause the animal to
be disposed of by sale, permanently place such animal with an organization or
group allowed under Section
5-7A-3 of this chapter to possess dangerous animals, or destroy such animal in
a humane manner. Failure to comply with an order of the City issued pursuant

warrant pursuant to Iowa rules of civil procedure and impound the dog pending
disposition of the case or until the dog owner has fulfilled the requirements
of Section

the costs of impounding and keeping the dog if the dog is determined to be a
dangerous dog.
      C.   The owner may, within seven (7) days after a determination that a
dog is a dangerous dog, appeal the determination to the Animal Review Board as
set forth in Section
5-7A-2 of this article. A decision by the Animal Review Board overturning the
determination of the Chief of Police or his designee shall not affect the right
of the Chief of Police or his designee to later declare a dog to be a dangerous
dog or to determine that the dog poses a threat to public safety based on the

requirements which are reasonable.

CHAPTER 7C
FEEDING DEER PROHIBITED
 
5-7C-1 Purpose     5-7C-3 Exceptions
5-7C-2 Prohibition 5-7C-4 Penalty
 
5-7C-1 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public’s health, safety, and
general welfare and the general welfare of the deer by prohibiting residents of
the City from intentionally feeding deer for the following reasons:
   1.   Intentionally feeding deer creates an increased risk of spreading
disease among the deer herd because the deer are concentrated in one place as a
result of intentionally feeding, which promotes contact between a sick animal
and a higher number of healthy animals.
   2.   Intentionally feeding deer creates an increased chance of exposure for
people and pets to deer ticks that carry Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi).
   3.   Intentional feeding of deer leads to reduced fear of humans in the
deer, which leads to increased property damage caused by the deer, car/deer
accidents, and other concerns.
5-7C-2 PROHIBITION.
   1.   No person shall place or allow any feeding device or any fruit, grain,
mineral, plant, salt, vegetable, or other material to be placed outdoors on any
public or private property for the purpose of attracting or feeding deer.
Pursuant to this chapter, a rebuttable presumption is created that the
placement of fruit, grain, mineral, plant, salt, vegetable, or other materials
(“feed materials”) in a drop feeder, deer feeder kit, automatic feeder, or
similar device (“feeding device”) regardless of the height of the fruit, grain,
mineral, plant, salt, vegetable, or other material is for the purpose of
feeding deer.
   2.   Each property owner or occupant of the property shall have the duty to
remove any feed materials placed on the owner’s property in violation of this
chapter. Failure to remove feed materials within 24 hours after notice from the
City shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
   3.   Each property owner or occupant of the property shall have the duty to
remove any feeding device placed on the owner’s property to which deer are
attracted or from which deer actually feed. Alternatively, a property owner or
occupant may modify a feeding device or make other changes to the property that
prevent deer from having access to or feeding from the feeding device. Failure
to remove such a feeding device or to make such modifications within 24 hours
after notice from the City shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
5-7C-3 EXCEPTIONS.
   1.   Naturally Growing Materials. This chapter does not apply to naturally
growing materials including, but not limited to, fruit, grain, nuts, seeds, and
vegetables.
   2.   Planted Materials. This chapter does not apply to planted materials
growing in gardens, as standing crops, or in a wildlife food plot.
   3.   Stored Crops. This chapter does not apply to stored crops, provided
that the stored crop is not intentionally made available to deer.
   4.   Incidental Spills. This chapter does not apply to spills of seed
materials intended for planting or to crop materials that have been harvested
if the spills are incidental to normal agricultural operations and such
materials are not intentionally made available to deer.
5-7C-4 PENALTY.
   Unless another penalty is expressly provided by this chapter for any
particular provision or section, any person violating any provision of this
chapter or any rule or regulation adopted herein by reference shall, upon
conviction, be subject to the standard penalty as stated in Section
1-4-1.

no emergency exists.
      D.   Unintentional Activation. Any system activation that did not
constitute an emergency; however, the system operated properly based on
conditions or human actions at that time. (Examples include smoke detector
activation from burned food, children activating a pull station, unintentional
security system activation with prompt follow up to the 911 call center, or
extraordinary violent conditions of nature.)
The burden of proving that such an alarm signal was not a false alarm shall be
on the alarm user.
   10.   “Monitoring” means the process by which an alarm company or its
designated alarm answering service receives signals from an alarm system and
relays an alarm dispatch request to the emergency dispatch center, or other
places as directed by the City, for the purpose of summoning police or fire
personnel to the building.
5-9-2 PURPOSE.
   It is the finding of the Council that false alarms seriously undermine the
morale and safety of Fire and Police Department personnel as well as
unnecessarily expose to danger the citizens of the City who encounter emergency
vehicles responding to false alarms, result in a waste of City resources, and
result in citizens ignoring alarm system signals. The purpose of this chapter
is to provide regulations applicable to alarm systems and to encourage the
effective use of alarm systems. The most significant desired result of this
chapter is to enhance public safety and more efficiently and safely use City
emergency response resources by reducing the number of false alarms received.
5-9-3 ENFORCEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION.
   1.   Grace Period After Installation of an Alarm System.
      A.   Upon the installation date of a new or replacement alarm system, a
grace period of 14 calendar days will be allowed for the alarm user and alarm
system operators to become familiar with the operations of the alarm system and
to make corrections to the operation of the alarm system. Service charges for
false alarms shall be waived during the grace period, provided the number of
false alarms during the grace period is not excessive. An excessive number of
false alarms is:
         (1)   Equal to three or more false alarms in one calendar day or 24-
hour period.
         (2)   Equal to six or more false alarms in the first 14 calendar days
since installation of the alarm system.
      B.   The appropriate Chief, or Chief’s designated representative, may
waive the service charge fee for an excessive number of false alarms during the
grace period, at their discretion, due to extenuating circumstances as
determined on a case-by-case review.
   2.   Excessive False Alarms; Service Charge Fees.
      A.   Because a false alarm for security, intrusion, robbery, and other
non-fire causes usually requires from one to three police officers to respond
in individual vehicular units, depending on the type of alarm, and a false
alarm for fire suppression or other firefighting incidents usually requires
multiple firefighters from the Fire Department to respond in multiple and
specialized firefighting equipment, depending on the type of alarm, the City
shall assess a service charge fee to any alarm user that generates an
unnecessary number of false alarm responses during a calendar year as listed
below (“false alarm fee”). The alarm user shall pay the City the assessed false
alarm fee within 20 days of the date an invoice is given to the alarm user for
any false alarm created by the alarm user’s alarm system in accordance with the
following schedule:
 
Alarm Fee Schedule
False Alarm Occurrence                                                  Rate
The first and second false alarms during a calendar year                $0.00
The third false alarm during a calendar year                            $75.00
The fourth false alarm during a calendar year                           $100.00
The fifth false alarm and each false alarm thereafter during a calendar $150.00
year
 
      B.   After the second false alarm, the alarm user shall receive a written
notice from the Chief. The notice shall require that by a specified date the
alarm user shall have their alarm system inspected by an alarm company and
alarm user shall review operational procedures with the alarm system operator
and any other individuals having access to the use and operation of the alarm
system. Notice or billing from the City to any alarm user shall be deemed to
have been given or rendered on the date such notice or billing is deposited in
the U.S. mail, first class postage, addressed to the alarm user at the address
shown for the alarm user. The alarm user shall notify the applicable Chief, in
writing, after the inspection by the alarm company has been completed, and
shall provide to the Chief a copy of any report of service, repair or
inspection of the alarm system given by the alarm company. An alarm company
providing an inspection or repair of an alarm system shall notify the Chief in
advance of such service. The alarm company shall be assessed a fee of $100.00
by the City when the Police Department or Fire Department respond to a false
alarm and it is determined by the City that an on-site employee of the alarm
company directly caused the false alarm. In such a circumstance, the false
alarm shall not count against the alarm user.
   3.   Appeal Process for False Alarm Service Charges. An alarm user assessed
a false alarm fee may appeal the false alarm fee in writing to the Alarm Review
Board. The filing of an appeal with the Alarm Review Board stays the assessment
of the false alarm fee until the Alarm Review Board makes a final decision.
      A.   The alarm user shall file a written appeal to the Alarm Review Board
by setting forth the reasons for the appeal within 10 days after receipt of the
false alarm fee invoice. The Alarm Review Board will review relevant
information, including conditions of nature for the date and time of the
occurrence of the false alarm. The Alarm Review Board may reverse the
assessment of the false alarm fee only if there was no false alarm or the false
alarm was not contributed to by the act(s) or omission(s) of the alarm user or
the alarm user’s family, pets, guests, employee(s), or invitees.
      B.   The Alarm Review Board shall notify the alarm user, the alarm
company, and the coordinator of its decision within five working days. The
decision of the Alarm Review Board is final as to administrative remedies of
the City.
5-9-4 NONLIABILITY OF CITY.
   The City shall not be liable for any defects in the operation of any alarm
system, for any failure or neglect to respond appropriately upon receipt of an
alarm from such a source, for any failure or neglect of any person in
connection with the installation, operation, disconnection, or removal of
equipment, the transmission of alarm signals, or the relaying of such signals
or messages.
5-9-5 PENALTY.
   Unless another penalty is expressly provided by this chapter for any
particular provision or section, any person violating any provision of this
chapter or any rule or regulation adopted herein by reference shall, upon
conviction, be subject to the standard penalty as stated in Section
1-4-1.

   1.   “Cleanup” means the removal of the hazardous substances to a place
where the waste will not cause any danger to persons or the environment, in
accordance with the State statutes, rules, and regulations therefor, or the
treatment of the material as defined herein to eliminate the hazardous
condition, including the restoration of the area to a general good appearance
without noticeable odor as far as practicable. “Cleanup” includes all actions
necessary to contain, collect, identify, analyze, treat, disperse, remove, or
dispose of a hazardous substance and to restore the site from which such
hazardous substance was cleaned up.
   2.   “Hazardous condition” means any situation involving the actual,
imminent, or probable spillage, leakage, or release of a hazardous substance:
      A.   Within the City or onto City property located outside the City
which, because of the quantity, strength, and toxicity of the hazardous
substance, its mobility in the environment and its persistence, creates an
immediate potential danger to the public health or safety; or
      B.   Onto land, into the waters within the State or into the atmosphere,
but outside the City, which, because of the quantity, strength, and toxicity of
the hazardous substance, its mobility in the environment and its persistence,
creates an immediate potential danger to the public health or safety of persons
or property within the City. “Hazardous condition” includes any accident
involving hazardous materials required to be reported under Section 321.266(4)
of the Code of Iowa.
   3.   “Hazardous substance” means any substance or mixture of substances that
presents a danger to the public health or safety or environment and includes,
but is not limited to, a substance that is toxic, corrosive, or flammable, or
that is an irritant or that, in confinement, generates pressure through

Act of 1976, or any toxic pollutant listed under Section 307 of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act of 1976 as amended to January 1, 1977, or any
hazardous substance designated under Section 311 of the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act as amended to January 1, 1977, or any hazardous material designated
by the Secretary of Transportation under the Hazardous Materials Transportation
Act, or any hazardous substance listed under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980.
   4.   “Responsible person” means the person, whether the owner, agent,
lessor, or tenant, in charge of the hazardous substance being stored,
processed, or handled, or the owner or bailee transporting hazardous wastes or
substances whether on public ways or grounds or on private property where the
spill would cause danger to the public or to any person or to the environment.
   5.   “Treatment” means a method, technique, or process, including
neutralization, designed to change the physical, chemical, or biological
character or composition of a hazardous substance so as to neutralize it or to
render the substance nonhazardous, safer for transport, amenable for recovery,
amenable for storage, or to reduce it in volume. “Treatment” includes any
activity or processing designed to change the physical form or chemical
composition of a hazardous substance to render it nonhazardous.
5-10-3 NOTIFICATIONS.
   When a hazardous condition is created, the responsible person shall notify
the Department of Natural Resources and the Fire Department immediately upon
discovery of the condition but in no instance later than 30 minutes after the
discovery of the hazardous condition. The Fire Chief, once notified of the
hazardous condition, shall immediately notify the Department of Natural
Resources.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.386)
5-10-4 CLEANUP REQUIRED.
   Whenever a hazardous condition is created by the deposit, injection,
dumping, spilling, leaking, or placing of a hazardous substance, so that the
hazardous substance, or a constituent of the hazardous substance, may enter the
environment or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters, including
ground waters, the Fire Chief or the Chief’s designee may remove or provide for
the removal and disposal of the hazardous substance at any time, unless the
Fire Chief or the Chief’s designee determines such removal will be properly and
promptly accomplished by the responsible person. If the responsible party does
not initiate and complete cleanup within the time designated by the Fire
Department, the City may proceed to remedy the hazardous condition by
performing the necessary cleanup services.
5-10-5 LOSS, BURDEN, OR COSTS.
   A responsible person shall be liable to the City for all cleanup costs
incurred by the City, including, but not limited to, fees payable by the City
to any public or private agency for assistance pursuant to any 28E Agreement,
local ordinance, or emergency request of the City, for chemical damage, for
contamination of equipment, and for the use of consumable materials, but shall
not be liable for those losses, burdens, or costs normally associated with
response to fire emergencies which do not involve hazardous conditions. If
charges for such cleanup costs are not paid within 30 days after invoice, the
City may proceed to obtain payment by all legal means. A public or private
agency providing assistance to the City pursuant to any 28E Agreement, local
ordinance, or emergency request of the City may directly bill the responsible
party for the fees for assistance provided in regard to cleanup of a hazardous
substance. The responsible party shall be responsible for the payment of such
fees to same extent as if the fees were billed by the City to the responsible
party.
5-10-6 PENALTY.
   Unless another penalty is expressly provided by this chapter for any
particular provision or section, any person violating any provision of this
chapter or any rule or regulation adopted herein by reference shall, upon

CHAPTER 11
ROADSIDE SOLICITATION
 
5-11-1 Purpose     5-11-3 Place of Roadside Solicitation
5-11-2 Definitions 5-11-4 Penalty
 
5-11-1 PURPOSE.
   1.   The Council does hereby find that:
      A.   It is the intent of the Council, by enacting this chapter, to
recognize free speech rights for all citizens while at the same time ensuring
the safety of all citizens on and along the public roadways within the City;
      B.   However, the Council finds that certain types of actions directed at
users of the public roadways in the City and conducted in specific areas within
the City pose an increased safety risk for pedestrians and users of public
roadways within the City, and
      C.   The Council finds that the presence of solicitors in certain
specific areas creates increased safety risks to pedestrians and users of
public roadways within the City, and
      D.   The Council further finds that certain forms of solicitation impede
the orderly flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic along and on the public
roadways within the City, and
      E.   This chapter is not intended to impermissibly limit an individual’s
right to exercise free speech with solicitation; rather it aims to impose
specific time, place, and manner restrictions on solicitation and associated
conduct in certain limited circumstances and in certain locations, and
      F.   In promulgating this chapter, the Council seeks to impose
regulations that are narrowly tailored to serve the aforementioned significant
government interests.
5-11-2 DEFINITIONS.
   No person shall commit harassment.
   1.   Hickman Road, University Avenue, and Ramp Terminal Zones. For the
purpose of this chapter, an area in the City and County comprised of the
following:
      A.   Ramp terminal zones are the off-ramp terminals located where
Interstate 35-80 exits to and intersects with Hickman Road, and where
Interstate 35-80 exits to and intersects with University Avenue, which would
include the entire off-ramp paved surface and the additional area consisting of
16 feet from the edge of the paved surface;
      B.   Hickman Road zone means the area in the City 150 feet east and west
of the ramp terminal zone (area where Interstate 35-80 intersects with Hickman
Road) which would include the entire paved surface of Hickman Road and the
additional area consisting of 16 feet from the edge of the paved surface; and
      C.   University Avenue zone means the area in the City 150 feet east and
west of the ramp terminal zone (area where Interstate 35-80 intersects with
University Avenue) which would include the entire paved surface of University
Avenue and the additional area consisting of 16 feet from the edge of the paved
surface.
   2.   “Person” means and includes both individual persons and organizations.
   3.   “Roadside Solicitation” means any communication made in person
requesting action or inaction by another person. For example, requesting an
immediate donation of money or other thing of value would constitute roadside
solicitation. Purchase of an item for an amount far exceeding its value, under
circumstances where a reasonable person would understand that the purchase is
in substance a donation, is a donation for the purpose of this chapter.
However, roadside solicitation does not include passively standing or sitting
with a sign or other indication that one is seeking donations or other action,
without addressing any request to any specific person other than in response to
an inquiry by that person, as long as said individual maintains the distance
set forth in the definition of Hickman Road, University Avenue, and ramp
terminal zones.
5-11-3 PLACE OF ROADSIDE SOLICITATION.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in roadside solicitation when
the person solicited is in any of the following places within the City limits:
   1.   In any vehicle on the street;
   2.   On public property in the “Hickman Road, University Avenue, and ramp
terminal zones,” as defined in Section
5-11-2 of this chapter.
5-11-4 PENALTY.
   Unless another penalty is expressly provided by this chapter for any
particular provision or section, any person violating any provision of this
chapter or any rule or regulation adopted herein by reference shall, upon
conviction, be subject to the standard penalty as stated in Section
1-4-1.

identities and addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders,
notice by one publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area
where the vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of
notice under Subsection 2 of this section. The published notice may contain
multiple listings of abandoned vehicles, but shall be published within the same
time requirements and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed
notice in Subsection 2 of this section.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3a])

whose title certificate is faulty, lost or destroyed, may dispose of such motor
vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without notification
procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more wheels or

6-9-7 PROCEEDS FROM SALES.
   Proceeds from the sale of any abandoned vehicle shall be applied to the
expense of auction, cost of towing, preserving, storing, and notification
required, in accordance with State law. Any balance shall be held for the owner
of the motor vehicle or entitled lien holder for 90 days, and then shall be
deposited in the state road use tax fund. Where the sale of any vehicle fails

for reimbursement from the department of transportation.

the abutting property owner shall not be required to remove diseased trees or
deadwood on the public parking. The public parking area shall be planted
entirely with: a) turf grass; b) approved vegetative ground cover; c) permitted
plantings, as planted and maintained at a height not to exceed 48 inches in an
area located within 36 inches of a single mailbox that is used for U.S. mail
delivery; or d) approved landscape materials or permitted plantings, as
authorized in a right-of-way landscaping permit approved by the Public Works

not: a) interfere with the ability of individuals to freely enter or exit their
vehicles from or onto the public parking; b) interfere with the ability of
motorists to see vehicles or pedestrians on the public right-of-way, including

shall maintain all grass areas or approved vegetative ground cover in the
public parking to a height or length not to exceed 10 inches, except as
otherwise specifically allowed in this section. In the event the City or any
public utility shall disturb the public parking for utilities or street work,
the City or public utility shall restore any turf grass area to a similar

pursuant to these provisions do so at their own risk and without any right,
title, or interest in the parking or in the free use and enjoyment of the
parking for the purpose allowed in this section. Abutting property owners
acting pursuant to this section should take notice of the fact that
installations in the parking will be subject to damage or destruction at any
time that the City or a person with a utility easement deems it necessary to
enter upon the parking for construction, maintenance, or any other purpose.

7-2-1 DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this chapter, the following terms are
defined:
   1.   “Bicycle/recreational trail” means a PCC, blacktop, or gravel bicycle/
recreational route developed primarily for outdoor recreational purposes.
Trails are largely designed for pedestrians and other users to “experience” the
outdoors and may be used by a variety of users, but they are not primarily
designed for transportation purposes.
   2.   “Property” means land situated in the City, whether or not improved
with buildings or other structures.
   3.   “Property owner” means a person who, alone or with another person or
other persons, holds the legal title to property; except, however, where
property has been sold on contract to a person who has the present right to
possess the property and the contract has been filed for record in the office
of the Polk County Recorder or the Dallas County Recorder, the person so
purchasing the property, whether alone or with another person or other persons,
is the “property owner” and not the person retaining bare legal title to the
property as security for the balance of the purchase price.
   4.   “Public sidewalk” means a portion of a street between the curb line, or
the lateral line of a roadway, and the adjacent property line or within
easements on private property that is paved or improved and intended for use by
pedestrians. In accordance with Section 12-5-9 of this Code, a public sidewalk
must be a minimum of four feet in width. A sidewalk’s primary purpose is to
provide pedestrians with connections to neighborhoods, shopping centers,
businesses, and other venues of interest.
   5.   “Shared use path” means a paved pathway, typically from eight to 12
feet in width, physically separated from motorized vehicular traffic within the
roadway right-of-way or within an easement adjacent to the roadway right-of-
way. Primarily used by pedestrians and bicyclists, shared use paths are also
used by joggers, skaters, wheelchair users (both nonmotorized and motorized). A
shared use path’s primary purpose is to provide pedestrians with connections to
trails, other neighborhoods, shopping centers, businesses, and other venues of
interest. In addition, the shared use path may be used for recreational
purposes.
   6.   “Trailhead” means an outdoor system developed to serve as an access
point to a bicycle/recreational trail which generally includes an area to park
vehicles and typically is a beginning or ending point of a bicycle/recreational
trail. The junction of two or more trails, where no other access point is
provided to the trails, is not a trailhead.
7-2-2 DUTY OF ABUTTING PROPERTY OWNERS.
   Every property owner is required to maintain, at their own expense, the
public sidewalk, shared use path, or public right-of-way on that length and
side of the public street or streets to which said property owner’s property
abuts in accordance with the City’s sidewalk/shared use path/public right-of-
way inspection and repair policy (“repair policy”) approved by the Council.
This obligation to maintain includes, without limitation, the duty to keep the
public sidewalk, shared use path, or public right-of-way open and in a safe
condition free of defects, debris, nuisances, obstructions, or any other
hazard, snow and ice, and other obstacles as required by this chapter, and in a
reasonable state of repair so as not to present a hazard to persons using the
public sidewalk, shared use path, or public right-of-way. Provided, however,
that this section shall not be construed to require a property owner to take
any action with respect to a public sidewalk, shared use path, or public right-
of-way when said action is made necessary by the excavation or other activity
of the City or a public utility. The abutting property owner may be liable for
damages caused by the failure to use reasonable care in the removal of snow or
ice from the sidewalks.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12(2)(c))
(Section 7-2-2 – Ord. 1155 – Feb. 25 Supp.)
7-2-3 PERFORMANCE BY CITY.
   If the property owner does not perform an action required by this chapter,
and more particularly set forth in the repair policy, within a reasonable time,
the Council may cause such required action to be performed and assess the costs
and expenses therefor against the abutting property for collection in the same
manner as property taxes. Provided, however, no such assessment shall be made
for the repair, reconstruction, or replacement of a public sidewalk unless the
City has served upon the person shown by the records of the Polk County Auditor
or the Dallas County Auditor to be the owner of the abutting property, by
certified mail, a notice requiring said person to repair, reconstruct, or
replace the public sidewalk within 45 days from the date said notice is mailed.
For a shared use path, the City shall perform the repair, reconstruction, or
replacement of the shared use path in accordance with the repair policy and the
property owner shall be responsible to pay to the City the cost of repairing,
reconstructing, or replacing that portion of the shared use path which is equal
in width to the minimum width of a sidewalk under this Code, as such amount is
reasonably determined by the City Engineer. The remaining cost of
reconstructing or replacing the shared use path shall be borne by the City.
(Code of Iowa, Secs. 364.12[2d and e])
7-2-4 RIGHT TO SPECIALLY ASSESS RESERVED.
   The City is not prevented by this chapter from paying for or recouping the
costs and expenses of repairing, reconstructing, or replacing the public
sidewalk, the portion of the public shared use path equal in width to the
minimum width of a sidewalk under this Code or the public parking by special
assessment where otherwise authorized by City ordinance and the laws of the
State.
7-2-5 SIDEWALK STANDARDS.
   Public sidewalks/shared use paths repaired, replaced, or constructed within
the City shall meet the standards for such construction adopted by resolution
of the Council.
7-2-6 REMOVAL OF SNOW AND ICE ACCUMULATIONS.
   The owner, lessee, occupant, or person in charge of property abutting
sidewalks and shared use paths shall remove snow and ice accumulations from
sidewalks and from a portion of shared use paths equal in width to the minimum
width of a sidewalk under this Code within 24 hours after a snowfall or the
deposit or formation of ice thereon.
7-2-7 AWNINGS.
   It is unlawful for a person to erect or maintain any awning over any
sidewalk or shared use path unless all parts of the awning are elevated at
least eight feet above the surface of the sidewalk or shared use path and the
roof or covering is made of duck, canvas, or other suitable material supported
by iron frames or brackets securely fastened to the building, without any posts
or other device that will obstruct the sidewalk or shared use path or hinder or
interfere with the free passage of pedestrians.
7-2-8 ENCROACHING STEPS.
   It is unlawful for a person to erect or maintain any stairs or steps to any
building upon any part of any sidewalk or shared use path without permission by
resolution of the Council.

   It is unlawful for a person to:
   1.   Stairs and Railings. Construct or build a stairway or passageway to any
cellar or basement by occupying any part of the sidewalk or shared use path, or
to enclose any portion of a sidewalk or shared use path with a railing without
permission by resolution of the Council.
   2.   Openings. Keep open any cellar door, grating, or cover to any vault on
any sidewalk or shared use path except while in actual use with adequate guards

7-2-13 MERCHANDISE DISPLAY.
   It is unlawful for a person to place upon or above any sidewalk or shared
use path, any goods or merchandise for sale or for display in such a manner as
to interfere with the free and uninterrupted passage of pedestrians on the
sidewalk or shared use path; in no case shall more than three feet of the
sidewalk next to the building be occupied for such purposes.
7-2-14 SALES STANDS.
   It is unlawful for a person to erect or keep any vending machine or stand
for the sale of fruit, vegetables, candy, soft drinks, or other substances or
commodities on any sidewalk or shared use path without first obtaining a
written permit from the Council.
7-2-15 EFFECT UPON OTHER LAWS.
   This chapter shall not be construed to allow any use of the public sidewalk,
shared use path, or the public parking that is otherwise prohibited by the laws
of the State or by other ordinances of the City or to lessen the duty of care
otherwise imposed upon property owners by the laws of the State.
7-2-16 PENALTY.
   Unless another penalty is expressly provided by this chapter for any
particular provision or section, any person violating any provision of this
chapter or any rule or regulation adopted herein by reference shall, upon

7-4-1 PURPOSE.
   The City’s right-of-way is held by the City primarily for the purpose of
pedestrian and vehicular passage and for the City’s provision of essential
public safety services, including police, fire, and emergency medical response
services, and public health services, including sanitary sewer, water, and
storm drainage. The purpose of this chapter is to provide standards for
mailboxes in order to maintain the safety and the visual character of the

color, it may interfere with, obstruct the view of, or be confused with any
authorized traffic control device.
7-4-4 CLUSTER STYLE MAILBOXES.
   1.   New Developments. All new residential or commercial developments
constructed after the enactment of the regulations contained in this chapter
(October 2, 2003) which are situated on any public cul-de-sac, street, avenue,

   The cost of installation, including, but not limited to, box units and
concrete pad, shall be borne by the developer, and subsequent maintenance shall
be carried out by the USPS.
   No driveway or street access shall be constructed within five feet of a
cluster style mailbox.
7-4-5 CURBSIDE MAILBOX REQUIREMENTS.
   While curbside mailboxes may be installed in developments constructed and

amount set by Council in a fee schedule. If the property owner performs the
replacement, reimbursement will not exceed the established cost for a standard
curbside mailbox and breakaway post. Property owner must submit an application
for a custom-built mailbox with the City prior to making any needed repairs.
7-4-7 RESPONSIBILITIES OF PROPERTY OWNER.

destruction, at any time, as a result of the City or a person with a utility
easement entering upon the City right-of-way to construct, repair, or maintain
the utilities located in the City right-of-way or as a result of the City
engaging in activities to maintain the public street or right-of-way, such as
snow removal, pavement repair, or street cleaning. If a curbside or cluster
style mailbox located in the City right-of-way is damaged during such
activities, the City or the utility that damaged the mailbox shall replace said
mailbox with a mailbox of the same design, if it has been approved for
installation by the USPS with the proper markings inscribed “U.S. Mail” and
“Approved By The Postmaster General,” and if it is still available for purchase
and complies with this chapter. Property owner may choose to be reimbursed in
full or have the City reinstall a new mailbox meeting stated requirements. If

7-5-1 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter, the following terms are defined:
   1.   “dbh” means a commonly used term referring to the diameter of a tree at
breast height (four and one-half feet).
   2.   “Park trees” means trees, shrubs, bushes, and all other woody
vegetation in public parks having individual names, and all areas owned by the
City, or to which the public has free access as a park.
   3.   “Parking” means that part of the street right-of-way in the City not
covered by sidewalk and lying between the lot line and the curb line; or, on

   4.   “Private trees” means trees, shrubs, bushes, and all other woody
vegetation on private property to which the City has no responsibility.
7-5-2 PLANTING RESTRICTIONS.
   No trees, shrubs, bushes, or woody vegetation shall be planted in any

stands, and public grounds, as may be necessary to ensure public safety or to
preserve or enhance the symmetry and beauty of such public grounds.
7-5-4 TREE TOPPING.
   It is unlawful as a normal practice for any person or City department to top
any street tree on public property. “Topping” is defined as the severe cutting
back of limbs to stubs within the tree’s crown to such a degree so as to remove
the normal canopy and disfigure the tree. Trees severely damaged by storms,
diseases, or other causes, or certain trees under utility wires or other
obstructions where other pruning practices are impractical may be exempted from
this chapter at the determination of the City.
7-5-5 DUTY TO TRIM.
   1.   Private Trees. Every owner of any tree overhanging any street or right-
of-way within the City shall prune the branches so that such branches do not
obstruct the light from any streetlamp or obstruct the view of any street
intersection and so that there is a clear space of eight feet above the surface
of the sidewalk and 15 feet above the traveled surface of the street. Said
owners shall remove all dead, diseased, or dangerous trees, or broken or
decayed limbs which constitute a menace to the safety of the public. The City
has the right to prune any tree or shrub on private property when it interferes
with the proper spread of light along the street from a streetlight, interferes
with the visibility of any traffic control device or sign, or violates the
terms of this subsection.
   2.   Trees in Parking. In the case of trees existing in the parking, the
owner or person in possession of the abutting property shall keep the trees on,
or overhanging the street, trimmed so that all branches will be at least 15
feet above the surface of the street and eight feet above the sidewalks.
7-5-6 CITY ABATEMENT; ASSESSMENT OF COST.
   If the abutting property owner or person in possession of the abutting
property fails to trim the trees as required in Subsection
7-5-5(2) of this chapter, the City may serve notice on the abutting property
owner requiring the property owner to do so within 30 days. If the property
owner fails to trim the trees within that time, the City may perform the
required action and assess the costs against the abutting property for
collection in the same manner as a property tax.
7-5-7 REMOVAL OF TREES AND STUMPS.
   1.   Dead or Diseased Tree Removal on Private Property. The owner or person
in possession of private property shall remove any trees constituting a hazard
to life or property, or trees harboring insects or disease which constitute a
potential threat to other trees within the City located on the private property
within the City. If the owner or person in possession fails to remove any such
tree, the City may serve notice on the property owner requiring the property
owner to do so within 30 days. If the property owner fails to remove any such
tree within that time, the City may perform the required action and assess the
costs against the abutting property for collection in the same manner as a
property tax.
   2.   Removal of Stumps. All stumps of park trees and trees in the parking
shall be removed below the surface of the ground so that the top of the stump
does not project above the surface of the ground, except trees in the Greenbelt
Park.
7-5-8 LANDSCAPE PLAN.
   1.   Submission of Plan; Required Information. In connection with the
submission of a site plan, site plan amendment, or preliminary plat for
approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Council, the applicant
shall submit a landscape plan, which must contain, at a minimum, the following
information:
      A.   The location of all existing trees four inches in diameter or
larger, when measured at the dbh, on public or private property, specifying the
size, species, and condition of such existing trees (any such existing trees to
be removed shall be noted);
      B.   The location of all new plant material to be planted on the
property, shown by size and species; and
      C.   A landscape plan filed in connection with a preliminary plat need
only show the outline of existing trees and foliage, clarifying the drip line
area of trees with the use of “clouded” areas of individual or clumping of
trees.
   2.   Preliminary Plat Evaluation; Considerations. In evaluating any
preliminary plat or site plan for approval, the Commission and the Council
shall consider the following issues addressed by the landscape plan:
      A.   Whether an excessive or unnecessary number of existing trees are to
be removed, taking into consideration the City’s goal of preserving existing
trees and any reasonable alternatives available to the developer;
      B.   All site plans in zoning districts shall be planted with a variety
of trees and shrubs which are substantial in size and number, and are in
accordance with the City’s policy on recommended trees;
      C.   Whether the applicant has provided for the replacement of existing
trees to be removed, at other locations on the property;
      D.   Whether the landscaping provides a visual buffer, where necessary,
from the surrounding property, including headlight screening for streets; and
      E.   Whether the streets, sidewalks, and lots are laid out in a manner to
preserve existing trees, where feasible, and whether the applicant has provided
for fencing off or protecting trees during construction, to the extent
feasible.
   3.   Protection of Existing Trees Not Being Removed. Any and all existing
trees which are not to be removed pursuant to the landscape plan shall be
clearly identified and, prior to the issuance of a grading permit, shall be
protected at the construction site by fencing located around the drip line of
the tree, where feasible, maximizing the protection of the root zone area of
the tree. The foregoing fencing requirements may be waived or modified by the
City if the trees to be saved are not located in an area where construction is
occurring.
   4.   Council Approval Before Permit Issuance. Prior to the issuance of any
grading permit or demolition permit for the development of any property that
will require site plan or plat approval, the applicant shall disclose to the
City whether any existing tree, four inches in diameter or larger, when
measured at the dbh, are to be removed. If any such trees are to be removed,
the City shall not issue a grading permit or demolition permit until a site
plan or preliminary plat has been approved by the Council. This is not to
include occupied single-family dwellings, duplexes, or townhouses. Prior to the
issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy, a new residential unit shall have, at a
minimum, two trees not less than one inch in diameter.
   5.   Illegal Tree Removal; Remedial Action. If any trees are removed in
violation of an approved site plan or plat, the owner or developer shall plant
three times such number of trees, of equal caliper, on such plat or site plan.
If it is impractical to replace such a tree with an equal caliper tree, then
several trees of a smaller caliper, totaling, in aggregate, the caliper of the
improperly removed tree, shall be required. The specific number and size of
such trees shall be determined by the City. For purposes of example only, if
one eight-inch caliper tree is improperly removed, the City may require: 1)
that three eight-inch caliper trees be planted; 2) that six four-inch caliper
trees be planted; or 3) that 12 two-inch caliper trees be planted. If it is
impractical to place all of such trees on that particular plat or site plan,
the City may require that some of the trees be planted on public property, such
as in a park.
   6.   Diseased or Damaged Plantings; Replacement. If any trees, vegetation,
or other landscape materials shown on an approved landscape plan shall become
diseased or substantially damaged at any time after the landscape plan is
approved, the owner of the property shall promptly replace such trees,
vegetation, or landscape material to bring the property in compliance with the
landscape plan.
7-5-9 PENALTY.
   Unless another penalty is expressly provided by this chapter for any
particular provision or section, any person violating any provision of this
chapter or any rule or regulation adopted herein by reference shall, upon
conviction, be subject to the standard penalty as stated in Section
1-4-1.

right-of-way in the conduct or promotion of the event, thereby creating an
anticipated significant impact to the City property or right-of-way, such as
increased vehicle or pedestrian traffic or the closure of a public street, and
it is advisable or necessary to include City staff in the preparation,
planning, coordination, and approval of the requested special event to promote
the health, safety, and welfare of the general public and of the event
participants or attendees.
7-7-3 DEFINITIONS.

timely applied for and issued by the City prior to the commencement of the
event. It shall be unlawful for any person or organization to engage, sponsor,

and obtained a permit in accordance with this chapter. Receiving approval of a
special event permit from the City shall not preclude, supersede, circumvent,
or waive the applicant’s responsibility to obtain any additional permits,
licenses, and approvals for other applicable local, State, and federal
regulations. The City reserves the right to impose special guidelines and
restrictions for any special event based upon the nature of the proposed event,

measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the Director of Public Works. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at
the owner’s expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and
accessible at all times.
8-2B-7 TESTING OF WASTES.
   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of “Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater,” published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from
24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are determined from periodic
grab samples.)

water service to any customer who has failed to pay the amounts due and owing
under this chapter and who has not contested the payment therefor in good
faith. All rates or charges due and owing under this chapter, if not paid as
provided in this chapter, shall constitute a lien upon the premises served by
any of the services mentioned herein and may be certified to the County
Treasurer and collected in the same manner as taxes.
8-2D-9 SPECIAL AGREEMENTS PERMITTED.
   No statement in this chapter shall be construed as preventing a special
agreement, arrangement, or contract between the Council and any industrial
concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be
accepted subject to special conditions, rates, and costs as established by the
Council; provided further, that such rates and agreement shall not be in
violation of any law, or any outside contract between the City and other
corporate entity.
8-2D-10 ANNUAL REVISION OF RATES.
   The City will review the sewer service charges at least yearly and revise
the sewer user charges as necessary to ensure that such charges as herein
established and specified generate adequate revenues to pay the costs of
maintenance and operation (including replacement and debt service) of a sewage
treatment plant and system and that the sewer user charge system continues to
provide for the proportional distribution of maintenance and operation costs
(including replacement costs and debt service) for a sewage treatment plant and
system among the users and user classes. The liability of a sanitary sewer user
to pay for charges as provided in this chapter shall not be contingent,
however, upon any such review or revision.
8-2D-11 USER NOTIFICATION.
   The City will notify each sanitary sewer user at least annually, in
conjunction with a regular bill for charges for sanitary sewer service as
provided in this chapter, of the rate being charged for operation and
maintenance (including replacement and debt service) of the sewage treatment
plant and system. The liability of the sanitary sewer user to pay for such
charges as set forth in this chapter shall not be contingent, however, upon
such notification.

8-3-3 GENERAL ADOPTION.
   The provisions of this chapter are enacted to aid in the enforcement of the
pretreatment regulations set forth in this chapter. The City, by enacting this
chapter designates the WRA and its operating contractor as the enforcement
agency under this chapter. Employees, agents, and officers of the WRA and of
its operating contractor, while acting to enforce this chapter for the WRA, are
empowered to make such inspections, issue such orders, or permits and take such
actions within the corporate boundaries of the City as are authorized by this
chapter. The WRA or its operating contractor is also authorized to impose and
collect all fees or penalties authorized by this chapter, and is authorized to
directly bill and collect from contributors penalties, fees, charges, and
surcharges from all users within the City. A user’s failure to pay any fee,
charge, penalty, or surcharge is a municipal infraction and shall also be
grounds to discontinue sewer service to the user, all as hereafter more
particularly provided. The enforcement of this chapter in the City is not
dependent upon passage of this chapter or a similar ordinance by other WRA
participating communities.
8-3-4 INTENT AND CONSTRUCTION.
   This chapter seeks to implement provisions of the Act, the general
pretreatment regulations found at 40 CFR, parts 403, and the Iowa
Administrative Code, Chapter 567, Sections 62.4 and 62.8. This chapter is to be
construed and applied in accordance with the Clean Water Act amendments, the
general pretreatment regulations, the Iowa Administrative Code and the purpose
and policy provision set forth in Section
8-3-3 of this chapter.
8-3-5 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   This chapter regulates the use of sanitary sewers; private wastewater
disposal; the installation and connection of building sewers; and the discharge
of wastewater or waste into the POTW, and the deposit of wastewater and waste
hauled to the WRF or to other locations approved by the WRA Director for
disposal and treatment. The objectives of this chapter are:
   1.   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that may
interfere with the operation of the system or interfere with sludge management
and disposal.
   2.   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that may pass
through the system inadequately treated and ultimately into receiving water,
the atmosphere, or otherwise be incompatible with the system.
   3.   To protect workers’ safety and health and protect against damage to the
POTW.
   4.   To provide for equitable distribution of treatment and industrial
pretreatment costs resulting from pollutants introduced into the POTW.
8-3-6 JURISDICTION.
   The sections of this chapter are applicable in their entirety to all users
who contribute wastewater, directly or indirectly, into the POTW without regard
to whether the physical facilities of such users are situated within or outside
the corporate limits of the City.
8-3-7 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of this chapter or the application thereof to any
particular person or particular circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
shall not affect other provisions or application of this chapter which can be
given effect without the invalid provision or application. To this end, the
provisions of this chapter are severable.
8-3-8 INTERPRETATION.
   This chapter shall be construed and interpreted to conform with 40 CFR I,
and it is the intent of this chapter that it comply with the federal
regulations.
8-3-9 USER REQUIREMENTS.
   1.   Specific Requirements. The following requirements shall apply to all
users of the POTW:
      A.   All users shall promptly notify the WRA Director in advance of any
substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge.
      B.   New or increased contributions of pollutants or changes in the
nature of pollutants discharged to the POTW shall require prior approval by the
WRA Director.
      C.   Industrial users shall notify the WRA Director, the Environmental
Protection Agency Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State
hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR 261. The notification shall comply with the requirements set forth in 40
CFR 403.12(p).
      D.   Discharge of any pollutants without the notice and approval required
by this section is prohibited. Upon the receipt of notice required by this
section, the WRA Director shall, within 180 days or less, approve the discharge
if they find the proposed discharge meets applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements and would not cause the WRA to violate its National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System permit. The WRA Director shall deny permission for
the discharge if they find applicable pretreatment standards and requirements
are not met or the discharge would cause a violation of the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System permit for the WRF.
   In lieu of denial of permission for discharge, the WRA Director may allow
such discharge or contribution upon conditions which would not violate
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements and would not cause a
violation of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit for the
WRF.
      E.   Food service establishments shall be regulated first under
Subsection 1(A) of this chapter, but may be required to obtain a wastewater
discharge permit and be subject to the requirements of this chapter if the WRA
Director determines that additional pretreatment is required in order to comply
with fat, oil, and grease discharge limits.
   2.   Permit. Any part of this section notwithstanding, upon receipt of the
notice required by this section, the WRA Director may require, in addition to
the requirements of this section, that an industrial user obtain a permit under
this chapter. Users who are determined to be industrial users as herein defined
and who refuse to apply for or obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall be
subject to termination of sewer services as provided in Section
8-3-38 of this chapter.
8-3-10 DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.

polishing waste, or tumbling and de-burring stones, and wastewater containing
fat, wax, O and G, or other substances which may solidify or become viscous at
temperatures between 32 degrees Fahrenheit and 150 degrees Fahrenheit (0°C and
65°C).
   4.   Any pollutant, including oxygen demanding pollutants (B.O.D., etc.)
released in a discharge at a flow rate or pollutant concentration which will
cause interference or pass-through at the WRF or which constitutes a slug load
as defined in this chapter.
   5.   Heat in amounts which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW
resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater or vapor having a
temperature higher than 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65°C) at the point of
introduction into the POTW, and in no case wastewater or vapor which alone or
in concert with other discharges produces a temperature at the WRF greater than
104 degrees Fahrenheit (40°C).
   6.   Petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral
oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass-through.
   7.   Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or

   12.   Hazardous waste pharmaceuticals for human or animal use as defined in
40 CFR 266.500.
8-3-11 LOCAL LIMITS FOR SPECIFIC POLLUTANTS.
   1.   Generally. Local limits for specific pollutants discharged pursuant to
this chapter shall be as follows:
      A.   Dilution. Dilution of the discharge from a pretreatment facility or
from a regulated process is prohibited as a method for treatment of wastes in
order to meet the limits set forth in this chapter.
      B.   Sample Location. Measurement of pollutant concentrations to
determine compliance shall be made at the point immediately following the
pretreatment facility and before mixture with other waters, unless another
point is designated by the WRA Director. If necessary, the concentrations so
measured shall be recomputed to exclude the effect of any dilution that is
improper using the combined waste stream formula.
   2.   Headworks Limits; Average Mass. The average composite loading of all
industrial users contributing the following specific pollutants to the POTW
shall not exceed the allowable total pounds. The allocation of pollutants

as may be required in order to:
      A.   Reduce the objectionable characteristics or constituents of
wastewater to within the maximum limits provided for in Sections
8-3-10,
8-3-11, and
8-3-12 of this chapter.
      B.   Control the quantities and rates of discharge of such wastewater.
      C.   Reduce the pollutants to such concentration and flows as may be
contained in the user's wastewater discharge permit.
      D.   Prevent the discharge of liquid waste containing FOG, sand in
excessive amounts, any flammable waste, or other harmful pollutants. All traps
or similar devices shall be of a type and capacity needed to perform
effectively and shall be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. All traps or devices shall be provided and maintained in efficient
operating condition at all times. Materials removed from traps shall be
considered unacceptable for disposal at the WRF unless specifically approved by
the WRA Director.
   2.   Review and Approval of Plans. All plans, specifications, technical
operating data, and other information pertinent to the proposed operation and
maintenance of pretreatment facilities shall be reviewed and approved by the
WRA Director prior to construction. Design and installation of such facilities
shall be subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, chapters, and
laws, including local zoning regulations. The review and approval of such plans
and operating procedures shall, in no way, relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent
acceptable to the WRA Director under this chapter. Any subsequent changes in
the pretreatment facilities or method of operations shall be reported to and be
acceptable to the WRA Director prior to the user’s initiation of the changes.
   3.   Maintenance of Facilities. Users shall continuously maintain all
pretreatment facilities required by this chapter in satisfactory and effective
operating condition at the sole expense of such user.
   4.   Special Agreements. No section contained in this chapter shall be
construed to prevent or prohibit a separate or special agreement between the
WRA and any user whereby wastewater containing waste of unusual strength,
character, or composition may be accepted for treatment, subject to additional
payment by such user; provided, however, that such agreement shall have the
prior approval of the WRA Board, shall not conflict with the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requirements, and
shall be consistent with Subsection
8-3-11(B) and Sections
8-3-12 and
8-3-13 of this chapter, and Subsection 6 of this section.
   5.   Rejection of Waste. The WRA Director may reject any waste which, in the
opinion of the Director, may cause interference or pass-through.
   6.   Waste Discharge Approval Required. Users shall obtain the specific
approval of the WRA Director prior to discharging any waste resulting from a
pretreatment facility to the POTW.
   The WRA Director may develop a documentation system to track the
transportation and final disposition of any pretreatment waste. Pretreatment
waste regulated by this subsection shall include waste generated as a result of
pretreatment processes used to comply with National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System permits, air pollution permits, wastewater discharge
permits, soil/groundwater reclamation processes, and pollutants resulting from
a spill of any liquid or solid material or the cleanup of any such spill.
Pretreatment waste is prohibited from disposal to the waters of the State
except as specifically permitted by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.
8-3-16 DILUTION PROHIBITED.
   Users shall not increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt to
dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
pretreatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards, or with any other pollutant-
specific limitation developed by the WRA or its operating contractor.
8-3-17 SPILL CONTAINMENT.
   1.   Prevention of Accidental Discharge. Users having the ability to cause
interference or pass-through or to discharge a slug shall provide protection
from accidental discharge to the POTW of prohibited materials or other
substances regulated by this chapter. Facilities to prevent accidental
discharge of prohibited materials shall be constructed, installed, operated,
and maintained at the user’s sole cost and expense.
   2.   Containment Plan. Users meeting the criteria in Subsection 1 of this
section shall develop a spill containment plan. The plan shall require the
approval of the WRA Director and shall contain the following:
      A.   A description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges.
      B.   A description of stored chemicals.
      C.   Procedures for immediately notifying the WRA of slug discharges,
including any that would violate the discharge prohibitions in Section
8-3-10 of this chapter. Notification procedures shall comply with Subsections 3
and 4 of this section.
      D.   A description of procedures and structures necessary to prevent
adverse impacts upon the POTW from accidental spills including inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling, and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants including solvents, or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
      E.   A schedule for the completion or implementation of necessary
procedures and structures. Complete implementation and installation of any
procedures or structures shall be according to the shortest possible schedule,
but in no case longer than one year. Review and approval of such plans and
operating procedures shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to
modify and operate its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this
chapter.
   3.   Notify WRA of Illegal Discharge. Users shall immediately telephone and
notify the WRA of any accidental or deliberate discharge of pollutants which
violatesSection
8-3-10 of this chapter or which is a slug load. Any discharge into the POTW of
a substance which is a listed or characteristic waste under Section 3001 of
RCRA must be immediately reported to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
Regional Director, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, and the WRA.
   Notifications required in this subsection shall include the name of caller,
location, and time of discharge, pollutant concentration, volume, and the
corrective actions taken.
   4.   Report Required. Users shall submit a written report to the WRA
Director within five days following such an accidental or deliberate discharge
describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user
to prevent similar future occurrences. Users shall submit follow-up reports as
may be required by the WRA Director. Such report shall not relieve the user of
any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result
of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property,
nor shall such report relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other
liability which may be imposed by this chapter or otherwise. Failure to report
accidental or deliberate discharges may, in addition to any other remedies
available to the City, result in the revocation of the discharger’s wastewater
discharge permit.
   5.   Users to Control Production. Users shall control production of all
discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with all applicable
regulations upon reduction, loss, or failure of its pretreatment facility until
the facility is restored or an alternative method of pretreatment is provided.
This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the
primary source of power to the user’s pretreatment facility is reduced, lost,
or fails.
   6.   Posting Emergency Notification Procedures. Users required to have a
spill containment plan must permanently post a notice in English and the
language of common use on the user’s bulletin board or other prominent place
advising employees whom to call if a prohibited discharge occurs. Users shall
ensure that all employees who are in a position to cause, discover, or observe
such an accidental discharge are advised of the emergency notification
procedures.
8-3-18 TREATMENT UPSETS.
   Users shall inform the WRA Director within one hour of becoming aware of an
upset in operations that places it in a temporary state of noncompliance with
the pollutant limits in this chapter. Users shall provide a follow-up written
report to the WRA Director within five days. The report must demonstrate that
the pretreatment facility was being operated in a prudent and appropriate
manner and shall contain:
   1.   A description of the upset, its cause, and impact on the user’s
compliance status.
   2.   The duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance, and, if the noncompliance is continuing, the time by which
compliance is reasonably expected to be restored.

blowdown).
   2.   Class B permit issued to a user discharging less than 25,000 gallons
per day of process wastewater.
8-3-22 PERMIT REQUIREMENTS GENERALLY.
   1.   All new industrial users shall notify the WRA Director of the nature
and characteristics of their proposed discharge 180 days prior to commencing
discharge. A notification form prescribed by the WRA shall be used for this
purpose.
   2.   Significant users shall discharge wastewater, either directly or
indirectly, into the POTW only after obtaining a wastewater discharge permit
from the WRA Director. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve
a user of the obligation to obtain other permits required by federal, State, or
local law.
   3.   Other users, including waste haulers, shall obtain permits as required
by the WRA Director.
8-3-23 PERMIT APPLICATIONS; BASELINE MONITORING REPORTS; COMPLIANCE SCHEDULES.

as required by 40 CFR 403.12 or by the WRA Director:
   1.   Users applying for a wastewater discharge permit must submit an
application form prescribed by the WRA and accompanied by the application fee.
All new significant users must submit such application 180 days prior to the
date of any wastewater discharge.
   2.   Existing users subject to new National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards must, within 180 days after the effective date of the standard,
submit a baseline monitoring report prescribed by the WRA.
   New users subject to National Categorical Pretreatment Standards must submit
a baseline monitoring report prescribed by the WRA at least 90 days prior to
commencement of discharge to the POTW. A baseline monitoring report shall
include:
      A.   Name, address, and location of the facility, if different from the
mailing address.
      B.   Name of the operator and owners of the facility.
      C.   A list of all environmental control permits held by or for the
facility.
      D.   A description of the operations including the average rate of

schematic process diagrams, and points of discharge to the POTW from regulated
processes.
      E.   Daily average and daily maximum flow measurements for regulated
process waste streams and nonregulated waste streams where necessary.
      F.   The categorical user shall identify the pretreatment standards
applicable to each regulated process and shall submit the results of sampling
and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required)
of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable
pretreatment standards from each regulated process.
      G.   The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample
immediately downstream of any pretreatment facility or immediately downstream
of each regulated process if no pretreatment exists and prior to mixing with
other waste to compile that data necessary to comply with this requirement. If
non-regulated wastewater is mixed with regulated wastewater prior to
pretreatment, the user must measure the flows and concentrations necessary to
allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to
evaluate compliance with pretreatment standards. Where an alternate
concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6
(e), this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the
WRA Director. Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with 40
CFR 136 or other verified method approved by the WRA Director.
      H.   The time, date, and place of sampling, methods of analysis, and
certification that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work
cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW.
      I.   Historical data may be allowed by the WRA Director so long as the
data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial
pretreatment measures.
      J.   Certification by an authorized representative of the user as
referenced in Section
8-3-27 and certified to by a qualified professional indicating whether
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether
additional operation and maintenance or additional pretreatment is required for
the user to meet pretreatment standards and requirements.
      K.   If additional pretreatment or O and M will be required to meet
pretreatment standards, requirements, discharge limits as set forth in Sections
8-3-10,
8-3-11,
8-3-12 of this chapter, or any other limit set by the WRA Director, the user
shall supply a compliance schedule indicating the shortest time schedule
necessary to accomplish installation or adoption of such additional
pretreatment or O and M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be
later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment
standard. The following conditions apply to this schedule:
         (1)   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards. Such schedule shall include, where
applicable, but shall not be limited to, dates for the hiring of an engineer,
completing preliminary plans, executing contracts for major components,
commencing construction, beginning operation, and conducting routine
operations.
         (2)   No increment referred to in Subsection (K)(1) of this section
shall exceed nine months, nor shall the total compliance period exceed 18
months.
         (3)   No later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and
the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the
WRA Director, including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and the steps being taken by
the user to return to the established schedule. In no event shall more than
nine months elapse between such progress reports to the WRA Director.
      L.   A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total
phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other
pollutants required, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-
proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The WRA Director may
waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any user who demonstrates that
flow-proportional sampling is not feasible. In such cases, samples may be
obtained through time-proportional techniques or through a minimum of four grab
samples where the user demonstrates that such sampling will provide a
representative sample of the effluent being discharged.
         (1)   New significant users not subject to categorical standards shall
submit analysis of wastewater representative of the effluent discharged to the
POTW as required in Subsections (2)(G-I) of this section for all parameters
deemed necessary by the WRA Director.
         (2)   New or existing industrial users not subject to categorical
pretreatment standards who fail to meet local, State, or federal pretreatment
standards or other permit requirements on a consistent basis shall be subject
to compliance schedules for additional pretreatment or O and M as outlined in
Subsection (2)(K) of this section.
   3.   Certification. All applications and reports must contain the
certification statement and be signed in accordance withSection
8-3-27 of this chapter.

of January and July, a report indicating the nature, concentration, and flow of
pollutants in the effluent which are limited by permit or pretreatment
standards for the preceding six- month period. This report shall include a
record of the monthly average flows and the daily flow for each analysis date
during the reporting period. At the discretion of the WRA Director and in
consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget
cycles, etc., the WRA Director may agree to alter the months during which the
reports are to be submitted. More frequent reports may be required by the WRA
Director.
   2.   The WRA Director may impose mass limitations on users. In such cases,
the report required by Subsection 1 of this section shall indicate the mass of
pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. All
analyses shall be performed using Environmental Protection Agency approved
methods using sampling techniques approved by the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources.
   3.   Users shall meet the certification and signatory requirements in
Section
8-3-27 of this chapter for each report submitted under this section. Where the
WRA itself collects all the information required for the report, including flow
data, the industrial user will not be required to submit a periodic compliance
report.
   4.   A user must notify the WRA Director of all violations identified as a
result of self-monitoring to the POTW by telephone, during normal business
hours, within 24 hours of the time the user becomes aware of such violation.
The user must also submit the results of repeat analyses to the WRA within 30
days after becoming aware of the violation, together with a complete report on
all steps taken to resolve the violation. The user need not repeat the analyses
if:
      A.   The WRA performs sampling of the industrial user at a frequency of
at least once per month; or
      B.   The WRA performs sampling of the user between the time when the user
performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results
of this sampling.
   5.   A user who monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the
WRA or who self-monitors in addition to WRA monitoring, using Environmental
Protection Agency methods or standard methods, shall report the monitoring
results to the WRA Director in accordance with Subsections 1, 2, and 4 of this
section.
8-3-27 CERTIFICATION AND SIGNATORY REQUIREMENTS.
   1.   All applications or reports submitted by a user pursuant to this
chapter shall contain the following certification statement:
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were

information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations.
   2.   All applications and reports shall be signed by an authorized
representative of the “user” as defined herein. A user shall maintain a current
and accurate authorization on file with the WRA Director.
8-3-28 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   1.   Facilities Required. When required by the WRA Director pursuant to this
chapter, each permitted user shall, at its expense, provide and operate
monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of
the building sewer or internal drainage systems. The WRA Director may require
the placement of such monitoring facilities at the end of each process where
pollutants are used, produced, or treated. The monitoring facility should
normally be situated on the user’s premises and located so that it will not be
obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
   2.   Sampling Requirements. When required by the wastewater discharge permit
and within 90 days of written notification, a user shall install a sampling
chamber for each separate discharge of the building sewer in accordance with
plans and specification approved by the WRA Director. A user shall provide
ample room in or near such sampling chamber to allow accurate sampling and
preparation of samples for analysis. Each user shall, at its expense, maintain
all sampling and measuring equipment in a safe and proper operating condition
at all times, which equipment shall be safely, easily, and independently
accessible to authorized representatives of the WRA.
   Users shall certify all flow measuring devices to be in proper working
condition at a frequency specified in the permit or in writing by the WRA
Director, using a qualified technician acceptable to the WRA Director. Sampling
shall be in accordance with the following:
      A.   Each sampling chamber shall contain a flume unless another device is
approved by the WRA Director, with a recording and totalizing device for
measurement of the liquid quantity.
      B.   At the discretion of the WRA Director, metered water supply to a
user may be used as the volume quantity where it is substantiated that the
metered water supply and waste quantities are approximately the same, or where
a measurable adjustment agreed to by the Director is made in the metered water
supply to determine the liquid waste quantity. Separate meters may be used to
subtract water which is not discharged to the POTW or is discharged to a sewer
other than the sampled location.
      C.   Samples shall be taken at a frequency and volume determined by the
WRA Director and shall be properly refrigerated and preserved in accordance
with Environmental Protection Agency approved methods. The sample shall be
composited in proportion to the flow for a representative 24-hour sample. A
time proportioned 24-hour sample may be used if flow proportioned sampling is
determined by the WRA Director to be impractical. Grab samples shall be used
where appropriate.
   3.   Breaking Sampler Seal; Notify Director. A user must inform the WRA
Director prior to breaking a sampler seal, used by the WRA to detect sample
tampering, unless necessary to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe
property damage. A user shall not place additional seals or locks upon a
sampler which may be used by the WRA without first obtaining approval from the
WRA Director.
8-3-29 INSPECTION, SAMPLING, AND RECORD KEEPING AUTHORITY.
   Under this chapter, users shall give the following authorities to the WRA
and its operating contractor:
   1.   Right of Entry. Users shall permit authorized representatives or agents
of the WRA to enter upon all properties and all parts of the premises, or upon
properties of users with wastewater discharge permits for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination, records copying, or the performance
of any of their duties. This shall include the right to set up, on the user’s
property, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection,
compliance monitoring, or metering operations as may be required in pursuance
of the implementation and enforcement of this chapter.
   2.   Security Measures. Where a user has security measures in force which
would require proper identification and clearance before entry into the
premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements in the security measures
so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, WRA or operating
contractor personnel will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the
purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.
   3.   Records Retention. All users subject to any of the reporting
requirements of this chapter shall maintain copies of reports and records of
all information as required in 40 CFR 403.12(o) resulting from any monitoring
activities required by this chapter for a minimum of three years and shall make
such records available for inspection and copying by the WRA and its operating
contractor. This period of retention shall be extended until the completion of
any unresolved negotiation, hearing, or litigation involving a purported
violation.
8-3-30 CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENTS, DATA, AND INFORMATION.
   1.   Except as provided in this section, documents, data, and information
obtained from user reports, questionnaires, permit applications, and
inspections pursuant to this chapter shall be made available to the public or
other government agencies without restriction. If the user specifically
requests and is able to demonstrate that the release of such information would
divulge information concerning processes or methods of production entitled to
protection under law as trade secrets of the user or would give the advantage
to competitors and serve no public purpose, the WRA Director may determine that
such information should be kept confidential and not made available for public
examination, but such information shall be available to the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency or the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.
   2.   Decisions by the WRA Director to deny confidential status for
information may be appealed using the procedures in Section
8-3-31 of this chapter. In determining whether information is confidential, the
provisions of Chapter 22 of the Code of Iowa shall prevail.
   3.   Effluent data and enforcement actions by the WRA or its operating
contractor will not be considered confidential records or information.
8-3-31 APPEAL OF DENIAL OF CONFIDENTIAL STATUS.
   1.   Any person aggrieved by the WRA Director’s decision to release
information or data obtained as provided in Subsection
8-3-30(1) of this chapter and who can demonstrate a direct and substantial
interest in the information or data sought to be kept confidential may appeal
the WRA Director’s decision. A request for appeal shall be filed in writing
with the WRA Director not less than five days after the WRA Director’s decision
to deny confidential status to such information or data. The appeal request
shall include a statement of the basis upon which the request for confidential
status is made, as well as the appealing party’s interest in the information or
data sought to be kept confidential. The WRA Director may request additional
information from the appealing party.
   2.   Based upon the information provided by the appealing party, the WRA
Director shall make a determination with respect to the confidentiality of the
information or data at issue. The WRA Director shall notify the parties, in
writing, of the WRA Director’s decision within seven days after receipt of the
appeal.
   3.   If still aggrieved by the WRA Director’s determination on appeal, a
party may file an action in County District Court, seeking a declaratory ruling
with respect to the confidentiality of such documents, data, and information,
or seeking an injunction to prevent the disclosure of same.
   4.   During the pendency of an appeal to the WRA Director, the documents,
data, or information at issue shall be kept confidential. However, if during
the pendency of such appeal, a request for examination or copying of such
documents, data, or information is made of the WRA or its operating contractor
pursuant to Chapter 22 of the Code of Iowa, the WRA or its operating contractor
will notify the appealing party of such request for disclosure and will keep
confidential the requested documents, data, or information, pending action by
the appealing party to defend its confidentiality request. In that
notification, the appealing party requesting confidentiality will be given not
more than five calendar days within which to file suit in County District Court
seeking the entry of a declaratory order or injunction to protect and keep
confidential such documents, data, or information. If the appealing party fails
to initiate suit within the time requested, the WRA Director shall release the
documents, data, or informational issue for public examination.
   5.   If during the pendency of such appeal, a lawsuit is initiated, pursuant
to Chapter 22 of the Code of Iowa, seeking the release of such documents, data,
or information, the appealing party shall take action to defend its
confidentiality request in said lawsuit. If the appealing party fails to defend
its confidentiality request in said suit, the WRA Director shall release the
documents, data, or information at issue for public examination.
8-3-32 PUBLIC NOTIFICATION OF SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   The WRA will annually publish, in the largest daily newspaper published in
the WRA community, a list of users who at any time during the previous 12
months were in significant noncompliance as defined in Section
8-3-33 of this chapter.
8-3-33 SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   1.   Instances of Noncompliance. Any violation of pretreatment requirements
under this chapter (i.e., including, but not limited to, those relating to
limits, sampling, analyses, reporting, meeting compliance schedules, and
regulatory deadlines) is an instance of noncompliance for which the user is
liable for enforcement, including penalties and injunctive relief. Instances of
significant noncompliance are user violations which meet one or more of the
following criteria:
      A.   Violations of wastewater discharge limits as follows:
         (1)   Chronic Violations. Sixty-six percent or more of the
measurements exceed the same daily maximum limit or the same average limit in a
six-month period (any magnitude of exceedance).
         (2)   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) Violations. Thirty-three percent
or more of the measurements exceed the same daily maximum limit or the same
average limit by more than the TRC in a six-month period (e.g., limit x TRC =
the point at which a violation becomes a TRC violation). There are two groups
of TRCs as follow:
            Group I for conventional pollutants (BOD, TSS, FOG) TRC = 1.4
            Group II for all other pollutants TRC = 1.2
         (3)   Other Violations. Any other violation of a wastewater discharge
permit limit (average or daily maximum) that the WRA Director believes has
caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference, including
slug loads, or pass-through or which endangers the health of City, WRA, or
operating contractor personnel or the public.
         (4)   Pollutant Causing Danger to Humans or Environment. Any discharge
of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to human health/welfare or
to the environment and has resulted in the WRA’s exercise of its emergency
authority to halt or prevent such a discharge.
      B.   Violations of compliance schedule milestones, contained in a
wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order, for starting construction,
completing construction, or attaining final compliance by 90 days or more after
the schedule date.
      C.   Failure to provide reports for compliance schedules, self-
monitoring data, or any other report required by the WRA within 45 days from
the due date.
      D.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance.
      E.   Any other violation or group of violations, which may include a
violation of Best Management Practices that the WRA Director considers to be
significant.
   2.   Duties of the Director. When a user is in significant noncompliance,
the WRA Director is directed to:
      A.   Report the information to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources
as part of the annual pretreatment performance summary of permitted user
noncompliance.
      B.   Include the user in the annual public notification according
toSection
8-3-32 of this chapter.
      C.   Address significant noncompliance through appropriate enforcement
actions or document in a timely manner the reasons for withholding enforcement.
8-3-34 ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS.
   1.   Notice of Violation. The WRA Director may issue a written notice to the
user giving the specific nature of violations which shall include the
frequency, magnitude, and impact of the violation upon the POTW.
   The notice may also include the following:
      A.   An order requiring a plan of action for preventing reoccurrence of
the violation.
      B.   An order requiring specific action for accomplishing remediation.
      C.   An order requiring the user to respond in writing within 30 days.
   2.   Corrective Action. The WRA Director is empowered to enter into consent
orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with the user responsible for any noncompliance. Such
orders will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct
noncompliance within a time period specified by the order.
   3.   Compliance Schedule. The WRA Director may issue enforceable orders or
schedules to require compliance with pretreatment standards including
appropriate interim limits. Such orders and schedules may be incorporated as a
revision to an existing wastewater discharge permit and shall not require the
consent of the user.
8-3-35 ACTIONS AUTHORIZED.
   1.   Where there has been noncompliance with any section of this chapter,
the WRA Director may request the WRA operating contractor’s attorney, or the
attorney retained by the WRA for that purpose, to bring an action in equity or
at law to seek the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction, or both,
or such other relief as may be appropriate, to compel the user’s compliance
with this chapter.
   2.   In addition to other remedies provided under this section or other
sections of this chapter, in any action brought at the request of the WRA
Director to enforce this chapter, the WRA operating contractor’s attorney or
the attorney retained by the WRA is authorized to seek to recover all actual
damages suffered by the City or the WRA, including all actual damages and
losses related to costs of repair and remediation of the POTW, costs of
investigation, and administration reasonably related to any particular
violation and attorneys’ fees.
8-3-36 CIVIL PENALTIES.
   1.   Each violation of any section of this chapter or of a permit issued
under this chapter is declared to be a municipal infraction. Each day that a
violation of a section of this chapter continues, and each day that a violation
of a permit issued under this chapter continues, shall be considered a separate
municipal infraction.
   2.   Any person who knowingly makes a false statement, representation, or
certification in any application, record, report, plan, or other document filed
or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter or a wastewater discharge
permit, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any
monitoring device or method required under this chapter, commits a municipal
infraction punishable by a civil penalty as hereafter provided by Subsection 4
of this section.
   3.   Any person who fails to perform an act required by the provisions of
this chapter, or who commits an act prohibited by the provisions of this
chapter, commits an environmental violation and shall be guilty of a municipal
infraction, punishable by a civil penalty as provided by Subsection 4 of this
section. Violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement referred to in 40
CFR 403.8 is an environmental violation punishable by a civil penalty as
hereafter provided in Subsection 4 of this section.
   4.   Whenever in this chapter, any act is prohibited and is declared to be a
municipal infraction, or, whenever in this chapter, the doing of any act is
required and the failure to do that act is declared to be a municipal
infraction, the violation of any such provision shall be punishable by a civil
penalty of not more than $500.00 for each violation or, if the infraction is a
repeat offense, by a civil penalty of not more than $750.00 for each repeat
offense. However, a municipal infraction which is classified as an
environmental violation or which arises from noncompliance with a pretreatment
standard or requirement, referred to in 40 CFR 403.8, by an industrial user may
be punishable by a civil penalty of not more than $1,000.00 for each day a
violation exists or continues. Each day a violation of a provision of this

8-3-37 PERFORMANCE AND PAYMENT BONDS.
   1.   The WRA Director may decline to reissue a permit to any user who has
failed to comply with this chapter or any order or previous permit issued under
this chapter unless such user first files a satisfactory bond payable to the
WRA in a sum not to exceed the value determined by the WRA Director to be
necessary to achieve compliance giving due consideration to the number and
magnitude of previous violations, potential need for remediation, and stating
the reasons which support the amount of bond in a written order directed to the
user, but in no case shall the bond be required to be greater than $100,000.00.
The user shall use a bond form prescribed by the WRA.
   2.   The WRA Director may require any user, including any permitted or non-
permitted waste generator which sends its wastewater by truck to the WRF, to
obtain a bond payable to the WRA with reasonable surety in a penal sum which
will adequately cover treatment costs, surcharges, fees, or any other charges
associated with discharge of wastewater to the POTW in the amount as listed in
Section 8-3B-2. The user shall use a bond form prescribed by the WRA.
8-3-38 REVOCATION OF DISCHARGE PERMIT; TERMINATION OF SEWER SERVICE.
   1.   Grounds for Revocation of Discharge Permit or for Termination of Sewer
Service. Any user who violates this chapter, any condition of its wastewater
discharge permit, or any of the following is subject to having its discharge
permit revoked or its sewer service terminated in accordance with the
procedures of this section:
      A.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge.

not addressed elsewhere in this chapter.
   2.   Procedure for Revocation of Discharge Permit and for Termination of
Sewer Service. The procedure for revocation of a discharge permit and
termination of sewer service shall be as follows:
      A.   Any permit issued to a user pursuant to this chapter may be revoked,
and sewer service terminated, by written order of the WRA Director, specifying
the grounds for such revocation and termination as outlined in Subsection 1 of
this section, which order shall not take effect until hearing thereon as
hereafter provided. Upon determining that grounds exist for an order to revoke
a user’s discharge permit and terminate sewer service, the WRA Director shall
cause a notice of hearing to be prepared, specifying the violations of
Subsection 1 of this section which are deemed to have occurred, and the time,
date, and place that such hearing will be held. The notice shall be sent to the
user by regular mail addressed to the user’s address listed on the wastewater
discharge permit a minimum of 10 days prior to the date set for hearing, and
shall be deemed delivered when placed in the mail.
      B.   Sewer service may be terminated by written order of the WRA
Director, specifying the grounds for such revocation and termination as
outlined in Subsection 1 of this section, which order shall not take effect
until hearing thereon as hereafter provided. Upon determining that grounds
exist for an order to terminate sewer service, the WRA Director shall cause a
notice of hearing to be prepared, specifying the violation of Subsection 1 of
this section which is deemed to have occurred, and the time, date, and place
that such hearing will be held. The notice shall be sent to the user by regular
mail addressed to the user’s address a minimum of 10 days prior to the date set
for hearing, and shall be deemed delivered when placed in the mail.
      C.   If, after such a hearing, the WRA Director makes a finding based on
substantial evidence that violations under Subsection 1 of this section have
occurred as alleged, the Director may issue an order immediately revoking the
permit, if a permit had previously been issued, and terminating sewer service
to the user’s premises. The determination to revoke such permit and terminate
service, shall be in the discretion of WRA Director and shall be dependent upon
the circumstances surrounding the user’s violations of Subsection 1 of this
section and the severity of those violations. If the user does not appear for
the hearing, the WRA Director shall issue the order revoking the discharge
permit or terminating sewer service, which shall take effect immediately.
      D.   The decision and order of the WRA Director to revoke the permit of a
user may be appealed to the WRA Appeal Committee. Such appeal request shall be
in writing, shall include the grounds for appeal including any factual findings
which are disputed, and shall be delivered to WRA not less than 10 days after
the Director’s entry of the order of revocation of permit or termination of
sewer service. Such appeal request shall be considered delivered when placed in
the mail, return receipt requested, addressed to:
         WRA Appeal Committee
         c/o Des Moines Metropolitan Wastewater Reclamation Authority
         3000 Vandalia Road
         Des Moines, Iowa 50317
      E.   The Chair of the Appeal Committee shall schedule the appeal and
shall cause notice of the time, date, and place of the hearing to be mailed to
the appealing user. Such appeal shall be decided by majority vote of the Appeal
Committee. If the Appeal Committee affirms the order of the WRA Director
revoking the permit or terminating sewer service, the Appeal Committee shall so
state and order in its written decision.
      F.   A user whose permit has been revoked shall not be eligible for
another permit until 30 days after the violating conditions have been corrected
to the satisfaction of the WRA Director.
      G.   Upon determination by the WRA director that the user’s sewer service
connection to the POTW be terminated, the Director’s written order shall be
sent to the Public Works Department who shall cause the user’s connection to
the sewer to be severed or plugged. The manner of severance and procedure for
disconnection shall be determined by the Public Works Department. Upon
completion of the disconnection, the Public Works Department shall certify to
the WRA Director the City’s cost to disconnect the user’s sewer service. Upon
receipt of such certification of costs, the WRA Director shall forward to the
user whose service was disconnected by registered mail return receipt
requested, certified mail, or personal service, a bill for the cost of making
the disconnection, including all costs for labor and materials, and a service
charge of $500.00 for WRA supervision.
      H.   Any building at which sewer service is disconnected as herein
provided shall be inspected by the City Building Official and, if appropriate,
shall be red-tagged as unfit for human occupancy.
8-3-39 REINSTATEMENT OF SERVICE.
   If service is severed pursuant to this chapter, the service may be
reinstated in the following manner:
   1.   Upon payment to the WRA of any delinquency in full, supervision fee of
$500.00, and an inspection by the WRA Director to determine whether the
original cause for termination has been corrected, the WRA will issue a permit
for reconnection of the building service line to the POTW.
   Such reconnection costs, plus inspection fees for the City in accordance
with this Code, shall be at the sole expense of the user.
   2.   Upon reconnection and payment of all costs described in Subsection 1 of
this section, the City, through its agents, shall remove the red tag from the
building, and the building shall, so far as the City is concerned, be fit for
human occupancy.
8-3-40 EMERGENCY DISCONNECTION OF SERVICE.
   1.   Conditions for Immediate Disconnection of Service. The WRA Director
may, after informal notice, suspend the wastewater discharge permit of, and
sewer service to, a user whenever such suspension is necessary in order to stop
an actual or threatened discharge presenting or causing an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, the POTW, or the
environment.
   2.   Procedures for Immediate Disconnection. The procedure for immediate
disconnection shall be as follows:
      A.   When the WRA Director determines that a discharge as described in
Subsection 1 of this section exists, an oral order shall be issued, followed
immediately by a written order, to the user stating the problem and requiring
immediate cessation of the discharge. A user orally notified of a suspension of
its wastewater permit or sewer service shall immediately stop or eliminate all
discharges. If a user fails to immediately and voluntarily comply with the
suspension order, the WRA Director shall take immediate action to eliminate the
discharge, including disconnection from the POTW.
      Methods of informal notice to a user shall include, but not be limited
to, any of the following: personal conversations between user and personnel or
the WRA or its operating contractor, telephone calls, letters, hand-delivered
messages, or notices posted at the user’s premises or point of discharge.
      B.   A user responsible, in whole or in part, for imminent endangerment
shall submit to the WRA Director, prior to the hearing described in Subsection
8-3-38(2) of this chapter, a detailed written report describing the causes of
the endangerment and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence.
8-3-41 ELIMINATION OF DISCHARGE; REINSTATEMENT OF PERMIT.
   A user notified by the WRA Director of revocation of its discharge permit or
disconnection of its sewer service underSection
8-3-38 or
8-3-40 of this chapter shall immediately cease discharging wastewater to the
POTW.
   If the user fails to comply voluntarily with the revocation or disconnection
order, the City shall take such steps as are deemed necessary by the WRA,
including immediate severance of the sewer connection. The WRA Director shall
reinstate the wastewater discharge permit or the sewer service upon proof of
the elimination of the non-complying discharge.
8-3-42 ADDITIONAL REMEDIES.
   1.   In addition to remedies available to the WRA set forth elsewhere in
this chapter, if the WRA is fined by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources
or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for violations of the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit for the WRF, or for violations of
water quality standards as the result of a discharge of pollutants by an
identifiable user, the fine, and all legal, sampling, analytical testing costs
and any other related costs, shall be charged to the responsible user. Such
charge shall be in addition to any other remedies the WRA may have under this
chapter at law or in equity.
   2.   If the discharge from any user results in a deposit, obstruction,
damage, or other impairment to the POTW, the user shall become liable to the
City or the WRA for any expense, loss, or damage caused by the violations or
discharge. The WRA may add to the user’s charges and fees the costs incurred by
the WRA and by the City for any cleaning, repair, or replacement work caused by
the violations or discharge.
   3.   The remedies provided in this chapter shall not be exclusive, and the
WRA may seek whatever other remedies are authorized by statute, at law or in
equity against any persons violating this chapter.
   4.   In addition to any other remedies provided in this chapter, the City or
the WRA may initiate an action, either in law or in equity, to obtain an

8-3A-1 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter shall be to aid in the prevention of sanitary
sewer blockages and obstructions from contribution and accumulation of fat,
oil, and grease into the POTW.
   Such discharges from commercial kitchens, restaurants, food processing
facilities, and all other establishments, where fat, oil, and grease of
vegetable or animal origin are discharged directly or indirectly into the POTW,
can contribute to line blockages or spills in violation of Title 40, Code of
Federal Regulations (40 CFR), part 403.
8-3A-2 DEFINITIONS.
   The definitions found in Section
8-3-1 of this chapter shall apply to the provisions of this chapter; provided,
however, that the following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this
chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where
the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
   1.   “Best Management Practices” or “BMPs” means and includes schedules of
activities, prohibitions of practices, maintenance procedures, and other
management practices to prevent or reduce the pollution of waters of the State.
For purposes of this chapter, Best Management Practices include procedures and

treatment fee shall reflect a total cost per gallon or per pound of hauled
waste equaling the sum of the total cost of pollutants per gallon or per pound
plus, if applicable, total cost of flow per gallon, based on: (1) the
parameters of chemical oxygen demand (COD), estimated biochemical oxygen demand
(B.O.D.), total suspended solids (TSS) or total solids (TS), volatile solids
(VS), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), oil and grease (O and G), and, if
applicable, total phosphorus (TP) contained in trucked waste to the WRF; (2)
net weight of the wasteload in pounds; and (3) the treatment surcharge
component rate per pound of pollutant as found in Section
8-3-20 of this chapter. Wasteloads disposed of at an unapproved location at the
WRF, or containing pollutant concentrations different from typical pollutant
concentrations or from original disclosures made during the wasteload approval
process, may be subject to the following additional costs: treatment fees,
charges, or fines may also be applied pursuant toSection
8-3-20(1).
      B.   The treatment fee for loads originating outside the corporate limits
of the WRA participating communities shall be one and one- half times the fee
for loads originating within the WRA participating communities.

shall be computed and recorded at the WRF truck scales and the resulting
treatment fees shall be paid by the waste hauler or the waste generator, at the
WRA’s discretion, on the basis of monthly billings by the operating contractor.
Limits of credit shall not exceed 60 days. Abuse of such credit shall be
grounds for liability on the waste hauler’s or waste generator’s bond and for
refusal of disposal services to any waste hauler or waste generator under this
division.
   4.   Testing of Loads. Waste haulers and waste generators may elect to have
their routine waste streams tested for actual concentration at their expense as
set forth in Section

   The purpose of this chapter is to establish a stormwater utility which shall
be responsible for stormwater management within the corporate boundaries of the
City and shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation,
use, and enhancement of stormwater management systems and facilities.
8-4-2 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter the following terms are defined:
   1.   “Commercial/industrial” means any developed land whereon multiple-
family dwellings, commercial retail and office, industrial, and manufacturing
buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious

hospitals, and convalescent centers have been constructed.
   2.   “Customers of the stormwater utility” means all persons, properties,
and entities served by or benefiting from the utility’s acquisition,
management, maintenance, extension, and improvement of the public stormwater
management system and facilities.
   3.   “Developed land” means land that has been altered from its natural
state by construction or installation of more than 500 square feet of
“impervious surface area” as defined in this section.
   4.   “Duplex dwelling” means a building containing only two dwelling units
and designed for and occupied exclusively by not more than two families with
separate housekeeping and cooking facilities for each. In the application of
stormwater service charge rates, duplex dwelling properties shall be treated as
two single-family dwellings.
   5.   “Equivalent Residential Unit” (ERU) means the median average impervious
coverage of a detached dwelling unit property in the City as determined by the
City and shall be used as the basis for determining stormwater service charges.
Forty-one hundred square feet of impervious surface area shall be one
equivalent unit.
(Subsection 5 – Ord. 1144 – May 24 Supp.)
   6.   “Impervious surface area” means those areas which prevent or impede the
infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it enters in natural conditions
prior to development. Common impervious surface areas include, but are not
limited to, rooftops, sidewalks, driveways, patios, parking lots, storage
areas, compacted gravel surfaces, and other surfaces which prevent or impede
the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to
development.
   7.   “Multiple-family dwelling” means a building or portion thereof
containing more than three dwelling units designed for or occupied by more than
three families with separate housekeeping and cooking facilities for each. In
the application of stormwater service charge rates, multiple-family dwelling
properties shall be treated as commercial/industrial.
   8.   “Pollutant” means anything that causes or contributes to pollution.
Pollutants may include, but are not limited to: paints, varnishes and solvents;
oil and other automotive fluids; nonhazardous liquid and solid wastes and yard
wastes; refuse, rubbish, garbage, litter, or other discarded or abandoned
objects, so that the same may cause or contribute to pollution; pesticides,
herbicides, and fertilizers; hazardous substances and wastes; sewage, fecal
coliform bacteria and pathogens; dissolved and particulate metals; animal
wastes; waste and residues that result from constructing a building or
structure; and noxious or offensive matter of any kind.
   9.   “Service charge” means the periodic rate, fee, or charge applicable to
a parcel of developed land, which charge shall be reflective of the service
provided by the City stormwater utility. Service charges are based on
measurable parameters which influence the stormwater utility’s cost of
providing services and facilities, with the most important factor being the
amount of impervious surface area on each parcel of developed property. The
service charge shall be determined, from time to time, by resolution of the
Council.
   10.   “Single-family dwelling” means a building containing only one dwelling
unit and designed for and occupied exclusively for residence purposes by only
one family.
   11.   “Stormwater management systems and facilities” means the issue of
drainage management (flooding) and environmental quality (pollution, erosion,
and sedimentation) of receiving rivers, streams, creeks, lakes, and ponds
through improvements, maintenance, regulation, and funding of plants,
structures, and property used in the collection, retention, detention, and
treatment of stormwater or surface water drainage.
   12.   “Substantial completion” means the date when the construction has been
completed and the City has acknowledged that the construction has been
completed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications through the
issuance of a temporary Certificate of Occupancy or permanent Certificate of
Occupancy.
   13.   “Townhome dwelling” means a dwelling unit which is detached or
attached horizontally, and not vertically to one or more other dwelling units,
wherein the land or lot beneath each dwelling may be individually owned in
common by a townhome association. In the application of stormwater service
charge rates, each townhome dwelling shall be treated as one single-family
dwelling.
   14.   “Undeveloped land” means land in its unaltered natural state or which
has been modified to such minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response
comparable to land in an unaltered state shall be deemed undeveloped.
“Undeveloped land” shall have less than 500 square feet of pavement, asphalt,
or compacted gravel surfaces or structures which create an impervious surface
area that would prevent infiltration of stormwater or cause stormwater to
collect, concentrate, or flow in a manner materially different than that which
would occur when the land was in an unaltered natural state.
8-4-3 SCOPE AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR STORMWATER UTILITY.
   The City stormwater utility consists of all rivers, streams, creeks,
branches, lakes, ponds, drainageways, channels, ditches, swales, storm sewer,
culverts, inlets, catch basins, pipes, dams, head walls and other structures,
natural or manmade, within the corporate boundaries of the City which control
or convey stormwater through which the City intentionally diverts surface
waters from its public streets and properties. The City owns or has legal
access for purposes of operation, maintenance, and improvement to those
segments of this system which: a) are located within public streets, rights-of-
ways, and easements; b) are subject to easement or other permanent provisions
for adequate access for operation, maintenance, and improvement of systems or
facilities; or c) are located on public lands to which the City has adequate
access for operation, maintenance, and improvement of systems or facilities.
Operation, maintenance, and improvement of stormwater systems and facilities
which are located on private property, or public property not owned by the City
and for which there has been no public dedication of such systems and
facilities, shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner,

8-4C-1 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the Clive Postconstruction Stormwater
Management Ordinance, may be cited as such, and will be referred to herein as
“this chapter.”
8-4C-2 PURPOSE.
   1.   The U.S. EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(“NPDES”) permit program (“program”) administered by the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources (“IDNR”) requires that cities meeting certain demographic and
environmental impact criteria obtain from the IDNR an NPDES permit for the
discharge of stormwater from a municipal separate storm sewer system (“MS4”)
(“MS4 permit”). The City of Clive (“City”) is subject to the program and is
required to obtain, and has obtained, an MS4 permit. The City’s MS4 permit is
on file at the office of the Clerk and is available for public inspection
during regular office hours.
   2.   The purpose of this chapter is to comply with the MS4 permit
requirements and establish a set of water quality and quantity policies
applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for the
regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water
resources from degradation. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from
land development and other construction activities in order to control and
minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream
channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater
runoff, is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and
safety.
8-4C-3 WARNING.
   No person shall place reliance upon this chapter, any inspections performed
or certificates issued pursuant to this chapter, as indicating the safety of or
quality of construction of any particular premises. Neither this chapter nor
inspections made pursuant thereto, nor certificates issued, are intended to
assume the duty of any person to adequately construct and maintain a premises
or provide a safe premises or to, in any way, indicate a decrease in the risk
associated with the use or occupancy of any premises. A certification that a
premises has been inspected pursuant to this chapter shall not, in any way,
constitute a warranty or guarantee of the safety or quality of that premises.

and SUDAS. PCSWMP facilities shall be designed with appropriate BMPs, such as
detention and retention basins, wetlands, soil quality restoration, grass
swales, buffer strips, bioretention basins, and other similar types of
infiltration based practices, so that the drainage through the property shall
not cause adverse water quality or quantity impacts to a downstream property
owner, watercourse, channel, or conduit receiving stormwater runoff from the
proposed development site.
   3.   In order to ensure that the PCSWMP facilities are constructed in
accordance with the approved design, the property owner or applicant shall
provide to the City an as built plan detailing dimensions and elevations as
well as certification that the approved facilities were installed and working
properly. The as-built plan shall be completed by a State licensed professional
engineer or landscape architect and submitted to the City prior to the
acceptance of any public improvements or issuance of any Certificate of
Occupancy.
   4.   At the discretion of the City, the property owner or applicant may
satisfy the PCSWMP requirements by ensuring the conveyance of stormwater
discharge from the property to a regional detention facility.
8-4C-7 MAINTENANCE.
   It shall be the property owner’s duty to ensure that the site is
periodically inspected and maintained in accordance with the approved PCSWMP.
   Periodic inspections shall be completed as needed and in no case less than
one time per year. Inspections shall be documented and shall be retained by the
property owner for at least three years. Copies of the inspection documentation
shall be made available to the City upon request.
8-4C-8 INSPECTIONS.  
   1.   The City shall be permitted to enter and inspect any property with
PCSWMP facilities subject to this regulation as often and as necessary to
determine compliance with this chapter.
   2.   The City may conduct site visits at any time to determine compliance
with the approved PCSWMP.
   Additionally, the City may request that a property owner verify, through the
preparation of an as-built plan completed by a State licensed professional
engineer or landscape architect, that the PCSWMP facilities contain appropriate
capacities and operational characteristics as originally designed and approved.
   3.   In the event that a site is found not to be in compliance with the
PCSWMP, the City will communicate, in writing, with the property owner a list
of deficiencies that identifies the area or incident of noncompliance. The
property owner shall have 14 days from the date of notice to provide a written
response outlining the steps and implementation time lines for corrective
action. The property owner shall have 30 days from the date of notice to
complete the corrective action necessary to bring the site back into compliance
with the approved PCSWMP.
   4.   Following the review of the property owner’s written response, if
extenuating circumstances exist which makes implementation of the necessary
corrective action difficult to complete within the specified time period, the
City may grant, at its sole discretion, a reasonable extension of time to
complete the corrective action.
   5.   Failure of the property owner to allow access to the property, provide
a written response, or undertake corrective action shall constitute a violation
of this chapter.
8-4C-9 CORRECTIVE ACTION BY CITY.
   If the property owner fails to take corrective action, following notice
prescribed for the service of civil process by the State rules of civil
procedure, the City may do so, by its own crews or by persons under its hire,
and assess against the property owner the City’s cost therefor. Said costs
shall include the salaries and benefits earned by City employees during such
corrective action, a charge for City machinery used, and such other costs and
expenses as the City actually incurred. To the extent allowed by State law,
such costs and expenses may be assessed against the property owner and
collected in the same manner as a property tax.
8-4C-10 RESPONSIBILITY.
   The failure of City officials to observe or foresee hazardous or unsightly
conditions, or to impose other or additional conditions or requirements, or to
deny or revoke permits or approvals, or to stop work in violation of this
chapter shall not relieve the property owners of the consequences of their
actions or inactions or result in the City, its officers or agents, being
liable therefor or on account thereof. Notwithstanding any provision of this
chapter, every applicant bears final and complete responsibility for compliance
with the NPDES General Permit No. 2 and any other requirements of State or
federal law or administrative rule.
8-4C-11 VIOLATIONS.
   Unless another penalty is expressly provided by this chapter for any
particular provision or section, any person violating any provision of this
chapter or any rule or regulation adopted herein by reference shall be subject
to a civil penalty as set forth in the schedule of civil penalties in Title 1
Chapter 4A of this Code. Each day that a municipal infraction occurs or is

property, unless the owner has been granted written permission from the City
Manager or their designee to use public property for such purposes. The storage
site shall be well drained; fully accessible to collection equipment, public
health personnel, and fire inspection personnel. All owners of residential and
commercial premises shall be responsible for proper storage of all garbage and
yard waste to prevent materials from being blown or scattered around
neighboring yards and streets. Trash shall be bagged before it is placed in the
residential solid waste containers in order to minimize blowing or loss of
material when the containers are emptied.
   3.   Location of Containers For Collection. The owner or occupant of each
single- or two-family dwelling using solid waste collection service at the curb
shall place the containers storing solid waste and bags and bundles of “yard
waste” at the curb, as defined herein, not earlier than 5:00 p.m. on the day
preceding the regularly scheduled collection day. For purposes of this section,
placing a container “at the curb” means placing the solid waste container such
that the side of the container with the metal bar is at least 18 inches from
the curb or from the edge of the road, if there is no curb. Yard waste bags and
bundles and Curb It! recycling containers shall all be located at least three
feet away from the solid waste container.
   4.   Removal of Containers from Curb or Edge of Roadway. After collection,
the owner or occupant of each single- or two-family dwelling shall remove all
empty solid waste containers from the curb or from the edge of the road, as
applicable, on the same day as the scheduled collection day.
   5.   Assistance for the Physically Impaired. In the event all occupants of a
single- or two-family dwelling are physically impaired to the extent that no
occupant can place the containers storing solid waste at the curb, the City
may, upon application by the occupant, authorize house side collection service.
For residents electing house side collection service, containers for solid
waste and recyclable materials shall be placed outdoors for collection at some
easily accessible place not more than 10 feet from the front of a single- or
two-family dwelling, or a garage serving such building, on the regularly
scheduled collection day. The collector shall return all containers at the curb
of the single- or two-family dwelling, whether the resident elects collection
at the curb or house side. The collector shall place all empty containers at
the curb in a location that does not block ingress or egress to any driveways.
8-5-11 PROHIBITED PRACTICES.  
   It is unlawful for any person to:
   1.   Unlawful Use of Containers. Deposit refuse in any solid waste
containers not owned by such person without the written consent of the owner of
such containers.
   2.   Interference with Collectors. Interfere in any manner with solid waste
collection equipment or with solid waste collectors in the lawful performance
of their duties.

                                       8-5B-5 Enforcement
 
8-5B-1 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter pertaining to recycling is to promote recycling
by maintaining residential recycling programs for single-family dwellings and
duplexes and by permitting property owners of multi-family dwellings, not
otherwise served by residential recycling programs, to provide facilities for
the source separation of recyclable materials. Any person engaged in the
collection, processing, and marketing of recyclable materials within the City
or who collects solid waste within the City shall be subject to the provisions
of this chapter.
8-5B-2 ESTABLISHMENT OF RECYCLING PROGRAM FOR SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLINGS AND
DUPLEXES.
   1.   Adoption of Curb It! Program. The City has determined that all single-
family dwellings and duplexes in the City shall be served by the Curb It!
recycling program administered by Metro waste authority.
   2.   Preparation and Placement for Collection. Recyclable materials for
single-family dwellings and duplexes shall be placed in containers provided by
the Curb It! program and placed at the curb for collection every other week on
the same collection day as the regularly scheduled collection day for solid
waste. Only recyclable material shall be placed in the Curb It! program
containers for collection. Placing residential waste or yard waste in the Curb
It! program collection containers will result in such containers not being
emptied and other penalties applied in accordance with the Curb It!
contamination policy.
   3.   Residential Recycling Program Billing Procedure. The fees for the
collection of the recyclable materials from single-family dwellings and
duplexes shall be billed to residents together with the solid waste collection
fee in accordance with Sections
8-5A-9 through
8-5A-11 of this chapter. The monthly charges for collection of recyclable
materials shall be paid whether the occupant of the residential premises
utilized the recycling collection program or not.
8-5B-3 RECYCLING PROGRAM FOR MULTI-FAMILY DWELLINGS.
   Owners of multi-family dwellings may arrange for the collection of
recyclable materials separate from the collection of solid waste.
   1.   Storage Of Recyclable Materials: An owner of multi-family dwelling
premises that adopts a recycling program shall provide and keep, at all times,
a sufficient number of containers to hold all recyclable materials which may
accumulate during the intervals between collection of such recyclable materials
by an authorized collector.
   2.   Storage Container Requirements. For multi-family dwelling premises that
have adopted a recycling program, all recyclable materials accumulated by
owners and occupants of multi-family dwellings shall be placed in containers
which are durable, watertight, and made of metal or plastic. Each container
shall be clearly marked with both the recycling symbol and the type of material
(s) to be deposited in the container. The containers shall remain on the multi-
family premises at all times and shall be kept in a clean condition and in good
repair. The storage of recyclable materials shall not result in the creation of
a public nuisance. Containers shall have lids, if necessary, to avert a public
nuisance or protect the marketing quality of recyclable materials. Such lids
must remain closed except when recyclable materials are being placed in or
removed from the containers.
   3.   Storage Container Location. Containers for collection of recyclable
materials at multi-family dwellings adopting a recycling program shall be
located on the multi-family premises at places agreed upon by the owner of the
multi-family premises and the authorized collector. Such location shall not
interfere with private or public sidewalks, walkways, driveways, roads,
streets, highways, or entrances and exits of private or public buildings and
shall be in compliance with all applicable laws. Containers which are on wheels
to facilitate their movement shall remain blocked at all times while unattended
to prevent unintentional movement.
   4.   Collection. Collectors shall collect and remove all recyclable
materials from containers on multi-family premises and shall return the
containers to the multi-family premises in a manner so as not to create a
public nuisance.
8-5B-4 COLLECTION AND TRANSPORTATION.
   Any collector transporting recyclable materials within the City shall
prevent any spillage from containers or vehicles used in the transport of such
recyclable materials. Where spillage does occur, the material shall be picked
up immediately by the collector or transporter and returned to the vehicle or
container and the area properly cleaned. Such vehicles or containers shall not
be overfilled and shall be cleansed at sufficiently frequent intervals to
prevent obnoxious odors or unhealthful conditions. Such vehicles shall also be
so constructed, loaded, and driven as to prevent any portion of the load from
falling out upon the streets or highways.
8-5B-5 ENFORCEMENT.
   Failure to comply with the terms or provisions of this chapter constitutes a
municipal infraction, subject to a civil penalty as provided in Title 1 Chapter
4A of this Code.

9-4B-1 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the cable television system
within the City.
9-4B-2 SYSTEM CAPACITY.
   TCI of Central Iowa (hereinafter referred to as “Grantee”) shall install
initially in the City a cable television system with at least 120 MHz of
bandwidth (the equivalent of 20 television channels) available for immediate or
potential use. Grantee shall maintain an ability to expand the channel capacity
of the system as the demand for channel space increases pursuant to Section
9-4B-12 of this chapter.
9-4B-3 RETURN COMMUNICATIONS.
   Grantee shall design, engineer, and construct its cable television system so
that it has the potential capacity for nonvoice return communications, and
Grantee shall make this service available when it becomes practical to do so on
other than an experimental basis.
9-4B-4 SERVICE TO SCHOOLS AND MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS.
   1.   Schools and Community Buildings. Grantee shall install a color-capable
cable service line to all public and private primary and secondary schools and
all municipally owned or leased buildings located within the City, including
all external wiring, and including all internal wiring for the connection of
one outlet. Grantee shall provide maintenance for such installations at
Grantee’s cost. Grantee shall provide cable service to such buildings without
charge. Grantee shall make all improvements to such installations and service
as technology permits to serve properly such schools and municipal buildings.
   2.   School Originated Broadcasts. When available on other than an
experimental basis, and upon request by schools located in the City, Grantee
shall provide to the schools, without charge, a type of cable that will permit
selected classrooms within each school building to originate live cable
transmissions. Such a two-way cable system shall be linked at the Grantee’s
expense to Grantee’s head-end permitting cable transmissions originated in the
selected classrooms to be transmitted over the educational channels referred to
in Subsection 3 of this section.
   3.   Educational Channel. Grantee shall maintain at least one cable channel
specifically designated for use by any and all recognized educational
authorities located in the City, both public and private, for such
instructional and educational purposes as they may determine. Grantee may
establish rules prohibiting the presentation of this channel of any advertising
material designed to promote the sale of commercial products or services
(including advertising by or on behalf of candidates for public office),
lottery information, and obscene or indecent matter. A public record may be
kept of all persons or groups requesting access to such channel. Grantee shall
not charge for the maintenance of such channel, except as required by the
Federal Communications Commission and consistent with the regulations of the
Federal Communications Commission and approved by Council pursuant to the
procedures set forth in Section 9-4B-18 of this chapter. Grantee shall make no
per-channel or per-program charge of any kind to any subscriber for the
privilege of receiving the channel designated for use by the educational
authorities. Grantee shall provide to public and private schools located within
the City such textbooks as are available on matters such as equipping,
purchasing, installing, and operating the schools’ own studio facilities.
   4.   School Activities. Grantee shall not televise, tape, or in any way
reproduce or show to the general public any school activity, either as a public
service or as a commercial activity, without the prior approval of the schools
involved.
9-4B-5 EMERGENCY WARNING SYSTEM.
   Grantee shall provide an emergency warning system so that emergency
information may be given simultaneously on all channels of Grantee’s cable
television system, and during an emergency, Grantee shall allow proper City
officials the complete use of its cable television system.
9-4B-6 TELEVISION BROADCAST SIGNALS.
   Grantee shall provide, as part of its cable television service, the signals
of all television broadcast signals presently available off the air in the City
and the maximum number of additional television signals consistent with the
rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission and all other
applicable laws, rules, or regulations. Grantee may provide such automated
video services and such audio services as it wishes and as are consistent with
the terms of this chapter.
9-4B-7 LOCAL PROGRAMMING.
   Grantee shall provide cablecasting originated by it on one or more channels
which it shall designate for such purpose. Grantee shall use its best efforts
to present programming which deals with the needs and interests of the City and
its citizens. Grantee shall maintain the necessary studio, facilities, and
equipment to produce and transmit such programming.
9-4B-8 MUNICIPAL CHANNEL.
   Grantee shall maintain at least one cable channel specifically designated
for use by the City for whatever lawful, noncommercial purposes the City may
determine. Grantee shall not charge for the maintenance of such channel except
as required by the Federal Communications Commission and consistent with the
regulations of the Federal Communications Commission and approved by the
Council pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section
9-4B-18 of this chapter. Grantee shall make no per-channel or per-program
charge of any kind to any subscriber for the privilege of receiving the channel
designated for use by the City.
9-4B-9 USE OF STUDIO FACILITIES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.
   Grantee shall allow the City and recognized educational authorities located
in the City, both public and private, to use its studio and other production
facilities, equipment, and materials, on reasonable notice, at reasonable
times, and if a charge is made, at Grantee’s cost. Grantee shall provide at no
charge such technical assistance as may be reasonably required in the
production of instructional, educational, and civic programs. Grantee shall
provide to public and private schools located within the City such equipment it
owns and technology it has, at reasonable times and upon reasonable request, as
will permit said schools to produce and transmit programs of an educational
nature without costs to the district.
9-4B-10 NONCOMMERCIAL PUBLIC ACCESS CHANNEL.
   Grantee shall maintain at least one specially designated, noncommercial
public access channel available to groups and individuals on a first come,
nondiscriminatory basis, together with equipment and facilities reasonably
necessary for the production of programming on such channel. Grantee shall make
production costs, if any, which are incurred in live studio presentations
exceeding five minutes. Should an additional public access channel or channels
be made available pursuant to Section
9-4B-12 of this chapter, Grantee may make such reasonable charge for the use of
the channel(s) as may be approved by the Council pursuant to Section
9-4B-18 of this chapter. Grantee may establish rules providing for access to
the public channel on a first come, nondiscriminatory basis, prohibiting the
presentation of any advertising material designed to promote the sale of
commercial products or services (including advertising by or on behalf of
candidates for public office), lottery information, and obscene or indecent
matter. A public record may be kept of the names and addresses of all persons
or groups requesting access time. Grantee shall make no per-channel or per-
program charge of any kind to any subscriber of the privilege of receiving the
channel(s) designated for public access.
9-4B-11 LEASED CHANNELS.
   Grantee may lease channel space to any organization, group, or individual at
a reasonable charge. Grantee may adopt rules governing the leasing of channel
space which provide for access on a first come, nondiscriminatory basis,
prohibit the presentation of lottery information and obscene or indecent
matter, require sponsorship identification, specify an appropriate rate
schedule, and permit public inspection of a record of the names and addresses
of all persons or groups requesting time.
9-4B-12 EXPANSION OF ACCESS CHANNEL CAPACITY.
   In the event that any of the channels provided for in Subsection
9-4B-4(3) and Sections
9-4B-8,
9-4B-10, and
9-4B-11 of this chapter shall be in use during 80 percent of the weekdays
(Monday through Friday) for 80 percent of the time during any consecutive
three-hour period for six consecutive weeks, Grantee shall make an additional
channel for that purpose available within six months for any or all of the uses
and under the conditions specified in Subsection
9-4B-4(3) and Sections
9-4B-8,
9-4B-10, and
9-4B-11 of this chapter. Nothing herein shall interfere with Grantee’s right to
add additional channels of the type described in Subsection
9-4B-4(3) and Sections
9-4B-8,
9-4B-10, and
9-4B-11 of this chapter whenever it wishes, provided that such channels are
operated in a manner consistent with those sections.
9-4B-13 COMPLAINTS.
   Grantee shall maintain an office within the City, or within an adjoining
City for the purpose of receiving, investigating, and responding to complaints
and grievances with respect to the quality of the service rendered by the
Grantee, equipment malfunctions and other similar matters pertaining to the
cable television system of the Grantee. Within 30 days from the occurrence of
the facts and circumstances giving rise to a complaint or grievance, and not
thereafter, any subscriber in the City may state a complaint or grievance to
the Grantee in writing. In the event that a written complaint or grievance is
received by the City, the City shall forward the complaint or grievance to the
Grantee. Within five days from the receipt of a complaint or grievance by the
Grantee, the Grantee shall state to the complainant its intentions with respect
to the complaint or grievance in writing. In the event that the complaint or
grievance is not resolved to the satisfaction of the complainant within 15 days
after the receipt thereof by the Grantee, the Grantee shall notify the City and
the City shall forward a copy of such notice to the complainant, with a
statement of the procedure to be followed to further prosecute the complaint.
When a complaint has not been satisfied, the complainant may file a formal
complaint with the Council, in such form and manner as prescribed by the City,
within 30 days after the date of the Grantee’s notice of refusal or inability
to satisfy the complaint. If the complainant fails to file a formal complaint
within such 30 day period, complainant will be deemed to have abandoned the
complaint, and such complaint will be deemed dismissed. Upon receipt of a
formal complaint, the Council shall ascertain the facts and shall have the
power to enforce its decision, if against Grantee, by all actions hereunder,
including the revocation of the franchise. On or before the 10th day of each
calendar month, the Grantee shall file a report in writing with the City
stating the date and substance of each complaint or grievance received by it
during the preceding calendar month, the date and nature of the action taken by
the Grantee with respect thereto, and, if still pending, the status thereof.
9-4B-14 FRANCHISE FEE.
   On or before April 1 of each year, Grantee shall pay to the City, at the
office of the Clerk, a franchise fee of five percent, subject to the approval
of the Federal Communications Commission, or such other franchise fee as is
approved by the Federal Communications Commission, but in no event to be less
than three percent of Grantee’s gross subscriber receipts received for cable
service operations in the City for the preceding calendar year during the term
of the franchise. In the event the franchise fee payable by Grantee to the City
provided herein is held invalid by any court or governmental agency having
jurisdiction thereof, then, at the option of the City, it may terminate and
revoke Grantee’s franchise. In the event that a franchise fee of five percent
is not approved by the Federal Communications Commission, as provided in this
section, then Grantee shall reimburse the City for all expenses incurred by the
City for engineering services performed by or on behalf of the City with
respect to the review of plans and specifications submitted to the City by
Grantee and for all costs of the City arising out of review, inspection, and
supervision of the erection, installation, construction, reconstruction,

given no less than seven days’ notice.
9-4B-16 FRANCHISE FEE NOT TAX.
   Payments of the franchise fee by the Grantee to the City pursuant to the

to be paid by any law of the United States, the State, or the City.
9-4B-17 SERVICE RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   Grantee shall have the right to prescribe service rules and regulations for
the conduct of its business with its subscribers and service users, not

installation, construction, replacement, removal, repair, maintenance, and
operation of the system shall be in accordance with the provisions of the
National Electrical Code of the National Fire Protection Association and

shall be installed underground. Grantee shall only be allowed to erect its own
poles upon receiving the permission of the Council to do so.
   2.   Reservation of Right to Use Poles. The City shall retain and does
hereby retain the right to utilize the existing poles for future use and to

own expense.
9-4B-29 INTERFERENCE WITH UTILITY FIXTURES.

with any gas, electric, or telephone fixtures, water hydrant or main, and all
such poles or other fixtures placed in any street shall be placed at the outer
edge of the sidewalk and inside the curb line, and those placed in alleys shall

a manner as not to interfere with the usual travel on said streets, alleys, and
public ways.

installation shall be guarded and protected at all times by the placement of
adequate barriers, fences, or boarding, the bounds of which, during periods of
dusk and darkness, shall be clearly designated by warning lights. Grantee
shall, whenever it is deemed necessary by the City Director of Public Works,

10-1-1 SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the Clive Building Code, and may be cited as
such and may also be known, referred to, and cited as the “Building Code.”
10-1-2 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to require architects, builders,
contractors, property owners, their agents, and others to meet their
responsibilities with respect to proper construction, construction techniques,
and premises safety, and to provide for inspection as a means of compelling
compliance therewith. It is not the purpose of this chapter to create any duty
on the part of the City, its officers, agents, or employees, owing to any
individual member of the public or to protect any particular or circumscribed
class of persons. Specifically, it is not the intent of this chapter to create
any duty or liability by the City, its officers, agents, or employees, to
premises occupants, owners, tenants, or any other person.
10-1-3 WARNING.
   No person shall place reliance upon this chapter, any inspections performed,
or certificates issued pursuant to this chapter as indicating the safety of or
quality of construction of any particular premises. Neither this chapter, nor
inspections made pursuant thereto, nor certificates issued are intended to
assume the duty of any person to adequately construct and maintain a premises
or provide a safe premises or to, in any way, indicate a decrease in the risk
associated with the use or occupancy of any premises. A certification that a
premise has been inspected pursuant to this chapter shall not in any way
constitute a warranty or guarantee of the safety or quality of that premises.
10-1-4 INTERPRETATION.
   The foregoing statements of legislative intent shall govern and take
precedence over any other language contained in this chapter or the
International Building Code, 2021 edition, or International Residential Code,
2021 edition, adopted herein.
10-1-5 ADOPTION.
   Pursuant to published notice and public hearing, as required by law, the
International Building Code, 2021 edition, and the International Residential
Code, 2021edition, published by the International Code Council, Inc., are
adopted in full except for such portions as may be hereinafter deleted,
modified, or amended, and shall constitute the “Building Code of the City of
Clive, Iowa,” to regulate the erection, construction, enlargement, alteration,
repair, moving, removal, demolition, conversion, occupancy, equipment, use,
height, area, and maintenance of buildings or structures in the City, and the
same are, by this reference, incorporated herein as fully and completely as if
set forth in full. The use of the term “Building Code” in this chapter shall be
interpreted to refer to the International Building Code, 2021 edition. The

and appendix chapters to the International Residential Code may be utilized to
determine basic guidelines or acceptable solutions to code requirements
(determination to be made by the Construction Services Administrator).

refer to the International Building Code, 2021 edition, and the use of the term
IRC shall be interpreted to refer to the International Residential Code, 2021

contractors, property owners, their agents, and others to meet their
responsibilities with respect to proper electrical installation, material
selection, installation methods, and premises safety, and to provide for
inspection as a means of compelling compliance therewith. It is not the purpose
of this chapter to create any duty on the part of the City, its officers,
agents, or employees, owing to any individual member of the public or to
protect any particular or circumscribed class of persons. Specifically, it is
not the intent of this chapter to create any duty or liability by the City, its
officers, agents, or employees, to premises occupants, owners, tenants, or any
other person.
10-2-3 WARNING.
   No person shall place reliance upon this chapter, any inspections performed,
or certificates issued pursuant to this chapter as indicating the safety of or
quality of construction of any particular premises. Neither this chapter nor
inspections made pursuant thereto nor certificates issued are intended to
assume the duty of any person to adequately construct and maintain a premises
or provide a safe premises or to, in any way, indicate a decrease in the risk
associated with the use or occupancy of any premises. A certification that a
premise has been inspected pursuant to this chapter shall not, in any way,
constitute a warranty or guarantee of the safety or quality of that premises.
10-2-4 INTERPRETATION.
   The foregoing statements of legislative intent shall govern and take
precedence over any other language contained in this chapter or the National
Electrical Code, adopted herein.

shall not do so without first securing a permit from the Community Development
Department.
   2.   Issuance. After proper application on forms provided by the Community
Development Department, permits shall be issued in the name of the property
owner or of a firm or corporation registered with the State Division of Labor
Services, according to their rules and standards. The property owner or

buildings or structures constructed by or for the City.
   4.   Expiration.
      A.   Every permit issued under the provisions of this Code shall expire
by limitation and become null and void, if the work authorized by such permit

been completed in accordance with the applicable codes. The Construction
Services Administrator shall determine the appropriate level of special
inspection necessary to ensure that the work was completed in accordance with
the applicable codes. Special inspections shall be performed by an approved

service charge fee to any alarm user that generates an unnecessary number of
false alarm responses during a calendar year as listed below (“false alarm
fee.”) The alarm user shall pay the City the assessed false alarm fee within 20
days of the date an invoice is given to the alarm user for any false alarm
created by the alarm user’s alarm system in accordance with the following
schedule:
 
The first and second false alarms during a calendar year                $0.00
The third false alarm during a calendar year                            $75.00
The fourth false alarm during a calendar year                           $100.00
The fifth false alarm and each false alarm thereafter during a calendar $150.00
year
 
      A.   After the second false alarm, the alarm user shall receive a written

10-11-1 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the Clive Erosion Control Ordinance, may be
cited as such, and will be referred to herein as “this chapter.”
10-11-2 PURPOSE.
   1.   The U.S. EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(“NPDES”) Permit Program (“program”) administered by the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources (“IDNR”) requires that cities meeting certain demographic and
environmental impact criteria obtain from the IDNR an NPDES permit for the
discharge of stormwater from a municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) (MS4
permit). The City of Clive (“City”) is subject to the program and is required
to obtain, and has obtained, an MS4 permit. The City’s MS4 permit is on file at
the office of the Clerk and is available for public inspection during regular
office hours. As a condition of the City’s MS4 permit, the City is obligated to
undertake primary responsibility for administration and enforcement of the
program by adopting regulations to effectively manage construction site erosion
and sediment controls and to require compliance with the IDNR NPDES General
Permit No. 2.
   2.   The purpose of this chapter is to comply with the MS4 permit
requirements and care for and control the City streets, sidewalks, and sewers
to prevent the despoliation of the environment and to promote and preserve the
rights, privileges, property, safety, health, welfare, comfort, and convenience
of the residents of, and visitors to, the City by regulating and controlling
the design, construction, quality of material, and use and maintenance of any
development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise
results in the movement of soil in the City, and by requiring property owners
to abate certain accumulations of soil.

constitute a warranty or guarantee of the safety or quality of that premises.
10-11-5 INTERPRETATION.
   The foregoing statements of legislative intent shall govern and take
precedence over any other language contained in this chapter.
10-11-6 GRADING PERMIT REQUIREMENTS; FEE.
   1.   Permit Required. Unless permitted by Subsection 2 of this section, it
is unlawful for any person to undertake any construction activity within any
property in the City unless the owner of such property, or general contractor,
if any, responsible for the work, holds for the property a current grading
permit issued by the Community Development Department permitting such work to
be done. If the construction activity requires an NPDES General Permit No. 2,
the Community Development Department shall not issue the grading permit until
such time as the NPDES General Permit No. 2 has been issued by the IDNR.
   2.   Exceptions. Any language in this chapter to the contrary
notwithstanding, a grading permit is not necessary when excavating or filling
is done:
      A.   To further a farming or horticultural activity;
      B.   By a public utility company for the purpose of installing
underground utilities;
      C.   By City employees on City business or contractors under City’s hire;
      D.   By or under the direction of a soil engineer or engineering
geologist to investigate, test, or evaluate earth materials in conjunction with
the designing and engineering of buildings or other improvements; and
      E.   On property then occupied as the residence of the property owner and
no more than 500 square feet of existing ground cover will be disturbed.
   3.   Permit Review. An SWPPP, prepared in accordance with all current NPDES
General Permit No. 2 minimum requirements, shall be submitted for review prior
to the issuance of a grading permit. The SWPPP shall be site specific and
identify all construction site sources, including building materials, concrete
washout, chemicals, solid waste, and sanitary waste, that may impact water
quality. Additionally, the SWPPP shall identify all BMPs intended to be
utilized to mitigate the potential adverse impacts to water quality from all
construction site sources.
   4.   Issuance. After proper application on forms provided by the City
Community Development Department, permits shall be issued in the name of a
registered contractor or property owner. Permits are not transferable. No
permits shall be issued to any person or company who has fees outstanding or
who has outstanding violations of this Code or any other laws or ordinances of
this City.
   5.   Fee. There shall be a fee paid for the issuance of permits. Permit fees
shall be set forth in a fee schedule established and approved, from time to
time, by the Council. Fees on all buildings or structures constructed by any
unit of the government or nonprofit organization may be waived by the Council.
No fees shall be collected on buildings or structures constructed by or for the
City.
   6.   Expiration. Every permit issued under the provisions of this chapter
shall expire by limitation and become null and void, if the work authorized by
such permit is not commenced within 90 days from the date of issuance of such
permit, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned at
any time after the work is commenced for a period of 60 days. Before such work
can be recommenced, a new permit shall be first obtained, and the fee therefor
shall be one-half the amount required for a new permit for such work, provided
that such suspension or abandonment has not exceeded 120 days.
   7.   Revocation. Any permit required by the provisions of this chapter may
be summarily revoked by the Construction Services Administrator or Engineering
Services Administrator upon the violation of any provision of this chapter.
10-11-7 INSPECTION AND ENFORCEMENT.
   1.   Monitor Site for Compliance. It shall be the property owner or permit
holder’s duty to monitor the site daily to assure compliance with the grading
permit.
   2.   City Inspection. With the issuance of a grading permit, the permit
holder acknowledges that the City may conduct site visits at any time to
determine compliance with the grading permit. In the event that a site is found
not to be in compliance with the grading permit, the City will communicate,
verbally or in writing, with the property owner or permit holder as outlined in
the City Erosion and Sediment Control Enforcement Response Plan chapter of the
City Stormwater Management Manual.
   3.   Enforcement. Following notice from the City that the site is not in
compliance with the grading permit, the property owner or permit holder shall
immediately commence corrective action and shall complete corrective action
within the timeframe identified by the City.
10-11-8 ABATEMENT OF SOIL ACCUMULATION.
   1.   Cleanup Required. If, by erosion, vehicle tire, or otherwise, soil
shall be carried from private property in the City and shall accumulate on the
City streets or sidewalks or in the City sewers or established streams and
drainage ditches located in the City, and if such accumulation of soil is by
its presence dangerous to the persons or properties of others or interferes
with the safe use or efficient operation or maintenance of said streets,
sidewalks, sewers, streams, and drainage ditches, the owner of such property,
and the permit holder for such property, if there be one, shall cause such
accumulation of soil to be cleaned from said streets, sidewalks, sewers,
streams and drainage ditches as directed by the City. Failure to take
corrective action shall constitute a violation of this chapter. Anytime the
Construction Services Administrator, Code Enforcement Officer, or Engineering
Services Administrator determines that the presence of such accumulation of
soil is hazardous to life and limb or materially disruptive of the normal use
of such streets, sidewalks, sewers, streams, or drainage ditches, they may
authorize the immediate cleanup by the City as outlined in Section
10-11-9 of this chapter.
   2.    Serving of Cleanup Orders. Cleanup orders issued pursuant to this
section shall be in writing and shall be served in a manner prescribed for the
service of civil process by the Iowa Rules of Civil Procedure; except, however,
such an order to a permit holder for the property may also be given verbally by
the Construction Services Administrator, Code Enforcement Officer, or
Engineering Services Administrator, either in person or by telephone call, to
the permit holder or to a person designated by the permit holder to receive
such notices from the Building Official, or to a family member, employee, or
associate of such permit holder or designee as is found at the addresses or
phone numbers of the permit holder or designee listed on the excavation permit.
   3.   Each Day a Separate Offense. Each day a property owner or permit holder
remains in violation of a cleanup order given pursuant to this section shall
constitute a new and separate violation of this chapter.
10-11-9 CLEANUP BY CITY; ASSESSMENT OF COSTS.
   If the property owner or permit holder fails to clean accumulations of soil
from the City streets and sidewalks, City sewers or established streams and
drainage ditches in the City within the time period described by the
Construction Services Administrator, Code Enforcement Officer, or Engineering
Services Administrator in the order given pursuant to the Clive Erosion and
Sediment Control Enforcement Response Plan chapter of the City Stormwater
Management Manual, the City may do so by its own crews or by persons under its
hire, and assess against the property owner and permit holder the City’s costs
therefor. Said costs shall include the salaries earned by City employees during
such cleanup operations, a charge for City machinery used, and such other costs
and expenses as the City actually incurred. To the extent allowed by State law,
such costs and expenses may be assessed against the property and collected in
the same manner as a Property Tax.
10-11-10 RESPONSIBILITY OF PROPERTY OWNERS OR PERMITTEES.
   The failure of City officials to observe or foresee hazardous or unsightly
conditions, or to impose other or additional conditions or requirements on
permit holders, or to deny or revoke a grading permit, or to stop work in
violation of this chapter shall not relieve the property owners or permit
holders of the consequences of their actions or inactions or result in the
City, its officers, or agents being liable therefor or on account thereof.
Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, every applicant bears final and
complete responsibility for compliance with a State NPDES General Permit No. 2
and any other requirements of State or federal law or administrative rule.
10-11-11 VIOLATION; PENALTY.
   Unless another penalty is expressly provided by this chapter for any
particular provision or section, any person violating any provision of this
chapter or any rule or regulation adopted herein by reference shall be subject
to a civil penalty as set forth in the schedule of civil penalties in Title 1
Chapter 4A of this Code. Each day that a municipal infraction occurs or is
permitted to exist constitutes a separate offense.

11-1-1 TITLE.
   This title shall be officially known, cited, and referred to as the “Zoning
Regulations of the City of Clive, Iowa.”
11-1-2 PURPOSE.
   This zoning chapter is adopted in order to lessen congestion in the streets;
to secure safety from fire, flood, panic, and other dangers; to promote health
and general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the
overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to facilitate
the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewer systems, schools, parks,
and other public improvements; and to encourage orderly development and the
most appropriate use of land throughout the City; all in accordance with the
Comprehensive Plan. The provisions established by this chapter for the
development of land and the attachment of reasonable conditions to the
development of land are an exercise of valid police power delegated by the
State. A developer has the duty of compliance with conditions laid down by the
City for design, dedication, improvements, and restrictive use of land to
conform to the physical and economic development of the City for the health,
safety, and welfare of the community at large.
11-1-3 POLICY.
   1.   The regulations of this chapter apply to development of any parcel of
land located within the corporate limits of the City or outside the corporate
limits of the City, as provided by law.
   2.   The existing and proposed public improvements shall conform to and be
properly related to the requirements shown in the Comprehensive Plan, Official
Map, State “Urban Standard Specifications for Public Improvements Manual”
(SUDAS), State “Urban Design Standards for Public Improvements Manual,” the
“Development Standards Manual,” and it is intended that these regulations
supplement and facilitate the enforcement of the provisions and standards
contained in Building and Housing Codes and subdivision regulations.
   3.   Land that has been developed before the effective date hereof shall,
whenever possible, be brought within the scope of these regulations to further
the purposes of regulations identified in Section
11-1-2 of this chapter.
   4.   An entitlement to construct a structure on any land shall only be
issued for a legal platted lot of record.
   5.   No certificates of zoning compliance or Certificate of Occupancy shall
be issued for any parcel of land or development not in substantial conformity
with the provisions of this chapter. No excavation of land or construction of
any public or private improvements shall take place or be commenced except in
conformity with this chapter.
   6.   No building permit shall be issued until a final plat, site plan, site
plan amendment, or administratively approved site plan amendment has been
approved.
   7.   It being essential to the proper government and administration of the
City and to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens, the
Council has determined that it is necessary to enact a temporary moratorium on
certain zoning and development activities within the Emerald Isle area, as
defined in Exhibit A attached to the ordinance codified herein ("Emerald Isle
area"). The purpose of this moratorium is to allow sufficient time for land use
planning in order to facilitate development of the Emerald Isle area.
      A.   During the effective period of this moratorium, no official,
officer, or agency of the City shall accept development applications, plans, or
permits for any property modification requiring development review or approval.
      B.   Those provisions of the City zoning ordinance that are inconsistent
or conflicting with the provisions of this Subsection 7 are hereby repealed for
the duration of the moratorium hereby ordained and any extension thereof, but
not otherwise.
11-1-4 INTERPRETATION.
   1.   In interpreting and applying the provisions of this chapter, such
provisions shall be held to the minimum requirements for the promotion of the
public health, safety, and welfare. The regulations of this chapter shall be
construed broadly to promote the purposes for which they are adopted.
   2.   The regulations of this chapter are not intended to interfere with,
abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule, or regulation, statute, private
covenants, or other provision of law except as provided in these regulations.
If a conflict between requirements appears within this chapter, the most
restrictive requirement shall prevail.
   3.   Information erroneously presented by any official or employee of the
City does not negate or diminish the provisions of this chapter pertaining
thereto.
   4.   Whenever a number of days are specified in this chapter, or in any
permit, condition of approval, or notice issued or given, as set forth in this
chapter, such number of days shall be deemed to be consecutive calendar days,
unless otherwise specified.
   5.   Whenever application of this chapter results in standards being
expressed in fractions of whole numbers, such fractions are to be rounded to
the next higher whole number, except that quantities expressing units per acre
shall not be rounded.
   6.   All references to density in this chapter are based on gross site area
unless otherwise specified.
   7.   Whenever this chapter refers to setback distances, the setback standard
shall be measured from the official property lines, unless noted otherwise.
   8.   No action of the City, its Council, Planning and Zoning Commission, or
the Community Development Director shall be deemed invalid by reason of failure
to comply with or conform to the provisions of this chapter, provided that the
procedural requirements of the Code of Iowa have been met.
   9.   It is the intent of this chapter that all questions of interpretation
and enforcement shall be first presented to the Community Development Director,
and that such questions shall be presented to the Board of Adjustment only on
appeal from the decision of the Community Development Director, and that
recourse from the decision of the Board of Adjustment shall be as provided by
law.
11-1-5 ENFORCEMENT.
   The Community Development Director is hereby designated and ordered to
enforce this chapter. In the case any building or structure is erected,
constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted, or maintained, or any
building, structure, or land is used in violation of this chapter, the
Community Development Director, in addition to other remedies, shall institute
any proper action or proceedings in the name of the City to prevent such
unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair,
conversions, maintenance, or use, to restrain, correct or abate such violation,
to prevent the occupancy of said building, structure, or land, or to prevent
any illegal act, conduct, business, or use in or about said premises. All
departments, officials, and employees of the City who are vested with the duty
or authority to issue permits or licenses shall issue no such permit for any
license for any use, structure, or purpose if the same would not conform to the
provisions of this chapter.
11-1-6 VIOLATION COMPLAINTS.
   Whenever a violation of this chapter occurs, or is alleged to have occurred,
any person may file a complaint. Such complaint must be written, stating fully
the causes and basis thereof and shall be filed with the Community Development
Director. Parties witnessing such alleged violation shall sign such complaint.
The Community Development Director shall record properly such complaint,
immediately investigate, and take action as provided by this chapter.
11-1-7 PENALTIES.
   Violation of the provisions of this chapter, or failure to comply with any
of its requirements, shall constitute a municipal infraction as set forth in
Title 1 Chapter 4A of this Code. Each day that a violation occurs shall
constitute a separate offense. In the event that the City seeks court
intervention for violation of any provision of this chapter, the City may seek
reimbursement for reasonable attorney fees and administrative costs. Nothing
herein contained shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful action as
is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

(Parapgraph E – Ord. 1156 – Feb. 25 Supp.)
11-3-7 VARIANCES.
   1.   Application Requirements. Application for variance from the terms of
this chapter will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to
special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter
would result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of this chapter
shall be observed and substantial justice done. No nonconforming use of
neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in other districts shall be
considered grounds for the issuance of a variance.
   2.   Resubmittal After Changes. In the event a variance is granted under the
terms of this chapter, any changes thereafter in the approved use or site plan
shall be resubmitted and considered in the same manner as the original
proposal. Before granting a variance, the Board of Adjustment shall make
findings that the applicant has met the requirements of this chapter, and the
Board of Adjustment shall further find that the reasons set forth in the
application justify the granting of variance. The burden shall be upon those
seeking the variance to establish their entitlement to the requested variance.
   3.   Conditions for Granting. Variances shall only be granted upon:
      A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause; and

necessary to afford relief from this chapter while preserving the spirit of the
zoning ordinance.
   4.   Conditions and Safeguards. In granting any variance, the Board of
Adjustment may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity
with this chapter. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a
part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter and punishable underSection
11-1-7 of this title.

after the date of the granting of such special use permit or variance unless a
building permit has been issued for the construction authorized by such special
use permit or variance, or if no construction is authorized, then unless a
certificate of zoning compliance has been issued for such authorized use. The
Board of Adjustment may, upon written request of the affected person, extend

11-4-1 GENERAL REGULATIONS.
   This chapter provides for the administration and enforcement of general
zoning regulations. This chapter shall be known, cited, and referred to as the
“General Zoning Regulations of the City of Clive, Iowa.”
11-4-2 INTERPRETATION OF STANDARDS.
   The provisions of this chapter shall be interpreted and applied as minimum
requirements. Where this chapter imposes a greater restriction than is imposed
or required by other provisions of law or by other rules, regulations, or
ordinances, the provisions of this chapter shall control. For a specific land
use, where the requirements of any other City ordinance are more stringent or
restrictive than the requirements in this chapter, nothing in this chapter
shall not be construed to waive compliance with the provisions of such other
ordinances.
11-4-3 JURISDICTION; NONCONFORMITIES.
   The lawful use of facilities existing at the time of the enactment of this
chapter may continue, although such use may not conform to the regulations in
this chapter. For those facilities permitted before the adoption of this
chapter, such facilities shall be classified as “permitted nonconforming”
facilities. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these “nonconforming”
facilities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their
survival. Such facilities are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with
the permitted facilities in the districts involved. No permit shall be issued
for any lot, tenant, or development after the effective date of this chapter
which is not in substantial conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
Furthermore, no facility shall be substantially improved, converted, enlarged,
or otherwise altered without conforming except where specified to the
provisions of this chapter. On any building, devoted in whole or in part, to
any nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs or on repair or
replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing; provided that
the cubic content of the building as it existed at the time of enactment or
amendment of the zoning ordinance is not increased. This chapter shall not be
construed to prohibit the improvement of any building or structure from a state
of disrepair, neglect, or potentially harmful condition to a minimum level of
safety as determined by the Building Official.
11-4-4 SCOPE.
   1.   Conformance Required. Except as specified in this chapter, no land use,
building, or structure shall be erected, extended, converted, enlarged, moved,
or structurally altered which does not comply with all the regulations
established by this chapter for the district in which the building or land is
located.
   2.   Continuing Existing Nonconforming Uses. The lawful use of land,
building, or structure existing at the time of the enactment of the zoning
ordinance may be continued even though such use may not conform with the
regulations of this chapter. Any use in existence at the adoption of the zoning
ordinance which was not an authorized “nonconforming use” under previous zoning
ordinances, shall not be authorized to continue as a nonconforming use in
accordance with this chapter, or amendments in this section. If no structural
alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a building or structure may be
changed to another nonconforming use of the same or a more restricted
classification. Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a more
restrictive use or to another conforming use, such use shall not be changed to
a less restrictive use. When a nonconforming use of land, building, or
structure is discontinued or abandoned for six months, the building, structure,
and premises in combination shall not be used except in conformance with the
regulations in the district in which it is located. Where nonconforming use
status applies to a building, structure, and premises in combination, removal
of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. Any
nonconforming building or structure damaged more than 50 percent of its
replacement cost, exclusive of the foundations, at the time of damage by any
means shall not be restored or reconstructed, except in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter. If the structure is less than 50 percent damaged
above the foundation, it may be restored, reconstructed, or used as before,
provided that reconstruction is completed within six months of such happening,
and is built of like or similar materials as appropriate to the zoning
district.
   3.   Existing Building Permits.
      A.   Nothing contained in this section shall require any change in the
overall layout, plans, construction, size, or designated use of any building or
part of, for which approval and required building permits have been granted
before the effective date of this section. The construction, in conformance
with such plans, shall have started prior to the effective date and completion
carried on in a normal manner and not discontinued for any reason, other than
those beyond the builder’s control.
      B.   “Actual construction” is defined to include the placing of
construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent
manner; except where demolition or removal of an existing building has been
substantially begun prior to rebuilding. Demolition or removal shall be deemed
to be actual construction, provided that such work is diligently carried on
until completion of the building.
   4.   Yard, Open Space, and Parking. No part of a yard or other open space,
off-street parking or loading space required about or in connection with any
building, for the purpose of complying with this chapter, shall be included as
such required for any other building unless otherwise permitted through the
development review and approval process.
   5.   Reduction in Yard or Lot Requirements. No yard or lot existing at the
time of passage of this chapter shall be reduced in dimension or area below the
minimum requirements set forth herein. Yards or lots created after the
effective date of this chapter shall meet the minimum requirements established
by this chapter.
11-4-5 VISION CLEARANCE.
   The purpose of this provision is to prevent obstructions on private
property, which substantially impair or interfere with the visibility of
pedestrian or vehicular movement on and along public streets and sidewalks,
create an unreasonable risk of death, personal injury, or property damage, and
otherwise interfere with the unobstructed and safe use of the public right-of-
way.
   1.   On a corner lot in any district, nothing shall be erected, placed,
planted, or allowed to grow in such a manner as to impede vision between a
height of two and one-half and 10 feet above the centerline grades of the
intersecting streets in the area bounded by the ROW lines of such corner lots
and a line adjoining points along said ROW lines 25 feet from the point of
intersection of right-of-way lines. See
figure 11-4-5.1 of this section.
   2.   In the case of private streets or drives, the vision clearance triangle
shall be measured from the back of curb or edge of the private road surface and
the point of intersection with the right-of-way line.
   3.   Staff may require an engineering analysis to be performed and submitted
for review before permits are issued. Based on the analysis, differing greater
or lesser dimensions may be required based upon the current standards of the
Institute of Transportation Engineers or the Association of American State
Highway Officials.

11-4-6 STREET FRONTAGE.
   Except as provided in this section, no lot shall contain any building used,
in whole or in part, for any residence purposes unless such lot abuts for at
least 40 feet on at least one public street. An exclusive unobstructed ingress/
egress easement of access or right-of-way of at least 24 feet wide to a public
street may be used to satisfy this requirement in unique circumstances.
11-4-7 ACCESSORY BUILDINGS.
   Accessory buildings require a permit and a fee in an amount determined, from
time to time, by resolution of the Council.

buildings with floor area less than or equal to 75 square feet are permitted to
encroach into the secondary front yard. In this case, the “secondary front
yard” is defined as that yard that fronts on a public street or ROW, but does
not contain the main entrance to the principal structure. See
figure 11-4-8.3 in Section
11-4-8 of this chapter.
      B.   Principal Building Relationship. Accessory buildings, except
buildings housing animals or fowl, may be erected as part of the principal

such accessory building shall be considered as part of the principal building
for all yard requirements and building codes.
      C.   Height. No accessory building shall exceed one story or 15 feet in
maximum height.
      D.   Accessory buildings shall not be constructed in such a way as to
impede drainageways or interfere with overland flowage easements.

11-4-13 COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT.
   1.   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish general guidelines
for the siting of communication equipment and communication towers. The goal of
this section is to encourage the location of communication towers and equipment
in areas of the City which would be least adversely impacted by the visual,
aesthetic, and safety implications of their siting; minimize the total number
of communication towers throughout the City; strongly encourage the joint use
of new and existing tower sites; and enhance the ability of the providers of
telecommunication services to provide such services to the community quickly,
efficiently, and effectively.
   2.   City Policies and Criteria. The Telecommunications Act of 1996
prohibits the City from establishing policies that discriminate against one or
a group of telecommunication providers in favor of another group of providers
or potential group of providers. The following criteria will be applied
consistently to all telecommunication providers that request a permit:
      A.   Communication Equipment. Communication equipment shall be permitted
in any residential, commercial, or manufacturing district. Communication
equipment shall:
         (1)   Be screened from adjoining properties by the use of landscape
plantings, screen fences, walls, or parapet extensions when located on a
building. The City is aware of the operating needs of these types of structures
and acknowledges that it may be impossible to totally screen communication
equipment or a tower; however, every effort must be made by the communication
equipment owner to minimize visual impact of the communication equipment on
surrounding properties.
         (2)   Communication equipment larger than 36 inches in diameter shall
be permitted in rear yards only and is permitted a maximum height of 12 feet.
Such communication equipment must be set back at least five feet from all rear
and side property lines.
         (3)   Communication towers, including television antennas and amateur
radio antennas, not used for commercial purposes, may be utilized in
residential districts, provided they do not exceed 10 feet above the height
limit determined for principal structures in the applicable district and are at
least one-half the total height of the tower from any lot lines. Total height
shall be measured as the distance from the average grade at the base of the
supporting structure to the top of the highest point of the tower, including
beacons and antennas.
      B.   Towers Permitted in Certain Districts; Site Plan. Communication
towers shall be permitted in any C-5, M-1, M-2 Zoning Districts and City-owned
property. A site plan, consistent with the requirements as outlined in the
Clive Development Standards Manual, shall be required for all new communication
tower and equipment facilities, expansion of existing facilities, or major
modifications of existing facilities.
      C.   Required Information. In addition to site plan requirements as set
forth herein, the following information must be provided for review of a
communication equipment development request:
         (1)   Map showing the location of the applicant’s proposed facility
and any existing facilities within three miles of the proposed site location.
         (2)   Report from a structural engineer showing the tower antenna
capacity by type and number, and a certification that the tower is designed to
withstand winds in accordance with ANS/EIA/TIA 222, latest revision standards.
         (3)   Evidence that a valid FCC license for the proposed activity has
been issued.
         (4)   A written agreement signed by the communication facility owner
and property owner to remove the tower, foundation, and any other accessory
equipment within 60 days after abandonment. As used herein, the term
“abandonment” means a communication tower that is not used for its intended and
approved purpose for more than 180 days.
         (5)   Establish that the use of and frequencies emitted from the tower
and equipment will not interfere with the transmissions of law enforcement,
fire, emergency response, public works, or other service agencies.
         (6)   Additional information, as required, to determine that all
applicable zoning and siting regulations are met.
      D.   Tower and Equipment Standards. Communication towers and equipment
shall meet the following design standards:
         (1)   Communication towers shall be set back from all property lines
and all other principal structures a distance of not less than one-half of the
tower height, unless a tower is adjacent to a residential district or City
park, in which case the tower shall be set back a distance of not less than the
full tower height.
         (2)   Communication towers shall have a maximum height of 60 feet in
any permitted zoning district.
         (3)   Communication towers shall be painted a non-contrasting gray or
similar color, minimizing its visibility, unless otherwise required by the
Federal Communications Commission or the Federal Aviation Administration.
         (4)   Lights and signage shall not be permitted on any tower unless
specifically required and permitted by the Federal Communications Commission,
Federal Aviation Authority, and the City.
         (5)   Security fencing eight feet in height shall surround the
communication tower, equipment structure, and any guywires.
         (6)   Communication tower equipment enclosures and accessory
structures shall be designed with architectural compatibility with the
surrounding built environment.
         (7)   Communication facilities mounted to a building wall shall be
painted to blend with the color and materials of the surface to which it is
attached. All wiring and accessory equipment shall be concealed from view.
Communication facilities located above the roof of the structure shall be
appropriately screened from view through the use of panels, walls, fences, or
other screening techniques approved by the City.
      E.   Number of Towers Limited. In order to minimize the overall number of
towers within the City, providers can be required to collocate and enter into
collocation agreements.
         (1)   All new communication towers, and any preexisting communication
towers, owned by a licensed carrier, upon which this section permits
collocation of additional communication facilities, shall be made available for
use by the owner or initial user thereof, together with as many other licensed
carriers as can be technically collocated thereon. However, nothing in this
section shall prevent such licensed carriers from charging a reasonable fee for
the collocation of additional communication facilities upon said tower which
does not exceed the fair market value for the space occupied.
         (2)   All licensed carriers shall cooperate with each other in
collocating additional communication facilities upon such towers. All licensed
carriers shall exercise in good faith in collocating with other licensed
carriers and in the sharing of towers, including technical information to
evaluate the feasibility of collocation. This covenant of good faith and fair
dealing shall be a condition of any permit issued pursuant to this section for
a new communication tower.
      F.   Compliance with Federal Regulations. Communication towers and
equipment shall meet or exceed the current standards and regulations of the
Federal Aviation Administration, and any other agency of the federal government
with the authority to regulate communication towers and equipment.
   3.   Review of Application by Technical Expert. The Community Development
Director is authorized to submit a communication equipment development
application to an independent technical expert to review any technical
materials submitted including, but not limited to, those required under this
section. The applicant shall pay all reasonable costs of said review, including
any administrative costs incurred by the City. Any proprietary information
disclosed to the City, or the technical expert hired, shall remain confidential
and shall not be disclosed to any third party.

register on forms provided by the Community Development Department.
   3.   Covenants; Requirements of Association.
      A.   In accordance with covenants formed by such associations, provisions
shall provide for the maintenance of uses and structures including, but not
limited to:
         (1)   Walls and fences;

condition of the structure or use. If the structure or use is not improved,
then such use shall be construed as a site plan violation and enforced as such.
   4.   Responsibilities. Provisions set forth in the covenant shall become the
responsibility of the subdivision association when 70 percent of the lots are
developed, unless otherwise stated in the agreement.
11-4-15 PROHIBITION ON SALE OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES FROM DRIVE-THROUGH WINDOW.
   No sale of alcoholic beverages shall be made from a drive-through window in
any zoning district classification in the City.
11-4-16 ADULT ORIENTED BUSINESSES.
   In adopting the zoning ordinance, it is recognized that adult entertainment
facilities have certain objectionable side effects which render these
facilities incompatible with residential, public, and other family uses, when
the adult facilities are located close to or adjacent to such uses. This
section seeks to ensure that residential, public, family-orientated business,
and adult entertainment facilities will be located in separate and compatible
locations. It is a subject of legitimate concern for the City to use its zoning
power to preserve the quality of life, preserve the City’s neighborhoods, and
to meet effectively the increasing encroachments upon the quality of life
within the City.
   1.   Location. No person, whether as principal or agent, clerk, or employee,
either for himself or any other person, or as an officer of any corporation, or
otherwise, shall place, maintain, own, or operate any adult bookstore, adult

to intervening structures, from the closest exterior structural wall of each
business. The distance between any adult entertainment facilities and any
religious institution, school, or public park, governmental office,
supermarket, restaurant, or any property designated for residential use or used
for residential purposes shall be measured in a straight line, without regard
to intervening structures, from the closest property line of the adult
entertainment facility to the closest property line of the religious
institution, school, public park, government office, supermarket, restaurant,
or the property designated for residential use or used for residential
purposes.
   3.   Restrictions. All building openings, entries, windows, etc., shall be
located, covered, or screened in such a manner to prevent a view into the
interior from public or semipublic area; and for construction, and whenever
else it seems feasible by the City, the building shall be orientated so as to
minimize any possibility of viewing the interior from public or semipublic
areas. Adult material advertisements, displays, or other promotional materials
shall not be shown or exhibited so as to be visible to the public from
pedestrian sidewalks, or walkways, or from other areas, public or semipublic.

11-4-19 RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS.
   1.   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish general guidelines
for the location and operation of wind and solar energy systems and associated
equipment. The intent of this section is to balance the need for clean,
renewable energy with the necessity to protect the health, safety, and general
welfare of the community. The City finds these regulations are necessary to
ensure that renewable energy systems are appropriately designed, sited, and
installed.
   2.   General Regulations.
      A.   Restriction on Use of Electricity Generated. Energy generated by
renewable energy systems shall be used exclusively to supply electrical power
for on-site consumption, except that when a parcel on which a renewable energy
system is installed also receives electrical power supplied by a utility
company, excess electrical power generated and not presently needed for on-site
use may be used by the utility company in accordance to State and local utility
company requirements.
      B.   Interconnection. The renewable energy systems shall meet the
requirements for interconnection and operations as set forth by MidAmerican
Energy and the Iowa Utilities Board. No building permits shall be issued until
the applicant has provided a copy of an executed interconnection agreement.
Off-grid systems shall be exempt from this requirement.
      C.   Lighting. Lights shall not be permitted on any renewable energy
system unless specifically required and permitted by the Federal Aviation
Authority or other federal or State agencies, and the City.
      D.   Signage. No advertising or signage other than required safety
signage and equipment labels shall be permitted on any renewable energy system.
No temporary signage shall be permitted to be mounted or otherwise affixed to
any renewable energy system. One sign, limited to four square feet, shall be
posted at or near the base of any ground-mounted solar energy system or any
wind energy system. The sign shall include a notice of no trespassing, a
warning of high voltage (if applicable), and the phone number of the property
owner/operator to call in case of emergency.
      E.   Maintenance. Facilities shall be well maintained in an operational
condition that poses no potential safety hazard. Should the renewable energy
system fall into disrepair and be in such dilapidated condition that it poses a
safety hazard or would be considered generally offensive to the senses of the
general public, the system may be deemed a public nuisance and may be abated in
accordance with Title 5 Chapter 6 of this Code.
      F.   Noise. No renewable energy system shall emit sound exceeding the
requirements established in
Title 5 Chapter 8 of this Code.
      G.   Electromagnetic Interference. All renewable energy systems shall be
designed and constructed so as not to cause radio and television interference.
If it is determined that the system is causing electromagnetic interference,
the operator shall take the necessary corrective action to eliminate this
interference, including relocation or removal of the facilities, subject to the
approval of the appropriate City authority. A permit granting a renewable
energy system may be revoked if electromagnetic interference from the system
becomes evident.
      H.   Removal. If the renewable energy system remains nonfunctional or
inoperative for a continuous period of one year, the system shall be deemed to
be abandoned. The owner/operator shall remove the abandoned system at their
expense. Removal of the system includes the entire structure, collector panels,
and related equipment from the property. Should the owner/operator fail to
remove the renewable energy system, the system will be considered a public
nuisance and will be abated in accordance with
Title 5 Chapter 6 of this Code.
      I.   Nonconforming Systems. A renewable energy system that has been
installed on or before the effective date of this section, is in active use,
and does not comply with any or all of the provisions of this section shall be
considered a legal nonconforming structure and will be regulated by the
provisions noted in Section
11-4-3 of this title.
   3.   Wind Energy Systems. The following criteria will be applied
consistently to all small Wind Energy Conversion System (SWECS) providers that
request a permit:
      A.   Special Use Permit Requirements. An SWECS shall only be allowed as
an accessory structure to a permitted principal use and shall require special
use permit approval from the Board of Adjustment prior to construction,
installation, and operation. As a condition of approval of the special use
permit, the applicant shall execute an SWECS operations agreement which shall
be recorded by the appropriate County Recorder’s office. The agreement will
memorialize the responsibilities of the property owner and allow the City to
access the property in order to remove the SWECS, if the property owner does
not comply with this section. The Board of Adjustment may review the issuance
of a special use permit, at any time, if a previously approved system does not
comply with the rules set forth in this section or the conditions imposed by
the Board of Adjustment. The owner/operator of the SWECS shall obtain all other
permits required by federal, State, and local agencies prior to construction
and operation of the system.
      B.   Construction Permits. Applications for the construction of an SWECS
shall be accompanied by standard drawings of the wind turbine, including the
tower, base, and footings. An engineering analysis, certified by a State
licensed professional engineer, shall be provided demonstrating that the tower
is compliant with the applicable Building Code. For roof-mounted structures, an
engineering analysis, certified by an State licensed professional engineer,
shall be provided demonstrating that the mounting method is compliant with the
applicable Building Code. Applications shall also be accompanied by a line
drawing of the electrical components in sufficient detail to allow for a
determination that the manner of installation conforms to the Electrical Code.
All electrical components must be listed as meeting Code recognized test
standards.
      C.   Bulk Regulations.

         (5)   No SWECS shall be installed in any location where its proximity
with existing fixed broadcast, retransmission, or reception antenna for radio,
television, or wireless phone or other personal communication systems would
produce electromagnetic interference with signal transmission or reception. If
it is determined that the SWECS is causing electromagnetic interference, the
operator shall take the necessary corrective action to eliminate this
interference including relocation or removal of the facilities, subject to the
City.
         (6)   The enactment of this section does not constitute the granting
of an easement by the City. The owner/operator shall obtain covenants,
easements, or similar documentation to assure sufficient wind to operate the
SWECS. unless adequate accessibility to the wind is provided by the site.
         (7)   No SWECS shall be installed and operated in a manner that causes
a shadow flicker to fall on any occupied adjacent structure.
      E.   Owner Responsibilities.
         (1)   The property owner of any SWECS shall maintain such system in a
safe and attractive manner, including replacement of defective parts, painting,
cleaning, and other acts that may be required for the maintenance and upkeep of
the function and appearance of such a system.
         (2)   At least every 24 months, every tower mounted SWECS shall be
inspected by an expert who is regularly involved in the maintenance,
inspection, or erection of towers. At a minimum, this inspection shall be
conducted in accordance with the tower inspection checklist provided in the
Electronics Industries Association (EIA) Standard 222, “Structural Standards
for Steel Antenna Towers and Antenna Support Structures ” Inspection record
shall provide verifiable proof of ongoing energy production. A copy of the
inspection record shall be provided to the City.
         Any SWECS that is not operated for a continuous period of 180 days
shall be considered abandoned and shall be removed within 30 days. Removal of
the system includes the entire structure including foundations, transmission
equipment, and fencing from the property. If the abandoned SWECS is not removed
in the specified amount of time, the City may remove it and recover its costs
from the property owner.
         Operation of a wind energy system includes, but is not limited to, the
actual production of measurable energy. Wind energy systems that function
mechanically, but no longer produce energy, shall be considered abandoned.
         (3)   The owner/operator of a wind energy conversion system must
demonstrate adequate liability insurance. Upon the granting of a permit,
applicant shall assume full responsibility for any and all damages, claims,
expenses, liabilities, judgments, and costs of any kind, including reasonable
attorney fees related to or caused by the erection, location, use, or removal
of a facility, whether on public or private property, and shall agree to hold
the City harmless, indemnify and defend it from all such liabilities incurred
or judgments entered against it as a result of the erection, location, use, or
removal of the facility.
   4.   Solar Energy Systems. No Solar Energy Systems (SES) shall be installed
within the City without first obtaining a building permit. The following
criteria will be applied consistently to all solar energy system providers that
request a permit:
      A.   Engineer Certification. Applications for any SES shall be
accompanied by standard drawings of the receiving structure, if newly
constructed, including the supporting frame and footings. For systems to be
mounted on existing buildings, an engineering analysis showing sufficient
structural capacity of the receiving structure to support the SES per the
applicable code regulations, certified by an State licensed professional
engineer shall be submitted.
      B.   Color. The SES shall be a neutral color. All surfaces shall be
nonreflective to minimize glare that could affect adjacent or nearby
properties. Measures to minimize nuisance glare may be required, including
modifying the surface material, placement, or orientation of the system, and if
necessary, adding screening to block glare.
      C.   Building integrated and building mounted systems shall be allowed in
all zoning districts.
         (1)   Location. Placement of building integrated SES and building-
mounted SES systems shall adhere to all local fire and building code
regulations.

         (1)   Special Use Permit Requirements. An SES shall only be allowed as
an accessory structure to a permitted principal use and shall require special
use permit approval from the Board of Adjustment prior to construction,
installation, and operation.
As a condition of approval of the special use permit, the applicant shall
execute an SES operations agreement, which shall be recorded by the appropriate
County Recorder’s office. The agreement will memorialize the responsibilities
of the property owner and allow the City to access the property in order to
remove the SES if the property owner does not comply with this section.
The Board of Adjustment may review the issuance of a special use permit, at any
time, if a previously approved system does not comply with the rules set forth
in this section or the conditions imposed by the Board of Adjustment. The
owner/operator of the SES shall obtain all other permits required by federal,
State, and local agencies prior to construction and operation of the system.
         (2)   Bulk Regulations.

and rear yards only. SES units shall be setback 10 feet from side and rear
property lines.
11-4-20 PAWNBROKERS AND DELAYED DEPOSIT SERVICES.
   It is recognized that pawnbrokers and delayed deposit service facilities
have certain objectionable side effects which render these facilities
incompatible with residential, public, and family uses, when located close to
or adjacent to such uses. This section seeks to ensure that pawnbrokers and
delayed deposit services will be located in separate and compatible locations
from residential, public, and family uses. It is a subject of legitimate
concern for the City to use its zoning power to preserve the quality of life
and protect the property values and economic vitality of its neighborhoods.
   1.   Location. No person, whether as principal or agent, clerk, or employee,
either themself or any other person, or as an officer of any corporation, or

City, Polk or Dallas County, the Polk or Dallas County Conservation Board, or
the State.
         (4)   Within 1,000 feet of any adult-oriented business, pawnbroker, or
delayed deposit service facility.
   2.   Measurement of Distance. The distance between any two adult-oriented
businesses, pawnbroker, or delayed deposit service facilities shall be measured
in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures, from the closest
exterior structural wall of each business. The distance between any pawnbroker
or delayed deposit service facilities and any daycare, school, church, public
park, or any property designated for residential use, or used for residential
purposes, shall be measured in a straight line, without regard to intervening
structures, from the closest property line of the pawnbroker or delayed deposit
service facility to the closest property line of any daycare, school, church,
public park, or any property designated for residential use or used for
residential purposes.
   3.   Restrictions. Visibility into the store shall be maintained by
utilizing clear, transparent glass on all windows and doors, and by keeping all
windows free of obstructions for at least three feet into the store. Product

11-5-3 INTERPRETATION AND CONFLICT.
   1.   Rules for Determining Boundaries. In cases where the exact location of
the district boundary is not clear as shown on the Official Zoning Map, the
following rules shall be used in determining the location of said district
boundary:
      A.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of
streets or highways shall be construed to follow such centerlines.
      B.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines
shall be construed as following such lot lines.
      C.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following City limits shall be
construed as following City limits.
      D.   Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed
to be midway between the main tracks.
      E.   Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to
follow such shorelines and, in the event of change in the shoreline, shall be
construed as moving with the actual shoreline; boundaries as approximately
following centerlines of streams, creeks, lakes, or other bodies of water shall
be construed to follow such centerlines.
      F.   Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features
indicated in Subsections 1A through 1E of this section shall be so construed.
The scale of the map shall determine distances not specifically indicated on
the Official Zoning Map.
      G.   Where physical features existing on the ground are at variance with
those shown on the Official Zoning Map, or in other circumstances not covered
by Subsections 1A through 1F of this section, the Community Development
Director shall interpret the district boundaries.
   2.   Street Vacations. Vacation of public streets shall cause the land
vacated to automatically be placed in the same district as the abutting side.
Any land annexed to the City after the effective date hereof shall be zoned R-
1 Residential until rezoned in accordance with this title and the Comprehensive
Plan. Within six months of the annexation of any land into the City, the

Each rezoning request shall be reviewed by the Community Development Department
to ensure that it contains all the information required in this chapter.
   2.   Application Fee. A nonrefundable application fee in an amount
determined by resolution of the Council, from time to time, shall be paid to
the City with each rezoning request.
   3.   Accompanying Documents.
      A.   Each rezoning request shall be accompanied by a written request for
a change, a rezoning map, a master plan, or development plan as required
herein, all in accordance with the provisions outlined herein.
         (1)   Plans and Plats Required. The Community Development Director may
require a development plan, site plan, preliminary plat, or conceptual master
plan for any proposed rezoning.
         (2)   Notification of Surrounding Property Owners. After the Community
Development Director has set the Planning and Zoning Commission meeting date,
notice will be sent to the surrounding property owners within 310 feet of the
property to be rezoned. Notice shall be sent not less than seven days prior to
the Planning and Zoning Commission meeting at which the zoning amendment is
first considered. The notice shall contain the date, time, and location of the
Planning and Zoning Commission meeting and Council public hearing.
         (3)   Notification Signs. The City will post at least one rezoning
notification sign containing the time, date, location, and subject of the City
Planning and Zoning Commission meeting and Council public hearing on the
property for which a request has been made. Notification signs shall be posted
at least seven days before the Planning and Zoning Commission meeting and shall
remain until one day after the Council public hearing.
      B.   Any or all of the above-mentioned procedures may be waived by the
Community Development Director for certain minor rezoning matters, such as the
following: rezoning right-of-way, or minor adjustments to zoning boundaries
necessitated by minor adjustments to lots or right-of-way lines at the time of
approval on final plats of a subdivision.
   4.   Development Plans. Development plans are intended to present basic
development information in such a way as to empower area residents, interested
parties, City staff and Council to accurately and decisively formulate opinions
on the proposed development. Development plans shall be required for all
proposed rezoning of land within the City to a commercial or manufacturing
district. The Community Development Director may require a master plan for the
proposed rezoning to residential districts. Similar to development plans,
master plans indicate, on a more general scale, the limits and effect of
proposed development.
      A.   Development plans, as well as master plans, shall show, at a
minimum, proposed building footprint, utilities, access, parking, and open
space. Additionally, the plan shall demonstrate how the development enhances
the established neighborhood and the character of the City at large. The
Community Development Director may require additional information at their
discretion, which they feel will further the intent of the development plan.
      B.   The Community Development Director may suspend the requirement of a
development plan if:
         (1)   The Council initiates the rezoning.
         (2)   The actual development of the property is likely to be delayed
for a substantial time period, and the development plan is likely to
substantially change prior to actual development, and the rezoning is in
accordance with the Comprehensive Plan.
         (3)   If the rezoning is not in accordance with the Comprehensive
Plan, the Community Development Director may require a Comprehensive Plan
amendment in addition to the development plan requirement. Such suspension is
not a waiver of the requirement.
11-5A-5 OFFICIAL ACTION REQUIRED.
   1.   Initial Action by Council. When a petition meeting the requirements of
this chapter is presented to the Council, or if the Council elects to initiate
an amendment, the Council shall receive and file said petition and refer it to
the Planning and Zoning Commission for consideration of such amendment prior to
the date of the public hearing.
   2.   Action by Planning and Zoning Commission. After receiving the proposed
amendment from the Council, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall review the
proposed amendment, and report its recommendations within 60 days to the
Council for final action.
   3.   Action by Council.
      A.   After receiving the Planning and Zoning Commission recommendations,
the Council, at a public hearing, shall then take final action on the proposed
amendment, after public notice in accordance with applicable State law. The
amendment shall become effective by the favorable vote of a majority of all the
members of the Council. However, in the case of a proposed rezoning of property
if: a) the Planning and Zoning Commission disapproves of the amendment; or b) a
written protest against an amendment is filed with the Community Development
Department, the proposed amendment shall not become effective, except by the
favorable vote of at least four-fifths of all the members of the Council. Such
protest must be signed by the owners of 20 percent or more of the land included
in the proposed amendment, or by the owners of 20 percent or more of the
property which is located within 310 feet of the exterior boundaries of the
proposed amendment (exclusive of public property and intervening right-of-way).
      B.   The Council may make approval of the development plan contingent
upon the completion of construction and improvements within a reasonable period
of time; provided, however, that in the determination of such period, the
Council shall consider the scope and magnitude of the development project and
any schedule of construction and improvements submitted by the developer.
Failure to complete all construction and improvements within said period of
time shall be deemed sufficient cause for the Council, in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter, to rezone the unimproved property to the
classification effective at the time of original submission of the development
plan, unless an extension is recommended by the Commission and approved by the
Council for due cause shown. For the purposes of this title, “unimproved”
property means all property situated within the development plan area upon
which the installation of improvements has not been commenced.

      A.   Purpose. The Highway Commercial District is intended to provide for
major business and commercial districts to serve the highway traveling
population.
      B.   Automobile and Travel Plaza. Automobile and truck travel plazas
shall be under single ownership, management, or control and may be
characterized by a concentrated group of structures and compatible uses.
Various facilities shall be designed to be used in common, such as access
roads, parking, and loading areas, lighting, signs, and walks. For automobile
and truck travel plazas, the following regulations shall apply, except as
otherwise provided herein:
         (1)   Minimum lot area is 25 acres. No minimum lot area shall be
required for individual lots or tracts with the same area, provided that all
such development shall be in accordance with the site plan and development of
such individual lots or tracts and all common facilities within such area shall
remain under single management or control.
         (2)   The Community Development Director or the Council may also
require a statement of financial responsibility to assure construction of the
development in accordance with the submitted site plan and the requirements of
this chapter.
11-7-3 AUXILIARY USES.
   An “auxiliary use” shall mean a conditional use consisting of certain low
intensity commercial establishments which are primarily intended, designed, and
utilized to serve the proven needs within the C-3 and C-4 Districts of the
principal permitted uses that are in existence or that will be constructed at
or about the same time as the auxiliary use. Possible auxiliary uses are listed
in Section
11-7-4 of this chapter and noted with an “A.” In C-3 Zoning Districts, any
enterprise that cannot wholly enclose its functions within the principal
structure shall be prohibited. The Council may permit an auxiliary use within a
C-3 or C-4 District as part of a development plan, provided that the following
conditions are satisfied:
   1.   The auxiliary use shall primarily serve the needs within the C-3 or C-
4 District of the principal permitted uses that are then in existence or that
will be constructed at or about the same time as the auxiliary use.
   2.   The design, aesthetics, location, and character of the auxiliary
structure or use shall be compatible with the principal permitted uses within
the C-3 or C-4 District and abutting or nearby properties in adjoining zoning
districts.
   3.   The auxiliary use shall not adversely affect the setting and quality of
development for the principal permitted uses within the C-3 or C-4 District due
to over concentration or over saturation within the C-3 or C-4 District.
   4.   The auxiliary use shall not generate substantial additional traffic nor
create traffic congestion beyond that which would occur if any principal
permitted use were to locate on the same site.
   5.   The auxiliary use shall not be hazardous, detrimental, or disturbing to
principal permitted uses, nor to adjoining or abutting properties due to dust,
glare, noises, smoke, odor, fumes, vibration, or other effects not consistent
with the principal permitted uses within the C-3 or C-4 District.
   6.   The auxiliary uses shall incorporate the site's natural and scenic
features into the development design.
11-7-4 PRINCIPAL PERMITTED USES.
   Principal permitted uses for commercially zoned property are listed in the

11-8-1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION.
   The TC-1, TC-2, TC-3, and TC-4 Town Center Zoned Districts are intended and
designed to provide for an economically viable, diverse place, located within
and adjacent to the NW 86th Street corridor, with quality residential,
commercial, service, employment, and recreational uses of various densities and
intensities needed to promote quality of life, health, and general welfare of
citizens and visitors within the City and which draws citizens and visitors to
the corridor. It shall be generally recognized that the type of use is not as
important as the manner in which the use is accomplished. It is intended that
the district shall not be used indiscriminately to permit any use that could
potentially be detrimental to the intent of the zoning ordinance. For the
purposes of this chapter, other than the principal permitted uses table, the
regulations contained here within shall only apply to the redevelopment, or
substantial expansion of the existing development, of the properties currently
zoned TC-1, TC-2, TC-3, and TC-4. The term “substantial expansion of the
existing development” shall mean the cumulative set of site improvements that
result in the expansion of the impervious surface area of the site by more than
15 percent of the surface area of the property at the time of adoption hereof.
If the proposed site improvements result in less than a 15 percent expansion of
the impervious surface area of the site, the zoning district regulations and
design standards for that property that existed prior to the rezoning of the
property to TC-1, TC-2, TC-3, or TC-4 shall be applicable with respect to the
proposed site improvements. The principal permitted uses table in this chapter
shall continue to be enforced in accordance with the current zoning district of
each property.
11-8-2 PURPOSES OF DISTRICTS.
   1.   TC-1 North End Development Area. The North End Development Area
District is designed to provide land for the orderly and logical development of
a complete and intensive community shopping center with a broad range of retail
and professional office use which exhibits a high quality of architectural and
design elements. The district will incorporate high quality materials in unique
architectural designs and substantial plantings of trees, shrubs, and other
plant materials. The district will be developed with a network of connecting
parking lots with minimal street openings to NW 86th Street and Hickman Road.
   2.   TC-2 Residential Development Area. The Residential Development Area
District is primarily intended to provide opportunities for medium density
condo/townhome residential development preserving the integrity and value of
the existing single-family neighborhoods. The district will be designed so that
the residential structures engage the street, providing the massing and
building form that helps define the block. The district will incorporate high
quality materials and unique architectural designs. Open space will be used to
accent the architectural and natural features of the residential development
within the district.
   3.   TC-3 Mixed Use Development Area. The Mixed Use Development Area
District is designed to provide land for mixed use development incorporating
retail commercial and office uses with residential and recreational
opportunities. The district will be primarily developed with ground level
retail commercial and upper-level office or residential uses. Pedestrian
traffic is considered a priority and shall be well planned for throughout the
district. The district will incorporate high quality materials and unique
architectural designs. Public and private plaza and courtyard open space are
encouraged.
   4.   TC-4 Entertainment Development Area. The Entertainment Development Area
District is intended to provide for an office and regional commercial
entertainment center and will be designed in consideration of public plazas or
courtyards, Clive Greenbelt Park, historical amenities, and other urban open
space that can serve as a focal point for community activities. The area will
include retail/commercial, office, entertainment, residential, institutional,
and open space uses. The buildings within the district will be constructed with
high quality materials and will be designed to form part of a larger
composition rather than being designed in isolation of one another.
11-8-3 PRINCIPAL PERMITTED USES.
   Principal permitted uses for Town Center zoned property may be found below.
Where a use is not expressly listed below, the Community Development Director
shall have authority to determine if the use is compatible and consistent with
the surrounding environment. If it is determined by the Community Development
Director that the proposed use is not compatible and consistent with the
surrounding environment, the property owner shall have the right to appeal the
decision to the Board of Adjustment pursuant to the regulations and
requirements as expressed in
Chapter 3 of this title.

11-8-3-1 AUXILIARY USES.
   An “auxiliary use” shall mean a conditional use consisting of certain low
intensity commercial establishments which are primarily intended, designed, and
utilized to serve the proven needs within the TC-1, TC-3, or TC-4 District of
the principal permitted uses that are in existence or that will be constructed
at or about the same time as the auxiliary use. Possible auxiliary uses are
listed in Section
11-8-3 of this chapter and noted with an “A.” In TC-1, TC-3, or TC-4 Zoning

principal structure shall be prohibited. The Council may permit an auxiliary
use within a TC-1, TC-3, or TC-4 District as part of a development plan,
provided that the following conditions are satisfied:
   1.   The auxiliary use shall primarily serve the needs within the TC-1, TC-
3, or TC-4 District of the principal permitted uses that are then in existence
or that will be constructed at or about the same time as the auxiliary use.
   2.   The design, aesthetics, location, and character of the auxiliary
structure or use shall be compatible with the principal permitted uses within
the TC-1, TC-3, or TC-4 District and abutting or nearby properties in adjoining
zoning districts.
   3.   The auxiliary use shall not adversely affect the setting and quality of

11-9-1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION.
   The Planned Unit Development District is intended and designed to promote
and encourage development or redevelopment of tracts of land on a planned,
unified basis by allowing greater flexibility for those developments that
propose a creative and innovative design whose layout is not achievable under
the standards of other zoning districts. A planned unit development shall
consist of an arrangement and selection of land uses in groupings that are
organized and designed as an integrated unit rather than a collection of
independent building and sites. The integrated design shall include a holistic
presentation of elements such as building orientation and materials, utilities,
parking areas, traffic and pedestrian circulation, landscaping and open spaces
that satisfy the individual site needs while achieving greater value for the
entire development area.
11-9-2 CRITERIA.
   The Planned Unit Development District shall be reserved for only those
developments, which meet one or more of the following criteria:
   1.   Developments that provide for varying land uses to coexist within the
same development so that the growing demands of the population may be met by
greater variety in type, design, and layout.
   2.   Developments which encourage a more efficient use of land through the
incorporation of public/private spaces or uses which enhance the community at
large.
   3.   Developments that provide both public and private open spaces that
accent and enhance both the architectural and natural features of the
development and provide for the protection and preservation of existing
vegetative and water resources.
   4.   Developments that present a common and unified theme through the use of
architecturally compatible detailing to form a part of a larger composition
rather than separate land uses designed in isolation of one another.
11-9-3 PRINCIPAL PERMITTED USES.
   Principal permitted uses for planned unit development zoned property shall
consist of residential uses, neighborhood commercial uses, and neighborhood
office uses. If it is determined by the Council that a proposed use is not
compatible and consistent with the proposed planned unit development, the
property owner shall have the right to appeal the decision to the Board of
Adjustment pursuant to the regulations and requirements as expressed in
Chapter 3 of this title.
   1.   “Residential uses” shall be defined as single-family residential,
attached dwellings, multiple-family residential, assisted, and independent
living facilities and nursing homes.
   2.   “Neighborhood commercial uses” shall be defined as those uses which
normally and customarily service the surrounding residential properties.
Neighborhood commercial uses shall include, but not be limited to, dry
cleaners, delis, coffee shops, markets, convenience stores, and small retail
establishments.
   3.   “Neighborhood office uses” shall be defined as those office uses which
normally and customarily service the surrounding residential properties.
Neighborhood commercial uses shall include, but not be limited to, small
medical clinics, veterinarians, and banks.
11-9-4 ACCESSORY BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
   1.   Accessory buildings may be constructed in planned unit development
zoned lots as permitted in Section
11-4-7 of this title.
   2.   Accessory structures may be constructed in planned unit development
zoned lots as permitted in Section
11-4-8 of this title. Where the planned unit development is not specifically
mentioned, the requirements shall be consistent with the commercial district
regulations.
11-9-5 SIGNAGE REQUIREMENTS.
   Signage within a planned unit development shall serve as a unifying element
while creating measured and consistent identification of the various land uses
within the planned unit development.
11-9-6 PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
   Adequate parking shall be provided within the planned unit development based
upon the proposed uses. Shared parking for varying uses shall be strongly
encouraged.
11-9-7 OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
   Open space requirements within a planned unit development shall consist of
both public and private landscape areas, natural areas, plazas, and courtyards
designed to enhance the architectural and natural features of the development.
11-9-8 ARCHITECTURAL REQUIREMENTS.
   Buildings within a planned unit development shall be designed to be
architecturally compatible with each other and should be seen as a larger
composition as opposed to individual buildings. Buildings shall be designed to
promote quality architecture and design elements along all four building
elevations. The use of colors, materials, facade projections and recesses,
articulated rooflines, enhanced entrances, lighting, windows, or awnings shall
be used to make the development architecturally compatible as a whole.
11-9-9 BULK REGULATIONS.
   Density, setbacks, and height requirements shall be clearly specified within
the development plan and development agreement.
11-9-10 DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT.
   A development plan and development agreement shall be required for all
Planned Unit Development Districts. The development plan shall include a
narrative section that identifies the primary objectives of the development, as
well as providing specific guidelines and design standards related to the
development including, but not limited to, size, location, and uses of
buildings, bulk regulations, parking configurations and requirements,
architectural standards, landscaping, open space design, signage design and
location, pedestrian access, and utilities. In addition to the development
plan, a development agreement shall be required of the developer, which shall
acknowledge the developer’s commitment to develop the property in accordance
with the development plan.

11-10-1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION.
   The M-1 and M-2 Industrially Zoned Districts are intended and designed to
provide for areas within the City deemed appropriate for value added and
manufacturing processes of various intensities needed by the business and
technology population of a local, State, and national level while promoting the
quality of life, health, and general welfare desired by the citizens of the
City, all consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. The development will
incorporate high quality materials in unique designs with substantial buffering
and the incorporation of trees, shrubs, and other plant materials. It shall be
generally recognized that the type of use is not so important as the manner in
which the use is accomplished. It is intended that the district shall not be
used indiscriminately to permit any use that could potentially be detrimental
to the intent of this chapter. No use shall be permitted to be established or
maintained which, by reason of its nature or manner of operation, is or may
become hazardous, noxious, or offensive owing to the emission of odor, dust,
smoke, cinders, gas, fumes, vibrations, refuse matter, or waste. The best
practical means known for disposal of refuse material, the abatement of
obnoxious or offensive odor, dust, smoke, gas, noise, or similar nuisance shall
be employed.
11-10-2 PRINCIPAL PERMITTED USES.
   1.   M-1 Light Industrial Park. Principal permitted uses as listed in
Subsection 3 of this section.
   2.   M-2 Heavy Industrial Park.

FW
 
11-11-1 STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSE.
   1.   Authority. The Legislature of the State has in Chapter 414 of the Code
of Iowa, as amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations
to secure safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
   2.   Findings of Fact.
      A.   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health, and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community.
      B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by:
         (1)   The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood
damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately
elevated or otherwise protected from flooding; and
         (2)   The cumulative effect of obstructions on the floodplain causing
increases in flood heights and velocities.
      C.   This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
   3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Subsection 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
      A.   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows
so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
      B.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
      C.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
      D.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
      E.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
11-11-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   1.   Lands to Which Chapter Apply. The provisions of this chapter shall
apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City shown on the Official
Floodplain Zoning Map as being within the boundaries of the Floodway Overlay,
Floodway Fringe Overlay, and General Floodplain Overlay Districts, as
established in Section
11-5-1 of this title.
   2.   Establishment of Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) for Polk County and Incorporated Areas, City, panels
19153C0165F, 0305F, 0310F, 0326F, 0327F dated February 1, 2019, which were
prepared as part of the Flood Insurance Study for Polk County, is (are) hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be the Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The
flood profiles and all explanatory material contained with the Flood Insurance
Study are also declared to be a part of this chapter.
   3.   Rules for Interpretation of District Boundaries. The boundaries of the
zoning district areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the Official
Floodplain Zoning Map. When an interpretation is needed as to the exact
location of a boundary, the Community Development Director shall make the
necessary interpretation.
   4.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
   5.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated Floodplain District areas will be
free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on
the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
   6.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
   7.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.
11-11-3 ADMINISTRATION.
   1.   Appointment, Duties, and Responsibilities of Local Official.

         (8)   Such other information as the Administrator deems reasonably
necessary for the purpose of this chapter.
      C.   Action on Permit Application. The Administrator shall, within a
reasonable time, make a determination as to whether the proposed floodplain
development meets the applicable standards of this chapter and shall approve or
disapprove the application. For disapprovals, the applicant shall be informed,
in writing, of the specific reasons therefor. The Administrator shall not issue
permits for variances except as directed by the Board of Adjustment.
      D.   Construction and Use to be as Provided In Application and Plans.
Floodplain Development Permits based on the basis of approved plans and
applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in
such approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement, or
construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction in conflict with that
approved permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. The applicant
shall be required to submit certification by a professional engineer or land
surveyor, as appropriate, registered in the State, that the finished fill,
building floor elevations, floodproofing, or other flood protection measures
were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to
the use or occupancy of any structure.
11-11-4 FLOODWAY OVERLAY DISTRICT – FW.
   1.   Permitted Uses. The following uses, having a low flood damage potential
and not obstructing flood flow, shall be permitted within the Floodway Overlay
District to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or
statute, and provided they do not require structures, fill, fences, or storage
of materials or equipment, excavation, or alteration of a watercourse. In
addition, no use shall adversely affect the capacity or flow of Walnut Creek or
North Walnut Creek or the channels or floodways of any tributary to Walnut
Creek or North Walnut Creek or any other drainage facility or system. All other
uses permitted within the underlying zoning district shall be expressly
prohibited unless otherwise noted herein.
      A.   Agricultural uses such as, but not limited to, general farming,
nurseries, horticulture, truck farming, and sod farming.

      D.   Such other open space uses similar in nature to the above uses, as
determined by the Community Development Director.
      E.   Utility transmission lines, including poles and towers.
   2.   Performance Standards. All Floodway Overlay District uses allowed as a
permitted use shall meet the following standards:
      A.   No use shall be permitted in the Floodway Overlay District that
would result in any increase in the base flood elevation. Consideration of the
effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption
that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly situated
lands.
      B.   All uses within the Floodway Overlay District shall:
         (1)   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
         (2)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
         (3)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are
resistant to flood damage.
      C.   No use shall affect the capacity or conveyance of the channel or
floodway of any tributary to the mainstream, drainage ditch, or any other
drainage facility or system.
      D.   Structures, buildings, and sanitary and utility systems, if
permitted, shall meet the applicable performance standards of the Floodway
Fringe Overlay District, and shall be constructed or aligned to present the
minimum possible resistance to flood flows.

modifications) must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within
the altered or relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations
must be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
      H.   Any fill allowed in the floodway must be shown to have some
beneficial purpose and shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary.
      I.   Pipeline river or stream crossings shall be buried in the streambed
and banks or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due to channel
degradation and meandering or due to the action of flood flows.
11-11-5 FLOODWAY FRINGE OVERLAY DISTRICT – FF.

Where base flood data has not been provided on the Flood Insurance Rate Map,
the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such
data. The applicant will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural
Resources with sufficient technical information to make such determination.
      A.   All Structures. All structures shall:
         (1)   Be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement of the structure.
         (2)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
         (3)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are
resistant to flood damage.
      B.   Residential Structures.
         (1)   Residential Structures without Basements. All new or
substantially improved residential structures shall have the lowest floor
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation. Construction
shall be upon compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one
foot above the base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18
feet beyond the limits of any structure erected thereon. Subject to approval by
the Administrator, alternate methods of elevating may be allowed where existing
topography, street grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such
cases, the methods used must be adequate to support the structure as well as
withstand the various forces and hazards associated with flooding.
         (2)   Residential Structures with Basements.
            a.   All new or substantially improved residential structures with
basements shall have the basement, together with attendant utility and
sanitation systems, floodproofed to a level at least one foot above the base
flood elevation. Construction of floodproofed basements shall:
               i.   Take place within a compacted fill berm which shall, at all
points, be no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation and extend at
such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the limits of any structure erected
thereon;
               ii.   Be constructed such that the lowest part of all basement
external openings, such as doors and windows, are placed at least one foot
above the base flood elevation;
               iii.   Be designed and constructed so that the structure, below
one foot above the base flood elevation, is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water, and with the capability to resist
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy associated with
the base flood; and
               iv.   Be designed so that minimal structural damage will occur
if this design is exceeded.
            b.   A professional engineer registered in the State shall certify
that the floodproofed basement has been designed in accordance with the above
provisions. A record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in
relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the Community Development Director. All
basements constructed in accordance with these provisions shall not be used for
sleeping purposes and shall require the approval and recording of an agreement
that indicates the restriction.
            c.   All new residential structures located in areas that would
become isolated due to flooding of surrounding ground shall be provided with a
means of access that will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the base
flood. However, this criterion shall not apply where the Administrator
determines there is sufficient flood warning time for the protection of life
and property. When estimating flood warning time, consideration shall be given
to the criteria listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa Administrative Code.
   3.   Non-Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved non-
residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level. When
floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State
shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to withstand the
flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact, and uplift forces and other
factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the base
flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
   4.   New and Substantially Improved Structures.
      A.   Fully enclosed areas below the “lowest floor” (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
         (1)   A minimum of two openings, with positioning on at least two
walls, having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
         (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
         (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other

   3.   Sign Area. No more than 75 square feet of ground-mounted sign area
shall be permitted on each lot of record; provided however, if the frontage(s)
of such lot exceeds 500 feet, then 150 square feet of ground-mounted sign area
shall be permitted. The maximum sign area for any individual sign shall not
exceed 75 square feet. The total area of a sign shall be the actual square
footage of one sign face. Double -aced signs may be permitted with the maximum
square footage permitted on each side. The maximum sign area of a ground-
mounted sign shall not exceed 25 square feet; provided, however, the maximum
sign area may be increased five square feet for each additional one foot of
setback over the minimum required setback to a maximum sign area of 75 square
feet. See section
11-12-7(8) “Ground Mounted Sign Regulations Table” of this chapter for more
information.
   4.   Setback Requirement. The minimum setback required for ground-mounted
signs shall be five feet. All signs shall have a side setback not less than the
height of the sign. See section
11-12-7(8) “Ground-Mounted Sign Regulations Table” of this chapter for more
information. A minimum distance of 50 feet shall separate any two ground
mounted signs on the same property.
   5.   Height. The maximum height of a ground mounted sign shall be five feet;
provided, however, the maximum height may be increased one foot for each
additional one foot of setback over the minimum required setback to a maximum
sign height of 15 feet. See section
11-12-7(8) “Ground-Mounted Sign Regulations Table” of this chapter for more
information. For the purpose of measuring the height of the sign when the sign
is placed on a slope, the ground surface at the midpoint between the elevation
of the leading and trailing edge shall be considered the point of measurement.
Where the street is substantially higher or lower than the proposed sign
location, the Council may provide variations on the height requirement as
described in this chapter. “Substantially” is defined, in this case, as a
change in vertical distance greater than five feet. In
Figure 11-12-7(E) of this subsection, the sign height would be calculated at
eight feet in height.

comply with such notice within the time specified in such order, the Community
Development Director is hereby authorized to cause removal of such sign, and
any expense thereto shall be paid by the owner of the building, structure, or
property to which the sign is attached.
11-12-27 SUBSTITUTION.
   The owner of any sign which is otherwise permitted under this chapter may
substitute non-commercial copy in lieu of any other commercial copy. The
purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial
speech over non-commercial speech, or favoring of any particular non-
commercial message over any other commercial message. This provision prevails
over any more specific provision to the contrary. This provision does not
create a right to increase the total amount of signage on a parcel.

11-13-1 TITLE.
   This chapter, providing for the administration and enforcement of parking
regulations, shall be known, and may be cited and referred to as the “City of
Clive Parking and Circulation Requirements.”
11-13-2 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the health, safety, and general
welfare of the citizens, prevent traffic congestion and hazards, provide for
proper traffic safety by preserving the public thoroughfares for the unimpaired
movement of pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicular traffic, provide for attractive,
secure, properly lighted, and well screened off-street parking facilities,
assure the mobility and access of emergency vehicles, provide for appropriately
designed parking facilities in proportion to the needs generated by the varying
types of land use, and minimize the negative visual impacts of large expanses
of parking by reducing glare from parking lots through open space and
landscaping around the parking areas.
11-13-3 JURISDICTION.
   The lawful use of parking facilities existing at the time of the enactment
of this chapter (January 17, 2008) may be continued although such use may not
conform to the regulations herein. For those parking facilities permitted
before the adoption of these regulations, such facilities shall be classified
as “permitted nonconforming” facilities. No permit shall be issued for any lot,
tenant, or development after the effective date hereof and not in substantial
conformity with the provisions of these regulations. Nor shall any parking
facility, except as herein specified, be substantially improved, converted,
enlarged, or otherwise altered without conforming to the provisions of this
chapter.
11-13-4 APPLICABILITY.
   In all districts, in connection with every industrial, commercial, business,
recreational, or dwelling use, and all other uses, space for off-street parking
and storage of vehicles shall be provided in accordance with all of the
following regulations, except as elsewhere provided herein.
11-13-5 OFF-STREET PARKING REGULATIONS.
   All of the following standards shall apply to all off street parking:
   1.   Spaces Required. No structure or use shall be permitted or constructed
unless off-street parking spaces are provided in accordance with the provisions
of this chapter.
   2.   Parking Area Arrangement and Markings. All parking areas shall be so
arranged and marked so as to provide for orderly and safe loading or unloading,
parking and storage of self-propelled vehicles.
   3.   Fractional Spaces. Fractional space requirements shall be rounded up to
the next whole space.
   4.   Uses with Differing Business Hours. The number of required parking
spaces for uses with differing business hours that share a parking lot may be
reduced by 25 percent of the total required for each use, if it is determined
by the Community Development Director that such reduction will not have a
negative impact on the congestion or safety of the development. Special
regulations for Town Center (TC) District: All town center district parking
requirements are subject to Section
11-8-5.
   5.   Principal Building Enlargement. When any principal building is
enlarged, increased in capacity, or when a change in use creates an increase in
the amount of off-street parking space required, additional off street parking
spaces shall be required, in conformity with this chapter.
   6.   Mixed Use Building. For a building where a single tenant has multiple
uses, parking spaces shall be provided in accordance with the parking
requirements of each use. An example of a mixed use building is one containing
a combination of both office and manufacturing uses. The area dedicated to each
use can be calculated at its individual requirement, at the discretion of the
Community Development Director. The tenant may need to demonstrate that the
parking can meet the more restrictive standard if the uses are changed. Special
regulations for Town Center (TC) District: All Town Center district parking
requirements are subject to Section
11-8-5.
   7.   Flexible Space Buildings. Buildings developed as “flexible space” shall
be designed to accommodate six spaces per 1,000 square feet of gross building
area. In the case that a big box retailer is a tenant within a “flexible space”
building, the minimum parking requirements shall be provided in accordance with
the parking requirements of each use. “Big box retailers” shall be defined as a
single tenant user with a minimum square footage of 25,000 square feet in gross
floor area.
   8.   Outdoor Patron Use or Assembly Areas. Outdoor patron use areas or areas
used for assembly shall be included in the gross floor area (GFA) for
calculating parking requirements. Outdoor dining or drinking areas shall be
included in the GFA for bars, restaurants, and taverns when calculating parking
requirements.
   9.   Parking Spaces Displaced by Building Expansion. Any required parking
spaces displaced by building expansion shall be provided elsewhere on the site.
No required off-street parking facility shall be reduced in capacity below the
minimum requirements of this chapter.
   10.   Use of Parking Spaces Restricted. Required parking spaces shall be
used only for parking of vehicles for property owners, guests, renters,
patrons, or employees of the site. Parking spaces shall not be used for the
commercial sale, display, rental, or repair of other motor vehicles, unless
that is the principal use of the site.
   11.   Long Term Storage Prohibited. No outdoor parking spaces or drives
shall be used as long term storage for the following, including, but not
limited to, vehicles, supplies, construction materials, portable sheds. “Long
term,” in this case, shall be defined as a period of time greater than 10 days.
   12.   Parking Areas for Storage or Display of Vehicles.
      A.   All parking of vehicles, including automobiles, vans, campers,
trucks, trailers, tractors, recreational vehicles, boats, construction
equipment, and any other mobile vehicle equipped for street and highway travel
shall occur on permanent impervious surface (concrete or asphalt) areas and on
private property only, except for the special limited uses in this subsection.
Those commercial uses associated with the leasing or selling of vehicles shall
be permitted to temporarily display vehicles on nonpaved surfaces at a rate of
one vehicle per 100 linear feet of street frontage to a maximum of seven
vehicles per street frontage.
      B.   A minimum setback of 10 feet from the property line shall be
required. No vehicle shall be located within a 100-foot vision clearance
triangle at any public street intersection (or private street/driveway with any
public street intersection). At no time shall City ROW between the property
line and the street be used for the parking or display of vehicles.
   13.   Maneuvering and Circulation. Off-street parking facilities shall
accommodate the maneuvering and circulation of all vehicles on-site, so as not
to impair the movement of vehicles on public streets. Except for single-family
and attached dwellings, there shall be no backing of vehicles from an off-
street parking facility into the public street.
   14.   Striping. All parking spaces, except parking spaces for single-family
and attached dwellings, shall be striped in accordance with approved site plan.
The striping shall be maintained in a clear and visible manner.
   15.   Curbs and Gutters. All off-street parking areas and associated
driveways, access roadways, and frontage roads, except driveways for single-
family attached and detached residences, shall be constructed with permanent,
PCC curb and gutter of at least six inches high and 24 inches wide or of
alternate height and width approved by the City. Prefabricated portable curb or
wheel stops shall not be considered an acceptable alternative, unless otherwise
approved by the Council during review of a development request.
   16.   Construction and Maintenance. All parking facilities shall be
designed, constructed, and maintained with security as a priority to protect
the safety of the users. All required parking facilities shall be permanently
maintained, free of litter and debris, potholes, broken curb, etc.
   17.   Auto Repair Shops. For auto repair, car wash, oil change shops, or
other similar uses, lift racks shall not be considered as a required parking
space.

CHAPTER 14
LANDSCAPE AND OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS
 
11-14-1 Title                   11-14-4 Design Standards
11-14-2 Purpose and Scope       11-14-5 Maintenance Requirements
11-14-3 Landscaping Regulations  
 
11-14-1 TITLE.
   This chapter, providing for the administration and enforcement of
landscaping regulations, shall be known, and may be cited and referred to as
the “Landscaping Ordinance of the City of Clive, Iowa.”
11-14-2 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum standards for the
preservation, installation, and maintenance of landscape plantings and
landscaped open space in residential, commercial, and manufacturing districts,
to utilize landscaping and landscaping open space as an effective means of
energy conservation, to preserve open space, to improve property values, to
maintain aesthetic quality of the City, thereby promoting the health and
general welfare of the City.
11-14-3 LANDSCAPING REGULATIONS.
   All of the following standards shall apply to all required landscape
plantings:
   1.   Interference with Site Drainage. Landscape plantings shall not be
placed where they interfere with site drainage.
   2.   Plantings Shown on Approved Site Plan. Landscape plantings shall not be
placed in any public utility easement unless specifically permitted on the
approved site plan.
   3.   Interference with Public Utilities. Plantings shall not be placed where
they may interfere with maintenance of sanitary and storm structures, fire
hydrants, or water valves, or any other public utility.
   4.   Approved Plantings. Landscape planting shall not be placed in any
public street right-of-way unless previously approved by the Council.
   5.   Vision Clearance Triangle. Vision clearance triangle shall be
maintained at all times.
   6.   Restoration with Sod. All disturbed land shall be restored with sod,
unless specifically approved otherwise. In residential districts or uses, the
entire front yard, side yard, and rear yard to the building setback line shall
be sodded. In all cases, the adjacent ROW shall be sodded.
   7.   Survey of Larger Trees. A survey of trees larger than three-inch
caliper in diameter is required for sites with such existing trees. The tree
inventory shall include species, size, and a location map. Such plan shall be
included in the initial development submittal.
   8.   Saving or Replacing Larger Trees. All existing trees larger than three-
inch caliper shall be saved. In the case a tree or trees cannot be saved, trees
shall be replaced. If it is impractical to replace such trees with an equal
size, then several smaller sized plantings totaling, in aggregate, the size of
the removed landscaping, shall be required. The City may require that some of
the landscaping be planted on public property if it is impractical to place all
plantings on that particular site or plat. Replacement trees shall be similar
to those included in the original tree inventory.
   9.   Existing Landscaping Identified and Protected. All existing landscaping
which is not to be removed pursuant to the grading, landscape, or site plan,
shall be clearly identified and, prior to issuance of a grading permit, shall
be protected by fencing located around the dripline of the tree, maximizing the
protection of the root zone area. The Building Official may waive this
requirement if the landscaping to be saved is not located in the immediate area
where construction is to occur.
   10.   Preservation of Existing Landscaping. Whenever practical, existing
landscaping shall be preserved and incorporated into the overall design and
layout of the site.
   11.   Quantity of Trees Required. In sites where landscaping existed and was
retained during development, the minimum quantity of trees required may be
reduced by the total amount of caliper saved in the case of a deciduous tree or
the total height in the case of an evergreen tree. No more than 50 percent of
required plants may be waived in this manner.
11-14-4 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   The provisions below represent the minimum standards required for compliance
of this chapter. These regulations are not intended to suppress creative design
concepts or the use of variety in the landscape plan.
   1.   Minimum Size. The minimum size for required plantings, other than those
in required buffers, shall be as follows:
      A.   Deciduous overstory trees shall be a minimum two and one-half inch
caliper.
      B.   Evergreen overstory trees shall be a minimum height of six feet.
      C.   Ornamental trees shall be a minimum one and one-half inch caliper in
size.
   2.   Minimum Quantity. The minimum number of plantings per site shall be as
follows:
      A.   A minimum of 50 percent of all required trees shall be overstory
shade trees.
      B.   For all uses, except single-family and duplex family residential
dwellings, a minimum of 25 percent of all required trees shall be evergreen
trees.

                                               of required open space
 
      C.   Values expressed in the table above are in addition to plantings
required in buffer.
      D.   Based upon recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission and
approval by Council, the evergreen requirement may be modified, substituting a
different species of trees.
   3.   Off-Street Parking Areas. All of the following requirements shall apply
to off-street parking areas as follows:
      A.   All rows of parking spaces shall be provided a terminal landscaped
island, with a minimum width of 10 feet, to protect parked vehicles, provide
visibility, confine moving traffic to driveways, and provide space for
landscaping.
      B.   There shall be provided within each row of parking spaces,
landscaped islands, with a minimum width of 10 feet, located so as to prevent
more than 15 vehicles from being parked side by side in an abutting
configuration.
      C.   All landscaped islands required in Subsection 3(B) of this section
shall be planted with at least one ornamental or one deciduous overstory tree.
A minimum of 50 percent of the landscaped islands shall be provided with a
deciduous overstory tree. The entire landscaped island area shall be covered
with plant materials, lawn, or mulches.
      D.   The setback between the parking area and the public right-of-way
shall be landscaped with a minimum of one overstory deciduous tree per 40
linear feet of frontage. The frontage calculation shall be exclusive of the
driveways. The plantings may be planted individually or in clusters. This
requirement shall be included in the minimum number of trees required for the
site and is not in addition to.
   4.   Open Space Requirements.
      A.   It is recognized that the extensive use and excessive congestion of
land may become hazardous to the general health and welfare of the community.
Therefore, the intent of this chapter shall be to require not less than that
open space which is necessary to preserve the basic qualities and beauty of
nature. Open space shall be provided for each site in each district in
accordance with the table below. Values are in percentage of total site:
 
Open Space Requirements (Values in Percent)
R-3 C-1 C-2 C-3 C-4 C-5 M-1 M-2
25  15  15  25  25  25  15  15
 
      B.   The calculation of required open space shall be the entire limits of
the lot, exclusive of the required buffer areas. The calculation shall not
include sidewalks or patios in the minimum required open space.
   5.   Maintenance of Open Space. All open space and common areas shall be
under single management or control, and shall be maintained and preserved in
accordance with the site plan requirements.
   6.   Buffers. It is recognized that the transition from one district to
another district of contrasting and conflicting uses is across a line in
theory, not in existence. Therefore, it is the intent of this chapter to
require the actual provision of a physical barrier so as to reduce possible
harmful or detrimental influence one zoning district’s use may have to an
abutting and contrasting or conflicting zoning district’s use. The following
are conditions for requiring a buffer:
      A.   Any lot in any R or M District platted after the effective date
hereof, having both its front and rear lines abutting a public thoroughfare (a
double frontage lot) shall require a 30-feet buffer from the thoroughfare
abutting its rear lot line.
      B.   Buffers shall be provided in accordance with the following table.
Values are in feet:
 
Buffer Requirements (Values in Feet)
                        R-1, R-2, R-5 Districts R-3 R-4 C Districts M Districts
R-1, R-2, R-5 districts                         30  30  50          65
R-3                     30                          30  50          65
R-4                     30                      30      50          65
C districts             50                      50  50              30
M districts             65                      65  65  30
 
      C.   The more intense use shall provide the buffer required above. In an
instance where adjacent property is down zoned, thereby requiring additional
buffer, the newly zoned property shall provide the additional required buffer.
   7.   Buffer Requirements. The following shall be the minimum requirement.
All buffers shall provide the plantings as prescribed below.
 
Buffer Material Requirements (Per 30 Linear Feet of Buffer)
30 feet 1 overstory 2 evergreen 1 ornamental
50 feet 1 overstory 3 evergreen 2 ornamental
65 feet 2 overstory 4 evergreen 2 ornamental
 
      A.   Deciduous overstory trees shall be a minimum two and one-half inch
caliper and evergreen overstory trees shall be a minimum height of six feet.
Ornamental trees shall be a minimum one and one-half inch caliper in size.
Whenever practical, existing trees and shrubs should be preserved and
incorporated into the overall design of the buffer and can be included to meet
the total number of required trees. A continuous earthen berm, minimum of three
feet in height, shall be provided in addition to the required plantings.
      B.   In addition to the required permanent landscape buffer, the Council
may require a fence or a heavily landscaped earth berm to provide additional
screening. Such fence shall be constructed of substantial support elements,
including, but not limited to, brick, poured concrete, and stone. Steel posts
shall not be considered appropriate.
      C.   Required yards shall be measured from the lot lines as prescribed in
this chapter. Buffer may be included in yards required by this chapter. No
building, parking, or structures shall be permitted within any buffer, unless
authorized by the Council.
      D.   In a residential subdivision, the developer of the subdivision shall
be required to install the buffer improvements as required by this section. The
owner of the adjacent private property shall maintain the buffer in perpetuity.
      E.   In a situation that has landscape requirements other than those
stated in the buffering requirements, the buffer requirements shall be in
addition to any other required landscaping.
      F.   The need to establish the buffer as an easement shall be reviewed
and identified during the development review process. Easements shall generally
be required between different zoning districts and for buffering requirements
of residential districts. It shall be assumed that the buffer will be
established by an easement unless noted otherwise during the development review
process and approved by the Council. Buffer easements shall be recorded with
the County at the time of establishment, prior to, or concurrent with the
recording of a final plat or the final approval of a site plan.
      G.   For single-family residential subdivisions, the landscape buffer
shall be submitted for review and approval as a public improvement, at the same
time as the preliminary plat. For any type of development that requires a site
plan review, the buffer plans shall be submitted as a part of the site plan
submittal.
   8.   Reduction in Required Buffer. The Council may, at its discretion,
reduce the required buffer under the following conditions:
      A.   In those areas where the boundary line abuts permanent natural
features which function as a buffer, including, but not limited to, ponds,
severe grades, or mature woodlands, requirements for a buffer area for that
portion of the boundary may be reduced by the Council in the proportions that
the permanent natural features fulfill the buffer requirements.
      B.   In those areas where the property abuts an undeveloped property that
is shown on the adopted land use plan as the same or a more intensive use.
      C.   The abutting property has provided a portion or the entire required
buffer.
      D.   On lots that can present evidence that the above buffer provisions
would render the property unbuildable, the Council may grant a waiver of the
buffer requirements and permit a fence of not less than six feet in height.
Provisions for landscaping to soften the visual appearance of the fence and
provide additional buffering may be required and will be reviewed on a case by
case basis.
      E.   In those areas that abut a public park, the buffer area for that
portion of the boundary may be reduced to 50 percent of the requirement.
11-14-5 MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   1.   Landscaping, as approved by a site plan, shall be maintained in good
condition so as to present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance at all
times. Landscaping shall be maintained to minimize property damage and public
safety hazards, including the removal/replacement of dead or decaying plant
material, removal of low hanging branches and those obstructing street lighting
and maintenance of sight distance standards as set forth herein. Landscaping
shall be maintained in accordance with the following standards:
      A.   Landscaping shall be kept visibly free of insects and disease.
      B.   Areas originally mulched shall be kept free from weeds and other
volunteer plants.
      C.   Irrigation systems shall be maintained so as to eliminate water loss
due to damaged, missing, or improperly operating sprinkler heads, emitters,
piping and valves. Irrigation shall not spray or otherwise allow water to go
into roads or other public pathways.
   2.   In the event a tree, shrub, or other plant causes damage to streets,
sidewalks, or other public improvements, the offending plant shall be removed
and replaced.
   3.   All dead or diseased landscape plantings shall be replaced with
equivalent material in a timely fashion, or within 30 days following notice
from the Community Development Director.
   4.   If any landscaping is removed in violation of an approved site plan or
plat, the property owner shall plant three times such amount, of equal quality
and size, on such site or plat. If it is impractical to replace such
landscaping with an equal size, then several smaller sized plantings, totaling,
in aggregate, the size of the improperly removed landscaping, shall be
required. The City may require that some of the landscaping be planted on
public property if it is impractical to place all plantings on that particular
site or plat. Failure to maintain landscaping in accordance with approved site
plan shall constitute a violation of the approved site plan.

11-15-1 TITLE.
   This chapter, providing for the administration and enforcement of site
plans, shall be known and may be cited and referred to as the “Site Plan
Ordinance of the City of Clive, Iowa.”
11-15-2 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum standards to guide the
appropriate development of land, to ensure that provisions are made for
adequate traffic safety, emergency access, water supply, sewage disposal,
management of stormwater, erosion, and sedimentation, to minimize the adverse
effects on adjacent property values, to maintain aesthetic quality of the City,
thereby promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of the City. Site
plan review and approval shall be required for any permitted, accessory, or
conditional uses, other than single-family and duplex family residential
dwellings, in any zoning district.
11-15-3 JURISDICTION.
   The lawful use of property in which a site plan has been approved at the
time of enactment of this chapter may be continued, although such use may not
conform to the regulations herein. For those properties approved before the
adoption of these regulations, such property shall be classified as “permitted
nonconforming.” No permit shall be issued for any site development after the
effective date hereof and not in substantial conformity with the provisions of
this chapter. Nor shall any development requiring an approved site plan, except
as herein specified, be substantially improved, converted, enlarged, or
otherwise altered without conforming to the provisions of this chapter.
11-15-4 PROCEDURES.
   1.   Preapplication. Prior to the submission of a site plan application, it
is recommended that a preapplication review meeting be scheduled with the
Community Development Director. The purpose of the preapplication review
meeting is to begin identifying issues, communicate development requirements,
and point out possible future difficulties. This evaluation is preliminary in
nature and shall not be considered an intention to approve or deny any
particular project and is not intended to be inclusive of the comments, but
only to identify major areas of concern. The City reserves the right to
supplement additional comments that may be generated during the formal review
of the application.
   2.   Application Submission.
      A.   At the time of submission, the applicant shall provide the following
items:
         (1)   Application form, signed by property owner.
         (2)   Proof of ownership such as deed, purchase agreement, owner
consent.
         (3)   Payment of required fees.
         (4)   Six folded copies of each plan set.
      B.   If all required submittal items are not provided, the application
will be deemed invalid and such submittal will be returned to the applicant as
incomplete. The City will retain no record of the submittal if returned to the
applicant.
   3.   Waive or Reduce Requirements. The Community Development Director may
find that unusual characteristics of an application make it unnecessary for the
applicant to submit all of the information for an application required by this
chapter. In such cases, the Community Development Director may waive or reduce
the requirements, if it is also found that the absence of such information will
not inhibit the City’s ability to evaluate the compliance of the proposed site
development with the standards of this chapter and any other requirements of
this Code.
   4.   Review by City Officials. The Community Development Director shall
immediately refer a copy of the site plan to the Public Works Director, Fire
Chief, Parks and Recreation Director, and City Engineer. Each department shall
review said site plan as to its compliance with the ordinances of the City, its
effect upon public utilities, streets, property, and safety, and submit their
findings as soon as possible to the Community Development Director. The
Community Development Director shall forward the site plan and City staff
report to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   5.   Notification Signs. The City will post at least one notification sign
for which a request has been made. Notification signs shall be posted once the
agenda has been set for the Planning and Zoning Commission meeting and shall
remain until one day after the Council review.
   6.   Review and Recommendation of Commission. The Planning and Zoning
Commission shall, after receiving the site plan and City staff report, review
the site plan for conformity with the regulations and design standards
contained herein, and may confer with developer on changes deemed advisable in
such site plan. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall forward its
recommendation either for approval, approval with conditions, or disapproval of
the site plan to the Council.
   7.   Public Hearing. The Chairperson of the Planning and Zoning Commission
may, solely as a matter of discretion, by written order, fix a date, time, and
place for a public hearing to be held by the Planning and Zoning Commission on
the site plan of the proposed development and prescribe the notice thereof and
to whom such notice shall be given. If the Planning and Zoning Commission shall
hold such hearing at such date, time, and place, at such hearing all affected
property owners shall be given an opportunity to be heard.
   8.   Council Decision. The Council shall, upon receipt of the
recommendations of the Planning and Zoning Commission, either approve, approve
with conditions, or disapprove the site plan of the proposed development.
   9.   Filing of Approved Site Plan. Upon final action by the Council on any
site plan, five copies consistent with the Council’s approval shall be provided
and stamped approved by the Clerk and filed with the Community Development
Director. One copy of the approved site plan shall be returned to the
applicant.
11-15-5 GENERAL REGULATIONS.
   1.   Site Plan Required. A site plan, consistent with the requirements as
outlined in the Clive Development Standards Manual, shall be required for all
commercial, manufacturing, and non-single and duplex family dwellings in
residential zoning districts when new construction, expansion of existing
structures, or major modification of existing structures is proposed.
   2.   Certificate of Zoning Compliance. A Certificate of Zoning Compliance
shall be obtained prior to issuance of any building permit or occupancy of an
existing building. In the event a Certificate of Zoning Compliance is denied, a
variance may be requested from the Board of Adjustment. Such variance request
shall follow the same procedure as outlined in
Chapter 3 of this title. A Certificate of Zoning Compliance shall include, but
is not limited to:
      A.   Name and address of proposed business.
      B.   Name and address of building owner.
      C.   Zoning classification.
      D.   Legal description.
      E.   Use or parking restrictions.
      F.   Proposed use of business.
      G.   Number of parking stalls used, and required.
   3.   Building Permit Issuance. No building permit for any structure or
development within any district within which a site plan is required shall be
issued until said site plan has been approved by the Council and stamped
approved by the Clerk.
   4.   Expiration of Approvals. All site plan approvals shall expire and
terminate 90 days after the date of such approval unless a building permit has
been issued for the construction provided for in the site plan.
   5.   Extension of Time. Except as provided below, if the owner or developer
of property for which a site plan has been approved, determines that an
extension of time is necessary in the development schedule, or that a
significant modification of the site plan would provide for a more appropriate
or more practical development of the site, the owner or developer may apply for
an amendment of the site plan. Any such modifications or development schedule
extensions shall be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission and approved
by the Council.
   6.   Minor Modifications. In the case of minor modifications of the site
plan or development schedule, the Community Development Director may give
approval if the decision does not modify the overall theme of the development,
affect public safety, or result in the reduction of any minimum standard as
provided in this zoning ordinance. Minor modifications shall include the
following:
      A.   Lighting location and fixture type.
      B.   Location, height, and style of fences and walls.
      C.   Location of trash enclosures.
      D.   Location and size of building and monument signs.
      E.   Location and construction of on-site sidewalks, except on City
rights-of-way.
      F.   Location, type, and size of plantings provided the modification
would have the same effective cover and screening.
      G.   Location and construction of accessory buildings of less than 400
square feet.
      H.   Location and construction of accessory structures.
      I.   Reconfiguration of architectural features, including colors, or
modification of finished materials that do not alter or compromise the
previously approved theme.
      J.   Minor relocation or addition of driveways or parking spaces.
   7.   Refer Minor Modifications to Commission. Nothing contained herein shall
be construed to allow the Community Development Director to vary the provisions
of any statute, ordinance, City policy, or previous directives of the Council.
The Director shall have the discretion to refer any minor modification requests
to the Planning and Zoning Commission for its review.
   8.   Site Plan Amendment. Any modification that is deemed by the Community
Development Director not to be minor modification shall be required to submit a
site plan amendment. Site plan amendments shall follow procedures prescribed in
this Chapter 15.
   9.   Suspension of Building Permit; Order Construction Stopped. If the
Community Development Director finds that any construction, or proposed
construction, or occupancy of a development on a property for which a site plan
has been approved will not substantially comply with the site plan as approved,
or that the construction and development of the property is not being carried
out in accordance with the development schedule filed with the site plan, the
Community Development Director shall suspend all building permits for the
development and order all construction stopped until such time as the owner of
the project, or the owner’s successors in interest, shall provide satisfactory
proof that the site plan and schedule of development will be complied with. In
no case will a zoning compliance certificate or Certificate of Occupancy be
issued for any structure within the development while the building permit or
the development has been suspended pursuant to this subsection. Any person
aggrieved by any decision or action of the Community Development Director under
this subsection may appeal such action or decision to the Council.
   10.   Granting of Certificates of Occupancy. A Certificate of Occupancy will
be granted upon completion of new construction or completion of alterations or
additions to existing structures. No Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued
until such time as all site improvements and building construction is completed
in substantial compliance with all provisions identified on the approved site
plan and within all applicable building codes.
   11.   Temporary Certificate of Occupancy. A temporary Certificate of
Occupancy may be issued prior to completion of the project if, in the opinion
of the Community Development Director, the remaining items could not be
completed due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control and the issuance
of a temporary Certificate of Occupancy will not inhibit the completion of the
total project, nor have an adverse effect on persons in the immediate area or
nearby properties. The applicant will be required to sign an agreement to
complete and post a certified check with the Community Development Department
in an amount equal to the estimated cost of the remaining items to be
completed. The check will be returned to the applicant with the issuance of the
final Certificate of Occupancy. The agreement to complete will be accepted by
the Council.
11-15-6 SITE PLAN INFORMATION REQUIRED.
   All site plans shall provide the following information as prescribed in the
Clive Development Standards Manual. The information required shall include, but
is not limited to, access and circulation, parking, lighting, landscaping,
buffering, drainage, and architecture.
11-15-7 FEES.
   Said fee shall be in an amount determined by resolution of the Council from
time to time. In addition to the application fee, the applicant for site plan
review must also pay all cost incurred by the City for legal services,
engineering services, and services of other persons or entities employed by the
City for, or in any way involved in, the review and inspection of said site
plan and public utility extensions contemplated thereby, including, but not
limited to: street, sidewalks, water lines, sanitary sewer lines, storm sewer
lines, streetlights, electric and gas lines, water retention areas, and all
other improvements intended for public use or benefit constructed, or caused to
be constructed by the owner, and under no condition shall said fee be refunded
for failure of the City to approve said site plan.
11-15-8 MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   1.   Failure to Maintain. Failure to maintain a site in accordance with an
approved site plan shall constitute a violation of this chapter, and a failure
to correct such a violation within 30 days following written notice of said
violation, shall render the site plan and any certificates of zoning compliance
and occupancy subject to cancellation.
   2.   Failure to Acquire Approval. Failure to acquire site plan/site plan
amendment approval where required, prior to construction, alteration, or other
modification of a building, sign, or structure, shall constitute a violation of
this chapter and a failure to correct such a violation within 30 days following
written notice of said violation shall render the site plan and any
certificates of zoning compliance and occupancy subject to cancellation. In
addition, the Building Official shall post a stop work order relating to work
in the process of completion outside the requirements of this chapter.
   3.   Penalties. Penalties for a violation of this title are outlined in

12-5-8 Surfacing             12-5-16 Datum Plane
 
12-5-1 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The standards and details of design herein contained are intended only as
minimum requirements so that the general arrangement and layout of a
subdivision may be adjusted to a wide variety of circumstances. However, in the
design and development of a plat, the subdivider should use standards
consistent with the current edition of the Des Moines Metropolitan Design
Standards Manual and the site conditions so as to assure an economical,
pleasant, and durable neighborhood.
12-5-2 STREETS.
   The design of streets, alleys, and other public ways shall conform to the
following minimum design standards:
   1.   Comprehensive Plan. All proposed plats and subdivisions shall conform
to the Comprehensive Plan of the City.
   2.   Continuation of Existing Streets. Proposed streets shall provide for
continuation or completion of any existing streets (constructed or recorded) in
adjoining property, at equal or greater width, but not less than 50 feet in
width, and in similar alignment, unless variations are recommended by the
Commission.
   3.   Circulation. The street pattern shall provide ease of circulation
within the subdivision as well as convenient access to adjoining streets,
thoroughfares, or unsubdivided land, as may be required by the Commission. In a
case where a street will eventually be extended beyond the plat, but is
temporarily dead-ended, an interim turnaround may be required.
   4.   Street Intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right
angles as possible.
   5.   Cul-De-Sac. Whenever a cul-de-sac is permitted, such street shall be no
longer than 600 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround
having a street property line diameter of at least 100 feet in the case of
residential subdivisions. The right-of-way width of the street leading to the
turnaround shall be a minimum of 50 feet. The property line at the intersection
of the turnaround and the lead-in portion of the street shall be rounded at a
radius of not less than 25 feet. A turnaround diameter greater than 100 feet
may be required by the Commission in the case of commercial or industrial
subdivisions, if it is deemed necessary.
   6.   Street Names. All newly platted streets shall be named and in a manner
conforming to the prevailing street naming system. A proposed street that is
obviously in alignment with other existing streets, or with a street that may
logically be extended, although the various portions be at a considerable
distance from each other, shall bear the same name. Names of new streets shall
be subject to the approval of the Commission in order to avoid duplication or
close similarity of names.
   7.   Physical and Cultural Features. In general, streets shall be platted
with appropriate regard for topography, creeks, wooded areas, and other natural
features which would lend themselves to attractive treatment.
   8.   Half Streets. Dedication of half-streets will be discouraged. Where
there exists a dedicated or platted half-street or alley adjacent to the tract
to be subdivided, the other half shall be platted, if deemed necessary by the
Commission.
   9.   Alleys. Alleys may be required in business areas and industrial
districts for adequate access to block interiors and for off-street loading and
parking purposes. Except where justified by unusual conditions, alleys will not
be approved in residential districts. Dead-end alleys shall be provided with a
means of turning around at the dead-end thereof.
   10.   Easements. Easements for utilities shall be provided along rear or
side lot lines or along alleys, if needed. Whenever any stream or important
surface watercourse is located in an area that is being subdivided, the
subdivider shall, at the subdivider’s own expense, make adequate provision for
straightening or widening the channel so that it will properly carry the
surface water, and shall provide and dedicate to the City an easement along
each side of the stream, which easement shall be for the purpose of widening,
improving, or protecting the stream. The width of such easement shall be not
less than 20 feet and the total width of the easement shall be adequate to
provide for any necessary channel relocation or straightening.
   11.   Neighborhood Plan. If any overall plan has been made by the Commission
for the neighborhood in which the proposed subdivision is located, the street
system of the latter shall conform in general thereto.
   12.   Unsubdivided Portion of Plat. Where the plat to be submitted includes
only part of the tract owned by the subdivider, the Commission may require
topography and a sketch of a tentative future street system of the unsubdivided
portion.
   13.   Major Thoroughfares. Where a new subdivision, except where justified
by limiting conditions, involves frontage on a heavy trafficway, limited
accessway, freeway, or parkway, the street layout shall provide motor access to
such frontage by one of the following means:
      A.   A parallel street, supplying frontage for lots backing onto the
trafficway.
      B.   A series of cul-de-sacs or short loops entered from and planned at
right angles to such a parallel street, with their terminal lots backing onto
the highway.
      C.   An access drive separated by a planting strip from the highway to
which motor access from the drive is provided at points suitably spaced.
      D.   A service drive or alley at the rear of the lots.
   14.   Deed Covenants. Where any one of the above-mentioned arrangements is
used, deed covenants or other means should prevent any private residential
driveways from having direct access to the trafficway.
   15.   Dedication. A deed to the City shall be given for all streets before
the same will be accepted for maintenance.
   16.   Railroads. If a railroad is involved, the subdivision plan should:
      A.   Be so arranged as to permit, where necessary, future grade
separations at highway crossings of the railroad.
      B.   Border the railroad with a parallel street at a sufficient distance
from it to permit deep lots to back onto the railroad; or form a buffer strip
for park, commercial, or industrial use.
      C.   Provide cul-de-sacs at right angles to the railroad so as to permit
lots to back there onto.
   17.   Street Widths. Streets shall have a width and cross section as shown
in the Comprehensive Plan for the type of street involved.
   18.   Street Grades. Streets and alleys shall be completed to grades which
have been officially determined or approved by the City Engineer. All streets
shall be graded to the full width of the right-of-way and adjacent side slopes
graded to blend with the natural ground level. The maximum grade shall not
exceed six percent for main and secondary thoroughfares, or 10 percent for
minor or local service streets. All changes in grades on major roads or
highways shall be connected by vertical curves of a minimum length equivalent
to 20 times the algebraic difference between the rates of grades, expressed in
feet per hundred, or greater, if deemed necessary by the City Engineer; for
secondary and minor streets, 15 times. The grade alignment and resultant
visibility, especially at intersections, shall be worked out in detail to meet
the approval of the City Engineer.
12-5-3 BLOCKS.
   Blocks shall comply with the following minimum design standards:
   1.   Length. No block shall be longer than 1,320 feet.
   2.   Corners. At street intersections, block corners shall be rounded with a
radius of not less than 15 feet; where, at any one intersection a curve radius
has been previously established, such radius shall be used as standard.
12-5-4 LOTS. . Lots shall comply with the following minimum design standards:
   1.   Corner Lots. Corner lots shall have a minimum width of 75 feet, except
in districts where wider lots are required by the zoning ordinance, in order to
permit adequate building setbacks on both front and side streets.
   2.   Double Frontage Lots. Double frontage lots, other than corner lots,
shall be prohibited, except where such lots back onto a major street or
highway, or except in the case of large commercial or industrial lots.
   3.   Lot Sizes. For the purpose of complying with minimum health standards,
the following minimum lot sizes shall be observed:
      A.   Lots which cannot be reasonably served by an existing public
sanitary sewer system and public water mains shall have a minimum width of 100
feet, measured at the building line, and an area of not less than 20,000 square
feet.
      B.   Lots which are not within a reasonable distance of a public sanitary
sewer system, but are connected to a public water supply main, shall have a
minimum width of 80 feet and an area of 10,000 square feet; except where other
lot sizes are specified by the zoning ordinance.
   4.   Side Lot Lines. Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles
to the street or radial to curved streets. On large size lots, and except when
indicated by topography, lot lines shall be straight.
12-5-5 IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.
   The subdivider shall install and construct all improvements required by this
chapter. All required improvements shall be installed and constructed in
accordance with approved specifications and under the supervision of the
Council and to its satisfaction.
12-5-6 GRADING.
   All streets and alleys within the platted area which are dedicated for
public use shall be brought to the grade approved by the Council after
receiving the report and recommendations of the City Engineer.
12-5-7 CURB AND GUTTER.
   Curb and gutter shall be installed on all roadways in the plat being
dedicated for public use and shall be constructed of Portland cement concrete
in accordance with designs and specifications approved by the Council and at
grades established by the City Engineer.
12-5-8 SURFACING.
   All roadways being dedicated for public use shall be surfaced from curb to
curb. Surfacing shall be Portland cement concrete and shall be constructed in
accordance with designs and specifications approved by the Council at grades
established by the City Engineer.
12-5-9 SIDEWALKS.
   Sidewalks shall be constructed on both sides of all streets being dedicated
for public use. Sidewalks shall be a minimum of four feet in width and shall be
constructed of Portland cement concrete in accordance with designs and
specifications approved by the Council and at grades established by the City
Engineer. The requirement ofSection
12-5-12 of this chapter, as it relates to the construction of sidewalks, may be
waived by the Council in its discretion; provided, however, that in no event
shall a Certificate of Occupancy be issued on a lot within a platted area until
all sidewalks on such lot that are required by the plat are constructed.
12-5-10 WATER AND SEWERS.
   Water mains, sanitary sewer lines, and storm sewers and their appurtenances
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with the plans and
specifications adopted by the Council. Water and sewer lines shall be made
accessible to each lot.
12-5-11 UTILITY LINES.
   All utility lines, except electric lines of nominal voltage in excess of
15,000 volts, shall be installed underground. The subdivider shall be
responsible for making the necessary arrangements with the utility companies
for installation of such facilities. Such utility lines shall be installed in
such a manner so as not to interfere with other underground utilities.
Incidental appurtenances, such as pad mounted electrical equipment and its
enclosures, pedestal mounted terminal boxes, meters and meter cabinets may be
placed aboveground but shall be located so as not to be unsightly or hazardous
to the public and, if located in City right-of-way, as approved by the Council.
All underground utility lines shall be installed in accordance with applicable
federal and State statutes and regulations, and the Electrical Code of the
City. The Council may waive all or any part of the requirements of this section
if the Council, in its sole discretion, finds that soil, topographical, or
other conditions make underground installation impracticable.
12-5-12 ACCEPTANCE BY COUNCIL.
   Before the Council approves the final plat, all of the foregoing
improvements shall be constructed and accepted by formal resolution of the
Council. Before passage of said resolution of acceptance, the City Engineer
shall report that said improvements meet all City specifications and ordinances
or other City requirements, and agreements between the subdivider and the City.
12-5-13 BOND IN LIEU OF CONSTRUCTION.
   The requirement of Section
12-5-12 of this chapter may be waived if the subdivider will post a performance
bond or certified check with the Council guaranteeing that said improvements
will be constructed within a period of one year from final acceptance of the
plat. However, if a performance bond is posted, final acceptance of the plat
will not constitute final acceptance by the City of any improvements to be
constructed. Improvements will be accepted only after their construction has
been completed, and no public funds will be expended in the subdivision until
such improvements have been completed and accepted by the City.
12-5-14 WAIVER OF REQUIREMENTS.
   The Council may waive the requirements for the construction and installation
of some or all of the foregoing improvements in cases of resubdivisions where
only the size, shape, and arrangement of the lots is being changed and no new
streets are required, and in cases of dedications of land or rights-of-way to
public use where such dedication is in excess of the needs of the subdivision
and is desired by a public agency in lieu of a purchase or condemnation

12-5-15 RECREATIONAL FACILITIES.
   1.   Definition. For use in this section, the following terms are defined:
“development” or “developing” means any land subdivided under other ordinances
of the City or a tract of land otherwise developed, which is to be used for
residential purposes and which is more than one-half acre in size. The person
that is subdividing the land shall be referred to herein as the “developer.”
   2.   Design. In the design of the plat of a subdivision or preparation of
the site plan for development, consideration shall be given to adequate
provision of and correlation with public and private recreation areas.
   3.   Dedication of Land. Within the corporate limits of the City, the
developer shall provide and dedicate to the public adequate land to provide for
the recreational needs of the development. The dedication of land to the City
shall be accomplished by providing the City with a properly executed warranty
deed conveying the required land to the City without cost to the City.
   4.   Determination of Amount of Land.
      A.   The amount of land to be provided for recreational facilities shall
be determined based upon: a) the projected population of the residential land
shown on the preliminary plat or site plan; and b) the amount of park land
existing in the City per 1,000 residents. For purposes of this calculation, the
projected population of residential land shall be calculated as follows:
         (1)   For single-family residences: 2.7 persons per household.
         (2)   For multi-family residences: 1.25 persons per household.
         (3)   For townhome residences: 2 persons per household.
      B.   The amount of park land, excluding regional parks, existing in the
City per 1,000 residents shall be determined annually at the beginning of each
calendar year, and the Council shall, by resolution, establish the amount of
park land to be dedicated per resident (the “per resident park dedication
requirement.”) The per resident park dedication requirement shall be 8.36 acres
per 1,000 residents or 0.00836 acre per resident, until revised by resolution
of the Council. For purposes of illustration, if a development is projected to
contain 100 single-family residences, the projected population for the
development is 270 persons. The amount of land dedicated for park land would be
calculated as 0.00836 acre per resident times 270 projected residents equals
2.26 acres.
   5.   Alternative Means of Dedication of Land; Master Agreement. If the land
to be developed is a part of a larger area being developed by a single
developer or by a group of developers who enter into a single agreement with
the City, the developer or developers may enter into a written agreement with
the City providing for the dedication of the land relating to the present
development in a future subdivision plat, which land shall be dedicated for
recreational facilities serving the larger area under development by the
developer or developers. The written agreement between the City and the
developer or developers shall establish the timetable for the dedication of the
land by the developer. The amount of land dedicated and the method of
dedication shall be in accordance with the provisions of this section.
   6.   Applicability to Existing Subdivisions or Developments. The
requirements of this section are not applicable to:
      A.   Existing developments which are presently constructed.
      B.   Parcels of land which have previously been developed with
residential units and are being redeveloped to permit construction of
additional residences.
      C.   Developments for which building permits have been issued.
   7.   Applicability to Land Zoned PUD.
   Land zoned PUD (Planned Unit Development) may include residential uses,
neighborhood commercial uses, and neighborhood office uses which encourage the
more efficient use of land through the incorporation of both public and private
open spaces to accent and enhance both the architectural and natural features
of a development and provide for natural stormwater management systems. A
development plan and development agreement are required for all Planned Unit
Development Districts. The City and the developer of land zoned PUD shall
address the private and public open space and recreation area requirements and
the means to satisfy such requirements in the development agreement. All PUD
Districts shall comply with the intent and purpose of Subsection 4 of this
section; however, the application of the standard to PUD Zoning Districts may
be more flexible in order to create equivalent recreational facilities while
accommodating the mixed uses present in such developments.
12-5-16 DATUM PLANE.
   The United States coast and geodetic survey datum plane is hereby
established and adopted as the City datum plane. The United States coast and
geodetic survey datum plane shall be used as the reference plane in
establishing all elevations and grades within the City.
