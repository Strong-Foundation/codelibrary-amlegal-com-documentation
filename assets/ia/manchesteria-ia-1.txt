identities and addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders,
notice by one publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area
where the vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of
notice under Subsection 2 of this section. The published notice may contain
multiple listings of abandoned vehicles but shall be published within the same

91.01   PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to encourage the conservation of water and
facilitate the equitable distribution of charges for water service among
customers.
91.02   WATER USE METERED.
   1.   No water for any but public purposes shall be taken from the mains of
the City water system or through service pipes connected therewith unless the
water has first passed through a water meter and has been duly measured. This
section shall not apply to cases, if any, where special contracts in writing
now or hereafter entered into by special authority of the Council between the
customer and the City for the use of water and fixing the price therefor.
   2.   Each dwelling, commercial and/or industrial unit shall be served
separately by an individual water meter unless otherwise permitted by the
superintendent or City Manager.
   3.   Each dwelling unit must be supplied by water passed through a water
meter that has been approved by the City. Each single dwelling unit shall have
an approved water meter which shall be three-quarters inch in size; if there is
more than one dwelling unit being served by a meter, then that meter shall be
an approved compound meter. Meters larger than three-quarters inch shall be
furnished by the property owner at the owner’s own expense. This subsection
shall apply only to all new remodeled installations occurring after the
effective date of the ordinance codified in this subsection.
91.03   FIRE SPRINKLER SYSTEMS; EXCEPTION.
Fire sprinkler systems may be connected to water mains by direct connection
without meters under the direct supervision of the Superintendent. No open
connection can be incorporated in the system, and there shall be no valves
except a main control valve at the entrance to the building which must be
sealed open.
91.04   LOCATION OF METERS.
All meters shall be so located that they are easily accessible to meter readers
and repairmen and protected from freezing.
91.05   METER SETTING.
The property owner shall have provided all necessary piping and fittings for
proper setting of the meter including the brass valve on the inlet and outlet
sides of the meter. Meter pits may be used only upon approval of the
Superintendent and of a design and construction approved by the Superintendent.
91.06   METER INSTALLATION FEE.
The property owner shall pay an installation fee in an amount as specified by
resolution of the Council for each new installation of a water meter to a
three-fourths inch (3/4²) line. Such meter is to remain the property of the
City.
91.07   INSTALLATION AND REMOVAL.
All water meters shall be installed and removed by the City. The exceptions to
this rule are for mobile homes or meters used exclusively to measure water that
does not flow through the City’s sanitary sewer system; in which case, the
landowner is responsible to install or remove meters. A customer shall give the
City at least twenty-four hours’ advance notice prior to the installation or
removal of a meter. For mobile homes, the landowner shall notify the City
within forty-eight (48) hours if a meter is installed or removed. Property
owners can purchase water meters to separately meter water that will not be
cycled into or passed through the City’s sanitary system. This meter becomes
the property of the landowner and said installation shall be inspected by the
Superintendent. No one shall break the seal on a water meter or remote box
without permission of the Superintendent. No one shall use or take unmetered
water.
91.08   RIGHT OF ENTRY.
The Superintendent shall be permitted to enter the premises of any customer at
any reasonable time to read, remove, or change a meter.
91.09   METER MAINTENANCE; PROTECTION FROM FREEZING; REPAIRS.
Any meter needing maintenance will be replaced by the water department, except
in the case of mobile homes, where the meter shall be removed and a new meter
installed by the landowner within three (3) days after the date of notification
from the City. Failure to install the replacement meter in a timely fashion
will result in a penalty of $20.00 per day until the meter is installed. All
landowners shall be charged for meters that are lost or stolen. When any
customer allows the water meter to freeze by said customer’s failure to protect
the meter from frost, the customer will be charged for repairing same; and
failure to pay for such repairs will entitle the City to shut off the supply.

PRIVATE WELLS AND WATER SYSTEMS
 
94.01 Required Conditions          94.05 Revocation of Permit
94.02 Permit for New Well          94.06 Health and Safety Standards; Right of
                                   Interpretation
94.03 Annual Renewal of Permit     94.07 Permit Fees
94.04 Non-renewal of Annual Permit 94.08 Termination and Abandonment
 
94.01   REQUIRED CONDITIONS.
Except as hereinafter provided, private wells and water systems shall not be
maintained by any individual or property owner, nor shall any new wells be
established within the City limits. Private wells and water systems shall be
allowed only if one or more of the following conditions are established by the
applicant to the satisfaction of the City:
   1.   Existing Well. The well or water system was in existence prior to
October 1, 2002, and duly registered with the City, which registration
specified the location of the well, by address and legal description, the name
and address of the property owner of the well, the name and address of all
individuals using the well, and the address and legal description of all
properties serviced by the well.
   2.   Location. No part of a tract of ground from which a private well or
water system is proposed is within 200 feet of a City water main.
   3.   Undue Hardship. The property owner or individual applying for a private
well permit can show that denying the permit and not allowing the private well
or water system will cause the individual or property owner undue hardship.
Undue hardship in this case means that the particular tract of land is so
topographically situated that connection to the City water main system would be
unfeasible and that the particular conditions causing the unfeasibility of the
connection are in no way caused or contributed to by the property owner or
permit applicant. The Council shall rule on all questions of undue hardship and
their decision shall be final.
   4.   Special Circumstances. A well may be allowed where the circumstances of
the proposed use of the well, location of the well, and the surrounding
circumstances of the proposed use of the well are such that the City Council
has determined the granting of a well permit is consistent with protection of
public water supplies, maintenance of a public water system, and economic
development of the community.
94.02   PERMIT FOR NEW WELL.
All individuals who desire to construct or maintain a new private well or water
system within the City must first make application to the Building Inspector
for a private well permit. The request for permit shall show that the well will
be in compliance with the separation distances referred to in Section
93.04 of this Code of Ordinances. In addition, the request shall further
indicate why the property should be served by a private water system rather
than utilize the public water system provided by the City of Manchester. In
determining whether to grant a request for well permit, the City Council shall
consider the availability of public water systems to serve the subject
properties, the effect the proposed well may have upon future development
within the vicinity of the proposed well, and any other reasons which are
consistent with public policy. No permit for a new well or water system shall
be granted unless one or more of the required conditions under Section
94.01 are established and the well meets all applicable City, County, State and
federal rules, regulations and laws.
94.03   ANNUAL RENEWAL OF PERMIT.
Every well, including existing wells and future wells, shall be tested annually
and results of the tests filed with the City. An individual well owner may
cause to have a sample of the well water taken to an authorized testing agency
for testing, and a copy of such test results shall be filed with the City.
Every well shall be tested annually during the month of September of each year,
and the test results shall be filed with the City on of before the first day of
October of each year. If a well owner fails to comply with this annual test
requirement, the City shall send a notice to the well owner at the last known
address, advising the well owner no annual test results have been filed with
the City. The notice shall further specify that if the well owner does not
properly test the well and file the test results with the City within sixty
(60) days after the date of mailing of the notice, the City shall declare the
well abandoned, and the owner shall forthwith terminate use of the well as
required under Section
94.08 of this chapter. In the event a well owner has timely filed the annual
test results with the City or timely filed test results after notice and the
test results show compliance with all applicable health and safety standards as
required by appropriate City, County and State rules, regulations and laws, the
City shall renew the original permit for an additional one-year period.
94.04   NON-RENEWAL OF ANNUAL PERMIT.
In the event a well owner receives annual test results that indicate lack of
compliance with appropriate City, County and State rules, regulations and laws,
the well owner shall immediately advise the City of the test results and
immediately correct the problems and bring the well up to applicable standards.
The well owner shall have an additional ninety (90) days after October 1 of
each year to correct any problems shown by the annual test. If applicable
standards cannot be met or if the problems are not timely corrected, no renewal
permit shall be issued and the well owner shall forthwith terminate use of the
well as required under Section
94.08.
94.05   REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
If at any time it is determined that a private well or water system does not
meet applicable City, County or State rules, regulations or laws, the permit
issued pursuant to this chapter shall automatically terminate without further
notice to the well owner. The well owner shall have ninety (90) days to correct
the problems so that applicable standards are met. In the event applicable
standards cannot be met, the well shall be abandoned and the well owner shall
forthwith terminate use of the well as required by Section
94.08. In the event a private well or water system is not used for any
consecutive nine-month period of time, then at the expiration of the current
private well permit period, the permit shall not be renewed unless the well
owner shows good cause for the non-use and all provisions of this chapter for a
new well are complied with.
94.06   HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS; RIGHT OF INSPECTION.
All private wells and private water systems for which permits are granted
pursuant to this chapter shall meet all applicable City, County and State
rules, regulations and laws. All permit holders, as a condition of receiving a
permit, grant to the City the right to enter the well owner’s property solely
to inspect and test any private well and water system maintained upon the
permit holder’s property. In the event the private well or water system so
inspected and tested by the City does not meet applicable standards, the City
shall notify the well owner in writing of the failure to meet applicable
standards. The well owner shall have ninety (90) days from the date of mailing
the notice to correct the problems. If the owner fails to timely correct the
problems, the permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall terminate without
further notice to the well owner, and the well owner shall forthwith terminate
use of the well as required under Section
94.08. In the event a private well or water system cannot be brought up to
applicable standards in the time period allowed herein and the well owner is
not otherwise connected to the City’s water system, the well owner shall
connect to the City water system within 180 days in accordance with this Code
of Ordinances.
94.07   PERMIT FEES.
The following fee schedule applies to permits for private wells and water
systems:
   1.   Initial Permit. No fee is charged for the initial registration permit
for an existing well.
   2.   Annual Renewal Permit. There is no fee for each annual renewal permit,
provided the well owner does the test at the owner’s own expense. In the event
a well owner fails to have the well tested as required pursuant to this chapter
and the City makes the test, the costs of testing shall be charged to the well
owner, and the well owner shall pay an annual permit fee in an amount set by
resolution of the Council.
   3.   Permit Fees for New Wells. Any person desiring to install a new well or
water system shall make application to the Building Inspector for a permit, and
prior to start of construction shall pay the following permit fees:
      A.   For a new “sand point” or shallow well, a fee established by
resolution of the Council.
      B.   For a new well to be used for a supply of potable water, a fee set
by Council resolution; and in addition, the well owner shall file with the City
a certificate from the State authorized laboratory that a State bacteriological
test has been made on the water and the water supply is potable.
All permit fees shall be paid to the City at the time the application is filed.
In the event the permit is not granted, the application fee shall be returned
to the applicant.
94.08   TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT.
In the event any private well or water system is no longer being used, due to
failure to comply with applicable standards, the well owner’s connection to the
City water system, or other reasons, the well owner or property owner shall cut
off the service mains to the well and the well shall be abandoned in such
manner to preclude its further use. The termination of use shall be done by the
owner in accordance with the standards and guidelines of the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources.

96.03 License Required            96.08 Property Owner’s Responsibility
96.04 Connection Requirements     96.09 Abatement of Violations
96.05 Sewage Lifts/Grinder Pumps
 
96.01   CONNECTION FEE.
   1.   A connection fee per frontage foot of the lot or parcel of property
served by a new sewer connection in an amount set by resolution of the Council
will be charged to offset the sewer main construction costs. Lot frontage means
the narrowest portion of the lot fronting a public street. If the sewer main
has been stubbed for a sewer service line, into the lot(s) as platted at the
time the main was installed, there will be no connection fee. A minimum
frontage of seventy (70) feet shall be billed for residential and commercial
connections. Industrial connections shall be billed for a minimum frontage of
one hundred (100) feet. A residential structure located on land used for
agricultural purposes may, subject to the approval by the Council, enter into
an agreement for partial deferral of the connection fee. The agreement shall
require payment of a minimum connection fee based upon 70 frontage feet, with
the balance of frontage fees deferred until such time as additional
construction and/or development occurs on the property. The agreement shall be
further subject to such other terms and conditions as may be determined
necessary by the Council. The cost of recording the agreement shall be paid by
the owner of the land served by the sewer connection.
   2.   The connection fee is due prior to connection to the sewer main. In
lieu of paying the connection fee prior to connection to the main, the property
owner may choose to enter into a voluntary assessment agreement which would
allow this fee to be paid over a period of years as approved by the Council.
   3.   For connections that require a long service line (greater than 100 feet
from the main to the nearest point of the property line), the connection fee
referred to in subsection 1 shall be reduced by the property owner’s cost of
the service line in excess of 100 feet.
   4.   Special allowances will be made to this fee when a developer has paid
for the sewer main construction. In developments and subdivisions where a
developer has paid to install sewer main, and where the sewer main was not
stubbed for service lines into the development as part of the sewer main
project, the following connection fees will be assessed:
      A.   If the connection occurs within the first five (5) years following
the City’s acceptance of the main or adoption of the ordinance codified by this
section, whichever is later, there will be no additional connection fee.
      B.   If the connection occurs after five (5) years, but before ten (10)
years lapse following the City’s acceptance of the sewer main or adoption of
the ordinance codified in this chapter, the connection fee will be one-half of
the fee referred to in subsection 1 of this section.
      C.   If the connection occurs more than 10 years following the City’s
acceptance of the sewer main or adoption of the ordinance codified by this
section, the connection fee will be the same as referred to in subsection 1 of
this section.
96.02   ADDITIONAL FEES AND CHARGES.
Fees for the following sewer-related services shall be set by resolution of the
Council:
   1.   For three basic inspections for new dwellings and new commercial
buildings, the same being the inspection of the line to the building from the
trunk, the rough-in inspection, and the final inspection. 
   2.   For locating a private sewer line. If locating takes more than one
hour, there will be an additional fee for each additional hour required.
   3.   For any other sewer inspections.
96.03   LICENSE REQUIRED.
   All installations of building sewer and connections to the public sewer
shall be made by a state licensed plumber and/or a state licensed water/sewer
line construction contractor.

97.05   RESTRICTED DISCHARGES – POWERS.
If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the
public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in Section
97.04 and which in the judgment of the Inspector may have a deleterious effect
upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which
otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the
Inspector may:
   1.   Rejection. Reject the wastes by requiring disconnection from the public
sewage system;
   2.   Pretreatment. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for
discharge to the public sewers;
   3.   Controls Imposed. Require control over the quantities and rates of

the owner’s expense.
97.07   CONTROL MANHOLES.
When required by the Inspector, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Inspector.
The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner’s expense, and shall
be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
97.08   TESTING OF WASTES.
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from
periodic grab samples).

sanitary sewer system who are located outside the limits of the City, and who
have been granted permission by the City to connect to the system.
99.06   RATES FOR USERS OF WATER NOT RETURNING TO SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM.
   There shall be no service charge for water that flows through a special
meter, where the water does not pass through or cycle into the City’s sewer
system, unless such plumbing or meter is tampered with.
99.07   MINIMUM CHARGE.
   1.   The minimum sewerage service charges shall be $13.46 per month for each
water meter installed on a lot, parcel or real estate, building or premises
situated within the City, if all or part of the water measured by the meter
discharges into the sanitary sewer system of the City.
   2.   Multiple dwelling units, including mobile home courts and businesses,
may be serviced from a single meter. The minimum charge for such service shall
be $13.46 per month multiplied by the number of dwelling units or other units
serviced from the meter. Rates for sewage are based on water consumption, and
all in excess of the minimum shall be billed in accordance with Section
99.04 of this chapter.
   3.   It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to notify the
Clerk of any vacancies in multiple dwelling and/or business units and until
such notification is received, the City will charge according to the total
number of dwelling or other units serviced by one meter.
   4.   A dwelling unit is defined as a self-contained living facility (i.e.
including kitchen and bath), such as an apartment or a mobile home space,
including those dwelling units being served by one meter which also serves one
or several businesses.

a single commercial or mercantile activity as a means of a livelihood and has
sewer accessible within the confines of the area operated by the business. In
the event the owner of a building rents out office spaces in the building, each
office space that has sewer accessible in that office space shall be considered
as one business unit and in the case where there are common restrooms to serve
the entire building, the owner or a designated manager shall be billed for one
unit. (For example, if there are four businesses and one common restroom, there
shall be billed to the owner a bill based on one unit; if there are four
businesses and two of the businesses have sewer accessible within the
businesses and the other two do not and there are common restrooms, the owner
shall be billed for three units).
   6.   The minimum sewer service charge for any person discharging wastewater
or other liquid into the sanitary sewer system of the City when said person has
no water meter installed upon his or her premises, shall be $15.47 for each
one-month period or fraction thereof.
(Ord. 003-2025 – Aug. 25 Supp.)
99.08   SPECIAL RATES.
   Where, in the judgment of the Council, special conditions surround the use
of City water to the extent that the application of the service charges
established in this chapter would be inequitable or unfair to either the City
or the customer, the Council may establish a special rate applying to the
customer. The special rates, when adopted by ordinance of the Council, shall
apply to all customers under like circumstances. Such special rates may
include, among others, the following cases:
   1.   Where the nature of the use of City water is such that the resulting
sewage or industrial waste discharged into the sanitary sewer of the City has
characteristics making it more or less difficult to treat than ordinary waste.
   2.   Where the monthly City water use exceeds 25,000 gallons, and a
substantial portion of such water consumed is not polluted and is not
discharged into or does not reach the sanitary sewer system.
   3.   Exide Battery Corporation shall be charged a monthly industrial waste
rate of $0.59 per thousand gallons of water consumption.
(Ord. 003-2025 – Aug. 25 Supp.)
The user charge system shall take precedence over any terms or conditions of
agreements or contracts which are inconsistent with the requirements of Section
204(b)(1)(A) of the Clean Water Act and 40 CFR 35.929-2 dated September 27,
1978.
99.09   PAYMENT OF BILLS.
All sewer service charges are due and payable under the same terms and
conditions provided for payment of a combined service account as contained in
Section
92.10 of this Code of Ordinances. Sewer service may be discontinued in
accordance with the provisions contained in Section
92.12 if the combined service account becomes delinquent, and the provisions
contained in Section
92.16 relating to lien notices shall also apply in the event of a delinquent

lessee or tenant thereof shall be jointly and severally liable for sewer
service charges to the premises. Sewer service charges remaining unpaid and
delinquent shall constitute a lien upon the premises served and shall be
certified by the Clerk to the County Treasurer for collection in the same
manner as property taxes.

Notes
5 † EDITOR’S NOTE: Ordinance No. 010-2004, adopting a natural gas franchise for the
  City, was passed and adopted on October 11, 2004.
110.03   GOVERNING RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   1.   The franchise is granted subject to all conditions, limitations and
immunities now provided for, or as hereafter amended, and applicable to the
operations of a public utility, by State or federal law. The rates to be
charged by Grantee for service within the present or future corporate limits of
the City and the rules and regulations regarding the character, quality and
standards of service to be furnished by Grantee shall be under the jurisdiction
and control of such regulatory body or bodies as may, from time to time, be
vested by law with authority and jurisdiction over the rates, regulations and
quality and standards of service to be supplied by Grantee. Provided however,
should any judicial, regulatory or legislative body, having proper
jurisdiction, take any action that precludes Grantee from recovering from its
customers any cost associated with services provided hereunder, then Grantee
and the City shall renegotiate the terms of the franchise in accordance with
the action taken, so as to allow Grantee to be made whole economically. In
determining the rights and duties of the Grantee, the terms of this chapter
shall take precedence over any conflicting terms or requirements contained in
any other ordinance enacted by the City.
   2.   If an energy supplier is unable to furnish an adequate supply of energy
due to an emergency, an order or decision of a public regulatory body, or other
acts beyond the control of the Grantee, then the Grantee shall have the right
and authority to adopt reasonable rules and regulations limiting, curtailing or
allocating extensions of service or supply of energy to any customers or
prospective customers, and withholding the supply of energy to new customers,
provided that such rules and regulations shall be uniform as applied to each
class of customers or prospective customers, and shall be nondiscriminatory as
between communities receiving service from the Grantee.
110.04   CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF COMPANY FACILITIES.
   1.   Any pavements, sidewalks or curbing taken up and any and all
excavations made shall be done in such a manner as to cause only such
inconvenience to the inhabitants of the City and to the general public as is
reasonably necessary; and repairs and replacements shall be made promptly by
Grantee, leaving such properties in as good a condition as existed immediately
prior to excavation.
   2.   Grantee agrees that for the term of the franchise it will use its best
efforts to maintain facilities and equipment sufficient to meet the current and
future energy requirements of the City, its inhabitants and industries. While
maintaining its facilities and equipment, Grantee shall obtain permits as
required by ordinance, except that in emergency situations, Grantee shall take
immediate unilateral actions as it determines are necessary to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare; in which case, Grantee shall notify the
City as soon as reasonably possible.
   3.   The City will give Grantee reasonable notice of plans for street
improvements where paving or resurfacing of a permanent nature is involved that
affect Grantee’s facilities. The notice shall contain the nature and character
of the improvements, the rights-of-way upon which the improvements are to be
made, the extent of the improvements and the time when the City will start the
work and, if more than one right-of-way is involved, the order in which this
work is to proceed. The notice shall be given to the Grantee a sufficient
length of time, considering seasonable working conditions, in advance of the
actual commencement of the work to permit the Grantee to make any additions,
alterations, or repairs to its facilities.
110.05   FRANCHISE FEE.
   1.   In exchange for the franchise granted herein, Grantee shall collect
from its customers located within the corporate limits of the City (but not
from the City) and pay to the City an amount equal to three percent (3%) of
gross receipts derived from the sale, distribution, or transportation of
natural gas delivered within these areas. The City shall give a minimum of 90
days’ notice prior to the request to implement the three percent fee. The
franchise fee shall be collected as long as the Grantee provides service to the
City. “Gross receipts,” as used herein, are revenues received from the sale,
distribution, or transportation of natural gas, after adjustment for the net
write-off of uncollectible accounts and corrections of bills theretofore
rendered.
   2.   The amount paid by Grantee shall be in lieu of, and Grantee shall be
exempt from, all other occupation, license, excise or right-of-way permit fees
or taxes which the City may impose for the rights and privileges herein granted
or for the privilege of doing business within the City, and in the event any
such fee, charge, license, tax or assessment shall be imposed by the City, the
payment to be made in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be
reduced in an amount equal to the annual burden of such fee, charge, license,
tax or assessment imposed upon the Grantee. Ad valorem property taxes imposed
generally upon all real and personal property within the City shall not be
deemed to affect the obligation of the Grantee under this section.
   3.   Any consideration hereunder shall be reported and paid to the City by
Grantee on a monthly basis. Such payment shall be made not more than thirty
(30) days following the close of the period for which payment is due. Initial
and final payments shall be prorated for the portion of the period at the
beginning and end of the term of the franchise.
   4.   Grantee shall list the local franchise fee collected from customers as
a separate item on bills for utility service issued to customers. If at any
time the Iowa Utility Board, or other authority having proper jurisdiction,
prohibits, revises, or substitutes a different fee for such recovery, then
Grantee will collect and pay the franchise fee herein contemplated in
accordance with the applicable Iowa Law. Upon being relieved of the obligation
to collect and pay the franchise fee, Grantee shall have the right to continue
paying City the fees previously collected from customers as set forth above. In
addition, a Grantee may discount or reduce the franchise fee payable for
natural gas delivered to a specific customer of Grantee when it is required to
reduce the franchise fee to retain the business of that customer. Modification
or reduction of the franchise fee should occur if the franchise fee would cause
the customer to cease purchase or transportation deliveries of natural gas from
the Grantee by installing equipment to access natural gas supply not subject to
the City’s franchise fee.
   5.   The City shall provide copies of annexation ordinances to Grantee on a
timely basis to ensure appropriate franchise fee collection from customers
within the corporate limits of the City.
   6.   The City shall have access to and the right to examine during normal
business hours, those of Grantee’s books, receipts, files, records and
documents that are necessary to verify the correctness of payments due
hereunder. If it is determined that a mistake was made in the payment of any
franchise fee required hereunder, such mistake shall be corrected promptly upon
discovery, such that any under-payment by Grantee shall be paid within 30 days
of the recalculation and any over-payment by Grantee shall be discounted from
the next payment(s) due.
110.06   EXTENSION OF COMPANY FACILITIES.
Upon receipt and acceptance of a valid application for service, Grantee shall,
subject to its own economic feasibility criteria, make reasonable extensions of
its distribution facilities to serve customers located within the current or
future corporate limits of the City.
110.07   RELOCATION OF COMPANY FACILITIES.
If the City elects to change the grade of or otherwise alter any street, alley,
avenue, bridge, public right-of-way or public place for a public purpose,
Grantee, upon reasonable notice from the City, shall remove and relocate its
facilities or equipment situated in the public rights-of-way, if such removal
is necessary to prevent interference and not merely for the convenience of the
City, at the cost and expense of Grantee. If the City orders or requests
Grantee to relocate its facilities or equipment for the primary benefit of a
commercial or private project, or as a result of the initial request of a
commercial or private developer or other non-public entity, and such removal is
necessary to prevent interference and not merely for the convenience of the
City or other right-of-way user, Grantee shall receive payment for the cost of
such relocation as a precondition to relocating its facilities or equipment.
The City shall consider reasonable alternatives in designing its public works
projects so as not arbitrarily to cause Grantee unreasonable additional expense
in exercising its authority under this section. The City shall also provide a
reasonable alternative location for Grantee’s facilities. The City shall give
Grantee written notice of vacating of a public right-of-way. Vacating of a
public right-of-way shall not deprive the Grantee of its right to operate and
maintain existing facilities, until the reasonable cost of relocating the same
are first paid to the Grantee. Any person or corporation desiring to move a
building or other structure along, or to make any unusual use of any street,
alley, avenue, bridge, public right-of-way or public place which shall
interfere with the facilities or equipment of the Grantee, shall first give
notice to the City and the Grantee and pay a sum sufficient to cover the
expense and damage incident to the moving of Grantee’s facilities and
equipment.
110.08   CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
The City acknowledges that certain information it might request pursuant to the
franchise may be of a proprietary and confidential nature. If Grantee requests
that any information provided by Grantee to the City be kept confidential due
to such proprietary or commercial value, the City and its employees, agents,
and representatives shall maintain the confidentiality of that information, to
the extent allowed by law. If the City is requested or required by legal or
administrative process to disclose any such confidential information, the City
shall promptly notify Grantee of such request or requirement so that Grantee
may seek an appropriate protective order or other relief. The City shall use
all reasonable efforts to ensure that the confidentiality of Grantee’s
confidential information is maintained.
110.09   FORCE MAJEURE.
It shall not be a breach or default under this chapter if either party fails to
perform its obligations hereunder due to Force Majeure. Force Majeure includes,
but is not limited to, the following: (i) physical events such as acts of God,
landslides, lightning, earthquakes, fires, freezing, storms, floods, washouts,
explosions, breakage or accident or necessity of repairs to machinery,
equipment or distribution or transmission lines; (ii) acts of others such as
strikes, work-force stoppages, riots, sabotage, insurrections or wars; (iii)
governmental actions such as necessity for compliance with any court order,
law, statute, ordinance, executive order, or regulation promulgated by a
governmental authority having jurisdiction; and any other causes, whether of
the kind herein enumerated or otherwise not reasonably within the control of
the affected party to prevent or overcome. Each party shall make reasonable
efforts to avoid Force Majeure and to resolve such event as promptly as
reasonably possible once it occurs in order to resume performance; provided,
however, this provision shall not obligate a party to settle any labor strike.
110.10   HOLD HARMLESS.
Grantee, during the term of the franchise, agrees to save harmless the City
from and against all claims, demands, losses and expenses arising directly out
of the negligence of Grantee, its employees or agents, in the constructing,
operating, and maintaining of distribution and transmission facilities or
appliances of Grantee; provided, however, Grantee need not save harmless the
City from claims, demands, losses and expenses arising out of the negligence of
the City, its employees or agents.
110.11   NON WAIVER.
Any waiver of any obligation or default under this chapter shall not be
construed as a waiver of any future defaults, whether of like or different
character.

136.01   PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to enhance safe passage by citizens on
sidewalks, to place the responsibility for the maintenance, repair, replacement
or reconstruction of sidewalks upon the abutting property owner and to minimize
the liability of the City.
136.02   DEFINITIONS.

   9.   “Wood float finish” means a sidewalk finish that is made by smoothing
the surface of the sidewalk with a wooden trowel.
136.03   REMOVAL OF SNOW, ICE AND ACCUMULATIONS.
The abutting property owner is responsible for the removal of snow and ice from
sidewalks. Snow or ice from sidewalks may be disposed of along the curbs of the
streets prior to the commencement of the City’s snow removal operations. Snow
or ice may not be disposed of on a street after the City’s snow removal
operations have been completed on that street, except in the business district.
This section is not applicable to snow or ice from roofs, parking lots,
driveways, and private property other than sidewalks. Should any accumulation
of snow or ice remain on any sidewalk in the City for ten (10) daylight hours
after the same has fallen or been deposited thereon, it shall be the duty of
the City Manager to cause such accumulation to be removed forthwith and without
notice to the owner or occupant of the lot or property to which said sidewalk
is adjacent; and at the next regular meeting of the Council, the Manager shall
report to the Council the number of running feet of sidewalk cleared of snow
and ice on any lot or parcel of ground, the actual expense thereof, the date
when cleaned, the proper description of the lot or parcel of ground and the
name of the owner thereof. The Council shall examine the cost of the removal
against the lot, part of lot or parcel of ground and direct the Clerk to
certify the cost and assessments to the County Treasurer; and it shall be
collected with and in the same manner as general taxes as provided in Section
364.12 of the Code of Iowa. The abutting property owner may be liable for
damages caused by failure to remove snow, ice, and accumulations promptly from
the sidewalk.
136.04   PROPERTY OWNER’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAINTENANCE.
The abutting property owner shall repair, replace, or reconstruct, or cause to
be repaired, replaced, or reconstructed, all broken or defective sidewalks and
maintain in a safe and hazard-free condition any sidewalk outside the lot and
property lines and inside the curb lines or, in the absence of a curb, any
sidewalk between the property line and that portion of the public street used
or improved for vehicular purposes. The abutting property owner may be liable
for damages caused by failure to maintain the sidewalk.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[2c])
136.05   ORDERING SIDEWALK IMPROVEMENTS.
The Council may order the construction, reconstruction, repair or replacement
of permanent sidewalks upon any street or court. Notice of this order shall be
sent to the owner by certified mail. The notice shall include the fact that the
owner may request a hearing by the Council within fifteen (15) days of receipt
of the notice.
136.06   REPAIRING DEFECTIVE SIDEWALKS.
   1.   Property Owner’s Responsibility. It shall be the duty of the abutting
property owner at any time, or upon receipt of thirty (30) days’ notice from
the City, to repair, replace or reconstruct all broken or defective sidewalks
in the street right-of-way abutting said owner’s property. Sidewalks which
extend into the street right-of-way (including the ramp area, as well as
sidewalks) and across alleys will be the responsibility of the City. If, after
the expiration of the thirty (30) days, as provided in the notice, the required
work has not been done, or is not in the process of completion, the City
Inspector shall proceed to repair, replace or reconstruct the sidewalk. Upon
completion of the work, there shall be submitted to the Council an itemized and
verified statement of expenditures for labor and material, and the legal
description of the property abutting the sidewalk on which work has been
performed. These costs shall be assessed to the property as taxes.
   2.   Appeal Procedure. A property owner, upon receipt of notice from the
City to repair or reconstruct all broken or defective sidewalk in the street
right-of-way abutting said owner’s property, shall be entitled to appeal the
notice by the following procedure:
      A.   Within ten (10) days after receipt of notice, the property owner
shall file in writing with the Clerk a request for appeal to the Manchester
Building Inspector. The Building Inspector shall schedule a time to meet with
the property owner to be held within five (5) days of receipt of the notice of
appeal, to discuss issues raised by the property owner on appeal. The Building
Inspector shall provide a written response by ordinary U.S. mail to the
property owner within three (3) days of said meeting.
      B.   Within seven (7) days of mailing the written response by the
Building Inspector to the property owner, the property owner shall file a
written notice of appeal to the Clerk, requesting a hearing before the Sidewalk
Repair Committee. The Sidewalk Repair Committee shall be comprised of two
Council members and one person appointed by the Council. Within ten (10) days
after filing a written notice of appeal to the Sidewalk Repair Committee, the
Committee shall meet to hear and decide issues raised on appeal by the property
owner. The Committee shall, by ordinary U.S. mail within three (3) days after
the hearing, issue its written decision to the property owner.
      C.   Within seven (7) days after mailing the written decision of the
Sidewalk Repair Committee to the property owner, the property owner shall file
a written notice of appeal with the Clerk, requesting a hearing before the full
Council. A hearing shall be scheduled with the Council within twenty-one (21)
days after filing of notice of appeal to the Council by the property owner.
Following hearing before the Council, a decision shall be made and voted upon
by the Council. The decision of the Council shall be considered a final action.
136.07   DANGEROUS CONDITIONS.
When a sidewalk is found to be in such a dangerous condition that, in the
opinion of the Building Inspector, there should be no delay in remedying the
deficiency, it shall be the duty of the City Manager immediately to cause to be
erected sufficient barriers to protect the public until such time as the
Council can authorize the defective sidewalk to be repaired or reconstructed.
136.08   PERMIT REQUIRED.
No person shall make any sidewalk improvements, whether ordered by the Council
or not, unless such person shall obtain a permit from the City Inspector and
shall agree in writing that said person will, in making the sidewalk
improvements, comply with the ordinances of the City and with the
specifications for sidewalks approved by the Council and on file in the office
of the Clerk, and that the work shall be done under the direction and
supervision of the City Inspector and subject to the approval of that officer.
Said person shall also agree to hold the City free from all liability for
damages on account of injuries received by anyone through the negligence of
such person or agents or employees in making the sidewalk improvements, or by
reason of such person’s failure to properly guard the premises. All such
permits shall be issued without charge, and a copy thereof, together with the
written agreement referred to above, shall be filed and preserved in the office
of the City Inspector. Before granting any permit to make sidewalk
improvements, the City Inspector shall determine the propriety of the same and
shall state in all permits issued when the work is to be commenced and when the
sidewalk work is to be completed. The time of completion for the sidewalk
improvements may be extended by the City Inspector when, in the judgment of the
Inspector, it is deemed necessary. All permits for the Council-ordered sidewalk
improvements shall be issued in compliance with the resolution of the Council
ordering the improvement. All permits for sidewalk improvement not ordered by
resolution of the Council shall be issued in compliance with this chapter. The
City Inspector may withhold the issuance of any permit for sidewalk
improvements for a sufficient period to determine the necessity for the
proposed improvements or when weather conditions will adversely affect the
sidewalk improvements.
136.09   FAILURE TO OBTAIN PERMIT; REMEDIES.
Whenever any sidewalk improvements are made that do not conform to the
provisions of this chapter and with the specifications or when any sidewalk
improvements are made without a permit, the City Inspector shall serve notice
to obtain a permit upon the property owner and upon the contractor doing the
work. If the sidewalk is in the course of construction, the notice shall order
the work to stop until a permit is obtained and the work is corrected to comply
with the specifications. If the sidewalk work has been completed, the owner
shall obtain a permit immediately and perform any needed corrections within
five (5) days after receipt of the permit. If the owner fails to comply with
this notice, the City Inspector shall have the work completed and the costs
assessed to the property owner as provided in this chapter.
136.10   INSPECTION AND APPROVAL.
Upon final completion, the Building Inspector shall inspect the work and may
order corrections if the work does not meet specifications. When the work does
meet all requirements of this chapter, the specifications and the permit, the
City Inspector shall indicate this on both copies of the permit.
136.11   ASSESSMENTS TO PRIVATE PROPERTY.
The City may assess to private property within the City costs of construction
and repair of sidewalks within the City all pursuant to the rights, duties and
procedures established in Chapter 384 of the Code of Iowa. Nothing in this
chapter shall be considered or construed to limit or prohibit the City from
following and implementing the special assessment procedures outlined in the
Code of Iowa for sidewalk improvements, including the initial construction
thereof.
136.12   NOTICE OF ASSESSMENT FOR REPAIR OR CLEANING.
When the City Building Inspector submits a bill for sidewalk improvements or
for the removal of accumulations as provided in this chapter, the Clerk shall
send a notice of such facts to the owner of the abutting property. The notice
may be given either by personal service or by certified mail to the last known
address of the owner. The notice shall contain a statement of the work
performed, the cost of the work that is being assessed, a description of the
property affected and the fact that the person may pay the amount assessed
within thirty (30) days without interest or penalty. The notice also shall
indicate that the person may object to such assessment and give the place and
time at which the Council will hear such objections. The time set for hearing
shall be at least fifteen (15) days after service or mailing of the notice.
136.13   HEARING AND ASSESSMENT.
At the time and place designated in the notice provided for herein, the Council
shall consider all objections to the assessment, correct all errors or
omissions and adopt a corrected list of the amounts to be assessed against the
property.
136.14   CERTIFYING TO THE COUNTY TREASURER.
Thirty (30) days after the Council’s decision, the Clerk shall certify any
unpaid amounts to the County Treasurer. The unpaid assessments shall be
collected by the County Treasurer in the same manner as other taxes. Any
assessment that exceeds one hundred dollars ($100.00) may be paid in
installments as set by the Council, not exceeding ten (10), in the same manner
and at the same interest rates as for special assessments under Chapter 384 of
the Code of Iowa. No interest shall be charged for assessments, or parts
thereof, paid within thirty (30) days of the time the Council has determined
the final amounts.
136.15   SIDEWALK STANDARDS.

street, road, or highway is newly built or reconstructed, a curb ramp or sloped
area shall be constructed or installed at each intersection of the street,
road, or highway with a sidewalk or path. If a sidewalk or path is newly built
or reconstructed, a curb ramp or sloped area shall be constructed or installed
at each intersection of the sidewalk or path with a street, highway, or road.

lessee of the property in front of or along which such material may be
deposited, or such dangerous condition exists, to put in conspicuous places at
each end of such sidewalk and at each end of any pile of material deposited in
the street, a sufficient number of approved warning lights or flares, and to
keep them lighted during the entire night and to erect sufficient barricades
both at night and in the daytime to secure the same. The party or parties using
the street for any of the purposes specified in this chapter shall be liable

may be issued by the Mayor shall be subject to revocation by the Mayor at any
time without notice, whereupon the obstruction shall be removed at once from
the sidewalk and/or street. There shall be no fee for the permit; however,
anyone who fails to obtain such a permit shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

structure or portion thereof reported as dangerous or damaged and, if such is
found to be an unsafe building as defined in this chapter, the enforcement

146.07   MOBILE HOME PARK OCCUPATIONS.
The intent of this section is to protect and maintain the residential character

zoning and regulatory specifications at all times.
      B.   No equipment or process shall be used in such mobile home park
occupation that creates noise, vibration, glare, fumes, odors, electrical

detrimental to the residential character of the mobile home park neighborhood.
   5.   Conformity to Regulations. Any business, profession, occupation or
activity which does not meet these definitions, regulations and requirements,
shall not be deemed to be a mobile home park occupation.
   6.   Permit Requirement. A mobile home occupation cannot be granted or

   7.   Application for Permit. Persons seeking a mobile home park occupation
permit shall file with the Building Inspector a request for the permit, setting

conditions shall be deemed a violation of this section.
   9.   Standard for Review of Mobile Home Park Occupation Permits. In

diminish or impair the public health, comfort, morals or welfare of inhabitants
of the area or of the City in general.
      F.   The surrounding property will be protected.
The Board of Adjustment may require conditions for issuing the permit which it
deems necessary to protect the residential character of the mobile home park.
   10.   Failure to Act. In case an applicant does not exercise his or her
rights, act, begin construction or operation or occupancy, as the case may be,
in accordance with the permit granted by the Board of Adjustment within six (6)
months after the matter has been acted upon by the Board, such permit shall
become null and void.

detain the difference between the 5-year pre-developed storm and the 100-year
developed storm.
   2.   The maximum release rate for storms up to an expected return frequency
of 100 years shall be the 5-year pre-developed storm. A safe overflow path
shall be designed for storms exceeding the capacity of the detention/retention
basin.
   3.   Regional storm water management facilities are encouraged. Wet basins
are also encouraged because they enhance water quality, add aesthetic value,
and increase property value.
   4.   For new residential developments, storm water detention is not allowed
within any front or side yard setbacks required by the Zoning Code, or within
25 feet from the estimated rear building line. A single lot detention or
retention will not be allowed within 3 feet of rear building lot line.
   5.   Dry-bottomed detention basins shall be oversized by 10% to help offset
anticipated sedimentation. An alternative to over-sizing is the construction of

   1.   Permits. No person except the City or a person hired by the City shall
plant or remove any tree on City property without first filing an application
and obtaining a permit from the City. The person receiving the permit shall
abide by the Arboricultural Specifications and Standards of Practice as adopted
by the City. The City shall have the authority to require any permit holder to
show adequate insurance coverage to cover potential damages that occur during
the execution of the work. In the case of the property owner doing the work,
proof of homeowner personal liability insurance may be required. If the
property owner has hired another person or contractor to do the work, the
contractor shall provide the City with a certificate of insurance. The
certificates shall show the following minimum required limits of coverage of
Commercial General Liability Insurance with limits of not less than $500,000
per occurrence and Worker’s Compensation Insurance coverage at statutory limits
on any and all employees. A public utility shall also be required to obtain a
permit to trim or remove any tree on any street or other public place. The work
shall be limited to the actual necessities of the service of the company in the
area specified on the permit. This work shall be done in accordance with the
Arboricultural Specifications and Standards of Practice as established for the
City. The City may assign an inspector to supervise the provisions of the
permit. The cost of the service shall be charged to the public utility. In the
event severe weather has caused a tree to damage utility lines, the utility
company or the City (or authorized agent) may trim or remove trees necessary to
repair the damaged utility lines without first obtaining a permit. A permit
should be obtained before any additional trimming not required for repair of
the utility line is done.
   2.   Planting.
      A.   Tree Species. The City Forestry Improvement Committee shall develop
and maintain a list of desirable trees for planting in the right-of-way as part
of the City’s Arboricultural Specifications and Standards of Practice. The
Forestry Improvement Committee shall also establish and maintain a list of
trees not suitable for planting.
      B.   Spacing. In order to promote the healthy and vigorous growth of
street trees, their spacing shall be in accordance with the City’s
Arboricultural Specifications and Standards of Practice.
      C.   Utilities. In order to minimize obstructions and conflicts, the
placement of street trees under, over, adjacent to or near utility lines shall
be limited as specified in the City’s Arboricultural Specifications and
Standards of Practice.
      D.   Distance from Curb and Sidewalk. In order to promote the healthy and
vigorous growth of street trees, certain distances as specified in the City’s
Arboricultural Specifications and Standards of Practice from curbs, sidewalks,
driveways and intersections shall be maintained.
      E.   Excavation and Construction. In order to promote and ensure the
healthy and vigorous growth of street trees, any excavation, filling or
construction occurring within an area specified in the City’s Arboricultural
Specifications and Standards of Practice of a street tree is prohibited unless
a permit is obtained from the City.
      F.   Storage. The depositing, placement, storage or maintenance of any
stone, brick, sand, concrete or other material within the drip line of a tree
which may impede the free passage of water, air or fertilizer to the roots of
any street tree is prohibited without obtaining a permit.
   3.   Maintenance. Due to the existence of City street trees, the resulting
tree-lined streets provide both aesthetic and monetary value to the property
owner; therefore, the primary care and maintenance of street and parkway trees
shall be the responsibility of the adjacent homeowner. Persons shall maintain
trees and plants in the parkway on which their property abuts at the same
standard of care imposed on persons growing trees and plants on private
property. It shall be the duty of any person growing a tree or other plant on
private property abutting a street or public place:
      A.   To keep all private trees and planting extending over any street or
alley trimmed up to a height of not less than fourteen (14) feet except that a
height of not less than seven (7) feet shall be permitted over the sidewalk
area, and also to keep said space clear of debris. If the abutting property
owner fails to trim the trees, the City may serve notice on the abutting
property owner requiring that such action be taken within five (5) days. If
such action is not taken within that time, the City may perform the required
action and assess the costs against the abutting property for collection in the
same manner as a property tax.
      B.   Not to plant any tree or other plant which would cause a public
danger or a nuisance.
      C.   To treat in an accepted manner or remove any tree or plant diseased
or insect-ridden as to constitute a hazard to other trees or plants or to
constitute a nuisance to the health, welfare and safety of the community.
      D.   Removal. If in the opinion of the City, removal of a street tree
becomes necessary, the adjacent property shall be notified as specified in the
City’s Arboricultural Specifications and Standards of Practice. In the event
the adjacent property requests the removal of a street tree or shrub the City
does not consider the removal necessary, the property owner may appeal the
Street Superintendent’s decision to the Forestry Improvement Committee as
outlined in Section
151.10 of this chapter.
      E.   Traffic Control. In the event the planting, maintenance or removal
of any tree requires equipment or material to be located on or fall onto the
street right-of-way, the permit holder shall provide for traffic control. All
traffic control shall conform to the requirements and specifications of the
current edition of the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). In
all cases, the disruption of smooth traffic flow shall be kept to a minimum.
Additional warning devices or precautionary measures may be necessary to
control pedestrian traffic.

151.09   TREES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.
   1.   Maintenance. The property owner is responsible for the maintenance and
care of any tree located on private property. Certain regulations apply to
trees whose branches, limbs, roots or other parts extend into or over the
street right-of-way. The property owner is responsible for ensuring private
trees are trimmed to sufficient height to allow free passage of pedestrians and
vehicular travel and so they will not obstruct or shade streetlights, traffic
lights, signs or any traffic control devices or the view of any street
intersection. Detailed information is contained in the City’s Arboricultural
Specifications and Standards of Practice. Whenever the City is notified or
becomes aware of a dead tree or broken or dead branch or limb in any private
tree which is in imminent danger of falling and thereby injuring any individual
or causing property damage to adjacent property, the Street Superintendent may
declare the tree, branch or limb a hazard and order the property owner to
remove the hazard in an expedient manner. If the property owner fails to remove
the hazard, the Street Superintendent may cause the hazard to be removed. For
purposes of removing the hazard, City crews or City agents shall be allowed on
private property. Attempts should be made to notify the property owner before
entering onto private property.
   2.   Traffic Control. In the event the planting, maintenance or removal of
any private tree requires equipment or material to be located on or fall onto
the street right-of-way, the homeowner or the homeowner's agent shall provide
for traffic control. All traffic control shall conform to the requirements and
specifications of the current edition of the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control
Devices (MUTCD). In all cases the disruption of smooth traffic flow shall be
kept to a minimum. Additional warning devices or precautionary measures may be
necessary to control pedestrian traffic.
151.10   ENFORCEMENT.
   1.   Appeals. A person may appeal the issuance or denial of a permit
authorized by this chapter or an order of the Street Superintendent providing
for the non-emergency removal of a tree or shrub pursuant to the following
procedure:
      A.   Within 10 days of receiving the decision the Street Superintendent,
notice of appeal shall be given to the Street Superintendent and Forestry
Improvement Committee in writing. The notice of appeal shall state the nature
of the objection and request a hearing. Hearing shall be held before the
Forestry Improvement Committee within 20 days of the filing of the notice of
appeal. Following hearing, the Forestry Improvement Committee shall, within ten
(10) days, provide a written decision concerning the issues raised by the
notice of appeal.
      B.   A person may appeal the decision of the Forestry Improvement
Committee to the City Council by filing a written notice with the City Clerk
within seven (7) days after issuance of the decision of the Forestry
Improvement Committee. The notice of appeal shall specify the nature of the
objection to the decision of the Forestry Improvement Committee, and shall
include a summary of the factual basis supporting the appeal, as well as a
request for hearing before the City Council. The hearing shall be held before
the City Council within 20 days after the notice of appeal being filed with the
City Clerk. The City Council shall, within 10 days after hearing the appeal,
issue a decision. The decision of the City Council shall constitute a final
decision.
   2.   Interference. No person shall hinder, prevent, delay or otherwise
interfere with the City or any assistants in the execution or enforcement of
this chapter.
   3.   Penalties. Any person violating or failing to comply with the
provisions of this chapter shall be considered in violation, and provisions for
the City to abate the nuisance shall be made as specified in

and resources.
      E.   Give due consideration to the preservation of canopied areas and
mature trees and to provide for the mitigation of canopied areas and mature
trees which are removed for development.
   2.   The site planning review requirements of this chapter are designed to
ensure the orderly and harmonious development of such property in a manner that
shall:
      A.   Promote the most beneficial relation between present and proposed
future uses of land and the present and proposed future circulation of traffic
throughout the City.
      B.   Permit present development of property commensurate with fair and
orderly planning for future development of other properties in the various
areas of the City with respect to the availability and capacity, present and
foreseeable, of public facilities and services. The factors to be considered in
arriving at a conclusion concerning proposed present development of property
shall include the following:
         (1)   The maximum population density for the proposed development, the
proposed density of use, and consideration of the effect the proposal will have
on the capacity of existing water and sanitary sewer lines to the end that
existing systems will not become overloaded or capacity so substantially
decreased that site use will inhibit or preclude planned future development.
         (2)   Zoning restrictions at the time of the proposal.
         (3)   The City’s comprehensive plan.
         (4)   The City’s plans for future construction and provision for
public facilities and services.

161.08   DESIGN REGULATIONS.
The design regulations provided in this section are necessary to ensure the
orderly and harmonious development of property in such manner as will safeguard
the public’s health, safety, and general welfare and to ensure that the future
development of property in the City will not be foreclosed by such development.
The decision to approve, approve subject to conditions, or disapprove a
proposed site plan shall be based upon the conformance of the site plan with
the following design regulations:
   1.   The design of the proposed development shall make adequate provisions
for surface and subsurface drainage, including submittal of a storm water
runoff control plan in compliance with subsections
161.07(5) and (6), for connections to water and sanitary sewer lines, each so
designed as to neither overload nor to substantially decrease the capacity of
existing public utility lines in a fashion that will serve to inhibit or
preclude the planned future development of other property within the City and
so as not to increase the danger of erosion, flooding, landslide, or other
endangerment of adjoining or surrounding property. The City’s comprehensive
plan shall be the principal guide in determining the prospective use and
population density of other properties. However, the factors to be considered
in arriving at conclusions on standards of design shall include those set forth
in subsection
161.01(2)(B).
   2.   The proposed development shall be designed and located within the
property in such manner as not to unduly diminish or impair the use and
enjoyment of adjoining property and to this end shall minimize the adverse
effects on such adjoining properties from automobile headlights, illumination
of required perimeter yards, refuse containers, and impairment of light and
air. For purposes of this subsection, the term “use and enjoyment of adjoining
property” means the use and enjoyment presently being made of such adjoining
property, unless such property is vacant. If vacant, the term “use and
enjoyment of adjoining property” means those uses permitted under the zoning
district in which such adjoining property is located.
   3.   The proposed development shall have such entrances and exits upon
adjacent streets and such internal traffic circulation patterns as will not
unduly increase congestion on adjacent or surrounding public streets and in a
manner which will conform to the proposed future circulation of traffic
throughout the City and provide for adequate fire protection access.
   4.   To such end as may be necessary and proper to accomplish the standards
in subsections 1, 2, and 3 of this section, the proposed development shall
provide water, sewer, storm water, street, erosion control, or other
improvements.
   5.   All electrical, telephone, and cable television transmission systems
shall be placed underground whenever reasonably practicable.
   6.   The proposed development shall conform to all applicable provisions of
State law and all applicable sections of this Code.
   7.   The proposed development shall provide landscaping, including plantings
fences and screening in accordance with the Zoning Ordinance landscaping
requirements.
   8.   The proposed development shall comply with the requirements of the tree
removal and mitigation ordinance codified in
Chapter 151 of this Code of Ordinances.
   9.   The storm water runoff control facilities installed in compliance with
the storm water runoff control plan shall be maintained in compliance with
subsections
161.07(5) and (6).
161.09   MODIFICATION OF SITE PLAN.
The City Manager, or his/her designee (or the Planning Commission and Council
as applicable,) may require modification of a site plan as a prerequisite for
approval. Required modifications may be more restrictive than base district
regulations and may include, but not be limited to, additional landscaping or
screening; designation of building materials; installation of erosion control
measures; improvement of access or circulation; rearrangement of structures on
the site; or other modifications deemed necessary to protect the public health,
safety, welfare, community character, property values, and/or aesthetics.
   1.   Term and Modification of Approval.
      A.   A Site Plan Approval shall become void one year after the date of
approval, unless the applicant receives a building permit and diligently
carries out development prior to the expiration of this period.
      B.   The City Manager, or his/her designee, may approve an application to
modify a previously approved site plan if he/she determines that the
modification is minor and does not affect any conditions stipulated by City
Council.
      C.   The City Manager, or his/her designee, may revoke a Site Plan
Approval if he/she determines that the development is not complying with the
terms and conditions of the approval. Such revocation may be appealed to the

162.01   STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
   1.   The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 364, Code of Iowa,
as amended, delegated the power to cities to exercise any power and perform any
function it deems appropriate to protect and preserve the rights, privileges
and property of the City or of its residents, and to preserve and improve the
peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort and convenience of its residents.
   2.   Findings of Fact.
      A.   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of
the community.
      B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by: (i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
      C.   This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
   3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Paragraph 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
      A.   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows
so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
      B.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
      C.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
      D.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
      E.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.

all areas shown thereon to be within the boundaries of the base flood shall be
considered as having significant flood hazards. The Delaware County Flood
Insurance Study is hereby adopted by reference and is made a part of this
ordinance for the purpose of administering floodplain management regulations.
   2.   Rules for Interpretation of Flood Hazard Boundaries. The boundaries of
the Special Flood Hazard areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the
official Flood Insurance Rate Map. Where uncertainty exists with respect to the
precise location of the base flood boundary, the location shall be determined
on the basis of the base flood elevation at the particular site in question.
When an interpretation is needed as to the exact location of a boundary, the
Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The Council shall hear
and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any
requirement, decision, or determination made by the Administrator in the
enforcement or administration of this Ordinance.
   3.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no
structure shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered
without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
   4.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provision of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with
this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
   5.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
   6.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated special flood hazard areas will be
free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on
the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
   7.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.

required to submit certification by a professional engineer or land surveyor,
as appropriate, registered in the State of Iowa, that the finished fill,
structure floor elevations, floodproofing, or other flood protection measures
were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to
the use or occupancy of any structure.
162.05   FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT STANDARDS.
   1.   General Floodplain Standards. All development must be consistent with
the need to minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance
standards. Where base flood elevations have not been provided in the Flood
Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to
determine (i) whether the land involved is either wholly or partly within the
floodway or floodway fringe and (ii) the base flood elevation. Until a
regulatory floodway is designated, no development may increase the Base Flood
Elevation more than one (1) foot. The applicant will be responsible for
providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical
information to make such determination. Review by the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources is not required for the proposed construction of new or
replacement bridges or culverts where (i) the bridge or culvert is located on a
stream that drains less than two (2) square miles, and (ii) the bridge or
culvert is not associated with a channel modification that constitutes a
channel change as specified in 567-71.2(2), Iowa Administrative Code.
      A.   All development shall:
         (1)   Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement.
         (2)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
         (3)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are
resistant to flood damage.
      B.   Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved
residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation. Construction
shall be upon compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one
foot above the base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18
feet beyond the limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of
elevating (such as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed subject to
favorable consideration by the City Council, where existing topography, street
grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods
used must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various
forces and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential structures
located in areas that would become isolated due to flooding of surrounding
ground shall be provided with a means of access that will be passable by
wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this criterion shall not apply
where the Floodplain Administrator determines there is sufficient flood warning
time for the protection of life and property. When estimating flood warning
time, consideration shall be given to the criteria listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa
Administrative Code.
      C.   Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level. When
floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State of
Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and
other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the
base flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Floodplain
Administrator.
      D.   All New and Substantially Improved Structures:
         (1)   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
            a.   A minimum of two (2) openings, with positioning on at least
two (2) walls, having a total net area of not less than one square inch for
every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.)    
            b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
            c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access and
low damage potential storage.
         (2)   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
         (3)   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed
with electric meter, electrical service panel box, hot water heater, heating,
air conditioning, ventilation equipment (including ductwork), and other similar
machinery and equipment elevated (or in the case on non-residential structures,
optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood
elevation.
         (4)   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed
with plumbing, gas lines, water/gas meters and other similar service utilities
either elevated (or in the case of non-residential structures, optionally
floodproofed to) a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation or
designed to be watertight and withstand inundation to such a level.
      E.   Factory-Built Homes:
         (1)   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes,
including those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions,
shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
structure is a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation.
         (2)   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes,
including those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions,
shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Anchorage
systems may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties
to ground anchors as required by the State Building Code.
      F.   Utility and Sanitary Systems:
         (1)   On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located
or designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
         (2)   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system
as well as the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment
facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood
protection equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood elevation.
         (3)   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water
supply treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with
a level of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood
elevation.
         (4)   Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
      G.   Storage of Equipment and Materials. Storage of equipment and
materials that are flammable, explosive, or injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base
flood elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated
or: (i) not subject to major flood damage and anchored to prevent movement due
to flood waters; or (ii) readily removable from the area within the time
available after flood warning.
      H.   Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as
levees, flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the base
flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for
adequate interior drainage. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources
shall approve structural flood control works.
      I.   Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must
be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources must
approve such alterations or relocations.
      J.   Subdivision. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and
subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the base flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50 lots
(whichever is less) shall include base flood elevation data for those areas
located within the Special Flood Hazard Area.
      K.   Accessory Structures to Residential Uses.
         (1)   Detached garages, sheds, and similar structures that are
incidental to a residential use are exempt from the base flood elevation
requirements where the following criteria are satisfied:
            a.   The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential. Its size shall not exceed 600 sq. ft. in size. Those portions of the
structure located less than 1 foot above the base flood elevation must be
constructed of flood-resistant materials.
            b.   The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage
potential purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure
shall not be used for human habitation.
            c.   The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building
site so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
            d.   The structure shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement which may result in damage to other structures.
            e.   The structure’s service facilities such as electrical and
heating equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above
the base flood elevation.
            f.   The structure’s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of Paragraph D(1) of this subsection.
         (2)   Exemption from the base flood elevation requirements for such a
structure may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of
the structure and its contents.
      L.   Recreational Vehicles. Recreational vehicles are exempt from the
requirements of Paragraph E of this subsection regarding anchoring and
elevation of factory-built homes when the following criteria are satisfied.
         (1)   The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less
than 180 consecutive days; and
         (2)   The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than 180
consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements of
Paragraph E of this subsection regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-
built homes.
      M.   Pipeline Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be
buried in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to
prevent rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
      N.   Maximum Damage Potential Development. All new or substantially
improved maximum damage potential development shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the elevation of
the 500-year flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be
floodproofed to such a level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional
engineer registered in the State of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing
methods used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities,
impact and uplift forces and other factors associated with the 0.2% annual
chance flood; and that the structure, below the 0.2% annual chance flood
elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water. A record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in
relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator. Where 0.2% chance flood
elevation data has not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The
applicant will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources
with sufficient technical information to make such determinations.
   2.   Special Floodway Provisions. In addition to the General Floodplain
Standards, development within the floodway must meet the following applicable
standards. The floodway is that portion of the floodplain which must be
protected from developmental encroachment to allow the free flow of flood
waters. Where floodway data has been provided in the Flood Insurance Study,
such data shall be used to define the floodway. Where no floodway data has been
provided, the Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to provide a
floodway delineation. The applicant will be responsible for providing the
Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make
such determination.
      A.   No development shall be permitted in the floodway that would result
in any increase in the base flood elevation. Consideration of the effects of
any development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption that an
equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly situated lands.
      B.   All development within the floodway shall:
         (1)   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
         (2)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
         (3)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are
resistant to flood damage.
      C.   No development shall affect the capacity or conveyance of the
channel or floodway of any tributary to the main stream, drainage ditch or any
other drainage facility or system.
      D.   Structures, buildings, recreational vehicles, and sanitary and
utility systems, if permitted, shall meet the applicable General Floodplain
standards and shall be constructed or aligned to present the minimum possible
resistance to flood flows.
      E.   Structures, if permitted, shall have a low flood damage potential
and shall not be for human habitation.
      F.   Storage of materials or equipment that are buoyant, flammable,
explosive or injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited. Storage of
other material may be allowed if readily removable from the floodway within the
time available after flood warning.
      G.   Watercourse alterations or relocations (channel changes and
modifications) must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within
the altered or relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations
must be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
      H.   Any fill allowed in the floodway must be shown to have some
beneficial purpose and shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary.
      I.   Pipeline river or stream crossings shall be buried in the streambed
and banks or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due to channel
degradation and meandering or due to the action of flood flows.
162.06   VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   1.   The Council may authorize upon request in specific cases such variances
from the terms of this Ordinance that will not be contrary to the public
interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this Ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances
granted must meet the following applicable standards.
      A.   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
      B.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
      C.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      D.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for structures than what is ordinarily required by this Ordinance,
the applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the
Administrator that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of
insurance coverage and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and
property.
      E.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
   2.   Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Council Shall be Based - In
passing upon applications for Variances, the Council shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this Ordinance and:
      A.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
      B.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
      C.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.
      D.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      E.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the City.
      F.   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
      G.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
      H.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
      I.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for the area.
      J.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      K.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood water expected at the site.
      L.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and bridges.
      M.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
Ordinance.
   3.   Conditions Attached to Variances - Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the Council may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this Ordinance. Such
conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
      A.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
      B.   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
      C.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
      D.   Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this Ordinance.
      E.   Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the flood
protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration, rate
of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated with
the regulatory flood. The Council shall require that the applicant submit a
plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
162.07   NONCONFORMING USES.
   1.   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful
before the passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but
which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be
continued subject to the following conditions:
      A.   If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any future
use of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
      B.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
   2.   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless
it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary, building or safety codes or regulations or the
cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
designation.
   3.   Except as provided in Subsection 1(B) of this section, any use which
has been permitted as a variance shall be considered a conforming use.
162.08   PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
the requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this
chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction
thereof be fined not more than $500.00 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days.
Nothing herein contained prevent the City from taking such other lawful action
as is necessary to prevent or remedy violation.
162.09   AMENDMENTS.
The regulations and standards set forth in this chapter may from time to time
be amended, supplemented, changed, or repealed. No amendment, supplement,
change, or modification shall be undertaken without prior approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.

4.3   Application of Districts. A base district designation shall apply to each
lot or site within the City and its planning jurisdiction. A site must be in
one base district. Overlay and special districts may be applied to any lot or
site or any portion thereof, in addition to a base district designation.
4.4   Hierarchy. References in the Zoning Ordinance to less intensive or more
intensively urbanized districts shall be deemed to refer to those agricultural,
residential, commercial, and industrial base zoning districts established in
subsection 4.2, and shall represent a progression from the AG Agricultural
District as the least intensively urbanized to the I-2 General Industrial
District as the most intensively urbanized.
4.5   Development Regulations. For each Zoning District, permitted uses are set
forth in the Use Matrix. Individual sections describe the purpose and specific
development regulations for each zoning district. Supplemental Regulations may
affect specific land uses or development regulations in each zoning district.
The applicable Supplemental Regulations are noted in Use Matrix. Permitted
accessory uses are indicated in Section
165.24, subsection 24.10, Supplemental Use Regulations: Accessory Uses.
4.6   Zoning Map.
   a.   Adoption of Zoning Map. Boundaries of zoning districts established by
these Zoning Regulations shall be shown on the Zoning Map maintained by the
City Clerk. This map shall bear the signature of the Mayor attested by the City
Clerk under the certification that this is the Official Zoning Map referred to
by this Zoning Ordinance. This map, together with all legends, references,
symbols, boundaries, and other information, shall be adopted as a part of, and
concurrent with these Zoning Regulations. Said Zoning Map shall be on file with
the City Clerk and shall be readily accessible to the public at Manchester City
Hall.
   b.   Changes to the Zoning Map. The City Council may from time to time adopt
a new official zoning map which shall supersede the prior official zoning map,
in the event that the official zoning map becomes damaged or destroyed; or for
purposes of clarity due to a number of boundary changes, or to correct drafting
errors or omissions; provided, however, any such adoption shall not have the
effect of amending the original Zoning Ordinance or any subsequent amendment
thereof.  9
4.7   Interpretation of District Boundaries. The following rules shall apply in
determining the boundaries of any zoning district shown on the Zoning Map.
   a.   Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following lot
lines, such lot lines shall be considered the district boundaries.
   b.   Where district boundaries are indicated as within street or alley,
railroad, streams or creeks, or other identifiable rights-of-way, the
centerline of such rights-of-way shall be deemed the district boundary.
   c.   Where a district boundary divides a property, the location of the
boundary shall be determined by the use of the scale appearing on the Zoning
Map.
   d.   Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following
corporate limits, such corporate limits shall be considered the district
boundaries.
   e.   Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following
section lines, quarter section lines, or quarter-quarter section lines, such
lines shall be considered the district boundaries.
   f.   Boundaries not capable of being determined as set forth in 4.7a through
e shall be as dimensioned on the official Zoning Map or if not dimensioned
shall be determined by the scale shown on the map.
4.8   Vacation of Streets and Alleys. Whenever a public street or alley is
vacated, the zoning district adjoining each side of such right-of-way shall be
extended out to the former centerline.
4.9   Annexation of Territory. All unimproved or agricultural territory that
may hereafter be annexed to the City shall be considered as lying in the AG
Agricultural/Urban Reserve District until such classification shall be changed
as provided by this Zoning Ordinance. Any improved property that is annexed
into the City shall be zoned according to the zoning district that most nearly
describes either its present use or the use proposed by Manchester’s
Comprehensive Plan. This zoning shall be established by the Planning Commission
and the City Council at the time of annexation.
4.10   Required Conformance. Except as specified in this chapter, no building
or structure shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, or
structurally altered, nor shall any building or land be used, which does not
comply with all of the district regulations established by this chapter for the
district in which the building or land is located.
4.11   Required Frontage. Except as otherwise provided for, every building
shall be constructed or erected upon a lot or parcel of land which abuts upon a
public street or permanent easement of access to a public street.
4.12   Use Matrix: Levels of Permitted Uses. Within zoning districts in
Manchester, different uses are permitted with different conditions. These are
displayed in the Use Matrix. Levels of permission include:
   a.   Uses Permitted by Right. These uses are permitted subject to issuance
of a occupancy permit by the Zoning Administrator, subject only to compliance
with all regulations of this Ordinance. Uses permitted by right might be
subject to supplemental regulations contained in this Ordinance. These uses are
indicated in the Use Matrix by a “P” in the applicable cell.
   b.   Special Uses. These uses are subject to approval of a Special Use
Permit by the Zoning Board of Adjustment, following the procedure set forth in
Section
165.29, subsection 29.17. These uses are indicated in the Use Matrix by a “S”
in the applicable cell.
   c.   Site Plan Approval. Some use types require a site plan approval by the
Planning and Zoning Commission/City Council, based on specific criteria for
review. This procedure is set forth in
Chapter 161 of the Manchester Code of Ordinances. These uses are indicated in
the Use Matrix by an asterisk (*) following the citing of a specific use type.
4.13   Guide to Site Development Regulators. The regulators set forth in the
tables in Sections
165.05 through
165.19 establish the limits and requirements for most development in the City
of Manchester and its extra-territorial jurisdiction. This subsection is
intended to provide guidance for applying the regulators contained in these
tables.
   a.   Site Area per Housing Unit. This indicates the gross land area per unit
within a residential development. For example, a 40-lot subdivision on a 10-
acre (435,600 square foot) tract will have a site area per unit of 10,890
square feet. Site area per unit, which measures gross density, may differ from
minimum lot size.
   b.   Minimum Lot Area. This indicates the minimum size of a legally
described and recorded parcel upon which development can take place. As noted
above, minimum lot area and site area per unit may not be the same.
   c.   Minimum Lot Width.  This is the required minimum distance connecting at
points along opposite side lot lines, measured at the required front yard
setback. For example, the lot width of an irregular lot in a district requiring
a 25-foot front yard setback is determined by:
      1.   Locating the points along each side lot line at a distance of 25
feet back from the front property line.
      2.   Drawing a line connecting these two points.
      3.   Measuring the length of this line. The length is the lot width.
   d.   Minimum Yards.  These define the required setbacks of buildings from
front, side, and rear property lines. While the yard requirements apply to a
majority of development, this Zoning Ordinance provides for a number of
exceptions. Some of these include:
      1.   Planned Unit Developments. Front yard setbacks can be varied within
Planned Unit Developments, which are reviewed and approved by the City Council
after a recommendation from the Planning Commission.
      2.   Major Streets. The City may require greater than normal setbacks
along segments of the City’s arterial street system, as defined in the
Comprehensive Development Plan.
      3.   Flexibility Provided by Supplemental Development Regulations.
Subsection 25.7 establishes supplemental regulations, many of which provide
flexibility or variations in setback regulations for specific contexts.
      4.   Maximum Setbacks. Some specific zoning districts provide maximum as
well as minimum setbacks. These setbacks establish “build-to” lines that may be
necessary to protect the appearance and character of special urban districts.
   e.   Maximum Height. Height normally measures the vertical distance from the
established grade to the highest point of a building. However, as established
by the definition of height, the point of measurement may vary for different
types of buildings and roof slopes.
   f.   Maximum Amount of Total Parking in Street Yard. This controls the
maximum amount of parking that can be located in the area between a building
façade and the street. When applied in certain zoning districts, it is intended
to reduce the number of cars seen from the street, encourage site planning
which locates parking in rear and side yards, and produce a stronger
relationship between buildings and streets. For example, a project with 100
parking stalls and a 50 percent limit on the amount of parking located in
street yards must locate 50 of its stalls in rear or side yards without street
exposure.
   g.   Minimum Depth of Landscaping Adjacent to Street Right-of-Ways.  This
establishes the depth of landscaping that must be provided on private property
adjacent and in from the right-of-way line. Thus, if the required minimum depth
is 15 feet, a project must landscape the first 15 feet of its site back from
the right-of-way line. All landscaping must be done in accordance with Section
165.26, Landscaping and Screening Standards.
   h.   Minimum Buffer Yard Requirements. This establishes the depth of a
buffer yard that must be provided by intensive land uses adjacent to primarily
residential land uses in residential zoning districts. All landscaping must be
done in accordance with Section
165.26, Landscaping and Screening Standards.
   i.   Supplemental Use Regulations.  Certain permitted uses require
satisfaction of specific requirements in order to function successfully in
their urban or rural contexts. These supplemental requirements are set forth in
Section
165.24. These requirements are cross-referenced in the “Supplementary
Regulations” column of the Use Matrix.

Notes
9 † See EDITOR’S NOTE at the end of this chapter for ordinances amending the
  zoning map.
165.05   AG AGRICULTURAL/URBAN RESERVE DISTRICT.
5.1   Purpose. The AG district promotes and preserves agricultural uses,
including crop and animal production. This district is intended to accommodate
activities such as agriculture, horticulture, dairy farming, livestock farming,
poultry farming, general farming, and other agricultural activities. This
district discourages low density single-family residential development often
associated with agricultural areas by requiring a minimum 10-acre lot size. The
AG district is also intended to maintain interim agricultural uses within areas
designated in the Manchester Comprehensive Plan as long-term urban growth
areas. The intent here is to discourage rural residential growth in these areas
that are in watersheds that can eventually accommodate development served by
extension of public sewers. Where these areas are outside the city limits of
Manchester, but within its two-mile subdivision jurisdiction, it is intended
that the City work with the County to apply this district’s site development
regulations to these long term urban growth areas when and if Delaware County
adopts zoning. If the County does not adopt zoning, the City of Manchester may
apply this zoning district in unincorporated areas consistent with the City’s
comprehensive plan.
5.2   Site Development Regulations.

Maximum Height (feet)           35 feet             35 feet
Note 1:   Front yard setback is measured from property line of platted lots.
For unplatted lots along roads, residential structures shall be set back
sufficiently to allow for future right-of-way dedications. This setback is
typically 75 feet from the centerline of the adjacent road. The Zoning
Administrator may establish a different setback requirement based on the
specific context of a parcel. The reason for any such variation shall be
documented in writing by the Zoning Administrator.
 
 
165.06   R1 SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS (LOW DENSITY).
6.1   Purpose. The R1 districts are intended to provide for single-family
residential development, with gross densities from approximately 4 units per
acre in R1-80 districts to approximately 6 units per acre in R1-50 districts.
These areas generally include single-family dwellings on varying size lots with
supporting community facilities and urban services, including City water and
sanitary sewer service. The R1-50 district is intended primarily to recognize
the development pattern established in pre-World War II single-family
residential neighborhoods in Manchester. Gross densities in these historic
neighborhoods are around 6 units per acre. While initially developed as single-
family neighborhoods, these areas sometimes include conversions to multiple-
family dwellings that have occurred over time. Nonetheless, the predominate use
in these areas is single-family homes, and the R1-50 district is intended to
protect and preserve this character.

14.1   Purpose. The C-2 district accommodates commercial and office facilities
that serve the needs of markets ranging from several neighborhoods to the
overall region. While allowed commercial and office uses are generally
compatible with nearby residential areas, traffic and operating characteristics
of some uses may have an impact on adjacent residential neighborhoods. Use
regulations may require special permit review for these selected uses.
C-2 Districts are most appropriate at intersections of collector and arterial
streets, at the junction of several neighborhoods, along major commercial or
mixed use corridors, or at substantial commercial sub-centers. The district
also permits other uses with similar urban impacts to substantial commercial
development.

165.20   OVERLAY AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS.
20.1   Purpose. Overlay Districts are used in combination with Base Districts
to modify or expand base district regulations. Special Districts are not used
in conjunction with a Base District, but otherwise serve the same purpose as
Overlay Districts. Both districts adapt to the special needs of areas of the
City and further allow Manchester’s Zoning Ordinance to evolve as the planning
and development needs and trends of specific areas also change. The Overlay and
Special Districts are designed to achieve the following objectives:
   a.   To recognize special conditions in specific parts of the City which
require specific regulation.
   b.   To provide for the protection of special features in the natural and
built environment of the City.
   c.   To allow for change and adaptability to different needs and trends in
land development.
   d.   To encourage comprehensive neighborhood and environmental planning in
the City, and to protect the integrity of vital City services such as the water
supply and airport operation.
   e.   To provide flexibility in development and to encourage innovative
design through comprehensively planned projects.
20.2   Establishment of Districts. The following Overlay and Special Districts
are hereby established.

165.21   PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
21.1   Purpose. The PUD planned unit development district is intended and
designed to encourage large-scale and quality development of vacant or
underutilized tracts of land throughout the City pursuant to a unified building
and site development plan incorporating a comprehensive design based on a
thorough application of professional standards of excellence. It is further the
intent of this section to allow greater flexibility of standards and
diversification of land uses than provided in the regulations of other zoning
districts set forth in this chapter in order to accomplish the objectives to:
   a.   Preserve open space and other environmentally sensitive areas.
   b.   Permit development of land which, because of topographical or shape
problems or other practical difficulties, otherwise cannot be feasibly
developed.
   c.   Encourage appropriate mixed-use development.
   d.   Encourage revitalization of older neighborhoods by permitting
development or redevelopment of vacant or underutilized tracts of land
substantially surrounded by other properties which have been developed with
buildings.
21.2   Pre-Application Conference.
   a.   The owner of a contiguous tract of land may file an application for a
change to the PUD planned unit development district classification. Such tract
shall be no less than two acres in area, exclusive of streets and alleys.
   b.   Before submitting such application, the developer shall confer with the
Zoning Administrator and other relevant City departments. The purpose of the
conference shall be to discuss the feasibility of the proposal and to provide
the developer with information and guidance regarding applicable City
ordinances, specifications, standards and procedures, before the developer
enters into binding commitments or incurs substantial expenses.
   c.   The developer is encouraged to contact adjoining property owners to
inform them of the plan to submit a development proposal.
21.3   Conceptual Plan and Evidence Required. The application for a change to
the PUD planned unit development district classification shall be accompanied

placement on the Planning and Zoning Commission agenda. The application also
shall be accompanied by two copies of evidence, e.g., background studies,
letters from appropriate agencies, agency comments from the pre-application
conference, etc., showing the following:
   a.   The proposed development is in harmony with existing or anticipated
uses of other properties in the neighborhood.
   b.   The manner in which the developer proposes to maintain any common
ground to be included within the development.
   c.   The feasibility of providing adequate storm water and surface water
drainage, sanitary sewer capacity, and water service for the proposed
development.
   d.   The surrounding streets are capable of accommodating the increased
traffic that would be generated by the new development, including a traffic
study if required by City staff at the pre-application conference.
   e.   Off-street parking and loading will be provided as appropriate to the
size and character of the proposed development.
   f.   A study to indicate a market for the proposed development, provided

public health, safety, morals and general welfare.
21.6   Time Requirements for Submittal of Development Plan. If the City Council
approves the conceptual plan and request for rezoning as provided in subsection
21.5, the developer shall submit within two years thereafter to the City six
copies of a development plan of one or more development stages which must be no
less than two acres in area. The Zoning Administrator, upon written application

proposed change to the approved conceptual plan which: (i) is disapproved by
the Planning and Zoning Commission; or (ii) would increase the allowed number
of dwelling units or the allowed square footage of commercial space and which
is the subject of written protest filed with the City Clerk, duly signed by the
owners of 20 percent or more of the property which is located within 200 feet
of the exterior boundaries of the property proposed for change shall not become
effective except by the favorable vote of at least four-fifths of all members
of the Council. An insubstantial change may be approved by the City Manager if
it complies with the standards of subsection 29.26. Procedures for amendments
to conceptual and development plans are included in subsection 29.27.
21.11   Amendments to Development Plan. Any change in a development plan
proposed after the Zoning Administrator has approved the plan pursuant to this
section shall be resubmitted and considered in the same manner as the original
development plan. However, if any such change involves an amendment to the
conceptual plan, the City Manager shall not approve the amendment to the
development plan until the conceptual plan has been approved pursuant to
subsection 21.10 of this section.
21.12   Appeals from Decisions.
   a.   An applicant aggrieved by a decision of the Zoning Administrator to
approve or deny a proposed development plan or amendment thereto pursuant to
this section shall have the right to appeal any determination or action of the
Zoning Administrator made within the scope of this section. Appeal shall be
made, without cost, by written notification received by the City within 30 days
after the date of the action by the Zoning Administrator.
   b.   The appeal shall first be considered and acted upon by the Planning and
Zoning Commission. The Commission shall decide all appeals within 30 days after
the written notification has been received by the City, provided the appellant
may agree to a longer time period not to exceed 60 days after receipt of the
written notification. Failure to decide the appeal within such time period
shall have the effect of overturning the Administrator’s action and approving
the development site plan as appealed. At the Commission meeting, the appealing
party shall be presented a reasonable opportunity to present his or her views.
   c.   Decisions of the Commission may be appealed to the City Council in the
same manner as appeals from the action of the subcommittee, provided a majority
vote of the City Council shall be necessary to overturn or modify the action of
the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   d.   In making its decision on an appeal, an appellate body shall determine
whether the Zoning Administrator’s decision is in conformity with the
requirements of subsection 21.9. Each decision of an appellate body shall be in
writing and shall be filed in the office of the City Clerk, and notice of such
decision shall be mailed by the City within two days after its filing, to all
parties to the appeal.
21.13   Permitted Uses. Any use of structures or land permitted in any R, C, or
I district may be permitted in the PUD planned unit development district.
21.14   Standards.
   a.   All uses proposed in a PUD planned unit development district plan shall
be in harmony with the existing or anticipated uses of other properties in the
surrounding neighborhood and shall generally be in conformance with the City’s
Land Use Plan. The design of a PUD development shall be based on harmonious
architectural character; compatible materials; orderly arrangement of
structures and open space; and conservation of woodlands, streams, scenic
areas, open space and other natural resources.
   b.   Setbacks and other appropriate screens shall be provided around the
boundary of a PUD development to protect the adjoining district properties.
Only in exceptional circumstances shall such a setback be less than the amount
of the setback which the adjoining district is required to maintain from the
PUD development.
   c.   A PUD development shall comply with all applicable City ordinances,
specifications and standards relating to all dedicated street, sanitary sewer,
and storm sewer facilities and to surface drainage and storm water retention.
   d.   The streets surrounding a PUD development must be capable of
accommodating the increased traffic that would be generated by the new
development. The development shall be designed to provide maximum feasible
separation of vehicular traffic from pedestrian ways and recreational areas. If
turning lanes or other forms of traffic controls within or adjacent to the
development are deemed necessary by the City Council, the developer shall
provide the necessary improvements.
   e.   Off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided as appropriate
to the size and character of the development. Each off-street loading space
shall be not less than ten feet in width and 25 feet in length. All off-street
parking spaces shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of Section
165.27, Off-Street Parking and Loading.
   f.   Where appropriate to the size and character of a PUD development,
provision shall be made therein for open space for recreation and other outdoor
uses, and for places of worship, convenience shopping and other community
services.
21.15   Building Permits. No building permit concerning any stage of a PUD
planned unit development shall be issued until after the development plan for
that stage has been approved by the Zoning Administrator, and until after the
developer has provided the City with satisfactory evidence of the recording
with the County Recorder of the approved development plan and any amendments
thereto and of any covenant, deed, easement, or agreement required to be so
recorded pursuant to subsections 21.8c and d of this section.
21.16   Grading Permits. No grading permit concerning any stage of a PUD
planned unit development shall be issued until after the PUD conceptual plan
and the land restoration bond required pursuant to subsection 21.8b of this
section has been approved by the City Council.
21.17   Board of Adjustment Review Precluded. Because the PUD planned unit
development district is intended to provide relief from the rigid regulations
of more conventional zoning districts pursuant to a carefully integrated
overall development plan, the Board of Adjustment shall have no jurisdiction to
grant any variation, exception, or special permit relating to any property in
the PUD district.
21.18   Failure to Submit Development Plan or to Commence Construction. If the
developer fails either to: (i) submit a development plan within the time
requirements of subsection 21.6 of this section; or (ii) commence construction
in accordance with the time schedule set forth in the development plan, a
public hearing shall be scheduled before the Planning and Zoning Commission
regarding such failure, and the developer shall be served prior notice thereof
by certified mail. At such meeting the Commission shall consider all
circumstances relevant to the developer’s failure and shall vote to recommend
to the City Council that appropriate remedial measures be initiated, which
measures may include: (i) the initiation of rezoning of the subject property to
the zoning classification effective immediately prior to the rezoning of the
subject property to a PUD district classification; and/or (ii) referral of the
matter to the legal department for institution of enforcement proceedings in
the courts pursuant to subsections 29.1 and 29.2. Upon receipt of the
recommendations of the Commission, the City Council shall act to initiate
remedial measures in conformity to the Commission’s recommendations or to
initiate such other remedial measures as the Council determines to be
reasonably necessary under the circumstances.

the land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal
surfaces, and conical surfaces as they apply to the Manchester Municipal
Airport with an ultimate runway length of 3,465 feet as shown on the airport
layout plan. Such zones are shown on the Manchester Municipal Airport zoning
map consisting of one sheet, as included on Sheet 3 of the Airport Layout Plan
dated October 2012, prepared by Kirkham Michael and Associates, Inc., which is
attached to the ordinance codified in this section and made a part hereof. An
area located in more than one of the following zones is considered to be only
in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are
established and defined for the Manchester Municipal Airport as follows:
   a.   Larger than Utility Runway Non-Precision Instrument Approach Zone. The
inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary
surface and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a
width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal distance 10,000 feet from the primary
surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
   b.   Transitional Zones. The transitional zones are the areas beneath the
transitional surfaces.
   c.   Horizontal Zone. The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of
10,000 feet radii for all runways designated utility or visual and 10,000 feet
for all others from the center of each end of the primary surface of each
runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs.
The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.
   d.   Conical Zones. The conical zone is established as the area that
commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward
therefrom, a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
23.4   Airport Zone Height Limitations. Except as otherwise provided in this
section, no structure shall be erected, altered or maintained, and no tree
shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this section to a height in
excess of the applicable height herein established for such zone. Nothing in
this section shall be construed as permitting any structure to exceed the
Manchester Zoning Ordinance district maximum height requirement without first
obtaining the appropriate approvals. Where such height conflict the more
restrictive shall apply. Such applicable height limitations are established for
each of the zone in questions for Manchester Municipal Airport planned runway
classification as follows:
   a.   Larger than Utility Runway Non-Precision Instrument Approach Zone.
Slopes 34 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the
same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of
5,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.
   b.   Transitional Zone. Slopes 7 feet outward for each foot upward beginning
at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the
approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport
elevation which is 987 feet above mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing,
there are established height limits sloping 7 feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface,
and extending to where they intersect the conical surface.
   c.   Horizontal Zone. Established 150 feet above the airport elevation or at
a height of 1,137 feet above mean sea level.
   d.   Conical Zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at
the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the airport
elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation.
23.5   Use Restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section,
no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by this section
in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals
or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for
pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the
eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the
airport, create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or
interfere with the landing, take-off, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to
use the airport.
23.6   Nonconforming Uses. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this
section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is required
to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers
and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Manchester Airport Board of
Adjustment to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the
airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall
be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the Manchester
Municipal Airport.
23.7   Permits. Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction or alteration
of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits
established by this section. In addition to required local permits, the person
desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure or permit the growth
of any tree shall complete and submit a 7460-1 form to the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) during the permitting process. A copy of the complete FAA
determination of the 7460-1 form must be provided to the Airport Manager.
   a.   Existing Use. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use,
structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on
the effective date of this section or any amendment thereto or than it is when
the application for a permit is made.
   b.   Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed. Whenever the Manchester
Zoning Administrator determines that a nonconforming structure is abandoned for
one year or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more than 60 percent of
the replacement cost, such structure shall not be rebuilt, restored, or
reoccupied for any purpose unless it shall thereafter conform to all
regulations of this section.
   c.   Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use of property not in
accordance with the regulations prescribed in this section, may apply to the
Airport Board Of Adjustment for a variance from such regulations. The
application for variance shall be accompanied by a complete determination from
the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the
operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable
airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal
application or enforcement of the regulations will result in practical
difficulty or unnecessary hardship, and relief granted will not be contrary to
the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do
substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this section.
Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this section
may be considered by the Board of Adjustment unless a copy of the application
has been furnished to the Airport Manager for advice as to the aeronautical
effects of the variance. If the Airport Manager does not respond to the
application by the meeting, the Airport Board of Adjustment may act on its own
to grant or deny said application.
   d.   Obstruction Marking and Lighting. Any variance granted may, if such
action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this section and is
reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of
the structure or tree in question to install, operate and maintain, at the
owner’s expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper
by the Airport Board of Adjustment, this condition may be modified to require
the owner to permit the Manchester Airport Board of Adjustments, at its own
expense, to install, operate and maintain the necessary markings and lights.
23.8   Enforcement.  It is the duty of the Zoning Administrator to administer
and enforce the regulations prescribed herein. Applications for variances shall
be made to the Zoning Administrator upon a form established for that purpose.
Application for action by the Airport Board of Adjustment shall be forthwith
transmitted by the Zoning Administrator.
23.9   Airport Board of Adjustment.
   a.   There is created an Airport Board of Adjustment to have and exercise
the following powers: (i) to hear and decide appeals from any order,
requirement, decision, or determination made by the Manchester Zoning
Enforcement Officer in the enforcement of this section; and (ii) to hear and
decide specific variances.
   b.   The Board of Adjustment shall consist of members appointed by the City
and County as provided in Section 329.12, Code of Iowa. Members shall be
removable by the appointing authority for cause, upon written charges, after a
public hearing.
   c.   The Airport Board of Adjustment shall adopt rules for its governance
and in harmony with the provisions of this section. Meetings of the Airport
Board of Adjustment shall be held at the call of the Chairperson and at such
other times as the Airport Board of Adjustment may determine. The Chairperson
or, in the absence of the Chairperson, the acting chairperson, may administer
oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All hearings of the Airport Board
of Adjustment shall be public. The Airport Board of Adjustment shall keep
minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each member upon each question;
or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records
of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall immediately
be filed in the County Auditor’s office and the City Clerk’s office.
   d.   The Airport Board of Adjustment shall make written findings of fact and
conclusions of law giving the facts upon which it acted and its legal
conclusions from such facts in reversing, affirming, or modifying any order,
requirement, decisions or determination which comes before it under the
provisions of this section.
   e.   The concurring vote of a majority of the members of the Airport Board
of Adjustment shall be sufficient to reverse any order, requirement, decision
or determination of the Manchester Zoning Enforcement Officer or decide in
favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under
this section, to effect variation to this section.
23.10   Appeals.
   a.   Any person aggrieved, or any taxpayer affected by any decision of the
Manchester Zoning Enforcement Officer made in the administration of this
section, may appeal to the Airport Board of Adjustment.
   b.   All appeals hereunder must be taken within a reasonable time as
provided by the rules of the Airport Board of Adjustment, by filing with the
Manchester City Clerk a notice of appeal specifying the grounds therefor. The
City Clerk’s office shall forthwith transmit to the Airport Board of Adjustment
all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was
taken.
   c.   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from unless the Manchester Zoning Enforcement Officer certifies to the
Airport Board of Adjustment, after the notice of appeal has been filed with it,
that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would cause
imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be
stayed except by order of the Airport Board of Adjustment.
   d.   The Airport Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for hearing
appeals, give public notice and due notice to the parties-in-interest, and
decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing, any party may
appear in person or by agent or by attorney.
   e.   The Airport Board of Adjustment may, in conformity with the provisions
of this section, reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or modify the order,
requirement, decision, or determination appealed from and may make such order,
requirement, decision, or determination as may be appropriate under the
circumstances.
23.11   Judicial Review.  Any person aggrieved, or any taxpayer affected, by
any decision of the Airport Board of Adjustment, may appeal to the District
Court of Iowa, as provided in Chapters 329, 335 and 414 of the Code of Iowa.
23.12   Violations.  Each day a violation of any provision of this section
continues to exist shall constitute a separate offense and shall additionally
constitute a municipal infraction punishable as set out in this Code of
Ordinances. Seeking a civil penalty does not preclude the City or County from
seeking alternative relief including an order for abatement or injunctive
relief in the same or separate action.
23.13   City Action to Prevent Unlawful Construction. In case any building or
structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted
or maintained, or any building, structure or land is used in violation of this
section, the City, in addition to other remedies, shall institute any proper
action or proceedings in the name of the City to prevent such unlawful
erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion,
maintenance or use; to restrain, correct or abate such violation; to prevent
the occupancy of such building, structure or lane; or to prevent any illegal
act, conduct, business or use in or about such premises.

24.8   Telecommunications Towers. In any district where radio, television,
microwave, cellular, or other communication towers are allowed as a permitted
or Special Permit Use, such towers are subject to the following additional
requirements.
   a.   Tower Siting.
      1.   It is the policy of the City of Manchester to encourage co-location
of new communications towers with existing towers or as part of suitable
existing structures. All applications for approval of a communications tower
location shall include evidence that all potential alternatives for location on
existing towers have been explored and exhausted. Applicants may not be denied
space on an existing tower within the City and its jurisdiction unless
mechanical, structural, regulatory factors, or legitimate business expansion
plans prohibit co-location.
      2.   The applicant for a communications tower location is required to
demonstrate as part of its application that the tower must be located on the
proposed site in order to satisfy its function in the company’s system. The
applicant must also demonstrate that the proposed height is the minimum height
necessary for the successful functioning of the tower.
   b.   Tower Setbacks, Design, and Height.
      1.   Free-standing towers shall be located so that the distance from the
base of the tower to any adjoining property line or the supporting structure of
a separate neighboring tower is a minimum of 100% of the tower height. The
Planning Commission may recommend and the City Council approve a reduction to
the set back with a Special Use Permit if they determine that such reduction
does not constitute a hazard to safety or property on adjacent properties or
rights-of-way.
      2.   The tower installation shall be designed to be aesthetically and
architecturally compatible with the built environment of the City of
Manchester. The City encourages efforts to hide towers or restrict their
visibility from public right-of-way or neighboring properties. Associated
support buildings shall be designed with materials that are consistent with
those in the surrounding neighborhood. Metal exteriors shall generally not be
permitted for accessory support buildings.
      3.   All tower installations shall maintain landscaped peripheral yards
with a minimum depth of 35 feet from surrounding property lines. One tree
consistent with the provisions of Section
165.26 shall be planted for every 500 square feet of required peripheral yard
area.
      4.   As part of the Special Use Permit approval process, the Board of
Adjustment may permit the tower to exceed the height restrictions otherwise
allowable in the district.
      5.   Towers shall have a color generally matching the surroundings or
background that minimizes their visibility, unless a different color is
required by the FCC or FAA.
      6.   No signals, lights or signs shall be permitted on towers unless
required by the FCC or the FAA. Should lighting be required, at the time of
construction of the tower in cases where there are residential users located
within a distance which is 300% of the height of the tower from the tower, then
dual mode lighting shall be requested from the FAA. Lighting on towers shall
not exceed the minimum requirements of the FAA or other regulatory agencies.
      7.   Adequate security measures are required at the base of the tower to
prevent vandalism or hazards resulting from casual access to the facility.
   c.   City Site Selection Criteria in Evaluating Applications for
Communications Towers.
      1.   Consistent with the policy of this Zoning Ordinance, the
telecommunications company proposing to construct an antenna support structure,
or mount an antenna on an existing structure, shall demonstrate, using
technological evidence, that the antenna must go where it is proposed in order
to satisfy its function in the company’s grid system. Further, the company must
demonstrate by technological evidence that the height requested is the minimum
height necessary.
      2.   Applications for necessary permits will only be processed when the
applicant demonstrates that it is either an FCC licensed telecommunications
provider or has in place necessary agreements with an FCC licensed
telecommunications provider for use or lease of the support structure.
      3.   Personal wireless service facilities should be located and designed
to minimize any impacts on residential property values. Sites should be placed
in locations where the existing topography, vegetation, buildings or other
structures provide the greatest amount of screening.
      4.   Location and design of sites in all districts should consider the
impact of the site on the surrounding neighborhood and the visual impact within
the zone district. In residential districts and residential land use areas, the
minimum lot size for towers shall be three acres.
   d.   Priorities for Siting. The following establishes the order of
priorities for locating new communications facilities:
      1.   Public property (excluding prairie, conservation or wildlife areas,
or historic structures).
      2.   Appropriate existing structures, such as buildings, towers, water
towers, and smokestacks in other zoned districts.
      3.   AG, I-1, or I-2 districts that do not adjoin or adversely impact
residential neighborhoods.
      4.   Private, nonresidential property in C-2 districts.
      5.   Private, nonresidential properties in C-1 districts.
      6.   Place antennas and towers on multi-family residential structures
exceeding 30 feet in height in districts zoned R-4, and R-5.
      7.   Residential districts only if locations for which a need has been
demonstrated are not available on existing structures or in nonresidential
districts; and only on or in existing churches, parks, schools, utility
facilities or other appropriate public facilities.
      8.   An applicant for a new antenna support structure to be located in a
residential zoning district shall demonstrate that a diligent effort has been
made to locate the proposed communications facilities on a government
structure, a private institutional structure, or other appropriate existing
structures within a nonresidential zoning district, and that due to valid
considerations including physical constraints, or technological feasibility, no
appropriate location is available. The telecommunications company is required
to demonstrate that it contacted the owners of structures in excess of 30 feet
within a one-quarter mile radius of the site proposed, asked for permission to
install the antenna on those structures, and was denied for reasons other than
economic ones. The information submitted by the applicant shall include a map
of the area to be served by the tower, its relationship to other antenna sites
in the applicant’s network, and an evaluation of existing buildings taller than
30 feet, towers and water tanks within one-quarter mile of the proposed tower.

165.25   SUPPLEMENTAL DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS.
25.1   Purpose. The Supplemental Site Development Regulations establish basic
requirements for developable lots, including frontage requirements. They
recognize the existence of special conditions that cannot comply literally with
the site development regulations set out for each zoning district. Therefore,
these regulations qualify or modify the district regulations of this Zoning
Ordinance and provide for specific areas of exception.
25.2   Required Street Frontage. Except as otherwise provided for, every
building shall be constructed or erected upon a lot or parcel of land which
abuts upon a public street or permanent easement of access to a public street.
25.3   Lot Size Exceptions.
   a.   When two or more parcels of land, each of which lacks adequate area and
dimension to qualify for a permitted use under the requirements of the use
district in which it is located, are contiguous and are held in one ownership,
they shall be used as one zoning lot for such use.
   b.   Any single vacant lot or parcel of vacant land, officially recorded
prior to February 17, 1981, that does not meet the requirements for minimum lot
width and area may be utilized for a permitted use, provided that yards, courts
or usable open spaces are not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the
minimum required dimensions or areas.
   c.   Any new lot to be established in an area which was previously platted
or otherwise officially recorded prior to February 17, 1981, which does not
meet the requirements set forth in this chapter for minimum lot width, may be
established provided that the width of the lot shall not be less than the
average width of lots fronting on both sides of the street for the lineal block
which includes the proposed new lot.
   d.   A new lot established pursuant to this section may be utilized for a
permitted use, provided that yards, courts, or visible open spaces are not less
than 75 percent of the minimum required dimensions or areas.
25.4   Structures Located in City Right-of-Way or Easement. No structure,
except a single mailbox attached to a single post or except multiple mailboxes
attached as one unit to one or more posts, shall be placed in a City right-of-
way or easement except as set forth herein. The Council may approve a request
to build a structure on a City right-of-way or easement benefiting the City if:
   a.   The proposed structure will not significantly limit or impair the
ability of the City to utilize said right-of-way or easement; and
   b.   The proposed structure will not significantly limit or impede the
ability of the City to provide essential City services, including but not
limited to utility service, snow removal and street repair; and
   c.   The property owner executes an indemnification agreement holding the
City harmless and indemnifying it for any losses resulting from injury or
damages to personal property caused by the structure placed upon the City
right-of-way or easement.
25.5   Division of Zoning Lots. No improved zoning lot shall hereafter be
divided into two or more zoning lots and no portion of any improved zoning lot
shall be sold, unless all improved zoning lots resulting from each such
division or sale shall conform with all the regulations of the zoning district
in which the property is located. However, with respect to the resubdivision of
improved zoning lots in the R-3, R-4 and R-5 Districts, side yard requirements
shall not apply between attached buildings.
25.6   Number of Buildings on a Zoning Lot. Except in the case of planned unit
developments, no more than one single-family detached residential building
shall be located on a zoning lot, nor shall a single-family detached
residential building be located on the same zoning lot with any other principal
building.
25.7   Setback Adjustments.
   a.   Lots Adjoining Alleys. In calculating the depth of a required side or
rear yard setback for a lot adjoining a dedicated public alley, one-half of the
alley may be credited as a portion of the yard. Garages with direct access from
the alley should provide adequate setback from the alley, beyond the minimum
required, to provide for vehicle maneuvering.
   b.   Encroachments on Required Yards. Every part of a required yard shall be
open and unobstructed from finished grade upward, except as specified herein.
      1.   Architectural projections, including roofs that cover porches,
enclosed porches, window sills, belt courses, cornices, eaves, flues and
chimneys, and ornamental features may project two feet into a required yard.
      2.   Terraces, patios, uncovered decks, and ornamental features that have
no structural element more than three feet above or below the adjacent ground
level may project six feet into a required front yard. However, all such
projections must be set back at least three feet from an adjacent side lot
line; or 15 feet from any street property line. An uncovered deck shall be
permitted to encroach into a required rear yard area by 10 feet, or 33% of the
rear yard, whichever is less.
(Ord. 008-2021 – May 22 Supp.)
      3.   Fire escapes, fireproof outside stairways, and balconies opening to
fire towers may project a maximum of 3 feet into required yards, provided that
they do not obstruct the light and ventilation of adjacent buildings.
      4.   For buildings constructed upon a front property line, a cornice may
project into public right-of-way, unless such property is constructed on a
State or federal highway. Maximum projection is the smaller of four feet or
five percent of the right-of-way width.
      5.   In commercial districts, a canopy may extend into a required front
yard, provided that the canopy is set back at least 5 feet from the front
property line, covers less than 15 percent of the area of the required front
yard, and has a vertical clearance of at least 8 feet, 6 inches.
      6.   Swimming pools shall be subject to the same location and setback
requirements as accessory buildings.
      7.   Lamp posts with a maximum height of 10 feet, and flag poles up to
maximum height of base district may be located within required yards, provided
they are set back at least 5 feet from property lines. The spread of a flag
when fully extended shall not extend onto public right-of-way.
      8.   Any garage that fronts on a public street must be set back at least
20 feet from such street, regardless of the setback requirement within the
zoning district. This shall not be interpreted to waive a larger required
minimum setback required by the zoning district.
   c.   Setbacks on Arterial Streets. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Zoning Ordinance, the City may require a setback for all buildings built
or altered, or off-street parking areas developed along a State or federally
designated highway that exceeds those normally required for the zoning
district. Lots of record under five acres in size; lots of record duly platted
and approved prior to the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, or where a
properly dedicated and accepted frontage road right-of-way exists are exempt
from these provisions and are instead subject to the setback requirements of
their respective zoning district.
   d.   Setback Adjustments.
      1.   Setbacks on Built-Up Blockfaces. In R-1 through R-5 districts, where
some lots are developed with a front yard that is less than the minimum
required for the district by this Zoning Ordinance, or where some lots have
been developed with a front yard greater than required herein, the following
rule shall apply: Any new building or addition shall not be closer to the
street right-of-way than the average of the front yards of the existing
buildings on the same side of the street within the same block, except as
follows:
         (a)   Buildings located entirely on the rear half of a lot shall not
be counted.
         (b)   Buildings further than 300 feet from the lot in question shall
not be counted.
         (c)   No building shall be required to have a front yard greater than
50 feet.
      2.   Corner Lots.
         (a)   Required setbacks shall not reduce the buildable width of any
corner lot to less than 25 feet. Appropriate setback adjustments shall be
allowed to maintain this minimum width.
         (b)   No setback adjustment shall permit encroachment into the vision
clearance triangle.
   e.   Double Frontage Lots. Residentially zoned double frontage lots on a
major street, and with no access to that street may have a 25-foot minimum
front yard setback along said street. All other double frontage lots must
provide full front yard setbacks from each adjacent street.
   f.   Vision Clearance Zones. On any corner lot in any district, no fence,
wall, or other structure shall be erected, and no foliage plant shall be
permitted to grow to a height of more than 3 feet above the elevation of the
established curb grade at the intersection of the streets, on any part which is
bounded by street lines of the intersecting streets and within a line
connecting two points on said street lines 20 feet from their point of
intersection. The street lines, for the purpose of this section, are deemed to
begin at the edge of the street right-of-way and not the street surface or curb
line.
25.8   Accessory Buildings, Structures and Garages.
   a.   Time of Construction. No accessory building, accessory structure or
garage shall be constructed on any lot prior to the time of construction of the
principal building to which it is accessory.
   b.   Exempted from Specific Requirements. Residential accessory structures
having a lot coverage of 36 square feet or less, and no single dimension in
excess of 8 feet, are exempt from building permit requirements.
   c.   Percentage of Required Rear Yard Occupied. No detached, accessory
structure, accessory building or buildings shall occupy more than 25 percent of
the area of a required rear yard.
   d.   Height of Accessory Buildings in Required Rear Yards. No detached
accessory building or accessory structure located in a required rear yard shall
exceed 16 feet in height.
   e.   On Reversed Corner Lots. On a reversed corner lot in a residential
district and within 15 feet of any adjacent property to the rear in a
residential district, no accessory building or accessory structure or portion
thereof located in a required rear yard shall be closer to the side lot line
abutting the street than a distance equal to the least depth which would be
required herein for the front yard on such adjacent property to the rear.
Further, in the above instance, no such accessory building or structure shall
be located within five feet of any part of a rear lot line which coincides with
the side lot line or portion thereof of property in an R-1 or R-2 District.
   f.   Setback Requirements. No accessory building or accessory structure
shall be placed within 5 feet of a side or rear lot line. Those accessory
buildings consisting of 960 or more square feet shall be placed a minimum of 10
feet from a side or rear lot line. No accessory building or structure shall be
within 10 feet of the principal structure on the lot. No accessory structure or
use shall be located within a front yard.
   g.   Type of Construction. All accessory buildings or structures larger than
100 square feet or private garages located within a residential district shall
be constructed in a manner consistent with the residential character of the
district. All accessory buildings, accessory structures or private garages
located within a residential district shall:
      1.   Have a permanent floor located within the structure consisting of a
concrete or asphalt base. Rock or dirt floors shall be prohibited. Wooden
pallet floors are acceptable for moveable buildings.
      2.   Be constructed with siding commonly used for residential structures.
The use of galvanized steel, painted steel or aluminum sheets as commonly used
in agricultural buildings is prohibited.
         (a)   Lots in Excess of One Acre in Area. Siding materials used for
accessory buildings or structures located on a lot in excess of one acre, where
the accessory building has an area in excess of 600 square feet, shall be
permitted to use any commercially acceptable siding material which may include
factory painted galvanized steel, painted steel, or aluminum sheets.
(Ord. 020-2024 – Aug. 25 Supp.)
      3.   Be constructed with a roofing material as set forth below:
         (a)   Lots in Excess of Two Acres in Area. Roofing materials used for
accessory buildings or structures located on a lot in excess of two acres,
where the accessory building has an area in excess of 700 square feet, shall be
permitted to use any commercially acceptable roofing material which may include
asphalt, fiberglass shingles, vulcanized rubber, steel or aluminum roofing
materials.
         (b)   All Other Roofing Materials. Except as permitted in paragraph
(a) above, all accessory buildings must be constructed with roofing material
commonly used for residential structures, which shall include asphalt or
fiberglass shingles, shakes or vulcanized rubber. The use of steel or aluminum
roofing materials as commonly found in commercial or agricultural buildings is
prohibited.
25.9   Height Exceptions. These provisions allow exceptions to the height limit
of any zoning district in certain situations.
   a.   Vertical Projections.
      1.   Chimneys, cooling towers, building mechanical equipment, elevator
bulkheads, silos, fire towers, grain elevators, non-parabolic receiving
antennas, tanks, solariums, steeples, penthouses not exceeding 25 percent of
total roof area, flag poles, stage towers or scenery lofts, and water towers
may be built to any height in accordance with existing and future ordinances.
      2.   Any such equipment or vertical projections attached to a building
and exceeding the height limit shall be screened to prevent visibility from
public right-of-way or adjacent property using materials or design features
that are consistent with the overall design of the main building.
      3.   No such projection may be built which in the event of failure could
constitute a hazard or fall onto either public right-of-way or property, or
another private property.
   b.   Civic Buildings. Buildings housing civic use types may be built to a
maximum height of 60 feet. Such buildings located in residential districts
shall be set back one foot in addition to required setbacks from each property
line for each foot of height over the maximum height of the zoning district.
   c.   Wind Energy Conservation Systems (WECS). Wind Energy Conservation
Systems are subject to the regulations of subsection 25.9b.
25.10   Fence Regulations.

the specific prior approval of the City. Removal of any such fence shall be at
the expense of its owner.
   b.   Applicability. The regulations contained in this section apply to all
fences with a height above grade of 30 inches and over.
   c.   Sight Obstruction at Street Intersections. No fence or hedge permitted

grade on the part of the lot within a vision clearance zone.
   d.   Facing. The finished surfaces of any fence shall face toward adjacent
properties and street frontage.
   e.   Effect on Adjacent Properties and Drainage. Fences shall be erected and
maintained so as to avoid limiting or obstructing the flow of water in natural
drainage courses, or drainage ways created within easements.
   f.   Fence Construction on Utility Easements. Any fence erected on a tract
of land subject to an easement for the construction, maintenance, operations,
or replacement of any water, sanitary or storm sewer, gas line, electric power,
telephone, or other utility poles, or other cables or lines shall be designed
and constructed to be readily removable to permit the use of the easement. Such
fences shall be subject to removal by request whenever necessary to permit
access. The cost of removal or replacement shall be the responsibility of the
owner of the fence.
   g.   Residential Fences. Fences constructed within residential districts or
on land used for residential purposes are subject to the following provisions.
      1.   Height. The maximum average height of a fence or wall may not exceed
7 feet in height when located within the limits of side and rear yards. A fence
or wall not exceeding 4 feet in height is permitted within the limits of front
yards. In the case of retaining walls supporting embankments, the above
requirements shall apply only to that part of the wall above the ground surface
of the retained embankment.
      2.   Setbacks. All residential fences in front yards shall be a minimum
of 2 feet behind adjacent sidewalks. All fences must have a minimum setback
requirement of 3 feet from the property line except where the property line
borders street right-of-way. (The setback requirement shall be required for
alley right-of-way.) It will be the property owner’s responsibility to maintain
the property on both sides of the fence. A fence or wall may be placed on the
property line between adjoining properties if all adjoining property owners
affected by said fence or wall agree in writing to the erection of the fence or
wall on the property line. Said written agreement must provide that the
property owners are responsible to maintain the property on their respective
sides of the fence or wall. Said written agreement must be binding on all
current owners of the property and all subsequent owners of the property so
long as the fence or wall remains in place. In addition, said written agreement
shall be filed of record with the County Recorder.
      3.   Materials. Fences shall be constructed of wood, chain-link, PVC/
resin, stone or masonry materials, or ornamental metals only. Wood fences shall
utilize standard building lumber only. Barbed wire and/or electrified fences
are not permitted, and are defined as any fence that includes in its material
barbs, blades, razors, electric current or other features specifically designed
to injure or abrade an individual or animal who attempts to negotiate the
fence. Wire mesh fences may be permitted to enclose tennis courts and game and
recreation areas on public land and residential lots.
   h.   Civic, Office, Commercial, and Industrial Fences. Fences constructed in
civic, office, commercial and industrial districts are subject to the following
special provisions:
      1.   Maximum Height. The maximum height of a fence for any permitted use
in any nonresidential zoning district shall be 8 feet.
      2.   Public Fences. Fences surrounding school yards or public parks shall
be exempt from the height provisions as herein stated provided that visibility
at intersections is not hindered.
      3.   Civic Uses in Residential Districts. The maximum height of fences
installed as part of primary and secondary educational facilities, day care,
and park and recreation use types, or any other use that provides secured
outdoor space for the use of children within Residential Zoning Districts shall

      4.   The Board of Adjustment may approve greater fence heights on a case-
by-case basis if it concludes that such permission furthers the health, safety,
and welfare of the residents of the City.
      5.   Barbed wire shall not be used in the construction of any fence
outside of the AG Agriculture and I-2 General Industrial Zoning Districts.
Barbed wire may be used in the construction of fencing in an industrial
district provided that the bottom strand of the barbed wire shall be at least 6
feet above ground level. Electrified fences are not permitted within the
jurisdiction of the City.
25.11   Appeals. Denial, revocations, or cancellations of a building permit
based on the provisions of this subsection may be appealed to the Board of
Adjustment, as set forth in subsection 29.13.
165.26   LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING STANDARDS.
26.1   Purpose. The Landscaping and Screening Regulations provide additional
guidance on the development of sites within the City by addressing landscaping
and screening requirements. They are designed to improve the appearance of the
community, buffer potentially incompatible land uses from one another, and
conserve the value of properties within the City and its extra-territorial
jurisdiction. The Landscape and Screening provisions are further intended to
expedite development approval by including predictable, uniform standards for
landscaping.
26.2   Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to all new
development on each lot or site upon application for a building permit, except
for the following:
   a.   Reconstruction or replacement of a lawfully existing use or structure
following a casualty loss.
   b.   Remodeling, rehabilitation, or improvements to existing uses or
structures which do not substantially change the location of structures,
parking, or other site improvements.
   c.   Additions or enlargements of existing uses or structures which increase
floor area or impervious coverage area by less than 20 percent of the building
established on the site on the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance. Where
such cumulative additions or enlargements are 20 percent or greater, these
provisions shall apply only to that portion where the new development occurs.
26.3   Landscaping Requirements. Landscaping shall be required adjacent to each
street property line and shall extend to a minimum depth inward on private
property as set forth in the Development Regulations and summarized in Table
26.1.
26.4   Landscaping Materials and Installation Standards.
   a.   Official List of Recommended and Prohibited Plant Materials. Plantings
shall be used in required landscaped areas or buffer yards consistent with the
Official List of Recommended and Prohibited Plant Materials, provided through
the office of the Zoning Administrator. All plant materials shall conform in
size, species and spacing with this section.
   b.   Use of Inorganic Landscaping Materials. No artificial trees, shrubs,
plants, or turf shall be used to fulfill the minimum requirements for
landscaping. Inorganic materials, such as stone or decorative pavers, may be
used, provided that such material does not comprise more than 35% of the
minimum required landscaped area. Other concrete and/or asphalt pavement
surfaces may not be used within the minimum required landscaped area, except
for driveways and walkways.

26.5   Buffer Yard Provisions. These provisions apply when a use is established
in a more intensive zoning district (District A) that is adjacent to a less
intensive zoning district (District B). The owner, developer, or operator of
the use within District A shall install and maintain a landscaped buffer yard
on his/her lot or site, as set forth in this section. Buffer yard requirements
apply only to those districts indicated in Table 26.2. Buffer yards are not
required of single-family, two-family, duplex, or townhouse use types in the
more intensive zoning district.
   a.   The buffer yard dimensions set forth in Table 26.2 apply to zoning
districts which share a common lot line or are adjacent but separated by an
intervening alley.

   b.   When a street separates adjacent zoning districts requiring a buffer
yard, the size of the buffer yard shall be one-half the required buffer yard
set forth in Table 26.2.
   c.   Each required buffer yard must be entirely landscaped and free of paved
areas, access ways, storage, or other disturbances.
26.6   Screening Standards.
   a.   Application. Screening is required between adjacent zoning districts
indicated in Table 26.2 when one or more of the following conditions in the
more intensive zoning district is directly visible from and faces toward the
boundary of the less intensive zoning district:
      1.   Outdoor storage areas or storage tanks, unless otherwise screened.
      2.   Loading docks, refuse collection points, and other service areas.
      3.   Major machinery or areas housing a manufacturing process.
      4.   Major on-site traffic circulation areas or truck and/or trailer
parking.
      5.   Sources of glare, noise, or other environmental effects.
      6.   Bailing or stockpiling of cardboard or other shipping or packaging
materials.
      7.   Surface parking lots with more than four (4) stalls directly
adjacent to less intensive districts.
   b.   Opaque Barrier. A six-foot opaque barrier shall be provided which
visually screens the conditions listed in subsection 26.6a from less intensive
uses as follows:
      1.   A solid wood, PVC, and/or masonry fence or wall at least 6 feet in
height.
      2.   A landscaping screen, using evergreen or deciduous materials,
capable of providing a substantially opaque, hedge-like barrier and attaining a
minimum height of 6 feet within 3 years of planting.
      3.   A landscaped earth berm with a maximum slope of three to one, rising
no less than 6 feet above the existing grade of the lot line separating the
zoning districts.
      4.   Any combination of these methods that achieves a cumulative height
of 6 feet.
   c.   Screening: Effect on Drainage. Screening shall not adversely affect
surface water drainage.
   d.   Permitted Interruptions of Screening. Screening may be interrupted to
provide access drives to service areas or for loading purposes to buildings.
Such breaks or interruptions shall not exceed 20 percent of the length of the
required screened area.
26.7   Parking Lot Landscaping and Screening Requirements. Unless otherwise
noted, each unenclosed parking facility consisting of more than four parking
spaces shall conform to the following standards:
   a.   Each unenclosed parking facility shall provide a minimum landscaped
buffer of 10 feet along any street property line.
   b.   Each parking facility that abuts a residential district shall provide a
10-foot landscaped buffer along its common property line with the residential
district.
   c.   Any parking facility which abuts property in a residential district
shall provide a fence, wall, landscape screen, or earth berm not less than 6
feet in height for the length of the common boundary. A grade change, terrace,
or other site feature which blocks the sight line of headlights into a
residential property may satisfy this requirement, subject to the determination
of the Zoning Administrator.
   d.   Each unenclosed parking facility of over 6,000 square feet within any
street yard shall provide interior landscaped area equal to no less than 5
percent of the total paved area of the parking facility. Parking facilities
within the I-1 and I-2 Districts shall be exempt from this requirement.
   e.   Landscaping or screening installed in any required landscaped area
shall not obstruct the view from the off-street parking facility to any
driveway approach, street, alley, or sidewalk. Landscaping shall further not
obstruct any views among parking spaces and circulation ways, or visibility
between vehicles and pedestrians.
26.8   Tree Plantings.
   a.   In any landscaped area for commercial uses only required by the minimum
depth requirements, the buffer yard requirements, or the parking lot interior
landscaping requirements, one tree of an approved species with a minimum
caliper size of 2 inches shall be planted and maintained for each 500 square
feet of required landscaped area. Existing trees approved for preservation
shall be counted toward satisfaction of this requirement.
   b.   Any tree of an approved species planted or maintained with a caliper of
3 inches or above shall count as 1.5 trees toward the satisfaction of the
requirements of this section. An approved existing tree with a caliper of 8
inches or above preserved on a site shall count as two trees toward the
satisfaction of the requirements of this section.
   c.   In any required landscaped area for new residential lot development
there shall be a minimum of one tree, of an approve species with a minimum
caliper size of one and one half inches, planted and maintained.
(Ord. 001-2024 – Aug. 25 Supp.)
26.9   General Provisions.
   a.   Time of Application. The provisions contained in this subsection shall
be applied for each individual lot or site when an application for a building
permit on such lot is made. A Landscape Plan, prepared by a qualified
nurseryman or landscape architect shall be submitted with each application for
a building permit. Such plan shall be reviewed by the Zoning Administrator for
compliance with the provisions of this section.
   b.   Maintenance of Required Landscaping. Upon installation of required
landscape materials, each owner shall take appropriate actions to ensure their
continued health and maintenance. Required landscaping that does not remain
healthy shall be replaced consistent with this section and the approved
landscaping plan for the project.
   c.   Obstruction of View. Landscaping or screening installed in any
landscaped area shall not obstruct the view from or to any driveway approach,
street, alley, or sidewalk, and shall be consistent with the provisions of the
City’s vision clearance zone regulations.
   d.   Earth Berm Locations. All earth berm locations shall be reviewed by the
Zoning Administrator to determine how the berms shall relate to drainage and
public utilities.
   e.   Exceptions. A development may continue to comply with the buffer yard
and screening requirements in effect at the time of issuance of its original
permit, regardless of whether an adjacent lot or site is subsequently rezoned
to a less intensive district which would otherwise require compliance with
buffer yard or screening provisions.
165.27   OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING.
27.1   Purpose. This section requires that developments provide parking in
proportion to the need created by each use. The regulations further establish
standards for the functional design of parking facilities. These regulations
are intended to accommodate vehicles in a functionally satisfactory manner and
to minimize external effects on neighboring properties.
27.2   General Applications.
   a.   Applicability. Off-street parking shall be provided for any new
building constructed; for new uses or conversions of existing buildings; or for
enlargements of existing structures.
   b.   Exemptions. Any use within the CBD Downtown Manchester District is
exempt from the off-street parking requirements. Any off-street parking
facility constructed in the CBD District after the effective date of this
Zoning Ordinance must comply with the design standards set forth in this
section.
27.3   Schedule of Off-Street Parking Requirements. Parking facilities for each
use shall be provided in accordance with the minimum requirements set forth in
Table 27.1.
   a.   When a computation of required parking results in a fraction of 0.5 or
greater, the requirement shall be rounded up to the next whole number. Any
parking computation for any use other than single-family residential and
requiring such a calculation shall have a minimum requirement of three parking
stalls.
   b.   Unless otherwise indicated, parking requirements are based on gross
floor area.
   c.   When parking requirements are computed on the basis of capacity,
capacity shall be determined by the building code or other official
determinations of occupancy in effect for the City at the time the use is
established.
   d.   Tandem parking spaces shall not be permitted except for single-family
residences, mobile homes, or parking facilities when an attendant is on duty
during the hours when the facility is being used.

27.4   Parking Facility Location.
   a.   Residential Parking.
      1.   With the exception of Downtown Residential uses, off-street parking
for residential uses shall be located on the same lot or site as the use.
      2.   Off-street parking areas for any multi-family or group residential
uses shall be at least 6 feet from any main building and shall not be located
within a required front yard or street side yard.
      3.   For multi-family residential uses, separately leased detached
garages may not be used to satisfy parking requirements for such use. Parking
incorporated into the design of multi-family buildings, or within parking
structures, shall be counted toward fulfillment of parking requirements.
      4.   Parking in front yards shall be subject to the following:
         (a)   All required parking in any R district must be outside the
required front yard.
         (b)   No parking for any permitted use in any R district, other than
single-family or two-family units, may be located in the required front yard.
         (c)   In any R district, no single-family or two-family lot shall have
more than 30 percent of the front yard used for driveway and off-street parking
purposes. However, this restriction shall not prohibit the construction of a
20-foot-wide driveway or a driveway expansion immediately in front of and the
minimum width reasonably necessary to provide access to a two-car garage, or a
36-foot-wide driveway for a three-car-garage.
(Ord. 004-2020 – Oct. 20 Supp.)
         (d)   In any R district, expansions of off-street parking areas in
front yards shall be of a hard surface, e.g., paved concrete, asphalt, brick
pavers or equal.
         (e)   Overflow temporary parking for school athletic events shall be
allowed in the required front yard provided such parking is restricted to the
school grounds.
   b.   Nonresidential Parking.
      1.   Location. Off-street parking for nonresidential uses shall be
located on the same lot or site as the use, or within 1,000 feet of that use if
the parking site is within a zoning district that permits the off-street
parking use type.
      2.   Control of Off-Site Parking Facilities. When required parking
facilities are provided on land other than the zoning lot on which the building
or use served by such facilities is located, they shall be and remain in the
same possession or ownership as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use
to which the parking facilities are accessory. No such off-site parking
facilities shall be authorized and no permit shall be issued where the plans
call for parking facilities other than on the same zoning lot until and unless
the Board has reviewed the plans and heard the applicant and made findings that
the common ownership or possession of the zoning lot and the site of the
parking facilities are reasonably certain to continue and that the off-site
parking facilities will be maintained at all times during the life of the
proposed use of building.
27.5   Parking for People with Disabilities.
   a.   Each off-street parking facility shall provide the number of parking
spaces set forth in Table 27.2, designed and designated for use by people with
disabilities. Every eighth parking space shall be van-accessible. Design
criteria and dimensions shall be in accordance with Federal Register, Volume
56, No 144. Parking facilities for single-family, duplex, two-family, and
mobile home residential uses are exempt from this requirement.
   b.   Spaces designated for people with disabilities shall have a minimum
width of 12 feet. Each space shall provide a barrier-free route to an
accessible building entrance, which shall not require users to walk or wheel
behind parked cars. Such spaces shall be designated with an upright sign
exhibiting the universal symbol for accessibility by the disabled. All such
spaces shall be designed in compliance with the standards of the Americans with
Disabilities Act.

27.6   Off-Street Parking Design Standards.
   a.   Dimensions.
      1.   Standard Size. Standard parking stalls shall be 9 feet wide and 18
feet long.
      2.   Vehicle Overhang Area. Where parking stalls are located adjacent to
landscaped areas, the paved depth of such stalls may be decreased by two feet
to provide for a vehicle overhang area. The vehicle overhang area may not
encroach into a required landscaped area or public sidewalk or right-of-way.
      3.   Parking Module Design (from SUDAS Design Manual).  The drive aisle
is the space between two parking stalls directly across from one another. The
term “module” refers to the width of the drive aisle combined with the length
of the parking stalls on one or both sides of the drive aisle. Table 27.3 lists
recommended minimum dimensions for parking facilities. Figure 27.4 provides
further definition of the terms used in Table 27.3. The only dimension that
varies by stall width is the interlock dimension. An interlock occurs with
angled parking when two stalls in adjacent modules align. The overlap at the
front of the stalls is the interlock dimension. When a parking facility is
designed to take advantage of interlock, the effective width of the module may
be reduced by the interlock dimension. For aisles with interlocking spaces on
both sides, the effective width of the module may be reduced by two times the
interlock distance. This approach can provide a more efficient parking lot
facility and reduce the overall surface area required for the parking lot.
Because snow can obscure pavement markings, vehicles will often pull too far
into a parking space, which reduces the width of the aisle in the adjacent
module. This has been taken into consideration in Table 27.3. Therefore, when a
curb, wall, or other physical restraint is provided for on at least 30 percent
of the stalls, the aisle width (and therefore the overall module width) may be
reduced by one foot. Perpendicular parking provides the greatest number of
parking spaces for a given length of aisle. One-way angled parking provides
fewer spaces than perpendicular for the same length of aisle, but has the
advantage of a narrower drive aisle. Because of this, the surface area per
parking space for perpendicular and angled one-way parking is approximately
equal. Two-way angled parking is also allowable and can be useful in certain
situations; however, it is a less efficient design than two-way perpendicular
or one-way angled parking. Two-way angled parking cannot take full advantage of
the narrower drive aisle, requiring approximately 10 percent to 15 percent more
area per parking space than perpendicular or one-way angled parking.

   b.   Pavement and Drainage.
      1.   All off-street parking facilities, including approaches and
maneuvering areas, shall be surfaced with concrete, asphalt, asphaltic
concrete, or brick and shall be maintained with materials sufficient to prevent
mud, dust, or loose material except as provided below:
         (a)   Sites within the AG District are exempt from this requirement.
         (b)   In residential areas, all parking spaces and driveways used for
parking shall be paved, including driveways that lead to paved parking spaces.
      2.   Off-street parking facilities shall be designed and built to prevent
the free flow of water onto adjacent properties. Parking lot design which
discharges water onto public right-of-way is subject to review and approval by
the City Engineer.
   c.   Landscape and Screening Requirements. Landscape requirements for off-
street parking facilities are set forth in subsection 26.7.
   d.   Entrances and Exits.
      1.   Adequate access to each parking facility shall be provided by means
of clearly defined and limited driveways or access points. Such driveways shall
be designed to direct non-residential traffic away from residential areas.
      2.   Parking facilities other than driveways for single-family, duplex,
two-family, or mobile home residential uses must permit vehicles to enter
streets in a forward position.
      3.   Head-in parking from any public right-of-way shall be permitted only
in the CBD district, or as part of a specific Planned Unit Development design.
   e.   Design and Pedestrian Access.
      1.   Parking lots in commercial and office developments providing over
200 stalls should be divided into smaller parking fields not exceeding 100
stalls to reduce the visual impact of large parking expanses. Divisions should
be made with landscape strips, peninsulas, or grade changes.
      2.   Commercial or office parking lots shall be designed to separate
pedestrians from vehicles to the maximum degree possible and to provide
protected pedestrian paths within parking areas which lead to store, building,
or shopping center entrances.
      3.   Sidewalks and walkways in commercial developments should link to the
City’s sidewalk and trail system where available, and shall provide a safe
pedestrian route from adjacent public sidewalks and trails.
   f.   Safety Features.
      1.   Parking facilities shall be designed to provide visibility of and
between pedestrians and vehicles when circulating within or entering or leaving
the facility; and shall not create blind, hidden, or hazardous areas.
      2.   Circulation patterns shall be designed in accordance with accepted
standards of traffic engineering and safety.
   g.   Maintenance. All parking facilities shall be maintained to assure the
continued usefulness and compatibility of the facility. Acceptable maintenance
includes keeping the facility free of refuse, debris, and litter; maintaining
parking surfaces in sound condition; and providing proper care of landscaped
areas.
   h.   Adjustment for Special Uses and Planned Mixed Use Projects.
      1.   For uses subject to a Special Use Permit approval, the Zoning Board
of Adjustment may adjust the minimum requirements of this section, in order to
provide design, usability, attractiveness, or protection to adjoining uses in a
manner equal to or greater than the minimum requirements of this section.
      2.   In mixed-use projects, different uses may have complementary parking
requirements. This can result in a parking requirement that is less than the
sum of parking required for each use and added separately. The Board of
Adjustment may authorize an adjustment to the total parking requirement for
separate uses located as part of a common development, or for separate uses
located on adjacent sites and served by common parking facilities. All parking
facilities subject to the mixed-use adjustment must be located in a common
facility, equally accessible and usable to all served uses.
27.7   Off-Street Loading.
   a.   Loading Requirement. In any district with every building or part
thereof hereafter erected, having a gross floor area of 10,000 square feet or
more, which is to be occupied by manufacturing, storage, warehouse, goods
display, retail store, wholesale store, market, hotel, hospital, mortuary,
laundry, dry cleaning or other uses similarly requiring the receipt or
distribution by vehicles of material or merchandise, there shall be provided
and maintained on the same lot with such building, at least one off-street
loading space plus one additional such loading space for each 20,000 square
feet or major fraction thereof of gross floor area, so used, in excess of
10,000 square feet.
   b.   Design Standards.
      1.   Each loading space shall be at least 12 feet wide by 40 feet long,
with a vertical clearance of at least 14 feet.
      2.   Paving of loading spaces and access areas shall be permanent,
durable, and free of dust.
      3.   Off-street loading areas are subject to the landscaping and
buffering requirements for parking facilities set forth in this section.
27.8   Stacking Requirements for Drive-Through Services.
   a.   Commercial establishments providing drive-in or drive-through services
shall provide minimum on-site stacking distance as provided by Table 27.4.

      1.   All temporary signs shall be maintained in sound condition. Any sign
that exhibits deterioration of structure or materials may be removed subject to
the provisions of this section.
      2.   The Zoning Administrator shall order the removal of any sign not in
compliance with any provisions of this section. If the owner of the premises on
which such sign is located, or the owner of the sign if unlawfully located on
public property, fails to remove such sign, the Zoning Administrator shall be

165.29   ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
29.1   Zoning Administrator. The City Manager shall administer and enforce the
Zoning Ordinance as the City’s Zoning Administrator. If the Zoning
Administrator finds that any of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance are
being violated, the Zoning Administrator shall notify in writing the person
responsible for such violations, indicating the nature of the violation and
ordering the action necessary to correct it. The Zoning Administrator shall
order discontinuance of illegal use of land, buildings or structures; removal
of illegal buildings or structures or of illegal work being done or shall take
any other action authorized by this Zoning Ordinance to ensure compliance with
or to prevent violation of the provisions hereof.
29.2   Building Permits Required. No building or other structure shall be
erected, moved, added to, or structurally altered without a permit therefor,
issued by the Zoning Administrator. No building permit shall be issued by the
Zoning Administrator except in conformity with the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance, unless the Zoning Administrator receives written order from the
Board in the form of an administrative review, special exception, or variance,
as provided herein.
29.3   Application for Permit. All applications for building permits shall be
accompanied by plans drawn to scale, showing the actual dimensions and shape of
the lot to be built upon; the exact sizes and locations on the lot of buildings
already existing, if any; and the location and dimensions of the proposed
building or alteration or other similar drawing so required by the Zoning
Administrator. The application shall include such other information as lawfully
may be required by the Zoning Administrator, including existing or proposed
building or alteration; existing or proposed uses of the building and land; the
number of families, housekeeping units or rental units the building is designed
to accommodate; conditions existing on the lot; and such other matters as may
be necessary to determine conformance with and provide for the enforcement of
this Zoning Ordinance.
29.4   Expiration of Building Permit. If the work described in any building
permit has not begun within 180 days from the date of issuance thereof, said
permit shall expire; it shall be canceled by the Zoning Administrator; and
written notice thereof shall be given to the persons affected.
29.5   Construction and Use to Be as Provided in Application, Plans and
Permits. Building permits issued on the basis of plans and specifications
approved by the Zoning Administrator authorize only the use, arrangement, and
construction set forth in such approved plans and applications, and no other
use, arrangement or construction. Use, arrangement or construction at variance
with that authorized shall be deemed violation of the Zoning Ordinance.
29.6   Investigation Fees; Work without Permit.
   a.   Investigation. Whenever any work for which a permit is required by the
Zoning Ordinance has been commenced without first obtaining said permit, a
special investigation shall be made before a permit may be issued for such
work.
   b.   Fee. An investigation fee, in addition to the permit fee, shall be
collected whether or not a permit is then or subsequently issued. The
investigation fee shall be equal to the amount of the permit fee that would be
required by this Zoning Ordinance if a permit were to be issued. The payment of
such investigation fee shall not exempt any person from compliance with all
other provisions of this Code of Ordinances or any penalty prescribed by law.
29.7   Amendments.
   a.   Hearing Required; Notice. The Council may, on its own motion or as the
result of a petition by a private party, amend, supplement, change, and/or
repeal this Zoning Ordinance, including the boundaries of zoning districts. No
such action shall be effective until a public hearing on the amendment,
supplement, change, and/or repeal has been held by the Council, at which
hearing parties in interest and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard.
Notice of time and place of public hearing shall be published in a newspaper of
general circulation in the City not more than 20 days in advance and at least 7
days prior to the public hearing and in no case shall the public hearing be
held earlier than the next regularly scheduled Council meeting following the
published notice.
   b.   Planning Commission Report Required; Hearing. Before the Council holds
its public hearing, the proposed amendment, supplement, change, modification,
or repeal shall be referred to the Commission for its recommendations and
report. No report or recommendation shall be made to the Council until the
Commission holds a public hearing, at which parties in interest and citizens
shall have an opportunity to be heard. Not less than 7 or more than 20 days’
notice of time and place of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of
general circulation in the City. This notice may be published concurrently with
the notice required in subsection 29.7a above. If the Commission makes no
report or recommendation within 30 days, it shall be considered to have made a
report approving the proposed amendment, supplement, modification, change or
repeal.
   c.   Unfavorable Report or Protest; Council Vote Required. If the Commission
recommends against, or if a protest against signed by the owners of 20 percent
or more of either of the area of the lots included in the proposed change or of
those immediately adjacent in the rear thereto extending the depth of one lot
or not to exceed 200 feet therefrom or of those directly opposite thereto,
extending the depth of one lot or not to exceed 200 feet from the street
frontage of such opposite lots, such amendment, supplement, change,
modification or repeal shall not become effective except by favorable vote of
at least three-fourths of all the members of the Council.
   d.   Application Fee. A nonrefundable fee shall be paid by the applicant to
the City at the time of filing application for amendment, supplement, change,
modification or repeal. The fee shall be in an amount established by the
Council.
   e.   Procedures. Any person may submit to the Council an application
requesting a change in the zoning district boundaries as shown on the Official
Zoning District Map. Such application shall be filed with the Zoning
Administrator accompanied by a fee set by resolution of the Council and shall
contain the following information:
      1.   The legal description and local address of the property.
      2.   The present zoning classification and the zoning classification
requested for the property.
      3.   The existing use and proposed use of the property.
      4.   The names and addresses of all the owners of all property within 200
feet of the property for which the change is requested.
      5.   A statement of the reasons why the applicant feels the present
zoning classification is no longer valid.
      6.   A plat showing the locations, dimensions and use of the applicant’s
property and all property within 200 feet thereof, including streets, alleys,
railroads and other physical features.
29.8   Conditions on Rezoning. As a part of an ordinance changing land from one
zoning district to another zoning district or an ordinance approving a site
development plan, the Council may impose conditions on a property owner which
are in addition to existing regulations if the additional conditions have been
agreed to in writing by the property owner before the public hearing required
under this section or any adjournment of the hearing. The conditions must be
reasonable and imposed to satisfy public needs which are directly caused by the
requested change.
29.9   Board of Adjustment (BOA) Established; Composition; Terms. The Board of
Adjustment consists of five (5) members, appointed by the Mayor and confirmed
by the Council, to serve for staggered terms of five (5) years. Any vacancy
shall be filled by the Mayor and confirmed by the Council for any unexpired
term. Members of the Board may be removed by the Mayor, with consent of the
Council, for cause after written charges have been filed and a public hearing
has been held. The Board shall elect officers from its membership as deemed
necessary.
29.10   BOA General Procedures; Meetings; Records; Rules. The Board shall adopt
rules of procedure in accordance with the provisions of this Code of Ordinances
and the Code of Iowa. Meetings of the Board shall be held at the call of the
Chairperson and at such other times as the Board may determine. The Chairperson
or, in the absence of the Chairperson, the acting Chairperson may administer
oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the Board shall
be open to the public. Any person may appear and testify at a hearing either in
person or by duly authorized agent or attorney. The Board shall keep minutes of
its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question or if
absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact. Findings of fact and the
reasons for approving or denying each question before the Board shall be
included in the minutes. Any limitations or conditions imposed upon any relief
granted or work or use authorized shall be specifically set forth. A copy of
every rule or regulation, order, requirement, decision or determination of the
Board shall be filed immediately in the office of the Zoning Administrator and
shall be a public record.
29.11   BOA Finality of Decision and Necessary Vote. All decisions and findings
of the Board on any appeal or conditional use, after a public hearing, shall,
in all instances, be the final administrative decision and shall be subject to
judicial review as by law may be provided. All decisions and findings of the
Board on any application for variance shall be reviewed by the Council at its
next regularly scheduled meeting or a special meeting called for the purpose of
reviewing said variance. Upon the review of the granting of said variance, the
Council may remand the decision to grant a variance to the Board for further
study. The effective date of any variance so remanded shall be delayed for
thirty (30) days from the date of remand during which time the Board shall meet
to further study the granting of said variance. The granting of any variance
not so remanded shall be affirmed. The decisions and findings of the Board on
the application for the variance shall be the final administrative decision and
shall be subject to judicial review as by law may be provided upon the
happening of either of the following:
   a.   The review of the granting of said variance by the Council, which
decision is not remanded to the Board;
   b.   The 31st day following the decision by the Council to remand the
decision on the granting of a variance to the Board for further study. The
concurring vote of three (3) members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse
an order, requirement, decision or determination of the Zoning Administrator or
to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to
pass under this Zoning Ordinance or to effect any variance in such Zoning
Ordinance.
29.12   Appeals to the BOA. An appeal may be taken to the Board by any person
or by any office, department, board or bureau affected by any decision of the
Zoning Administrator and where it is alleged there is error in any order,
requirement, decision or determination made by the Zoning Administrator in the
enforcement of this Zoning Ordinance. Such an appeal shall be taken within a
reasonable time, as may be provided by the rules of the Board, by filing with
the Zoning Administrator and with the Board a notice of appeal specifying the
grounds of such appeal. The Zoning Administrator shall forthwith transmit to
the Board all of the papers constituting a record upon which the action
appealed from was taken. The Board shall make no finding except to a specific
case and after a public hearing is conducted. A nonrefundable fee shall be paid
by the applicant to the City at the time an application for an appeal, variance
or conditional use is filed. The fee shall help defray necessary costs and
shall be in an amount established by resolution, from time to time, by the
Council.
29.13   Effect of Appeal to BOA. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance
of the action appealed from, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the
Board after the notice of appeal has been filed that by reason of acts stated
in the certificate a stay would in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator
cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case proceedings shall not be
stayed except by restraining order which may be granted by the Board or by a
court of record in application on notice to the Zoning Administrator and on due
cause shown.
29.14   BOA: Notice of Hearing. Notice of the time and place of public hearings
to be conducted by the Board shall be published in a publication of general
circulation within the City not less than seven (7) days or more than twenty
(20) days before the date of hearing. In addition to the above, the notice
shall also contain the address or location of the property for which the
request is being made, legal description of the property in question, and a
brief explanation regarding the nature of the request.
29.15   BOA Powers and Duties.  The Board of Adjustment shall have the power
and duty to:
   a.   Hear and decide appeals taken pursuant to subsection 29.12.
   b.   Grant a variance in the regulations of this chapter that will not be
contrary to the public interest, where owing to special conditions a literal
enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that
the spirit of this chapter shall be observed and substantial justice done. To
establish unnecessary hardship a property owner must show all of the following
elements:
      1.   The land in question cannot yield a reasonable return from any use
permitted by the regulations of the district in which the land is located.
Failure to yield a reasonable return may only be shown by proof that the owner
has been deprived of all beneficial or productive use of the land in question.
It is not sufficient merely to show that the value of the land has been
depreciated by the regulations or that a variance would permit the owner to
maintain a more profitable use.
      2.   The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances not of the
owner’s own making, which unique circumstances must relate specifically to the
land in question and not to general conditions in the neighborhood.
      3.   The use to be authorized by the variance will not alter the
essential character of the locality of the land in question.
In granting any variance, the Board may prescribe appropriate conditions and
safeguards in conformity with this chapter. Violation of such conditions and
safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted,
shall be deemed a violation of this chapter subject to enforcement under
subsections 29.1 and 29.2. No appeal for a use variance shall be considered by
the Board unless a proposed amendment to rezone the subject property to a
district classification permitting such use has been considered and denied by
the City Council within the preceding year, provided that this requirement
shall not apply to appeals for area variances.
   c.   Grant a variation from the terms of Section
165.22, Floodplain/Floodway Overlay District, of this chapter that will not be
contrary to the public interest, where owing to special conditions a literal
enforcement of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Any such
variance granted must meet the following applicable standards, in addition to
the general standards for variances set forth in subsection 29.15b.
      1.   No variance shall be granted for any development within the FW
district which would result in a significant increase in the 100-year flood
level.
      2.   Variances shall only be granted upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the appellant;
         (c)   A determination that the granting of the variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, creation of nuisances, or victimization of the
public;
         (d)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and
         (e)   A showing that the Iowa Department of Natural Resources has been
notified of the requested variance.
   d.   Permit the exceptions in this subsection to the district regulations
set forth in this chapter, provided all exceptions shall by their design,
construction, and operation adequately safeguard the health, safety, and
welfare of the occupants of adjoining and surrounding property; shall not
impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property; shall not
unduly increase congestion in the public streets; shall not increase public
danger of fire and safety; and shall not diminish or impair established
property values in surrounding areas. However, nothing in this subsection shall
be interpreted as authorizing the Board to grant an exception to any separation
requirement, such power being expressly denied the Board. Any exception to a
separation requirement granted for a structure for which a building permit has
not been issued shall be null and void. In granting any exception, the Board
may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this
chapter. The Board of Adjustment may permit:
      1.   Exceptions to any setback, area, length, width, height, yard, size
or projection limitation or to the minimum required number of off-street
parking or loading spaces; provided such an exception may be granted only
where:
         (a)   Such exception does not exceed 33? percent of the particular
limitation or number in question; or
         (b)   Such exception is from a yard requirement to permit an addition
to an existing legal nonconforming building and such addition extends no
further into the required yard than the existing building;
         (c)   The exception relates entirely to a use classified by applicable
district regulations as either a principal permitted use, a permitted accessory
use, or a permitted sign, or to off-street parking or loading areas accessory
to such a permitted use;
         (d)   The exception is reasonably necessary due to practical
difficulties related to the land in question;
         (e)   Such practical difficulties cannot be overcome by any feasible
alternative means other than an exception; and
         (f)   The exception is in harmony with the essential character of the
neighborhood of the land in question.
      2.   Use of property for off-street parking areas accessory to permitted
residential district uses where such parking areas do not immediately adjoin
the permitted residential district use.
      3.   Exceptions to the minimum lot width requirement, where such lot
meets the lot width at the building line and satisfies the following
conditions:
         (a)   The development pattern of the lot is in harmony with the
development pattern of the neighborhood in which it is located;
         (b)   The development has unique terrain, views or vegetation; and
         (c)   The development is consistent with the density of the adjoining
lots.
      4.   Exceptions to the minimum design standards for single-family
detached dwellings where the design of the dwelling is consistent with the
design of existing dwellings in the neighborhood of the land in question, or
the exception is necessary to permit the construction of a dwelling upon a lot
of unusual shape or topography.
      5.   Exceptions to the time period within which a use may be resumed
after a temporary discontinuance of that use, where:
         (a)   The discontinuance of the use was due to unique circumstances
not of the owner’s own making.
         (b)   The use to be authorized by the exception is in harmony with the
essential character of the neighborhood of the land in question.
      6.   Extend a district where the boundary line of a district divides a
lot of record held in single ownership.
      7.   Interpret the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance in such a way as
to carry out the intent and purposes of the official zoning district map where
the existing street layout in fact varies from the street layout as shown on
the map.
      8.   Permit the construction and use of a building or the use of premises
for railroads or public utility purposes.
      9.   Permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming building which has been
damaged by fire, explosion or act of God to the extent of more than 60 percent
of its fair market value where the Board finds some compelling necessity
requiring a continuance of the nonconforming use and the Board further finds
that the public interest will best be served by permitting a continuance of the
nonconforming use.
      10.   Waive or reduce the parking, loading or screening requirements in
any of the zoning districts whenever the character or use of the building is
such as to make unnecessary the full provisions of such requirements, or where
such regulations would impose an unreasonable hardship on the property as
contrasted with merely granting an advantage or convenience.
      11.   Permit uses not specifically designated as principal permitted uses
in a zoning district, provided that the Board determines such use is similar
and compatible to uses allowed as principal permitted uses in that district.
   e.   Hear and decide applications for special permits in accordance with
subsection 29.16 of this chapter.
29.16   BOA Powers and Duties: Special Permits.
   a.   Uses Allowed by Special Permit. In accordance with subsection 4.12b,
the Board of Adjustment may, by special permit after public hearing, authorize
the location of buildings and uses in districts as indicated in Tables 4.1
through 4.6, provided, however, that no such special permit shall be granted
authorizing any building or use in a FW district.
   b.   Application. Application for a special permit under the terms of this
chapter shall be accompanied by evidence concerning the feasibility of the
proposed request and its effect on surrounding property and shall include a
site plan defining the areas to be developed for structures; the areas to be
developed for parking; the locations of sidewalks and driveways and the points
of ingress and egress, including access streets where required; the location
and heights of walls; the location and type of landscaping; and the location,
size, and number of signs. The application shall further demonstrate compliance
with the general and specific standards for approval of a special permit under
subsection 29.16c.
   c.   Review. The Board of Adjustment shall have the power and duty to
approve a special permit for a proposed use if it finds that the applicant has
demonstrated that the design, construction and manner of operation of the
proposed use will substantially conform to the standards set forth below:
      1.   General. Any structure or use of land to be allowed by a special
permit shall by its design, construction, and operation adequately safeguard
the health, safety, and welfare of the occupants of adjoining and surrounding
property; shall not unduly increase congestion in the public streets; shall not
increase public danger of fire and safety; and shall not diminish or impair
established property values in surrounding areas, and shall have no significant
detrimental impact on the use and enjoyment of adjoining properties.
      2.   Bulk Standards. Any deviation from the district bulk standards
applicable to uses allowed by the district regulations must be reasonably
necessary due to practical difficulties related to the land or type of use in
question; and, such practical difficulties cannot be overcome by any feasible
alternative means.
      3.   Residential Setback. Adequate setbacks shall be provided to protect
adjacent residentially zoned property from nonresidential and institutional
uses.
      4.   Architectural Character. New buildings and alterations to existing
buildings located in or adjacent to existing developed areas shall be
compatible with the existing architectural character of such areas.
Compatibility may be achieved through techniques such as the repetition of roof
lines, the use of similar proportions in building mass and outdoor spaces,
similar relationships to the street, similar window and door patterns, and/or
the use of building materials that have color shades and textures similar to
those existing in the immediate area of the proposed development. Brick and
stone masonry shall be considered compatible with wood framing and other
materials.
      5.   Building Mass.  New buildings and alterations to existing buildings
shall be either similar in size and height, or if larger, shall be articulated,
setback or subdivided into massing that is proportional to the mass and scale
of other structures on the same block and adjoining blocks. Articulation may be
achieved through variation of roof lines, setbacks, patterns of door and window
placement, and the use of characteristic entry features. To the maximum extent
feasible, the height, setback and width of new buildings and alterations to
existing buildings should be similar to those of existing buildings on the same
block. Taller buildings or portions of buildings should be located interior to
the site. Buildings at the ends of blocks should be of similar height to
buildings on the adjoining blocks.
      6.   Parking. No parking should be permitted in a required front yard of
an “R” district unless shown to be compatible with the adjoining land use.
Parking lots containing more than eight parking spaces should comply with the
adopted landscape standards applicable to commercial development in the C-
1 district, unless a higher standard is applicable under the site plan
regulations.
   d.   Conditions and Safeguards. In granting any special permit under the
terms of this chapter, the Board of Adjustment may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter. Violation of such
conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the
special permit is granted, shall result in revocation of the special permit.
   e.   Change in Use or Site Plan. If a special permit is granted under the
terms of this chapter, any change thereafter in the approved use or site plan
shall be resubmitted and considered in the same manner as the original
proposal.
29.17   Abandonment of Variances, Exceptions and Special Permits.
   a.   Uses of land, structures and uses of structures which would otherwise
be prohibited under this chapter but have been allowed by the granting of an
exception or variance or have been allowed as a special permit may continue
until such exception, variance or special permit lapses as provided in this
section.
   b.   If any such use of land or of a structure is not commenced within one
year of the allowance of the variance, exception or conditional use, whichever
is later, or is discontinued for a period of one year, such variance, exception
or conditional use shall lapse, and any subsequent use of such land or
structure shall conform to the district regulations for the district in which
such land or structure is located.
   c.   If the event the construction of any such structure is not commenced
within two years of the issuance of the variance, exception or special permit
for such structure, whichever is later, and diligently pursued to completion,
such variance, exception, or special permit shall lapse, and any subsequent use
of such land shall conform to the district regulations for the district in
which such land is located. If any such structure is destroyed by any means to
an extent of 60 percent or more of its replacement cost at the time of
destruction, it shall not be reconstructed; any such variance, exception, or
special permit for such structure shall lapse; and any subsequent use of such
land shall conform to the district regulations for the district in which such
land is located.
29.18   BOA Decisions; Review of Use Variance.
   a.   In exercising the powers mentioned in subsection 29.15, the Board of
Adjustment may, in conformity with the provisions of law, reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or modify the order, requirement, decision or determination
appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or determinations
as it believes proper, and to that end shall have all the powers of the Zoning
Administrator. The concurring vote of three of the members of the Board shall
be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of
the Zoning Administrator or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter
upon which it is required to pass under this chapter; provided, however, the
action of the Board shall not become effective until it has filed a written
decision in the Board office describing the action taken, the vote of each
member participating therein and the reasons for such action, specifying the
manner in which the applicant either satisfied or failed to satisfy each of the
applicable standards, conditions or elements set forth in subsection 29.15.
Decisions shall be filed promptly following the Board’s action and shall be
open to public inspection.
   b.   Every variation and exception granted or denied by the Board shall be
supported by a written testimony or evidence submitted in connection therewith.
   c.   If any application for a variance or exception shall have been denied
by the Board of Adjustment, no new application for the same relief shall be
considered for two years by the Board unless the Board shall find that
conditions have changed.
   d.   Any taxpayer or any officer, department, board or bureau of the City or
any persons jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of the Board may
present to a court of record a petition for writ of certiorari, duly verified,
setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying
the grounds of the illegality. The petition shall be presented to the court
within 30 days after the filing of the decision in the office of the Board. All
decisions of the Board, except decisions granting use variances or a variance
from any separation requirement, shall be final immediately upon filing. Each
decision granting a use variance or a variance from any separation requirement
shall be referred to the City Council for review pursuant to Section 414.7 of
the Code of Iowa. The City Council shall review such decision within 30 days
after the decision is filed. After such review, the Council may remand the
decision to the Board for further study. If the City Council does not act to
review the decision within 30 days after it is filed, the decision shall become
effective on the 31st day. If the City Council declines to remand a decision,
that decision shall become final on the date of the Council’s action. If the
City Council remands a decision to the Board, the effective date of the
decision is delayed for 30 days from the date of remand.
   e.   Upon remand of a decision from the City Council, the matter shall be
placed on the agenda for further study at the first board meeting after such
Council action. If, for any reason, the Board does not hold a regularly
scheduled meeting during such
30-day period, it shall be required to hold a special meeting and consider an
act upon the remanded decision within such 30-day period. At such meeting the
Board shall act to either affirm its earlier decision or grant a rehearing. A
rehearing shall be treated in the same manner as an appeal pursuant to
subsection 29.12, except that no fee shall be payable. If the Board grants a
rehearing, its initial decision shall be deemed to have been withdrawn. The
Board decision on rehearing is not reviewable by the City Council and shall be
final upon filing.
29.19   Nonconforming Uses and Structures: Statement of Intent.  Within the
various districts established by this chapter or amendments that may be
adopted, there exist structures and uses of land and structures which were
lawful prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter
derives but which would be prohibited under this chapter. It is the intent of
this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are
removed, but not to encourage their survival. Such uses are declared by this
chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is
further the intent of this chapter that such nonconformities shall not be
enlarged upon, expanded or extended.
29.20   Nonconforming Uses in any R District.
   a.   Nonconforming Uses of Land. The lawful use of land upon which no
building or structure is erected or constructed which becomes nonconforming
under the terms of the Zoning Ordinance may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following:
      1.   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased or extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of the
ordinance adopting or amending this chapter.
      2.   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot or parcel, which was not occupied by such use at the
effective date of the ordinance adopting or amending this chapter.
      3.   If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than six months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform
to the district regulations for the district in which such land is located.
   b.   Nonconforming Uses of Structures. If a lawful use of a structure or of
a structure and land in combination exists at the effective date of the
ordinance adopting or amending this chapter that would not be allowed in the
district under the terms of this chapter, the use may be continued so long as
it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following:
      1.   No existing structure devoted entirely or in part to a use not
permitted by this chapter in the district in which it is located, except when
required by law, shall be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, moved or
structurally altered, unless the use is changed to a use permitted in the
district in which such structure is located.
      2.   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use on the
effective date of the ordinance adopting or amending this chapter. No such use
shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
      3.   If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a
structure may be changed to another nonconforming use of a similar nature
within the same or a more restricted classification. Whenever a nonconforming
use has been changed to a more restricted use or to a conforming use, such use
shall not thereafter be changed to a less restrictive use.
      4.   If a nonconforming use of a structure or structure and land in
combination is abandoned, the use of such shall thereafter conform to the uses
permitted in the district in which it is located. A use shall be deemed
abandoned if while such use has been discontinued the owner of the property
makes any change to the property inconsistent with the resumption of such use.
Changes inconsistent with the resumption of a use include, but are not limited
to: Placing the property to another use; or combining two or more dwelling
units under one water, gas or electric meter; creating an opening between two
dwelling units.
      5.   If a nonconforming use of a structure or structure and land in
combination is discontinued for more than one year for any reason, the use of
such shall thereafter conform to the uses permitted in the district in which it
is located.
      6.   Any structure devoted to a use made nonconforming by this chapter
that is destroyed by any means to an extent of 60 percent or more of its
replacement cost at the time of destruction, exclusive of the foundations,
shall not be reconstructed and used as before such happening. If the structure
be less than 60 percent destroyed above the foundation, it may be reconstructed
and used as before, provided it is done within six months of such happening and
is built of like or similar materials. Where nonconforming use status applies
to a structure and land in combination, removal or destruction of the structure
shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land.
   c.   Nonconforming Structures, including Signs. Where a structure other than
a sign exists at the effective date of the ordinance adopting or amending this
chapter that could not be built under the terms of this chapter because of
restriction on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of
the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so
long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following:
      1.   No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which
increases its nonconformity.
      2.   If such structure is destroyed by any means to an extent of 60
percent or more of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall
not be reconstructed except in conformity with this chapter. Any single-family,
semidetached or two-family dwelling which was a conforming structure (on
effective date of ordinance) may be structurally altered, and if destroyed may
be reconstructed and used as before, provided such reconstruction is commenced
within one year of such destruction and diligently pursued to completion.
29.21   Nonconforming Uses in Any District Other than R Districts.
   a.   Nonconforming Uses of Land. The regulations governing nonconforming
uses of land in any R district as described in subsection 29.20a shall also
apply to this section.
   b.   Nonconforming Uses of Structures. If a lawful use of a structure or of
a structure and land in combination exists at the effective date of the
ordinance adopting or amending this chapter that would not be allowed in the
district under the terms of this chapter, the use may be continued so long as
it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following:
      1.   Within the FW district, no existing structure devoted entirely or in
part to a use not permitted by this chapter in the district in which it is
located, except when required by law, shall be enlarged, extended,
reconstructed, moved or structurally altered, unless the use is changed to a
use permitted in the district in which such structure is located.
      2.   Any structure in any district other than an R or FW district devoted
to a use made nonconforming by this chapter may be structurally altered or
enlarged in conformity with the lot area, lot coverage, frontage, yard, height,
and parking requirements of the district in which located, provided such
construction shall be limited to buildings on land owned of record by the owner
of the land devoted to the nonconforming use prior to the effective date of the
ordinance from which this section derives. Such structural alteration or
enlargement shall not authorize the substitution of a nonconforming use that is
less restrictive than the one to which the structure was devoted on the
effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives.
      3.   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use on the
effective date of the ordinance adopting or amending this chapter. No such use
shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
      4.   If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a
structure may be changed to another nonconforming use of a similar nature
within the same or a more restricted classification. Whenever a nonconforming
use has been changed to a more restricted use or to a conforming use, such use
shall not thereafter be changed to a less restrictive use.
      5.   If a nonconforming use of a structure or structure and land in
combination is abandoned, the use of such shall thereafter conform to the uses
permitted in the district in which it is located. A use shall be deemed
abandoned if while such use has been discontinued the owner of the property
makes any change to the property inconsistent with the resumption of such use.
Changes inconsistent with the resumption of a use include, but are not limited
to: placing the property to another use; combining two or more dwelling units
under one water, gas or electric meter; or creating an opening between two
dwelling units.
      6.   If a nonconforming use of a structure or structure and land in
combination is discontinued for more than one year for any reason whatsoever,
the use of such shall thereafter conform to the uses permitted in the district
in which it is located.
   c.   Nonconforming Structures. The regulations governing nonconforming
structures in any R district, as described in subsection 29.20c shall also
apply to this section.
29.22   Nonconforming Uses: Required Repairs and Unauthorized Nonconformities.
   a.   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the restoring to a
safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any
official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such
official.
   b.   Any use of land, use of structures or structures, in existence on the
effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives which was not
an authorized nonconformity under previous zoning ordinances shall not be
authorized to continue its nonconforming status pursuant to this chapter or
amendments to this chapter.

approved in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Upon the approval
of the final plat by the Council, it shall be the duty of the subdivider to
immediately file such plat with the County Auditor and County Recorder, as
required by law. Such approval shall be revocable after 30 days, unless such
plat has been duly recorded and evidence thereof filed with the Clerk within
such 30 days.
170.04   FEES ESTABLISHED.
The Council shall from time to time establish, by resolution, fees for the

170.07   IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.
The subdivider shall, at his or her expense, install and construct all
improvements required by this chapter. All required improvements shall be
installed and constructed in accordance with the design standards established
for such improvements by the City, and as shown on the approved preliminary
plat.
170.08   INSPECTION.
All improvements shall be inspected to ensure compliance with the requirements
of this chapter. The cost of such inspection shall be borne by the City.
170.09   MINIMUM IMPROVEMENTS.
The improvements set forth below shall be considered the minimum improvements
necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
      1.   Streets. The subdivider of land being subdivided shall provide the
grading of the entire street right-of-way, alley or public place and provide
appropriate paving, including curb and gutter, on all streets. All streets or
alleys shall be of such width and shall be constructed in accordance with the
plans and specifications approved by the City. Under some circumstances the
City may require, as a condition for the approval of the plat, dedication and
improvement of a street having a width greater than necessary to meet the needs
of the platted area, but necessary to complete the City street system as it
relates to both the area being platted and other areas. In such event, the City
will pay the subdivider the difference in cost of improving the wider street
and the street width reasonable to meet the foreseeable needs of the
subdivision taken alone. The streets shall, upon final approval and acceptance
by the City, become the property of the City.
      2.   Sanitary Sewer System. The subdivider of the land being platted
shall make adequate provision for the disposal of sanitary sewage from the
platted area with due regard being given to present or reasonably foreseeable
needs. There shall be constructed, at the subdivider’s expense, a sanitary
sewage system including all necessary pumping stations, pumping equipment,
manholes and all other necessary or desirable appurtenances to provide for the
discharge of sanitary sewage from all lots or parcels of land within the
platted area to a connection with the City’s sanitary sewers. The sanitary
sewer system shall be constructed in accordance with the plans and
specifications submitted by the subdivider and approved by the City. Under some
circumstances the City may require, as a condition for the approval of the
plat, installation of a sanitary sewer that is larger than necessary to meet
the needs of the platted area, but necessary to complete the City sanitary
sewer system as it relates to both the area being platted and other areas. In
such event, the City will pay the subdivider the difference in cost of pipe and
installation between the larger sewer and the diameter of sewer reasonable to
meet the foreseeable needs of the area. The above-mentioned facilities for the
collection and disposal of sanitary sewage from the platted area shall, upon
final approval and acceptance by the City, become the property of the City.
      3.   Storm Sewer System. The subdivider of the land being platted shall
install and construct a storm sewer system adequate to serve the area,
including anticipated extension of use to serve additional areas. The storm
sewer system shall be constructed in accordance with the plans and
specifications submitted by the subdivider and approved by the City. Under some
circumstances the City may require, as a condition for the approval of the
plat, installation of a storm sewer system that is larger than necessary to
meet the needs of the platted area, but necessary to complete the City storm
sewer system as it relates to both the area being platted and other areas. In
such event, the City will pay the subdivider the difference in cost of pipe and
installation between the larger sewer and the diameter of sewer reasonable to
meet the foreseeable needs of the area. The sewers shall, upon inspection,
approval and acceptance by the City, become the property of the City. In the
storm sewer design phase, consideration shall be given to alternatives and
principles of storm water management or the provisions of a storm water
management plan if such plan has been adopted by the City.
      4.   Water Main System. The subdivider of land being subdivided shall
install and construct a water main system adequate to serve all lots or parcels
of land within the platted area, with due regard to the present and foreseeable
needs of the entire area and shall connect the same to the City’s existing
water mains. Under some circumstances the City may require, as a condition for
the approval of the plat, installation of a water main that is larger than
necessary to meet the needs of the platted area, but necessary to complete the
City water distribution system as it relates to both the area being platted and
other areas. In such event, the City will pay the subdivider the difference in
cost of pipe and installation between the larger water main and the diameter of
water main reasonable to meet the foreseeable needs of the area. The water
mains shall, upon inspection, approval and acceptance by the City, become the
property of the City.
      5.   Other Improvements.
      A.   The owner and subdivider of the land being platted shall be
responsible for the installation of sidewalks within the street area, grading,
seeding or sodding of all lots. Deferments for sidewalk construction may be
approved by the City Council based on the City’s current procedures and
guidelines for sidewalk construction.
      B.   The owner and subdivider shall also be responsible for the
installation of street lighting.
170.10   EASEMENTS REQUIRED.
      1.   Public Utilities. Where alleys are not provided, or where otherwise
required by the present or future placement of public utilities, easements of
not less than ten feet in width shall be granted by the owner along rear, and
where necessary, along side lot lines for public utility requirements. Except
where prohibited by topography, such easements shall be centered on lot lines.
Easements of greater width may be required along lot lines, or across lot lines
when necessary for the placement and maintenance of utilities. No buildings or
structures, except as necessary for utilities, shall be permitted on such
easements.
      2.   Easements Along Streams and Watercourses. Wherever any stream or
surface watercourse is located in an area that is being subdivided, the
subdivider shall, at his or her own expense, make adequate provisions for the
proper drainage of surface water and shall provide and dedicate to the City an
easement along said stream or watercourse as necessary and as approved by the
City.
170.11   MAINTENANCE BOND REQUIRED.
The owner and subdivider of the land being platted shall be required to provide
to the City proper maintenance bonds, satisfactory to the City, so as to ensure
that for a period of two years from the date of acceptance of any improvement,
the owner and subdivider shall be responsible to maintain such improvement in
good repair.
170.12   ALTERNATIVE SYSTEMS FOR SEWER AND WATER.
      1.   Where connection to the City sewer or water system cannot reasonably
be made, the City may approve alternate facilities for the distribution of
water or the collection and disposal of sanitary wastes. Such alternate systems
shall be designed to fully protect the public health, safety and welfare, and
shall meet all requirements of State, County or other applicable health
regulations. Prior to granting approval of such alternate system, the City
shall require that the owner and subdivider provide to the City a waiver of
assessment, protest or such other legally binding documents necessary to
protect the City from the expense of the subsequent installation of sewer or
water facilities.
      2.   Lots which cannot be reasonably served by a public sanitary sewer
system and public water supply mains shall have a minimum width of 120 feet,
measured at the building line, and an area of not less than one acre exclusive
of right of way. On lots served by private on-site sewage disposal systems and
private water supplies, the developer is encouraged to utilize a well-sharing
system in order to maximize separation distances between alternate systems.
      3.   Percolation test data or professional soils analysis shall be
submitted for each lot in the proposed subdivision. Soils classifications in
the Soil Survey of Delaware County, Iowa can provide preliminary soil
information, but is not site specific and therefore is not to be substituted
for a professional soil analysis. Where soils classifications in the Soil
Survey of Delaware County, Iowa indicated shallow bedrock or ground water,
information on an additional test hole six feet in depth shall be provided for
each lot with that soil type. The submittal of the above information does not
relieve the owner from acquiring a permit for a private disposal system.
170.13   LAND SUITABILITY.
No land shall be subdivided which is found to be unsuitable for subdividing by
reason of flooding, ponding, poor drainage, adverse soil conditions, adverse
geological formations, unsatisfactory topography or other conditions likely to
be harmful to the public health, safety or general welfare, unless such
unsuitable conditions are corrected to the satisfaction of the City. If the
land is found to be unsuitable for subdivision for any of the reasons cited in
this section, the Council shall state its reasons in writing and afford the
subdivider an opportunity to present data regarding such unsuitability.
Thereafter, the Council may reaffirm, modify or withdraw its determination
regarding such unsuitability.
170.14   LANDS SUBJECT TO FLOODING.
No lot shall be located so as to include land located within a floodway or
flood hazard area unless the lot is of such size and shape that it will contain
a buildable area not within the floodway or flood hazard area, suitable for
development as allowed by the Zoning Ordinance for the zone in which the lot is
located. Land located within a flood hazard area or a floodway may be included
within a plat as follows, subject to the approval of the City:
      1.   Included within individual lots in the subdivision, subject to the
limitation of this section;
      2.   Reserved as open space for recreation by all owners of lots in the
subdivision, with an appropriate legal instrument, approved by the City,
providing for its care and maintenance by such owners;
      3.   If acceptable to the City, dedicated to the City as public open
space for recreation or flood control purposes.
170.15   PLAT TO CONFORM TO COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.
The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets
and the general nature and extent of the lots and uses proposed shall conform
to the comprehensive plan of the City, provided such plan has been adopted by
the City; and shall conform to such other plans, including but not limited to a
major street plan, a sanitary sewer system plan or a parks and open space plan,
provided such plan has been adopted by the City.
170.16   CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS FOR IMPROVEMENTS.
In addition to the standards set forth in this chapter, the Council may from
time to time adopt by resolution, technical standards for public improvements.
Such technical standards for public improvements shall contain the minimum
acceptable specifications for the construction of public improvements. Such
technical standards may vary for classes of improvements, giving due regard to
the classification of streets or other improvements, and the extent and
character of the area served by the improvements. Upon adoption by the Council
by resolution, the technical standards for public improvements shall have such
force and effect as if they were fully set forth herein.
170.17   STREET STANDARDS.
The following standards shall apply to all streets to be located within the
subdivision:
      1.   Streets shall provide for the continuation of major streets from
adjoining platted areas, and the extension of major streets into adjoining
unplatted areas. Where a plat encompasses the location for a major street
proposed in the comprehensive plan or major street plan, the plat shall provide
for such major street.
      2.   Street grades shall align to existing streets and all grades for
streets shall be approved by the City.
      3.   Arterial streets shall be located so as not to require direct access
from the arterial street to abutting lots.
      4.   Street right-of-way widths and pavement widths shall be as specified
in the technical standards for public improvements.
      5.   Half streets are prohibited; except where an existing platted half

provide necessary space within the right-of-way for sidewalks, traffic-control
devices and other necessary improvements without encroachment onto the corner
lots.
      10.   Dead-end streets are prohibited except where a street is planned to
continue past the subdivider’s property, a temporary dead end may be allowed.
      11.   Streets which connect with other streets, or loop streets, are
preferable for maintenance, fire protection and circulation, but cul-de-sacs
may be permitted. Whenever a cul-de-sac is permitted, such street shall be no
longer than 600 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround
having a street property line diameter of at least 120 feet in the case of
residential subdivisions. The right-of-way width of the street leading to the
turnaround shall be a minimum of 66 feet. The property line at the intersection
of the turnaround and the lead-in portion of the street shall be rounded at a

required in commercial areas with normal street frontage. Dead-end alleys are
prohibited, unless provided with a turnaround with a minimum right-of-way
diameter of 100 feet.
      13.   When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal lots or parcels,
such lots or parcels shall be so arranged so as to permit the logical location
and opening of future streets and appropriate resubdivision with provision for
adequate utility connections for such resubdivision. Easements for the future
opening and extensions for such streets or utilities may, at the discretion of
the Council, be made a requirement of the plat.
      14.   Streets which are or will become extensions of existing streets
shall be given the same name as the existing streets. New street names shall
not be the same or sound similar to existing street names. All street names
shall be at the approval of the Council.
      15.   Private streets, not dedicated to the City, shall be avoided. The
Council may approve a private street where unusual conditions make a private
street desirable, provided adequate covenants or other legal documents ensure
that the City will not have or need to assume any maintenance or other
responsibility for such street.

The subdivider shall present the sketch plan to the Commission and Council for
review prior to incurring significant costs preparing the preliminary or final
plat.
170.22   MINOR SUBDIVISION REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES.
      1.   The provision of adequate data concerning land use, utility
requirements, traffic impact, streets, easements and dedications is vital to
ensure the continued health, safety and welfare of the City’s residents.
Recognizing that the significance of this data is reduced for the small scale
projects that are most heavily impacted by cost of producing this data, the
City herein establishes a simplified procedure for minor subdivisions.
      2.   Applicants for subdivisions or resubdivisions creating no more than
three lots may follow the procedure set forth below provided that the
subdivision meets all of the following criteria:
      A.   No new street or other public improvements shall be necessary.

in the subdivision for a distance of at least 50 feet.
      C.   No new well or septic system is necessary.
      D.   No off-site drainage improvements are necessary.
      E.   The buildable area of any lot meets minimum zoning requirements
without being located within a 100-year flood plain, wetland or area of steep
slope.
      F.   Each lot in the subdivision complies with the City’s zoning
standards and the Comprehensive Plan.
      G.   No variances from subdivision or zoning are required.
      3.   A copy of the proposed minor subdivision plat shall be prepared and
submitted to the City Manager, said plat shall contain such information as
required for final plats. In addition, if the subdivision utilizes wells or
septic systems, the developer will also be required to comply with regulations

of receipt of an application, or such additional period as the subdivider may
authorize, the City Manager shall submit the subdivision request to the City
Council.
      6.   The City Council may approve or disapprove of the subdivision
request, or they may refer the request to the Planning and Zoning Commission
for their recommendation prior to making consideration of the request. In any
case, the Council shall approve or disapprove the minor plat by resolution. If
disapproved, the Council shall provide written reasons therefor.
      7.   Limitations. This section (minor subdivisions) shall not be
applicable to a parcel of land of any size which has previously had a parcel

      1.   A statement by the proprietors and their spouses, if any, that the
plat is prepared with their free consent and in accordance with their desire,
signed and acknowledged before an officer authorized to take the

are deemed necessary to adequately provide for maintenance and snow removal
costs and responsibilities involving the private street and for the creation of
a perpetual easement required for access by the general public, emergency
services, and other duties which the city is required by law to perform.
      9.   A resolution and certificate for approval by the Council and for

for public inspection and shall forward the remaining copies of the plat to the
City Manager.
      2.   The City Manager shall provide copies of the plat to the City
Engineer, the City Attorney and such other persons as necessary to review the
plat. Each of the aforementioned officers shall examine the plat as to its
compliance with the laws and regulations of the City and the State and submit
their findings to the City Manager as soon as possible, but within 30 days.
Upon receipt of these findings, the City Manager shall set forth such findings
in writing. A copy of the findings shall be provided to the subdivider. Then
the City Manager shall schedule the plat for consideration by the Commission.
      3.   If the plat is found to substantially conform to the preliminary
plat as approved, the final plat shall be forwarded to the Council for review.
If the plat is found not to conform to the preliminary plat, it shall be
referred to the Commission for review, prior to review by the Council. The
Planning Commission shall then review the plat and shall forward a written
recommendation thereon to the council within 45 days of the filing of the plat
with the Clerk. If the recommendation is to disapprove the plat or to require
modification of the plat, the reasons therefor shall be set forth in writing,
and a copy of the recommendation shall be provided to the subdivider.
      4.   Upon receipt of the plat and written reports thereon, the Council
shall review the plat and attachments thereto. If the plat is found to conform
to the ordinances and standards of the City and the comprehensive plan and
other duly adopted plans, all as of the date of approval of the preliminary
plat, and is found to substantially conform to the preliminary plat, the
Council shall approve the plat and shall cause its approval to be entered on
the plat as required by law.
      5.   Action on the final plat by the Council shall be taken within 60
days of the date of filing of the plat with the Clerk unless such time period

to disapprove the plat, the reasons therefor shall be set forth in the official
records of the Council and such decision shall be provided to the subdivider.
170.33   VARIANCES.
Where in the case of a particular proposed subdivision, it can be shown that
strict compliance with the requirements of this chapter would result in
extraordinary hardship to the subdivider because of unusual topography or other
conditions, the Council may vary, modify or waive the requirements so that
substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured. Provided,
however, such variance, modification or waiver will not have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of this chapter. In no case shall any
variance or modification be more than minimum easing of the requirements as
necessary to eliminate the hardship. In so granting a variance, the Council may
impose such additional conditions as are necessary to secure substantially the
objectives of the requirements so varied, modified or waived.
170.34   CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.
This chapter or any provision of this chapter may be changed or amended from
time to time by the Council, provided, however, that such changes or amendments
shall not become effective until after a public hearing has been held, public
notice of which shall have been published at least once not less than seven (7)
or more than twenty (20) days before the date of the hearing.
170.35   CONFLICTING ORDINANCES.
Nothing contained herein shall serve to abrogate, limit, repeal or otherwise
modify any other ordinances or regulations except as expressly set forth
herein. If any provision of this chapter conflicts with the provisions of any
other part of this Code of Ordinances or with any regulations or statute, the
most restrictive shall apply.
170.36   COMBINING ADJOINING LOTS.
   The purpose of this section is to allow the joining of single adjacent
parcels or lots under common ownership so they may be treated as a single
parcel or lot for purposes applying to the land use ordinance.
   1.   Applicability and Effect.
      A.   When parcels or lots are combined following the procedures in this
chapter, they are considered a single parcel or lot for purposes of applying
City Zoning and Subdivision ordinances.
      B.   Once combined under this chapter, the prior parcels or lot may not
be sold or conveyed separately without approval of a subdivision or other
procedure authorized under this code.
      C.   This chapter does not limit the ability of property owners to
combine the legal descriptions of separate parcels or lots for taxing or sale
purposes without following the requirements of this chapter. However, parcels
or lots combined only for taxing or sale purposes remain separate parcels or
lots for purposes applying the land use ordinance until or unless they are
combined following the provisions of this chapter.
      D.   A lot combination approved under this chapter serves to amend a
subdivision without requiring a subdivision plat amendment. As an alternative
to this chapter, a property owner may apply to combine lots through a
subdivision plat amendment or plat.
   2.   Process.
      A.   The City Manager shall review and make recommendations to the City
Council concerning the proposed lot combination.
      B.   The City Council upon receipt of the Application and recommendations
of the City Manager and following public hearing on the Application, may
approve, approve with conditions, or deny a parcel combination or lot
combination application.
      C.   Notice of public hearing before the City Council providing the date,
time and location of the meeting and opportunity to comment on the proposal
shall be mailed not less than seven (7) days before the hearing to each owner
of property located within two hundred feet (200') of the subject property,
addressed to the owner's mailing address appearing on the rolls of the Delaware
County Assessor.
   3.   Application Requirements. An application for a parcel combination or
lot combination shall include the following:
      A.   An application form as provided by the City Manager.
      B.   Legal descriptions of the parcels and lots as they exist prior to
the combination.
      C.   A map depicting the existing and proposed property boundaries and
existing uses on the properties.
      D.   The application shall confirm that the resulting parcel or lot will
be held in common ownership, unless subsequently subdivided or otherwise
approved by the city in accordance with the requirements of law.
      E.   Any other information the City Manager determines necessary to
review the application.
   4.   Standards for Approval. The City Council shall approve a proposed
parcel combination or lot combination application if it meets the following
standards:
      A. The combination results in only one parcel or lot without any remnant
parcels.
      B.   The combination does not create any violation of lot or development
standards under the land use ordinance. If the existing parcel or lot is
nonconforming, the combination does not increase the nonconformity.
      C.   All parcels or lots subject to the combination are under common
ownership, and the property owner has agreed to the combination.
      D.   The legal descriptions are accurate and conform with legal
requirements and professional standards as determined by the City Engineer.
      E.   The deed and agreement are legally sufficient to effect the
combination as determined by the City Attorney.
   5.   Recording Instrument. The applicant for a parcel combination or lot
combination shall record with the County Recorder an agreement that includes
the following:
      A. A notice of approval signed by the City Manager.
      B.   The notarized signature of the property owner.
      C.   The legal descriptions of the original parcels or lots.
      D.   A n agreement, signed by the property owner, that the resulting
parcel or lot will be held in common ownership unless subsequently subdivided
or otherwise approved by the city in accordance with the requirements of law.
   6.   Restoration of Combined Lots. Once combined, parcels may not be
restored except through approval of a subdivision plat.
(Ord. 015-2024 – Aug. 25 Supp.)
APPENDIX
USE AND MAINTENANCE OF THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
The following information is provided to assist in the use and proper
maintenance of this Code of Ordinances.
DISTRIBUTION OF COPIES
      1.   OFFICIAL COPY. The “OFFICIAL COPY” of the Code of Ordinances must be
kept by the City Clerk and should be identified as the “OFFICIAL COPY.”
      2.   DISTRIBUTION. Other copies of the Code of Ordinances should be made
available to all persons having a relatively frequent and continuing need to
have access to ordinances which are in effect in the City as well as reference
centers such as the City Library, County Law Library, and perhaps the schools.
      3.   SALE. The sale or distribution of copies in a general fashion is not
recommended as experience indicates that indiscriminate distribution tends to
result in outdated codes being used or misused.
      4.   RECORD OF DISTRIBUTION. The City Clerk should be responsible for
maintaining an accurate and current record of persons having a copy of the Code
of Ordinances. Each official, elected or appointed, should return to the City,
upon leaving office, all documents, records and other materials pertaining to
the office, including this Code of Ordinances.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 372.13[4])
NUMBERING OF ORDINANCES
AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
It is recommended that a simple numerical sequence be used in assigning
ordinance numbers to ordinances as they are passed. For example, if the
ordinance adopting the Code of Ordinances is No. 163, we would suggest that the
first ordinance passed changing, adding to, or deleting from the Code be
assigned the number 164, the next ordinance be assigned the number 165, and so
on. We advise against using the Code of Ordinances numbering system for the
numbering of ordinances.
RETENTION OF AMENDING ORDINANCES
Please note that two books should be maintained: (1) the Code of Ordinances;
and (2) an ordinance book. We will assist in the maintenance of the Code of
Ordinances book, per the Supplement Agreement, by revising and returning
appropriate pages for the Code of Ordinances book as required to accommodate
ordinances amending the Code. The City Clerk is responsible for maintaining the
ordinance book and must be sure that an original copy of each ordinance
adopted, bearing the signatures of the Mayor and Clerk, is inserted in the
ordinance book and preserved in a safe place.
SUPPLEMENT RECORD
A record of all supplements prepared for the Code of Ordinances is provided in
the front of the Code. This record will indicate the number and date of the
ordinances adopting the original Code and of each subsequently adopted
ordinance which has been incorporated in the Code. For each supplemented
ordinance, the Supplement Record will list the ordinance number, date, topic,
and chapter or section number of the Code affected by the amending ordinance. A
periodic review of the Supplement Record and ordinances passed will assure that
all ordinances amending the Code have been incorporated therein.
DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPLEMENTS
Supplements containing revised pages for insertion in each Code will be sent to
the Clerk. It is the responsibility of the Clerk to see that each person having
a Code of Ordinances receives each supplement so that each Code may be properly
updated to reflect action of the Council in amending the Code.
AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
The Code of Ordinances contains most of the laws of the City as of the date of
its adoption and is continually subject to amendment to reflect changing
policies of the Council, mandates of the State, or decisions of the Courts.
Amendments to the Code of Ordinances can only be accomplished by the adoption
of an ordinance.
