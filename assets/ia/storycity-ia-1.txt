10.03 Eligibility
10.01   PURPOSE.  
The purpose of this chapter is to provide for a property tax exemption for
shell buildings constructed by community development organizations, not-for-
profit cooperative associations under Chapter 499 of the Code of Iowa, or for-
profit entities for speculative purposes in accordance with Section 427.1 of
the Code of Iowa.
10.02   DEFINITIONS.
For use in this chapter the following terms are defined:
   1.   “Community development organization” means a City organization or a
multi-community group formed for one or more of the following purposes:
      A.   To promote, stimulate, develop, and advance the business prosperity
and economic welfare of the community, area, or region and its citizens.
      B.   To encourage and assist the location of new business and industry.
      C.   To rehabilitate and assist existing business and industry.
      D.   To stimulate and assist in the expansion of business activity.
For purposes of this definition, a community development organization must have
at least 15 members with representation from the government at the level or
levels corresponding to the community development organization’s area of
operation; a private sector lending institution; a community organization in
the area; business in the area; and private citizens in the community, area, or
region.
   2.   “New construction” means new buildings or structures and includes new
buildings or structures that are constructed as additions to existing buildings
or structures. “New construction” also includes reconstruction or renovation of
an existing building or structure that constitutes complete replacement of an
existing building or structure or refitting of an existing building or
structure, if the reconstruction or renovation of the existing building or
structure is required due to economic obsolescence, if the reconstruction or
renovation is necessary to implement recognized industry standards for the
manufacturing or processing of products, and the reconstruction or renovation
is required in order to competitively manufacture or process products or for
community development organizations, not-for-profit cooperative associations
under Chapter 499 of the Code of Iowa, or for-profit entities to market a
building or structure as a speculative shell building, which determination must
receive prior approval from the Council.
   3.   “Speculative shell building” means a building or structure owned and
constructed or reconstructed by a community development organization, a not-
for-profit cooperative association under Chapter 499 of the Code of Iowa, or a
for-profit entity without a tenant or buyer for the purpose of attracting an
employer or user that will complete the building to the employer’s or user’s
specification for manufacturing, processing, or warehousing the employer’s or
user’s product line.
10.03   ELIGIBILITY.
The new construction of shell buildings by the community development
organization, not-for-profit cooperative association under Chapter 499 of the
Code of Iowa, or for-profit entity for speculative purposes is eligible for
property tax exemption. The exemption shall be for one of the following:
   1.   The value added by new construction of a shell building or addition to
an existing building or structure.
   2.   The value of an existing building being reconstructed or renovated, and
the value of the land on which the building is located, if the reconstruction
or renovation constitutes complete replacement or refitting of the existing
building or structure.
10.04   WHEN EFFECTIVE.
   1.   If the exemption is for a project described in subsection 1 of Section
10.03, the exemption shall be effective for the assessment year in which the
building is first assessed for property taxation or the assessment year in
which the addition to an existing building first adds value. If the exemption
is for a project described in subsection 2 of Section
10.03, the exemption shall be effective for the assessment year following the
assessment year in which the project commences. An exemption allowed under this
section shall be allowed for all subsequent years until the property is leased
or sold or until the exemption is terminated by ordinance of the City Council.
   2.   Eligibility for an exemption as a speculative shell building shall be
determined as of January 1 of the assessment year. However, an exemption shall
not be granted for a speculative shell building of a not-for-profit cooperative
association under Chapter 499 of the Code of Iowa, or a for-profit entity if
the building is used by the cooperative association, or for-profit entity or a
subsidiary or majority owners thereof for other than as a speculative shell
building. If the shell building or any portion of the shell building is leased
or sold, the portion of the shell building that is leased or sold and a
proportionate share of the land on which it is located, if applicable, shall
not be entitled to an exemption under this section for subsequent years. Upon
the sale of the shell building, the shell building shall be considered new
construction for purposes of Section 427B.1 of the Code of Iowa if used for
purposes set forth in Section 427B.1.
10.05   APPLICATION.
   1.   If the speculative shell building project is a project described in
subsection 1 of Section
10.03, an application shall be filed pursuant to Section 427B.4 of the Code of
Iowa.
   2.   If the speculative shell building project is a project described in
subsection 2 of Section
10.03, an application shall be filed pursuant to Section 427.1(27) of the Code

the leaks and spills of hazardous substances, these regulations are promulgated
to establish responsibility for the treatment, removal and cleanup of hazardous
substance spills within the City limits.
36.02   DEFINITIONS.
For purposes of this chapter the following terms are defined:
   1.   “Cleanup” means actions necessary to contain, collect, control,
identify, analyze, clean up, treat, disperse, remove, or dispose of a hazardous
substance.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[1])
   2.   “Hazardous condition” means any situation involving the actual,
imminent, or probable spillage, leakage, or release of a hazardous substance
onto the land, into a water of the State, or into the atmosphere which creates
an immediate or potential danger to the public health or safety or to the
environment.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[4])
   3.   “Hazardous substance” means any substance or mixture of substances that
presents a danger to the public health or safety and includes, but is not
limited to, a substance that is toxic, corrosive, or flammable, or that is an
irritant or that generates pressure through decomposition, heat, or other
means. “Hazardous substance” may include any hazardous waste identified or
listed by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection
Agency under the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended by the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, or any toxic pollutant listed under
section 307 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as amended to January 1,
1977, or any hazardous substance designated under Section 311 of the Federal

   4.   “Responsible person” means a person who at any time produces, handles,

(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[7])
36.03   CLEANUP REQUIRED.
Whenever a hazardous condition is created by the deposit, injection, dumping,
spilling, leaking or placing of a hazardous substance, so that the hazardous
substance or a constituent of the hazardous substance may enter the environment
or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters, including ground
waters, the responsible person shall cause the condition to be remedied by a
cleanup, as defined in the preceding section, as rapidly as feasible to an
acceptable, safe condition. The costs of cleanup shall be borne by the
responsible person. If the responsible person does not cause the cleanup to
begin in a reasonable time in relation to the hazard and circumstances of the
incident, the City may, by an authorized officer, give reasonable notice, based
on the character of the hazardous condition, said notice setting a deadline for
accomplishing the cleanup and stating that the City will proceed to procure
cleanup services and bill the responsible person for all costs associated with
the cleanup if the cleanup is not accomplished within the deadline. In the
event that it is determined that immediate cleanup is necessary as a result of
the present danger to the public health, safety and welfare, then no notice
shall be required and the City may proceed to procure the cleanup and bill the
responsible person for all costs associated with the cleanup. If the bill for
those services is not paid within thirty (30) days, the City Attorney shall
proceed to obtain payment by all legal means. If the cost of the cleanup is
beyond the capacity of the City to finance it, the authorized officer shall
report to the Council and immediately seek any State or Federal funds available

evacuate people from the area threatened by a hazardous condition caused by the
person.

condition caused by that person, including the costs of assessing the injury,
destruction or loss.
   4.   The excessive and extraordinary cost incurred by the City or the agents
of the City in responding at and to the scene of a hazardous condition caused
that that person.

   1.   A person manufacturing, storing, handling, transporting, or disposing
of a hazardous substance shall notify the State Department of Natural Resources
and the Police Chief of the occurrence of a hazardous condition as soon as
possible but not later than six (6) hours after the onset of the hazardous
condition or discovery of the hazardous condition. The Police Chief shall

  in fact exist. If compliance is not secured following notice and hearings, we

the premises or in any parking lots or areas, including but not limited to
public rights-of-way, adjacent to the premises:

all times.
96.07   SEWER TAP.
Connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the “Y”
branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If no properly
located “Y” branch is available, a saddle “Y” shall be installed at the
location specified by the Superintendent. The public sewer shall be tapped with
a tapping machine and a saddle appropriate to the type of public sewer shall be
glued or attached with a gasket and stainless steel clamps to the sewer. At no
time shall a building sewer be constructed so as to enter a manhole unless
special written permission is received from the Superintendent and in
accordance with the Superintendent’s direction if such connection is approved.
96.08   INSPECTION REQUIRED.
All connections with the sanitary sewer system before being covered shall be
inspected and approved, in writing, by the Superintendent. As soon as all pipe
work from the public sewer to inside the building has been completed, and
before any backfilling is done, the Superintendent shall be notified and the
Superintendent shall inspect and test the work as to workmanship and material;
no sewer pipe laid under ground shall be covered or trenches filled until after
the sewer has been so inspected and approved. If the Superintendent refuses to
approve the work, the plumber or owner must proceed immediately to correct the
work.
96.09   PROPERTY OWNER’S RESPONSIBILITY.
All costs and expenses incident to the installation, connection, and
maintenance of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall
indemnify the City from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be
occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.

of official notice from the Council of such violation. If not made within such
time, the Council shall, in addition to the other penalties herein provided,
have the right to finish and correct the work and assess the cost thereof to
the property owner. Such assessment shall be collected with and in the same
manner as general property taxes.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[3])
96.11   TIMBERLAND RIDGE CONNECTION FEE DISTRICT.
   1.   Definitions. The following terms are defined for use in this chapter:
      A.   "Benefitted service area" means a designated area to which sanitary
sewer service will be provided by a sanitary sewer utility of a given design
and capacity.
      B.   "Connection" means any act that results in a direct or indirect
discharge into the Sanitary Sewer Utility, including (but not limited to) the
connection of a private sewer system to a lateral sewer, force main or manhole
or the connection of a lateral sewer serving a subdivision to a trunk sewer,
force main or manhole.
      C.   "Lot" means a parcel of land under one ownership. Two or more
contiguous parcels under common ownership may be treated as one lot for the
purposes of this chapter if the parcels bear common improvements or if the
Council finds that the parcels have been assembled into a single unit for the
purpose of use or development.
      D.   "Sanitary Sewer Utility" means and includes sanitary sewer trunk
lines and sanitary sewer interceptors, sanitary sewer force mains, pumping
stations and detention basins of the City.

serviced by force main that reside along the west side of Timberland Drive.
Said properties will require additional individual or regional pump stations to
discharge to the existing force main along said Timberland Drive and are not
serviced by gravity sewer that drains to the Timberland Ridge Pump Station,
located near the SW corner of the Timberland Ridge Subdivision.
   2.   District Establishment Policy.
      A.   Cost Recovery. The City Council, through a Developer's Agreement
with the Developer for Timberland Ridge Subdivision, and after public notice
and hearing as prescribed by law, has determined the necessity of establishing
sanitary sewer connection fee districts and the imposition of fees for
connection to the Sanitary Sewer Utility upon each person who owns property in
said areas and will be served by connection to the Sanitary Sewer Utility.
      B.   Intent. It is the intent of the City to define connection fees and a
connection fee district to allow the Timberland Ridge Developer to recover 100%
of the original cost of constructing sanitary sewer utilities to serve the
properties in the connection fee district.
   3.   Lots Outside City Limits. For lots outside the City limits, with the
application for connection, owners shall also be required to execute a service
contract with the City for their use of the Sanitary Sewer Utility.
   4.   Contiguous Parcels. If the owner of two contiguous parcels affected by
this chapter desires to make a connection to the Sanitary Sewer Utility that
will serve only one such parcel, and the parcels do not bear common
improvements and have not been assembled into a single unit for the purpose of
use or development, the owner may make application to the City Council to
connect to each such parcel separately. If the Council finds that the parcels
do not bear common improvements and have not been assembled into a single unit
for the purpose of use or development, the original connection fee shall be
calculated and paid only upon the parcel or parcels that will be served by the
connection. A new application must be filed, and a connection fee paid, when
the parcel or parcels not served by the original connection to the Sanitary
Sewer Utility are connected.
   5.   Additional Fee. Connection fees collected by the City Treasurer shall
be used only for the purpose of operating, or paying debt of, the Sanitary
Sewer Utility. The sewer connection fees established by this section are in
addition to, and not in lieu of, any other fees for connection required under
the State Plumbing Code, other provisions of this Code of Ordinances, or City
policy. The property owner paying a connection fee will be responsible for the
full cost of providing any necessary sanitary sewer extensions or services
lines from the private property improvements or buildings to the trunk sewers
and/or force mains being constructed as part of the project.
   6.   Illegal Connections; City Authority. In the event a connection is made
to the Sanitary Sewer Utility serving the connection fee district without the
permit required by this chapter, or without payment of the connection fees set
forth in this chapter, or if any installment payment of such fee as provided by
subsequent resolution of the Council is not made, the City shall disconnect
such service from the Sanitary Sewer Utility until such time as the property
owner has received a permit for the connection and paid the required connection
fee. In addition, the City may pursue any other remedy allowed by law.
   7.   Timberland Ridge Connection Fee District.

and payment of the sanitary sewer connection fee as established in the above
fee schedule.
         (5)   The owner of any parcel being used as a public or nonprofit
recreational or park facility upon the effective date of this section may apply
for connection upon annexation to the City and payment of a single-acre
sanitary sewer connection fee. Any future development of said parcel shall
require a revised application for connection and payment of the sanitary sewer
connection fee as established herein.
         (6)   The sanitary sewer connection fee for existing single-family
residences on land that cannot be subdivided further, due to restrictions
imposed by applicable zoning laws or regulations, is hereby set at $1,100.00,
subject to the Adjustment Schedule as defined herein.
      C.   Adjustment Schedule. The connection fees (per acre and per unit)
shall be imposed per Table 1 and shall have an effective date hereof through
June 30, 2021. The per acre and per unit connection fee shall be adjusted
annually as of July 1 of each calendar year based on the change in the
Engineering News-Record (ENR) construction cost index for the one year period
ending in April of the calendar year in which the adjustment is made. The City
Administrator shall determine the applicable connection fees for each
established connection fee district and the City Clerk shall maintain on file
the connection fees in each connection fee district effective July 1 of each
calendar year.
      D.   Effect of Schedule. The sanitary sewer connection fees herein shall
remain in force and effect until such time that the City Council adopts a
resolution to adjust the sanitary sewer connection fees applicable to the
Timberland Ridge Connection Fee District. Nothing herein is intended to
restrict the City Council from an adjustment of the sanitary sewer connection
fee schedule to reflect future construction costs.
      E.   Waiver of Requirements: The City Council reserves the right to waive
or modify to a lesser degree any provision or requirement contained in this
section provided said waiver or modification does not adversely affect the
intent of these regulations to adequately meet the requirements of the

sewers for their maintenance and repair.
   12.   Damaging Substances. Any waters, wastes, materials, or substances that
react with water or wastes in the sewer system to release noxious gases,
develop color of undesirable intensity, form suspended solids in objectionable
concentration or create any other condition deleterious to structures and
treatment processes.
   13.   Untreatable Wastes. Waters or wastes containing substances that are
not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes
employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage
treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having
jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.
97.04   RESTRICTED DISCHARGES – POWERS.
If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the
public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in Section
97.03 and which in the judgment of the Superintendent may have a deleterious
effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or
which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the
Superintendent may:
   1.   Rejection. Reject the wastes by requiring disconnection from the public
sewage system;
   2.   Pretreatment. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for
discharge to the public sewers;
   3.   Controls Imposed. Require control over the quantities and rates of
discharge; and/or
   4.   Special Charges. Require payment to cover the added cost of handling
and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under
the provisions of
Chapter 99.
97.05   SPECIAL FACILITIES.
If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows,
the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the Superintendent and subject to the requirements of
all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws. Where preliminary treatment or
flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be
maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at
the owner’s expense.
97.06   CONTROL MANHOLES.
When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner’s
expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
97.07   TESTING OF WASTES.
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from
periodic grab samples).
97.08   FATS, OILS, AND GREASE CONTROL PROGRAM.
The purpose of this section shall be to aid in the prevention of sanitary sewer
blockages and obstructions from contribution and accumulation of Fats, Oils,
and Grease (FOG) into the Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW). Such
discharges from commercial kitchens, restaurants, and all other food service
establishments, where FOG of vegetable or animal origin is discharged directly
or indirectly into the POTW, can contribute to line blockages and/or spills in
violation of Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations 40 CFR, Part 403, as it may
be amended from time to time.
   1.   Any customer which operates a Food Service Establishment (FSE) or
Mobile Food Unit licensed by the State of Iowa, and which is connected to the
City’s treatment works, shall be subject to the FOG Control Program.
   2.   Any costs for compliance with the regulations set forth in the FOG
Control Program shall be the responsibility of the customer. The FSE shall have
grease interceptor(s) professionally inspected by a certified inspector on an
annual basis.
   3.   FSEs subject to the FOG Control Program may apply for exemption from
the Restaurant Surcharge/Restaurant Fee. Exemptions shall utilize evidence
gathered in the preceding six (6) month period to determine whether an FSE is
exempt from the Restaurant Surcharge/Restaurant Fee for sewer bills mailed
during the following six (6) month period. Exemption periods shall be from
January to June and from July to December. Maintenance records shall be
submitted to the City on January 5 and July 5 each year.
   4.   The use of any additive into a grease interceptor, grease trap, or
other on-premise plumbing for the purpose of “treating” FOG shall be prohibited
unless prior approval is granted by the Wastewater Superintendent or designee.
      A.   FSE’s who wish to use any additives must submit a request in
writing. Each site wishing to use a product must obtain separate approval.
Approval is not granted to use any product unless and until written approval is
granted by the City.
      B.   A Safety Data Sheet (SDS) must be submitted to the Wastewater
Superintendent, or designee, for approval of the product. The SDS, or other
information submitted, must identify all active and inactive ingredients of the
products. Materials that include “confidential” or “proprietary” components
will not be approved.
      C.   To be approved, products must be composed of non-emulsifying active
biological additives designed to decompose the grease in the grease trap or
grease interceptor.
         (1)   Products that serve to simply “disperse” FOG, or that act by
allowing FOG to be more easily discharged from FOG control devices will not be
approved.
         (2)   Examples of products that are not approved are those that
include, but are not limited to, the following types of components:
            (i)   Enzymes
            (ii)   Solvents
            (iii)   Surfactants
            (iv)   Dispersants
            (v)   Other products that act on grease “chemically” as opposed to
“biologically”
            (vi)   Other components that are deemed to be otherwise
incompatible with the purpose of the FOG Control Program or the municipal
sewerage system.
      D.   Approval of a product may be revoked by the Wastewater
Superintendent or designee if pass-through of FOG or other problems in the
collection system of treatment plant occurs.
      E.   Aeration, agitation, or stirring of grease traps or grease
interceptors shall not occur at any time.
      F.   Approval of any additive shall not be construed as approval to
modify any plumbing. Any changes or modifications necessary shall be
conditioned upon receipt of a plumbing permit from the City.
      G.   Approval of any additive shall not be construed as an endorsement by
the City of the effectiveness of the product. The FSE assumes all
responsibility for the performance and effectiveness of the product.
      H.   Servicing frequencies for grease control equipment must still comply
with the other requirements of this ordinance.
      I.   Should the make-up or composition of any approved product change, a
new approval must be granted by the Wastewater Superintendent or designee.
   5.   The Wastewater Superintendent, or designee, may exempt an FSE from the
Restaurant Surcharge/Restaurant Fee for a six (6) month period if one of the
following criteria is met during the preceding six (6) month period:
      A.   Submission of records of grease interceptor cleanings occurring in
the previous six (6) months. If a grease interceptor is not cleaned during the
previous six (6) months, the reason(s) for this must be submitted to and
approved by the Wastewater Superintendent or designee. Such records shall
include the following information:
         (1)   The name and employer of the individual performing the grease
interceptor cleaning(s).
         (2)   The date(s) on which grease was removed from each grease
interceptor controlled by the customer.
         (3)   The quantity of grease removed during each cleaning.
            (i)   In the case of a gravity-flow grease interceptor, the
quantity of grease shall be calculated by comparing the depth of the floating
fats, oils, and grease, plus the depth of the accumulated solids, and dividing
that depth by the total depth of the unit (the design liquid level), expressed
as a percentage. The measurements shall be taken in the compartment nearest the
inlet of a multi-compartment grease interceptor and in the interceptor
immediately preceding connection to the sanitary sewer when more than one
interceptor is installed in series, and in all interceptors when more than once
interceptor is installed in parallel. In instances where an interceptor
requires cleaning multiple times during the six (6) month review period,
records shall be submitted for each cleanout. The owner or operator of the FSE
shall require the grease interceptor to be cleaned when FOG and solids reach
25% or less of the design liquid level of the grease interceptor. When multiple
cleanouts are required during a review period, the level of FOG and solids from
each cleanout shall average 25% or less and no single instance shall equal or
exceed 35%.
            (ii)   In the case of a hydromechanical grease interceptor, the
quantity of grease shall be calculated by comparing the depth of the floating
fats, oils, and grease, plus the depth of the accumulated solids, and dividing
that depth by the total depth of the unit (the design liquid level), expressed
as a percentage. The measurements shall be taken in the compartment nearest the
inlet of a multi-compartment grease interceptor, in the interceptor immediately
preceding connection to the sanitary sewer when more than one interceptor is
installed in series, and in all interceptors when more than once interceptor is
installed in parallel. In instances where an interceptor requires cleaning
multiple times during the six (6) month review period, records shall be
submitted for each cleanout. The owner or operator of the FSE shall require the
grease interceptor to be cleaned when FOG and solids reach 25% or less of the
design liquid level of the grease interceptor. When multiple cleanouts are
required during a review period, the level of FOG and solids from each cleanout
shall average 25% or less and no single instance shall equal or exceed 35%. In
situations where a hydromechanical grease interceptor is not able to be
measured prior to cleanout, it shall be required that the interceptor be
cleaned on a monthly basis.
         (4)   Verification that the place of disposal of hauled grease is a
facility designed for such a purpose and is licensed or certified in accordance
with local, state, and federal regulations, as appropriate.
         (5)   Verification that the method of transporting hauled grease is
appropriate for such a purpose and complies with local, state, and federal
regulations, as appropriate.
         (6)   Verification that any grease interceptor from which grease is
removed is inspected and found to be in proper working order. This inspection
shall include verification that the sanitary “tees” on the inlet and outlet
sides of the grease interceptor are not obstructed, loose, or missing,
verification that any baffles are secure and in place, verification that no
cracks or defects in the tank are present, and verification that lids are
securely and properly seated following completion of the cleaning. If any
component of the grease interceptor is not in proper working order, records
shall indicate what defect(s) exist and when, how, and by whom such defect(s)
are remedied.
      B.   Submission of a laboratory test to determine the oil and grease
content of typical wastewater discharge. Such tests shall be conducted by a
laboratory certified by the State of Iowa to test oil and grease under the
procedures specified in Chapter 567.83 of the Iowa Administrative Code.
Laboratory tests shall conform to the following conditions:
         (1)   The sample shall be obtained by use of a “grab sampling” method,
in which the sample flask is held under a free-flowing outfall of water from a
sampling port designed for such uses.
         (2)   Staff of the Wastewater Department shall select the date and
time during which a sample may be obtained, the timing of which shall be
selected to coincide with a peak customer demand.
         (3)   The sample shall not exceed 300 mg/L oil and grease.
         (4)   The FSE shall also be required to meet the same requirements as
defined in Sec. 97.08(5)(a).
      C.   Submission of kitchen best management practices records that detail
the grease control activities in the FSE.
Such records shall be spot-checked for compliance by the Wastewater Department.
The records shall at all times be kept and maintained on a day-to-day basis,
and records shall be kept secure at the premises of the FSE for a continuous
period of at least three years. The records shall document the following
activities:
         (1)   Each cleaning of the FSE’s grease interceptor(s). The FSE shall
be required to meet the same requirements as are defined in Sec. 97.08(5)(a).
         (2)   Training held for the FSE’s staff regarding practices that will
reduce the introduction of FOG into the sanitary sewer.
         (3)   Self-inspection for presence and proper use of drain screens,
clean and grease-free nature of exhaust hood equipment, and presence of spill
clean-up kits, warning signage over sinks regarding FOG practices, and
informational posters regarding FOG.
         (4)   Records of the date, time, quantity, and location of
introduction of any additive. A copy of the approval granted by the Wastewater
Department shall be kept with the logbook.
         (5)   Any other activities undertaken by the FSE’s staff to prevent or
mitigate the introduction of FOG into the treatment works or into the
environment.
   6.   Cleaning.
      A.   Cleaning of a hydromechanical grease interceptor may be performed by
food service establishment staff. Documentation of any cleaning must include
all information required for compliance with the FOG Control Program.
      B.   Cleaning of a gravity-flow grease interceptor must be performed by a
contractor that specializes in the disposal of restaurant grease.
   7.   The Wastewater Superintendent may, upon finding evidence of accumulated
FOG in the treatment works, authorize an inspection of any FSE that may
reasonably be believed to have introduced that accumulation of FOG.
Such inspection may occur at any reasonable time and without prior
notification. Inspections shall be limited to the equipment and practices
related to the introduction of FOG and waste water into the treatment works.
The FSE shall allow the individual performing this inspection, bearing proper
credentials and identification, to enter upon or into the building, facility,
or property housing the FSE for the purpose of inspection, observation,
measurement, sampling, testing, or record review. Upon request of the
individual performing the inspection, the FSE shall open any grease interceptor
for the purpose of confirming that maintenance frequency is appropriate, that
all necessary parts of the installation are in place, and that all grease
interceptors and related equipment and piping are maintained in efficient
operating condition. Inspections may be undertaken as many times as necessary
to identify the source of FOG entering the treatment works.
   8.   Submission of incomplete records or failure to submit records as
described in Sec. 97.08(5)(a-c) shall constitute a violation of
Chapter 97. Violators are subject to a municipal infraction and recovery costs
as described in
Chapter 3 of the Story City Code of Ordinances.
(Section 97.08 – Ord. 272 – Jul. 18 Supp.)
97.09   PURPOSE.
The purpose of this ordinance is to establish rules of compliance for the
drainage systems of the various tracts of real property located within the City
of Story City, Iowa, that promote the general health, welfare and safety of its
citizens.
COMPLIANCE REGARDING WATER DISCHARGE
The drainage systems of many tracts of real property within the City have
caused storm and other water to be discharged into the public sanitary sewers.
This often results in an overload of the City's sanitary sewer disposal system,
which causes flooding of residential basements, sanitary sewage being
discharged into local streams without being fully treated, substantially
reducing the capacity of the waste water facilities, and the additional wear
and tear that is placed on the City's wastewater treatment plant.
   1.   Mandatory Compliance for Sump Pump.
      A.   Duty to Inspect: The owner of real property shall have the duty to
inspect and test each and every tract of real property connected to the City's
waste water facilities, except for mobile homes, located within the City and to
determine whether said property complies with the sump pump, down spout and
surface drainage provisions of this ordinance. Inspections shall be certified
by an inspector approved by the City for such purposes.
      B.   Responsibility of Owners: It shall be the responsibility of the
owner of a tract of real property located within the City and connected to the
City's waste water plant to disconnect and remove from the City's sanitary
sewer system all water drainage from the said property by means of sump pumps,
downspouts, surface drainage or hoses. It shall further be the responsibility
of the owner to schedule an inspection of their property with the City or its
designated contractor upon notification from the City or its designated
contractor.
      C.   Certificate of Compliance: If the tract of real property complies
with the provisions of this ordinance as determined by the City or its
designated contractor, the owner shall receive from the approved inspector a
Certificate of Compliance, which shall be provided to the City. The City
reserves the right to re­inspect any property believed to be out of compliance
once a certificate has been provided to the City. Failure to allow the City to
re-inspect the property shall result in the costs under Section E(2) of this
ordinance to be assessed.
      D.   Cost: All costs of compliance are the responsibility of the owner of
the property.
      E.   Failure of Compliance:
         (1)   Failure on the part of the owner, tenant, or other person in
possession of a tract of real property to allow the City or its designated
contractor to inspect and test for compliance of this ordinance will be
considered in non-compliance upon notification from the City.
         (2)   Failure to comply with Section 97.09 shall result in an increase
in the monthly utility bill for that real estate. Such increase shall continue
until compliance is achieved. The amount of the increase shall be ninety
dollars ($90.00) per month.
         (3)   The City may also consider taking legal action against a
property owner who has failed to comply with Section 97.09 when such failure
causes the City to incur expenses or damages resulting from water that is
discharged into the sanitary sewer.
      F.   Voluntary inspections will be conducted during designated date and
time periods identified by the City to determine whether said property complies
with the sump pump, down spout and surface drainage provisions of this
ordinance. If a property owner schedules an inspection outside the designated

  accepted by the Company on September 23, 2015.
110.03   FRANCHISE FEES OR TAXES.
Grantor may, during the term of this franchise, in its discretion, in
compliance with and as authorized by state law, pass an ordinance imposing a
franchise fee on Grantee’s customers located within Grantor’s corporate limits;
provided, however, that the franchise fee shall not be effective, and Grantee
shall not be obligated to collect and pay same, unless and until: (1) it is
compatible with Grantee’s billing system; (2) the form of assessment and
collection of the franchise fee is based on either: (a) a percentage of
Grantee’s gross receipts of regulated sales or transportation revenues
collected from Grantee’s customers within Grantor’s corporate limits; (b) a
volumetric fee based upon Grantee’s delivery of energy within Grantor’s
corporate limits; or (c) a flat fee collected on a nondiscriminatory basis from
each of Grantee’s customers within Grantor’s corporate limits; and (3) with the
exception of Story City Muncipal Electric, Grantor has imposed a franchise fee
or similar tax or assessment in lieu of a franchise fee on all other parties,
if any, supplying energy within Grantor’s corporate limits, calculated in the
same manner as the franchise fee imposed on Grantee’s customers. Upon
satisfaction of the above requirements, Grantee shall commence collection of
Grantor’s Franchise Fee no later than ninety (90) days after the effective date
of the Franchise Fee Ordinance approved and passed by Grantor.
110.04   GOVERNING RULES AND REGULATIONS.
The franchise granted hereunder is subject to all conditions, limitations and
immunities now provided for, or as hereafter amended, and applicable to the
operations of a public utility, by local, state, or federal law. The rates to
be charged by Grantee for service within the present or future corporate limits
of Grantor and the rules and regulations regarding the character, quality and
standards of service to be furnished by Grantee, shall be under the
jurisdiction and control of such regulatory body or bodies as may, from time to
time, be vested by law with authority and jurisdiction over the rates,
regulations and quality and standards of service to be supplied by Grantee.
Provided however, should any judicial, regulatory or legislative body having
proper jurisdiction take any action that precludes Grantee from recovering from
its customers any cost associated with services provided hereunder, then
Grantee and Grantor shall renegotiate the terms of this Ordinance in accordance
with the action taken. In determining the rights and duties of the Grantee, the
terms of this Ordinance shall take precedence over any conflicting terms or
requirements contained in any other ordinance enacted by the Grantor.
110.05   PROVISION FOR INADEQUATE ENERGY SUPPLIES.
If an energy supplier is unable to furnish an adequate supply of energy due to
an emergency, an order or decision of a public regulatory body, or other acts
beyond the control of the Grantee, then the Grantee shall have the right and
authority to adopt reasonable rules and regulations limiting, curtailing or
allocating extensions of service or supply of energy to any customers or
prospective customers, and withholding the supply of energy to new customers,
provided that such rules and regulations shall be uniform as applied to each
class of customers or prospective customers, and shall be non-discriminatory as
between communities receiving service from the Grantee.
110.06   CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF GRANTEE’S FACILITIES.
Any pavements, sidewalks or curbing taken up and any and all excavations made
within the public right-of-way shall be done in such a manner as to cause only
such inconvenience to the inhabitants of Grantor and the general public as is
reasonably necessary, and repairs and replacements shall be made promptly by
Grantee, leaving such properties in as good as condition as existed immediately
prior to excavation.
If Grantor determines, after a reasonable amount of time, and with prior notice
to Grantee that Grantee has reasonably failed to repair, replace, or restore
any pavements, sidewalks, or curbing excavation in as good as condition as
existed immediately prior to excavation, then Grantor may, after confirming
with the Grantee that Grantee will not be taking further action within a
reasonable time, Grantor may make the necessary repairs, replacement, or
restorations to the excavation. Thereafter, Grantor may recover from Grantee
the actual reasonable cost of such repairs, replacements, or restorations as
are needed to leave the properties in as good as condition as existed
immediately prior to the excavation.
Grantee agrees that for the term of this franchise, it will use its best
efforts to maintain its facilities and equipment in a condition sufficient to
meet the current and future energy requirements of Grantor, its inhabitants and
industries. While maintaining its facilities and equipment, Grantee shall
obtain permits, including compliance with any of Grantor’s prior notice
requirements, as required and will fix its excavations within a commercially
reasonable time period, except that in emergency situations Grantee shall take
such immediate unilateral actions as it determines are necessary to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare; in which case, Grantee shall notify Grantor
as soon as reasonably possible. Within a reasonable time thereafter, Grantee
shall request and Grantor shall issue any permits or authorizations required by
Grantor for the actions conducted by Grantee during the emergency situation.
Grantor will give Grantee reasonable notice of plans for street improvements
where paving or resurfacing of a permanent nature is involved that affects
Grantee’s facilities. The notice shall contain the nature and character of the
improvements, the rights-of-way upon which the improvements are to be made, the
extent of the improvements, and the time when the Grantor will start the work,
and, if more than one right-of-way is involved, the order in which the work is
to proceed. The notice shall be given to the Grantee as soon as practical in
advance of the actual commencement of the work, considering seasonable working
conditions, to permit the Grantee to make any additions, alterations, or
repairs to its facilities.
110.07   EXTENSION OF GRANTEE’S FACILITIES.
Upon receipt and acceptance of a valid application for service, Grantee shall,
subject to its own economic feasibility criteria as approved by the Iowa
Utilities Board make reasonable extensions of its distribution facilities to
serve customers located within the current or future corporate limits of
Grantor. Grantee will extend its mains and pipes and operate, and maintain the
system in accordance with the applicable regulations of the Iowa Utilities
Board or its successors and Iowa law.
110.08   RELOCATION OF GRANTEE’S FACILITIES.
    If Grantor elects to change the grade of or otherwise alter any street,
alley, avenue, bridge, public right-of-way or public place for a public
purpose, unless otherwise reimbursed by federal, state or local legislative act
or governmental agency, Grantee, upon reasonable notice from Grantor, shall
remove and relocate its facilities or equipment situated in the public rights-
of-way, at the cost and expense of Grantee, if such removal is necessary to
prevent interference with Grantor’s facilities.
If Grantor orders Grantee to relocate its facilities or equipment for the
primary benefit of a commercial or private project, or as a result of the
request of a commercial or private developer or other non-public entity, and
such removal is necessary to prevent interference with such project, then
Grantee shall receive payment from the commercial or private developer or other
non-public entity for the cost of such relocation as a precondition to
relocating its facilities or equipment.
Grantor shall consider reasonable alternatives in designing its public works
projects and exercising its authority under this section so as not to
arbitrarily cause Grantee unreasonable additional expense. If alternative
public right-of-way space is available, Grantor shall also provide a reasonable
alterative location for Grantee’s facilities. Grantor shall give Grantee
written notice of an order or request to vacate a public right-of-way;
provided, however, that its receipt of such notice shall not deprive Grantee of
its right to operate and maintain its existing facilities in such public right-
of way until it (a) if applicable, receives the reasonable cost of relocating
the same and (b) obtains a reasonable public right-of-way, dedicated utility
easement, or private easement alterative location for such facilities.
110.09   CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
Grantor acknowledges that certain information it might request from Grantee
pursuant to this Ordinance may be of a proprietary and confidential nature, and
that such requests may be subject to the Homeland Security Act or other
confidentiality protections under state or federal law. If Grantee requests
that any information provided by Grantee to Grantor be kept confidential due to
its proprietary or commercial value, Grantor and its employees, agents and
representatives shall maintain the confidentiality of such information, to the
extent allowed by law. If Grantor is requested or required by legal or
administrative process to disclose any such proprietary or confidential
information, Grantor shall promptly notify Grantee of such request or
requirement so that Grantee may seek an appropriate protective order or other
relief.
110.10   FORCE MAJEURE.
It shall not be a breach or default under this Ordinance if either party fails
to perform its obligations hereunder due to force majeure. Force majeure shall
include, but not be limited to, the following: 1) physical events such as acts
of God, landslides, lightning, earthquakes, fires, freezing, storms, floods,
washouts, explosions, breakage or accident or necessity of repairs to
machinery, equipment or distribution to transmission lines; 2) acts of others
such as strikes, work-force stoppages, riots, sabotage, insurrections or wars;
3) governmental actions such as necessity for compliance with any court order,
law, statute, ordinance, executive order, or regulation promulgated by a
governmental authority having jurisdiction; and (4) any other causes, whether
of the kind herein enumerated or otherwise not reasonably within the control of
the affected party to prevent or overcome. Each party shall make reasonable
efforts to avoid force majeure and to resolve such event as promptly as
reasonably possible once it occurs in order to resume performance of its
obligations hereunder; provided, however, that this provision shall not
obligate a party to settle any labor strike.
110.11   INSURANCE.
Grantee shall maintain insurance at all times during the term of this franchise
and any extensions hereof in an adequate amount to cover and protect itself and
others to whom Grantee may be held legally liable in the performance of its
duties. Grantee shall provide Grantor with a certificate of insurance
evidencing such coverage.
110.12   HOLD HARMLESS.
Grantee, during the term of this Ordinance, agrees to save harmless Grantor
from and against all claims, demands, losses and expenses arising directly out
of the negligence of Grantee, its employees or agents, in constructing,
operating, and maintaining its distribution and transmission facilities or
equipment; provided, however, that Grantee need not save Grantor harmless from
claims, demands, losses and expenses arising out of the negligence of Grantor,
its employees or agents.
110.13   POLICE POWER.
Grantee agrees for and on behalf of itself, its lessees, successors and assigns
that all authority and rights in this chapter contained shall at all times be
subject to all rights, power and authority now or hereafter possessed by the
City to regulate the manner in which Grantee shall use the streets, alleys,
bridges and public places of the City and concerning the manner in which
Grantee shall use and enjoy the franchise herein granted.
110.14   SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.
All rights, privileges and authority granted to Grantee hereunder shall inure
to the benefit of Grantee’s lessees, successors and assigns, subject to the
terms, provisions and conditions herein contained, and all obligations imposed
upon Grantee hereunder shall be binding upon Grantee’s lessees, successors and
assigns.
110.15   NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES.
This Ordinance constitutes a franchise agreement between the Grantor and
Grantee. No provision of this Ordinance shall inure to the benefit of any third
person, including the public at large, so as to constitute any such person as a
third party beneficiary of the agreement or of any one or more of the terms
hereof, or otherwise give rise to any cause of action for any person not a
party hereto.
110.16   NON WAIVER.
Any waiver of any obligation or default under this Ordinance shall not be
construed as a waiver of any future defaults, whether of like or different
character.
110.17   EFFECTIVE DATE AND ACCEPTANCE.
This Ordinance shall become effective and be a binding contract between the
Grantor and Grantee upon its final passage and approval by Grantor, in
accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and upon Grantee’s acceptance

agreed to by the City and Grantee.

distribution system shall be those erected and maintained by such utility
companies operating within the City, provided mutually satisfactory rental
agreements can be reached. It is the City’s desire that all holders of public
franchises in the City cooperate with the Grantee and allow the Grantee the use
of their poles and pole line facilities whenever possible so that the number of
new or additional poles installed in the City may be minimized.
   2.   Grantee’s Poles. The Grantee shall have the right to erect, install,
and maintain its own towers, poles, guys, anchors, underground conduits, and
manholes as may be necessary for the proper construction and maintenance of the
antenna site, head end, and distribution system, providing that the Grantee has
at the work site the necessary City permit (or copy thereof) for scheduled
work, obtained in advance from the appropriate department of the City.
   3.   Rent of Grantee’s Poles. The Grantee shall have the right to establish
terms, conditions, and specifications governing the form, type, size, quantity,
and location of equipment of others on its poles, and shall have the further
right to charge a fair rental for attachment space or spaces occupied by the
said equipment and plant of others, except that no rent shall be paid by the
City for its attachment to the Grantee’s poles. The City shall pay any costs
incurred by the Grantee in providing space for the City’s attachments,
including any necessary rearrangements of the Grantee’s equipment and plant to
provide room for City’s attachments. Upon expiration, termination, or
revocation of a franchise, or should a Grantee wish to dispose of any of its
poles, conduit or manholes, being used by the City, the City shall have the
option to purchase them in place for their fair value.
   4.   Underground Facilities. In those areas of the City where transmission
or distribution facilities of both telephone and power companies are
underground or hereafter may be placed underground, the Grantee shall likewise
construct, operate, and maintain all of its transmission and distribution
facilities underground to the maximum extent the then existing technology
permits, in accordance with the most recent National Electrical Code, and its
successor document, as well as in conformance with all applicable State and
municipal ordinances and codes. If and when necessary, amplifiers, and/or
transformers in the Grantee’s transmission and distribution lines shall be in
appropriate housings on the surface of the ground. The Grantee shall obtain a
permit from the City for such housings and the location and construction of all
work required or pursuant to this section. Even when not required, underground
installation is preferable to the placing of additional poles.
   5.   Compliance to Codes. All transmission and distribution structures,
lines, and equipment erected by the Grantee in the City shall be located so as
not to endanger or interfere with the normal use of streets, alleys, or other
public ways and places so as to cause minimum interference with the rights or
reasonable convenience of the general public and adjoining property owners and
so as not to interfere with existing public utility installations and so as to
comply with the most recent National Electrical Code, and its successor
document, as well as in conformance with all applicable State and municipal
ordinances and codes of general applicability. In the case of any disturbance
by the Grantee or its equipment of pavement, sidewalks, driveway, lawn, or
other surfacing the Grantee shall, at its expense and in the manner required by
the City, promptly replace and restore all such surfacing to its prior or
better condition. The construction, installation, operation, maintenance, and/
or removal of the cable communications system shall meet all of the following
safety, construction, and technical specifications and codes and standards:
      ·   Occupational Safety and health Administration Regulations (OSHA);
      ·   National Electric Code;
      ·   National Electrical Safety Code (NESC);

FCC Rules and Regulations;
      ·   All Building and Zoning Codes, and all Land Use Restrictions as the
same exist or may be amended hereafter.
   6.   Interference with Other Utilities. The Grantee shall not place poles,
conduits, or other fixtures above or below ground where the same shall
interfere with any gas, electric, telephone fixtures, water hydrant, or other
utilities, and all such poles, conduits, or other fixtures above or below
ground shall be so placed as to comply with all the requirements of the City.
   7.   Moving Permits. The Grantee shall, on request of any persons holding a
moving permit issued by the City, temporarily move its wires or fixtures to
permit the moving of buildings. The expense of such temporary removal shall be
paid in advance by the person requesting the same, and the Grantee shall be
given not less than fifteen (15) working days advance notice to arrange for
such temporary changes.

supervision and direction of the City to trim trees or other natural growth
overhanging any of its cable system in the street or alley right-of-way so as
to prevent branches from coming in contact with the Grantee’s wires, cables, or
other equipment. The Grantee shall reasonably compensate the City or property
owner for any damages caused by such trimming, or shall, in its sole
discretion, and at its own cost and expense, reasonably replace all trees or
shrubs damaged as a result of any construction of the cable system undertaken
by Grantee. Such replacement shall satisfy any and all obligations Grantee may
have to the City pursuant to the terms of this section.
   9.   Service Area. The Grantee shall design and construct the cable system
in such a manner as to pass by and provide adequate tap-off facilities for

the accuracy of the franchise payment as specified in this chapter. The
acceptance of any payment shall not be construed as an accord that the amount

payable by the Grantee. All amounts paid shall be subject to audit and
recomputation by the City.

without the prior written consent of the City. Such consent as required by the
City, shall be given or denied no later than 120 days following any request and
shall not be unreasonably withheld. Prior consent shall not be required when
transferring the franchise between wholly owned subsidiaries of the same

inquire into the qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the
Grantee shall assist the City in any such inquiry. In seeking the Grantee’s
consent to any change in ownership or control, the transferee shall have the
responsibility:

         (1)   Has ever been convicted or held liable for acts involving moral
turpitude, including (but not limited to) any violation of Federal, State, or
local law or regulations, or is presently under an indictment, investigation or
complaint charging such acts;
         (2)   Has ever had a judgment in an action for fraud, deceit, or
misrepresentation entered against it, her, him, or them by any court of
competent jurisdiction; or

solvency of the proposed transferee by submitting all current financial data
for the proposed transferee which the Grantee was required to submit in its
franchise application, and such other data as the City may request, where the
same shall be audited, certified and qualified by a Certified Public
Accountant.
      C.   To establish to the satisfaction fo the City and technical
capability of the proposed transferee is such as shall enable it to maintain

the franchise shall have the right to notify the City that the financial
institution, or its designee, as approved in writing by the City, shall take
control and operate the cable system in the event of a Grantee default in its
financial obligations. Further, said financial institution shall also submit a
plan for such operation that will ensure continued service and compliance with
all franchise requirements during the term the financial institution exercises
control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise control
over the cable system for a period exceeding one year, unless extended by the
City at its discretion, but during said period of time it shall have the right
to petition the City to transfer the franchise to another Grantee. Except
insofar as the enforceability of this subsection may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar laws affecting
creditors’ rights generally, and further subject to applicable Federal, State,
or local law, if the City finds that such transfer, after considering the
legal, financial, character, technical and other public interest qualities of
the proposed transferee, is satisfactory, the City shall transfer and assign
the right and obligations of such franchise as in the public interest.
   4.   The consent or approval of the City to any transfer by the Grantee
shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the City in and to
the streets, and any transfer shall by its terms, be expressly subject to the
terms and conditions of any franchise.

all review sessions and shall be a factor to be considered in connection with
requests for rate adjustments, pursuant to FCC rules and regulations.
112.51   TESTING FOR COMPLIANCE.
The City shall have the right to compel the Grantee to test, analyze, and
report on the performance of the cable system. The City may also perform
technical tests of the cable system during reasonable times and in a manner
which does not unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of
the Grantee or the cable system in order to determine whether or not the
Grantee is in compliance with the terms hereof and applicable State or Federal
laws. Except in emergency circumstances, such tests may be undertaken only
after giving the Grantee reasonable notice thereof, not to be less than two
business days, and providing a representative of the Grantee has an opportunity
to be present during such tests. In the event that such testing demonstrates
that the Grantee has substantially failed to comply with a material requirement
hereof, the reasonable costs of such tests shall be borne by the Grantee. In
the event that such testing demonstrates that the Grantee has substantially

113.03 Report and Payment    113.07 Examination of Providers Records
113.04 Customer Notification
113.01   FRANCHISE FEE.
The City of Story City, Iowa, (hereinafter referred to as the "Municipality")
hereby establishes a franchise fee on every natural gas or electric company and
every other person, firm or corporation, their successors and assigns, owning,
operating, controlling, leasing or managing a natural gas or electric plant or
system and/or generating, manufacturing, selling, distributing or transporting
natural gas or electric (hereinafter referred to, collectively, as "Energy
Providers," each, individually, an "Energy Provider"). Energy Providers shall
collect from their customers located within the corporate limits of the
Municipality as depicted on the Map (as defined below) and pay to the City an
amount equal to one percent (1%) of gross receipts Energy Providers derive from
the sale, distribution or transportation of natural gas or electric delivered
within the present limits of the Municipality. Gross receipts as used herein
are revenues received from the sale, distribution or transportation of natural
gas or electric, after adjustment for the net write-off of uncollectible
accounts and corrections of bills theretofore rendered.
113.02   EXEMPTIONS.
The amount paid by Energy Providers shall be in lieu of, and Energy Providers
shall be exempt from, all other fees, charges, taxes or assessments which the
Municipality may impose for the privilege of doing business within the
Municipality, including, without limitation, excise taxes, occupation taxes,
licensing fees, or right-of-way permit fees, and in the event the Municipality
imposes any such fee, charge, tax or assessment, the payment to be made by
Energy Providers in accordance with this Ordinance shall be reduced in an
amount equal to any such fee, charge, tax or assessment imposed upon the Energy
Providers. Ad valorem property taxes imposed generally upon all real and
personal property within the Municipality shall not be deemed to affect Energy
Providers' obligations under this Ordinance.
113.03   REPORT AND PAYMENT.
Energy Providers shall report and pay any amount payable under this Ordinance
on a monthly basis. Such payment shall be made no more than thirty(30) days
following the close of the period for which payment is due. Initial and final
payments shall be prorated for the portions of the periods at the beginning and
end of any franchise granted by the City of Story City, Iowa, to an Energy
Provider.
113.04   CUSTOMER NOTIFICATION.
Energy Providers shall list the franchise fee collected from customers as a
separate item on bills for utility service issued to their customers. If at any
time the Iowa Utilities Board or other authority having proper jurisdiction
prohibits such recovery, Energy Providers will no longer be obligated to
collect and pay the franchise fee until an alternate lawful franchise fee can
be negotiated and implemented. In addition, with prior approval of
Municipality, Energy Providers may reduce the franchise fee payable for natural
gas or electric delivered to a specific customer when such reduction is
required to attract or retain the business of that customer.
113.05   CITY MAP.
Within ten (10) days of the date of this ordinance, the Municipality shall
provide the Energy Providers with a map of its corporate limits (the "Map").
The Map shall be of sufficient detail to assist Energy Providers in determining
whether their customers reside within the Municipality's corporate limits. The
Map along with Energy Provider's Geographic Information System ("GIS") mapping
information shall serve as the sole basis for determining Energy Provider's
obligation hereunder to collect and pay the franchise fee from customers;
provided, however, that if the Municipality's corporate limits are changed by
annexation or otherwise, it shall be the Municipality's sole responsibility to
(a) update the Map so that such changes are included therein, and (b) provide
the updated Map to the Energy Providers. An Energy Provider's obligation to
collect and pay the franchise fee from customers within an annexed area shall
not commence until the later: (a) of sixty (60) days after such Energy
Provider's receipt from the Municipality of an updated Map including such
annexed area, or (b) such time after such Energy Provider's receipt from the
Municipality of an updated Map including such annexed area as is reasonably
necessary for such Energy Provider to identify the customers in the annexed
area obligated to pay the franchise fee.
113.06   ANNEXATIONS.
The Municipality shall provide copies of annexation ordinances to Energy
Providers on a timely basis to ensure appropriate Franchise fee collection from
customers within the corporate limits of the city as set forth in Section 4
above.
113.07   EXAMINATION OF PROVIDERS RECORDS.
The Municipality shall have access to and the right to examine, during normal
business hours, Energy Provider's books, receipts, files, records and documents
as is reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of payments due hereunder;
provided, that the Municipality shall not exercise such right more than twice
per calendar year. If it is determined that a mistake was made in the payment

authority of 42 U.S.C. Sec. 5403 which was constructed on or after June 15,
1976, and is required by Federal law to display a seal from the United States

   2.   “Manufactured home community” means any site, lot, field, or tract of
land under common ownership upon which ten or more occupied manufactured homes

   3.   “Mobile home” means any vehicle without motive power used or so
manufactured or constructed as to permit its being used as a conveyance upon

more persons; but also includes any such vehicle with motive power not
registered as a motor vehicle in Iowa. A mobile home means any such vehicle
built before June 15, 1976, which was not built to a mandatory building code
and which contains no State or Federal seals.
   4.   “Mobile home park” means any site, lot, field or tract of land upon
which three (3) or more mobile homes or manufactured homes, or a combination of
any of these homes, are placed on developed spaces and operated as a for-profit

degree so as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure the tree. Trees severely
damaged by storms or other causes, or certain trees under the utility wires or
other obstructions where other pruning practices are impractical may be
exempted from this section at the determination of the Council, upon the
recommendation of the City Tree Board. Unless specifically authorized by the
City Tree Board. no person shall intentionally damage, cut, carve, transplant
or remove any tree on public property; attach any rope, wire, nail, advertising
poster or other contrivance to any tree on public property; allow any gaseous
liquid or solid substance that is harmful to such trees to come in contact with
them or with their roots; or set fire or permit any fire to burn when such fire
or the heat thereof will injure any portion of any tree on public property.

CHAPTER 157
ABATEMENT OF DANGEROUS BUILDINGS
 
157.01 Dangerous Building Defined 157.02 Enforcement
 
157.01   DANGEROUS BUILDING DEFINED.
For the purpose of this chapter, any building or structure that has any or all
of the conditions or defects hereinafter described shall be deemed to be a
dangerous building, provided that such conditions or defects exist to the
extent that the life, health, property or safety of the public or its occupants
are endangered:
   1.   Whenever any door, aisle, passageway, stairway or other means of exit
is not of sufficient width or size or is not so arranged as to provide safe and
adequate means of exit in case of fire or panic.
   2.   Whenever the walking surface of any aisle, passageway, stairway or
other means of exit is so warped, worn, loose, torn or otherwise unsafe as to
not provide safe and adequate means of exit in case of fire or panic.
   3.   Whenever the stress in any materials, member or portion thereof, due to
all dead and live loads, is more than one and one half times the working stress
or stresses allowed in the Building Code for new buildings of similar
structure, purpose or location.
   4.   Whenever any portion thereof has been damaged by fire, earthquake, wind
or flood or by any other cause, to such an extent that the structural strength
or stability thereof is materially less than it was before such catastrophe and
is less than the minimum requirements of the Building Code for new.
   5.   Whenever any portion or member or appurtenance thereof is likely to
fail, or to become detached or dislodged, or to collapse and thereby injure
persons or damage property.
   6.   Whenever any portion or any member, appurtenance or ornamentation on
the exterior thereof is not of sufficient strength or stability, or is not so
anchored, attached or fastened in place so as to be capable of resisting a wind
pressure of one half of that specified in the Building Code for new buildings
of similar structure, purpose or location without exceeding the working
stresses permitted in the Building Code for such buildings.
   7.   Whenever any portion thereof has wracked, warped, buckled or settled to
such an extent that walls or other structural portions have materially less
resistance to winds or earthquakes than is required in the case of similar new
construction.
   8.   Whenever the building or structure, or any portion thereof, because of
(i) dilapidation, deterioration or decay, (ii) faulty construction; (iii) the
removal, movement or instability of any portion of the ground necessary for the
supporting of such building; (iv) the deterioration, decay or inadequacy of its
foundation; or (v) any other cause, is likely to partially or completely
collapse.
   9.   Whenever, for any reason, the building or structure, or any portion
thereof, is manifestly unsafe for the purpose for which it is being used.
   10.   Whenever the exterior walls or other vertical structural members list,
lean or buckle to such an extent that a plumb line passing through the center
of gravity does not fall inside the middle one third of the base.
   11.   Whenever the building or structure, exclusive of the foundation, shows
33 percent or more damage or deterioration of its supporting member or members,
or 50 percent damage or deterioration of its non-supporting members, enclosing
or outside walls or coverings.
   12.   Whenever the building or structure has been so damaged by fire, wind,
earthquake or flood, or has become so dilapidated or deteriorated as to become
(i) an attractive nuisance to children; (ii) a harbor for vagrants, criminals,
or immoral persons, or as to (iii) enable persons to resort thereto for the
purpose of committing unlawful or immoral acts.
   13.   Whenever any building or structure has been constructed, exists or is
maintained in violation of any specific requirements or prohibition applicable
to such building or structure provided by the building regulations of the City,
as specified in the Building Code or of any law or ordinance of this state or
City relating to the condition, location or structure of buildings.
   14.   Whenever any building or structure that, whether or not erected in
accordance with all applicable laws and ordinances, has in any non-supporting
part, member or portion less than 50 percent, or in any supporting part, member
or portion less than 66 percent of the (i) strength, (ii) fire-resisting
qualities or characteristics, or (iii) weather-resisting qualities or
characteristics required by law in the case of a newly constructed building of
like area, height and occupancy in the same location.
   15.   Whenever a building or structure, used or intended to be used for
dwelling purposes, because of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, decay,
damage, faulty construction or arrangement, inadequate light, air or sanitation
facilities, or otherwise, is determined by the Health Officer to be unsanitary,
unfit for human habitation or in such a condition that is likely to cause
sickness or disease.
   16.   Whenever any building or structure, because of obsolescence,
dilapidated condition, deterioration, damage, inadequate exits, lack of
sufficient fire-resistive construction, faulty electric wiring, gas connections
or heating apparatus, or other cause, is determined by the Fire Marshal to be a
fire hazard.
   17.   Whenever any building or structure is in such a condition as to
constitute a public nuisance known to the common law or in equity
jurisprudence.
   18.   Whenever any portion of a building or structure remains on a site
after the demolition or destruction of the building or structure or whenever
any building or structure is abandoned for a period in excess of six months so
as to constitute such building or portion thereof an attractive nuisance or
hazard to the public.
157.02   ENFORCEMENT.
   1.   Administration. The Building Official or Fire Chief are authorized to
conduct inspections and take any other actions to carry out and enforce the
provisions of this chapter relating to dangerous buildings.
   2.   Abatement. All buildings or portions thereof which are on inspection
determined to be dangerous, as provided in Section
157.01 above, are hereby declared to be public nuisances and shall be abated by
repair, rehabilitation, vacating, securing against entry, demolition or removal
in accordance with procedures set forth herein.
   3.   Notice and Order. When the Building Official or other inspector has
determined that a building is dangerous, the Building Official shall give a
notice of that determination and order of abatement directed to the owner of
record, by certified mail, and shall post a copy of the notice conspicuously on
the property.
   4.   Contents of Abatement Order. The order shall identify the problems
found and set forth a plan of abatement for the dangerous building. The
Building Official may include in the plan the requirement that the owner
furnish to the Building Official an engineering report, structural study or
other professionally credentialed evidence for the purpose of determining an
appropriate plan of abatement. The order shall set a date for commencement and
completion of the plan.
   5.   Failure to Obey Abatement Order. If any order of the Building Official
has not been complied with, the Building Official may cause the person to be
prosecuted or institute actions to abate the building as a public nuisance by
securing against entry, repair or demolition.
   6.   Appeals. The owner may take an appeal to the City Board of Adjustment
where it is alleged that the Building Official erred in the determination that
a building is dangerous or where the Building Official rejects or refuses to
approve the mode or manner of construction or material to be used in the repair
or abatement of a dangerous building.
      A.   Hearing. A hearing will be held in accordance with normal Board
hearing procedures.
      B.   Standards. In determining whether a building is dangerous, the Board
shall consider whether a building or structure has any or all of the conditions
set forth in Section
157.01 of this chapter and Section 115 of the IBC to the extent that the life,
health, property or safety of the public or its occupants are endangered. In
considering alternative materials and methods of construction, the Board may
approve any alternate if it finds that the proposed design is satisfactory and
that the material, method or work offered is, for the purpose intended, at
least the equivalent of that prescribed in the Building Code in quality,
strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, durability and safety. Also, the
Board shall require that sufficient evidence or proof be submitted to
substantiate any claim that may be made regarding the use of alternatives.
      C.   Failure to Obey Order. When a decision or order of the Board becomes
final, and is not complied with, the Building Official may cause the person to
be prosecuted or institute actions to abate the building as a public nuisance
by securing against entry, repair or demolition.
      D.   Recovery of Cost. An estimate of the cost of the proposed work
needed to abate the nuisance shall be obtained and presented to the Board.
Should the decision of the Building Official not be appealed or be upheld by
the Board and finds be necessary to repair or demolish a structure, this
request shall be presented to the City Council. Said cost may then be assessed
in accordance with Iowa law. This shall not prevent action from being taken
during emergency situations with City Administrator’s approval. This shall be
done in accordance with Iowa law and established procedures.

160.02   STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
   1.   The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 414, Code of Iowa,
as amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure
safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
   2.   Findings of Fact.
      A.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Story City, Iowa, are subject
to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare of the community.
      B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by: (i) The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
      C.   This ordinance relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing
flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the
Department of Natural Resources.
   3.   It is the purpose of this Ordinance to protect and preserve the rights,
privileges and property of the City of Story City, Iowa, and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Section 160.02 (2)(A) of this Ordinance with provisions designed to:
      A.   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows
so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
      B.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
      C.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
      D.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
      E.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.

is hereby established which shall hear and decide (i) appeals and (ii) requests
for variances to the provisions of this ordinance, and shall take any other
action which is required of the Board .
   2.   Appeals - Where it is alleged there is any error in any order,
requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in
the enforcement of this ordinance, the aggrieved party may appeal such action.
The notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board of Adjustment and with the
official from whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason
for the appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to
the Board of Adjustment all the documents constituting the record upon which
the action appealed from was taken.
   3.   Variance - The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in
specific cases such variances from the terms of this Ordinance that will not be
contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance will result in unnecessary
hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards:
      A.   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
      B.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.

variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      D.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this Ordinance,
the applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the
Administrator that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of
insurance coverage and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and
property.
      E.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.

reasonably deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or
evaluation of a professional engineer or other expert person or agency,
including the Department of Natural Resources.
      B.   Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an Appeal or
Variance within a reasonable time . In passing upon an Appeal, the Board may,

reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in
writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision.

this section and all other relevant sections of this ordinance and may
prescribe such conditions as contained in 160.09(4)(B)(2).

downstream to the injury of others.
               The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability
of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.

flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
               The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the City.
               The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
               The availability of alternative locations not subject to
flooding for the proposed use.

and floodplain management program for the area.
               The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
               The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.
               The cost of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer,
gas, electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and bridges.
               Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
Ordinance.
         (2)   Conditions Attached to Variances - Upon consideration of the

flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration,
rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated
with the regulatory flood . The Board of Adjustment shall require that the
applicant submit a plan or document certified by a registered professional
engineer that the floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory
flood protection elevation and associated flood factors for the particular
area.

aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Adjustment may present to a court of
record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal,

      C.   Adult Entertainment Businesses. It is the purpose of this Zoning
Code to regulate adult entertainment businesses to limit their inherent adverse
impact in the community while at the same time permitting lawful businesses to
conduct operations in the community. The City Council finds as evidenced in
other cities that the number of adult entertainment businesses is increasing
and that, because of their very nature, are recognized as having serious,
objectionable operational characteristics, which are magnified when located in
close proximity to dwellings, churches, schools, and parks. Special regulation
of adult entertainment businesses is necessary to ensure that these adverse
affects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding
neighborhood. The City Council further finds that these regulations are
necessary to protect the youth of this community from the objectionable
operational characteristics of such businesses by restricting their location.
The City Council further fords that these regulations are necessary to protect
the health, safety and general welfare of all residents of the community.
         (1)   Limitations on Adult Entertainment Businesses. Adult
entertainment businesses shall be subject to the following restrictions and no

1,000 feet of a pre-existing school, public park, or church.

multiple-family dwellings and the usual accessory buildings, such as garages,
storage space, maintenance structures, and buildings for recreational purposes.
Commercial uses, limited to those specifically approved by the City Council,
are permitted provided that such uses are primarily for the service and
convenience of the residents of the development. Such commercial uses are
encouraged to be located within residential buildings, however, if such uses
are proposed to be contained within a separate free-standing structure:
         (1)   It must be so designed to reflect the residential character of
the development; and
         (2)   It may contain an identification sign no more than four square
feet, placed flush on one wall and generally not observable from the periphery
of the development.
No building permit for a free-standing commercial structure will be issued and/
or no certificate of occupancy for commercial use of any residential structures
will be issued until 60 percent of the development’s dwelling units have been
issued a certificate of occupancy.
      B.   Density. The permitted maximum dwelling unit density shall not
exceed what is allowable in the zoning district in which the PUD is
constructed. Where a PUD is proposed and is contained within two or more zoning
districts, density shall be determined by adding the maximum dwelling units
allowable for each proportional part.
      C.   Tract Size. There is no minimum tract size.
      D.   Parking. All parking must meet the requirements of the zoning
district in which the PUD is constructed. Where a PUD is proposed, and is
contained within two or more zoning districts, parking requirements shall be
determined by the City Council, but shall not be any less restrictive than the
existing requirements in the zones in which the PUD is constructed. Parking lot
design consideration shall be as follows:
         (1)   Parking areas shall be treated as an integral part of the
development in scale, location, and character.
         (2)   Parking areas shall be so arranged to discourage through
traffic.
         (3)   As appropriate, parking areas shall be screened from adjacent
structures and streets with hedges, plantings, fences, earth berms, changes in
grade, and/or similar examples.
         (4)   Parking areas shall be so designed to allow for drainage of
surface water without erosion, flooding, and other inconveniences.
      E.   Height. There shall be no maximum height requirement. However,
heights shall be regulated to the extent that it relates to the proposed
development and to the general area within which the development is proposed to
be located.
      F.   Open Space. A major portion of any PUD is its open space provisions.
The desirability is closely tied to the integration of open space with the
total development. The Statement of Intent of this section sets forth the
overall objective desired for PUDs. Therefore, no quantitative standards are
stated in this section. Quality standards acknowledge the separate and multiple
functions of open preservation of natural site amenities. In designing the PUD,
consideration shall be given to such functions. All land in the PUD indicated
as common land and common open space shall be maintained by one of the
following methods:
         (1)   If the land is deeded to a Homeowner’s Association (HOA), the
developer shall file a declaration of covenants and restrictions that will
govern the association, to be submitted with the application for the PUD.
         The provisions shall include, but not be limited to:
            a.   The HOA must be set up before the dwellings are sold.
            b.   Membership must be mandatory for each home buyer and any
successive buyer.
            c.   The open space restrictions must be permanent.
            d.   The HOA must be responsible for liability insurance, taxes,
and the maintenance of recreational and other facilities.
         (2)   All or any part of the open space system may be conveyed to the
City by joint agreement of the developer and City, such conveyance may be by
dedication or easement.
      G.   Additional Requirements. PUD plans, where applicable, shall comply
with the final plat requirements of the Subdivision Regulations.
      H.   Other Considerations. A number of major factors should undergo
evaluation as a portion of design standards. These include:
         (1)   Natural drainage areas shall be retained as appropriate and, if
necessary, improved.
         (2)   Due consideration shall be given to preserving natural site
amenities and minimizing the disturbance to the natural environment.
         (3)   Existing trees shall be preserved wherever possible. The
location of trees is to be considered in designing building locations,
underground services, and paved areas.
         (4)   If the development includes floodplain areas, they shall be
preserved as permanent open space.
         (5)   Due consideration shall be given to the natural topography and
major grade change shall be avoided. If the development includes hillsides and
slopes, special evaluation shall be given to geological conditions, erosion,
and topsoil loss. If unfavorable development conditions exist, the City Council
may restrict clearing, cutting, filling, or other substantial changes in the
natural conditions of the affected area.
166.20   F-1 CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE DISTRICT.
   1.   Statement of Intent. The Conservation and Open Space District is
intended to preserve and protect the heavily wooded areas, the stream banks and

      A.   Intent. To assure that the design and location of residential,
commercial, and industrial areas will be in conformance with the zoning
standards of this Zoning Code and are properly related to and in harmony with
the existing and future residential, business and industrial development of the
City, including generally accepted principles of commercial, industrial, and
urban design, a detailed site plan shall be submitted showing the proposed use
and development of all multiple family residential, nonresidential, commercial,
and industrial sites for approval by the City Council after review and
recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      B.   Procedure.
         (1)   Whenever any person, firm, corporation or other group wishes to
develop any tract, lot, or parcel of land within the incorporated area of the
City, located in any zoning district for all uses except single-family and two-
family dwellings, such person shall cause to be prepared a site plan for such
development and shall submit ten copies of said site plan to the Zoning
Administrator. The provisions of this section shall also be applicable to the
redevelopment, enlargement, or extension of more than 25 percent of any
commercial or industrial uses and structures existing at the time of adoption
of the zoning ordinance. The site plan shall contain such information and data
as outlined herein.
         (2)   The Zoning Administrator shall review the site plan for
compliance with this Zoning Code and shall refer a copy of the site plan to the
City engineer or such other person as shall be designated from time to time by
the City of Story City, who shall review said site plan as to its compliance
with other ordinances of the City and its effect upon public utilities and
public road system and submit findings as soon as possible to the Planning and
Zoning Commission.
         (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall also forward a copy of the site
plan to each member of the Planning and Zoning Commission. The Planning and
Zoning Commission shall, after receiving the report of the engineer and the
Zoning Administrator, review the site plan for conformity with the regulations
and standards contained herein and may confer with the developer on changes
deemed advisable in such site plan.
         (4)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall forward its
recommendation, either for approval or disapproval of the site plan, to the
City Council in a timely manner after the date of the submission of said site
plan. If the Commission does not act in a timely manner, the site plan shall be
deemed to be approved by the Commission, unless the developer agrees to an
extension of time.
         (5)   The Commission may, in its discretion, hold a public hearing on
the site plan of the proposed development and prescribe the notice thereof and
to whom such notice shall be given.
         (6)   The City Council shall, upon receipt of the recommendation of
the Planning and Zoning Commission, either approve or disapprove the site plan
for the proposed development.
         (7)   No building permit or certificate of zoning compliance for any
structure within any district in which a site plan is required shall be issued
until the site plan has been approved as provided herein.
         (8)   Upon final action by the Planning and Zoning Commission on any
site plan, a copy of said site plan, with the action of the Planning and Zoning
Commission noted thereon and signed by the Chairperson of the Commission, shall
be filed with the Zoning Administrator.
         (9)   If the Zoning Administrator finds that any construction or
proposed construction or occupancy of a development of a tract of land for
which a site plan has been approved will not substantially comply with the site
plan as approved, or if the Administrator finds that the construction and
development of the tract is not being carried out in accordance with the
development schedule filed with the site plan, the Administrator shall suspend
all building permits for the development and order all construction stopped
until such time as the owner of the project, or the successors in interest,
shall have provided satisfactory proof that the site plan will be complied
with. The Zoning Administrator shall not issue a certificate of zoning
compliance for any structure within the development while the permit for the
development has been suspended pursuant to this paragraph. Any person aggrieved
by any decision or action of the Zoning Administrator under this paragraph may
appeal such action or decision by the City Council.
         (10)   If the owner or developer of a tract of land for which a site
plan has been approved determines that an extension of time is necessary or
that a modification of the site plan would provide for a more appropriate or
more practicable development of the site, the owner may apply for an amendment
of the site plan. The Planning and Zoning Commission may grant an extension of
time or a modification of a previously approved site plan if it determines that
such modification of the site plan would provide a more appropriate development
of the site.
      C.   Site Plan Review. In reviewing a proposed site plan, the City
Council and the Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider the location of
the buildings on the site with respect to vehicular and pedestrian traffic to
and from the buildings, traffic between the site and abutting streets and
roads, suitable layout and adequate provisions for off-street parking and
loading, with due consideration given to the provision of traffic islands,
pedestrian ways, and landscaping within the parking area, provision for
necessary screening between adjacent properties and the site, location and
display of traffic signs to promote traffic patterns, location and display of
business signs so as not to distract or confuse motorists, and location and
display of outdoor advertising so as to provide adequate visibility within the
site during hours of night operation but not to have adverse effects on
surrounding properties.
      D.   Site Plan Requirements. All site plans shall be drawn at a scale not
less than 1¡È = 50¡Ç. Ten copies of the site plan shall be submitted to the
Zoning Administrator. The purpose of the site plan is to show all information

                                    Nonconforming Uses
 
167.01   NONCONFORMITIES.
Within the districts established by these regulations or amendments that may
later be adopted, there exist lots, structures and uses of land and structures
which were lawful before Ordinance No. 136 was passed or amended, but which
would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of these
regulations or future amendment. Subject to Sections
166.07 through
166.20, it is the intent of these regulations to permit these nonconformities
to continue until they are removed but not to encourage their survival. Such
uses are declared by these regulations to be incompatible with permitted uses
it the districts involved. It is further the intent of these regulations that
nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, or extended, or be used
as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district.
167.02   ADDITIONAL SIGNS.
A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a
nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged
after passage of these regulations by attachment on a building or premises of
additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition
of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district
involved.
167.03   CONSTRUCTION BEGUN.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in these regulations shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building
on which the actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date
of adoption or amendment of these regulations and upon which actual building
construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby
defined to include the placing or construction materials in permanent position
and fastened in a permanent manner; except that where demolition or removal of
an existing building has been substantially begun preparation to rebuilding,
such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided
that work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building
involved.
167.04   NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding
limitations imposed by other provisions of this Zoning Code, a single-family
dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on a single lot of
record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of these regulations;
provided however:
   1.   The sum of the side yard widths of any such lot or plot shall not be
less than 20 percent of the width of the lot, but in no case less than 10
percent of the width of the lot or five feet, whichever is greater, for any one
side yard.
   2.   The depth of the rear yard of any such lot need not exceed 20 percent
of the depth of the lot, but in no case less than 20 feet.
Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with
other lots in the same ownership. If two or more lots or combinations of lots
and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record
at the time of passage or amendment of these regulations, and if all or part of
the lots do not meet the requirements for lot width and area as established by
this Zoning Code, the land involved shall be considered to be an undivided
parcel for the purpose of these regulations and no portion of said parcel shall
be used or sold which does not meet lot width and area requirements established
by these regulations, nor shall any division of the parcel be made which leaves
remaining any lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this
Zoning Code.
167.05   NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of these regulations,
lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of
these regulations as enacted or amended, such use may be continued so long as
it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   1.   Enlargement of Land Area. No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged
or increased or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at
the effective date of adoption or amendment of these regulations.
   2.   Moving of Nonconforming Use. No such nonconforming use shall be moved
in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such
use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of these regulations.
   3.   Discontinuance. If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any
reason for a period of more than six (6) months, any subsequent use of such
land shall conform to these regulations for the district in which such land is
located.
   4.   Amortization. All nonconforming junk yards, storage yards and other
nonconforming uses of open land not involving a substantial investment in
permanent buildings shall be removed or made to conform to the provisions
herein within three (3) years after the adoption of these regulations.
167.06   NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment
of these regulations that could not be built under the terms of these
regulations by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or
other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such
structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
   1.   Enlargement or Alteration of Nonconforming Structure. No such structure
may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity.
   2.   Destruction of Nonconforming Structure. Should such structure be
destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement
cost at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed exception conformity
with these regulations.
167.07   NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES.
If a lawful use of a structure, or of structure and premises in combination,
exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of these regulations,
that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of these regulations,
the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject
to the following provisions:
   1.   Change of Nonconforming Structure. No existing structure devoted to a
use not permitted by these regulations in the district in which it is located
shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally
altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the
district in which it is located.
   2.   Enlargement of Nonconforming Use. Any nonconforming use may be extended
throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed
for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of these regulations, but no
such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
   3.   Change to Another Nonconforming Use. If no structural alterations are
made, any nonconforming use of a structure or structure and premises may be
changed to another nonconforming use provided that the board either by general
rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed
use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the
existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the board may require
appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with these regulations.
   4.   Change to Permitted Use. Any structure, or structure and land in
combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted
use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which such
structure is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
   5.   Discontinuance. When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure
and premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive
months or for 18 months during any three-year period, the structure thereafter
shall not be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in
which it is located.
   6.   Removal or Destruction. Where nonconforming use status applies to a
structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure
shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land.
167.08   REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work may
be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on
repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, to an
extent not exceeding 10 percent of the assessed value of the building, provided
that the cubic content of the building as it existed at the time of passage or
amendment of these regulations shall not be increased. Nothing in these
regulations shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening of or restoring to a
safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any
official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such
official.
167.09   NONCONFORMING USES TO REGISTER.
The owner or operator of any use of land or use of a structure, or use of land
and structure in combination, which shall become nonconforming on the effective
date of these regulations shall complete and file with the administrative
office a nonconforming use registration form describing the use, the nature of
its nonconformity and the area of land or structure occupied on said date.
167.10   USES UNDER EXCEPTION PROVISIONS NOT NONCONFORMING USES.
Any use for which a special exception is permitted as provided in these
regulations shall not be deemed a nonconforming use, but shall, without further
action, be deemed a conforming use in such district.

provided.
168.04   OTHER REMEDIES.
If any building or structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered,

new building be occupied for any purpose other than a single-family dwelling

officer. Every occupancy compliance certificate shall state that the new
occupancy complies with all provisions of these regulations and no subsequent
modifications shall be made to the occupancy, use or method of operation that
would be in violation of these regulations. All construction and occupancy
compliance certificates shall be covered by a weatherproof material and shall
be affixed to a sturdy sign, and displayed between the curb line and sidewalk

168.11   HEARINGS, APPEALS, NOTICE.
Appeals to the Board concerning interpretation or administration of these
regulations may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer or bureau of
the governing body of the City, affected by any decision of the administrative
official. Such appeals shall be taken within a reasonable time not to exceed 60
days of filing with the administrative official and with the board a notice of
appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The administrative official shall
forthwith transmit to the Board all papers constituting the record upon which
the action appealed from was taken. The Board shall fix a reasonable time for
the hearing of appeal, give notice thereof, as well as due notice to the
parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. At the
hearing any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. A fee to be
determined by resolution of the Council shall be paid to the administrative
officer at the time the notice of appeal is filed. The applicant shall also pay
publication and service of notice costs as set by resolution of the Council.
168.12   STAY OF PROCEEDINGS.
An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from,
unless the administrative official from whom the appeal is taken certifies the
Board after the notice of appeal is filed, that by reason of facts stated in
the certificate, a stay would, in the official’s opinion, cause imminent peril
to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than
by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Board or by a court of
record on application, on notice to the administrative official from whom the
appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
168.13   BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT POWERS AND DUTIES.
The Board shall have the following powers and duties:
   1.   Administrative Review. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the
administrative official in the enforcement of these regulations.
   2.   Special Exceptions: Conditions Governing Applications and Procedures.
To hear and decide only such special exceptions as the Board is specifically
authorized to pass on by the terms of these regulations to decide such
questions as are involved in determining whether special exceptions should be
granted; and to grant special exceptions with such conditions and safeguards as
are appropriate under these regulations, and to deny special exceptions when
not in harmony with the purpose and intent of these regulations. A special
exception shall not be granted by the Board unless and until:
      A.   A written application for a special exception is submitted
indicating the section of this chapter under which the special exception is
sought and stating the grounds on which it is requested.
      B.   Notice shall be given at least 15 days in advance of the public
hearing by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the City.
      C.   The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person or
by agent or attorney.
      D.   The Board shall make a finding that it is empowered under the
section of this Zoning Code described in the application to grant the special
exception, and that the granting of the special exception will not adversely
affect the public interest. In granting any special exception, the Board may
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with these
regulations. Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of
the terms under which the special exception is granted, shall be deemed a
violation of these regulations. The Board shall prescribe a time limit within
which the action for which the special exception is required shall be begun or
completed, or both. Failure to begin or complete, or both, such action within
the time limit set shall voids the special exception.
   3.   Variances: Conditions Governing Application: Procedures. To authorize
upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of these regulations
as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to the special
conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this Zoning Code would
result in unnecessary hardship. A variance from the terms of these regulations
shall not be granted by the Board unless and until:
      A.   A written application for a variance is submitted demonstrating
that:
         (1)   Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to
the land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district;
         (2)   Literal interpretation of the provisions of this Zoning Code
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this Zoning Code;
         (3)   Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant
any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands,
nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same
district, and no permitted use of land, structures or buildings in other
districts shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance.
      B.   Notice of public hearing shall be given as in paragraph B,
subsection 2 of this section.
      C.   The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person or
by agent or by attorney.
      D.   The Board shall make findings that the requirements of paragraph A
of this subsection have been met by the applicant for a variance.
      E.   The Board shall further make a finding that the reasons set forth in
the application justify the granting of the variance, and that the variance is
the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land,
building or structure.
      F.   The Board shall further make a finding that the granting of the
variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the Zoning
Code, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental
to the public welfare. In granting any variance, the Board may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with these regulations.
Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Zoning
Code. Under no circumstances shall the Board grant a variance to allow a use
not permissible under the terms of this Zoning Code in the district involved,
or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this Zoning
Code in said district.
168.14   DECISIONS OF THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
In exercising the above mentioned powers, the Board may, so long as such action
is in conformity with the terms of these regulations, reverse or affirm, wholly
or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination as
ought to be made, and to that end shall have powers of the administrative
official from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of three members of
the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or
determination of the administrative official, or to decide in favor of the
applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this Zoning
Code, or to effect any variation in application of this Zoning Code.
168.15   APPEALS FROM THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
Any person or persons, or any Board, taxpayer, department, Board or bureau of
the City aggrieved by any decision of the Board may seek review by a court of
record of such decision, in the manner provided by the laws of the State and
particularly by Chapter 414, Code of Iowa.
168.16   CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.
The regulations imposed and the districts created by this Zoning Code may be
amended from time to time by the Council but no such amendments shall be made
without public hearing before the Council and after a report has been made upon
the amendment by the Commission. No less than seven (7) days and no more than
20 days prior to the hearing a notice of the time and place of such hearing
shall be published in a newspaper having general circulation in the City. In
case the Commission does not approve the change or, in the case of a protest
filed with the Council against a change in district boundaries signed by the
owners of 20 percent or more either of the area of the lots included in such
proposed change or of those immediately adjacent thereto and within 200 feet of
the boundaries thereof, such amendment shall not be passed except by the
favorable vote of three-fourths of all the members of the Council. Amendments
need only refer to the code section to be valid. Such referral only to the
legal description will not invalidate the map or this Zoning Code other than to
change the zoning of the land described.
168.17   APPLICATION FOR CHANGE OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
Any person may submit to the Council an application requesting a change in the
zoning district boundaries as shown on the official zoning district map. Such
application shall be filed with the administrative officer accompanied by a fee

applicant feels the present zoning classification is no longer valid.
   6.   Plat Required. A plat showing the locations, dimensions, and use of the
applicant’s property and all property within 200 feet thereof, including
streets, alleys, railroads and other physical features. All fees shall be
deposited to the General Revenue Fund of the City. Failure to approve the

   3.   Comprehensive Plan. The proposed improvements shall conform to the
comprehensive plan of the City.
175.04   PURPOSE.
   1.   Supplement Other Regulation. It is intended that these regulations
shall supplement and facilitate the enforcement of the provisions and standards
contained in the building and housing codes, standard specifications for street
and utility improvements, zoning ordinance, and comprehensive plan.
   2.   Objectives. These regulations are adopted in order to lessen congestion
in the street; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to promote
health and general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to avoid undue
crowding of population; to facilitate the adequate provisions of

public requirements; to conserve the value of property and encourage the most
appropriate use of land throughout the City, in accordance with the
comprehensive plan.
175.05   JURISDICTION.
   1.   Outside City. In accordance with the provisions of Section 354.9 of the
Code of Iowa, these regulations shall apply to the subdivision of land within
two miles of the corporate limits. The Council shall have the right to waive
such requirements as are contained in these regulations to the end that the
City Council is satisfied that equally suitable regulations have been placed on
these subdivisions by the Board of Supervisors; provided however, the County
Board of Supervisors shall furnish the Commission and Council with a copy of
said subdivision certifying that all requirements of the appropriate County
ordinances have been met. The Commission shall study such plat to determine
that no conflict exists with the extension of existing streets and rights-of-
way within the City into the unincorporated area and to determine if the plat
would otherwise interfere in any way with the implementation of the
comprehensive plan for the City. If the Commission is satisfied by their
studies that these conditions are provided for, they shall endorse their
approval upon said plat and submit it to the City Council. Upon approval by the
City Council, the City Clerk shall notify the County Auditor and Recorder in
accordance with the provisions of existing statutes. The purpose of this
section is to facilitate the orderly processing of subdivisions in
unincorporated areas within two miles of the City and to avoid conflicting
regulations while at the same time assuring that provisions are made for proper
and orderly future growth of the City.
   2.   City Inspection. All improvements constructed on any land subject to
the jurisdiction of the City shall be inspected by the City and shall comply
with the City’s standard construction specifications.
   3.   Conditions. No land within the corporate limits of the City or within
two miles of the corporate limits of the City shall be subdivided until the
subdivider or agent has obtained final approval of the plat by the Council.
   4.   Building Permits and Certificates of Occupancy. No more than one
building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any parcel or
plat of land which was created by subdivision after the effective date of, and
not in conformity with the provisions of these regulations. No excavation of
land or construction of any public or private improvement shall take place or
be commenced until in conformity with these regulations.
   5.   Public Improvements. No public improvements over which the City Council
has control shall be made with City funds, nor shall any City funds be expended
for street maintenance, street improvements or other services in any area that
has been subdivided after the date of adoption of these Subdivision Regulations
unless the subdivision and streets have been approved in accordance with the
provisions of these Subdivision Regulations and the street accepted by the City
Council as a public street.
175.06   INTERPRETATION.
   1.   Minimum Requirements. These regulations shall be held to be the minimum
requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort,
convenience, and general welfare.
   2.   Relation To Other Regulations. It is not intended by these regulations
to repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way impair or interfere with any existing
provisions of law. Where any provision of these regulations imposes
restrictions different from those imposed by any other provision of these
regulations or any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provisions of
law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher standards shall
control.
175.07   RESERVATIONS AND APPEALS.
Any subdivision plat that has received preliminary approval by the Council
prior to the effective date of these regulations shall be subject to the
conditions effective at the time of the approval and for a period of one year
from such date of approval and shall continue to be processed according to
those requirements during such period. The preliminary approval shall be
considered null and void if after one year from the time of such preliminary
plat approval the applicant has not made application for final plat approval by
the City Council. Any future subdivision of any portion of the property subject
to such prior preliminary plat approval shall be made in conformance with these
regulations.
175.08   AMENDMENTS.
These Subdivision Regulations may be amended from time to time by the City
Council. Such amendments as may be proposed shall first be submitted to the
Commission for study and recommendation. The Commission shall report within 30
days, after which the City Council shall give notice of and hold a public
hearing on the proposed amendment. The amendment shall become effective from
and after its adoption and publication as required by law.
175.09   ACRE SUBDIVISION.
When land is subdivided and subdivision plat shows one or more lots containing
more than one acre of land suitable for future resubdivision into smaller
building sites, the Commission may require that such parcel of land be so
subdivided as to allow for future streets and the extension of the existing
street system to the acre.
175.10   AUDITOR’S PLATS.
The Commission and Council shall have the right to waive provisions governing
preliminary and final approval and public improvements outlined in
Chapters 176 and
177 for Auditor’s Plats providing there is on file with the City a copy of the
request of the County Auditor ordering such plat and a letter from the Auditor
stating that the plat as submitted meets the requirements for which the Auditor

the neighborhood; or a cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or
a combination of both, at the option of the City.
   2.   Location. The City has the right to designate the location of the area
dedicated, giving due consideration to potential future developments adjacent
to land being platted.
   3.   Payment-In-Lieu of Dedication. Where dedication of land is not feasible
or compatible as determined by the City Council upon recommendation by the
Planning and Zoning Commission and the Parks and Recreation Board, the owner of
the land being platted shall pay to the City a cash contribution in lieu of the
land dedication otherwise required by this section. The payments shall be
placed in a special fund by the City and shall be used solely for the
acquisition of development of park and recreational lands and facilities to
serve the subdivision, the development, or the neighborhood of which the
subdivision or development is a part. However, if the City Council, upon the
recommendation of the Park and Recreation Board, subsequently determines that:
(i) there is no present need for park and recreation acquisition, development,
or improvement in the subdivision, development, or neighborhood in question;
and (ii) the best interests of the entire City would be served thereby, the
payment received pursuant to this subsection may be applied in whole or in part
toward the acquisition, development, improvement, or maintenance of any park or
parks within the City. Any such determination by the Council shall be by motion
on a separate and distinct agenda item during any regular or special meeting of
the Council.
   4.   Value of Payment. The payment-in-lieu of land shall be based on the
“fair market value” of the acres of land in the development that otherwise
would have been dedicated as an open space site. The value shall be determined
by the City and developer by taking the value of the total development after
subdividing and determining the proportionate value of the land that would have
otherwise been dedicated. Should either the City or the developer determine
that the calculated value does not reflect the “fair market value” an appraisal
shall be made by three appraisers, one selected by the City, one selected by
the developer and the third selected by the two appraisers. Each party shall
pay the fee of the appraiser he selects and the cost of the third shall be
shared equally by the City and the developer. The “fair market value,” after
subdividing, determined by the appraisal shall be binding on both parties.
