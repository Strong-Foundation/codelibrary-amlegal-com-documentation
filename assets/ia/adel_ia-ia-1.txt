8.07 APPROVAL.
A person may submit a proposal to the City Council to receive prior approval
for eligibility for a tax exemption on new construction. If the City Council
resolves to consider such proposal, it shall publish notice and hold a public
hearing thereon. Thereafter, at least 30 days after such hearing, the City
Council, by ordinance, may give its prior approval of a tax exemption for new
construction if the new construction is in conformance with City zoning. Such

dangerous or potentially dangerous, and after investigation, the Police Chief
may declare such dog as dangerous or potentially dangerous by delivering a
written notice of declaration to the owner or keeper of the dog. The notice
shall include a description of the dog and the basis for the declaration as
dangerous or potentially dangerous. The notice shall set forth that the owner
or keeper shall be required to confine the dog as required by this chapter. The
notice shall be served upon any adult residing at the premises where the dog is
located or may be posted on those premises if no adult is present to accept
service.

question may contest the dangerous or potentially dangerous declaration by
filing a written request for hearing, including reasons for the request, with
the City Clerk within three business days of the receipt of the declaration. At
this time, if the owner agrees to confine the dog pursuant to quarantine
provisions of this chapter, the dog shall not be impounded pending appeal.
Failure to file a request for hearing shall constitute a waiver of any right to
contest the declaration of the Police Chief and the Police Chief shall be
authorized to order the seizure and impoundment of the dog if the owner cannot
show the ability to comply with Section
55.20 or Section
55.21 of this chapter. A dog confined or seized shall be impounded until the

Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â If a hearing is requested as provided in Subsection 3, the person
owning, keeping, sheltering, or harboring the dog in question shall be given
not less than 72 hoursâ€™ written notice of the time and place of the hearing.
The 72-hour written notice may be waived upon agreement of both parties. The
notice shall set forth the description of the dog in question and the basis for
the declaration as a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog.

dangerous, the City Administrator or their designee shall order the person
owning, sheltering, harboring or keeping the animal to permanently confine the
dog as required by Section
55.20 or Section
55.21 of this chapter. If the order is not complied with within three days of
its issuance, the City Administrator or their designee is authorized to seize
and impound the dog. A dog so seized shall be impounded for a period of seven
days. If, at the end of the impoundment period, the person against whom the
order of the City Administrator or their designee was issued has not complied

potentially dangerous and that is under impoundment or quarantine at an animal
shelter or veterinary office shall not be released to the owner but shall

hearing. All costs of such impoundment or quarantine shall be paid by the
owner.
55.20Â Â Â EXCEPTIONS TO DECLARING A DANGEROUS OR POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS DOG.

chapter. No dangerous dog may be kept in a house or structure when the windows
are open or when screen windows or screen doors are the only obstacle
preventing the dog from exiting the structure.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â The owner or caretaker of a dangerous dog shall display, in prominent
places on his or her premises near all entrances to the premises, signs in
letters of no less than 2 inches high warning that there is a dangerous dog on

impounded may be redeemed only if they are removed from the City. Such dogs not
redeemed shall be humanely euthanized.

consultation at the ownerâ€™s expense within 60 days after receiving notification

underlying policy of insurance is cancelled for any reason. In lieu of such a
certificate, a copy of a current homeownerâ€™s policy designating these

vaccination at the ownerâ€™s expense.

request by the Police Department a certificate of insurance from an insurance
company authorized to do business in the State of Iowa with coverage of at
least one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) combined single limit
liability for bodily injury. Such certificate of insurance shall provide that
no cancellation of the insurance will be made unless ten (10) daysâ€™ written

premises at which the violation occurred. Service shall not be restored until
the customer has paid the surcharge and the reconnection fee and has provided
reasonable assurance that future violations of Water Watch, Water Warning, or
Water Emergency use restrictions will not occur.
Any customer charged with a violation of the Water Watch, Water Warning, or
Water Emergency use restriction may request a hearing before the Adel City

circumstances under which the violation occurred warrant a complete or partial
mitigation of the administrative surcharge.

Water Watch, Water Warning or Water Emergency; however, if a customer is
charged with a municipal infraction relating to this ordinance, that proceeding
shall be conducted pursuant to Section 364.22 of the Code of Iowa. Appeals
shall be requested in writing and delivered to the City Clerk within the time
stated in the notice, or it will be conclusively presumed that the directive or
surcharge must be followed as ordered. The hearing shall be before the Council
at a time and place fixed by the Council. The findings of the Council shall be
conclusive and, if the directive or surcharge are found valid, it shall be
ordered and fulfilled within a reasonable time under the circumstances.
93.08 REDUCTION IN FLOW OF WATER TO ANY PERSON.
The Water Department, under authorization of the City Administrator and the
Public Works Director, may reduce or disconnect the flow of water to any
customer determined to be using water in any manner not in accordance with this
ordinance during a Water Watch, Water Warning, or Water Emergency or for any
matter that may be deemed a risk to public health. All unmetered usage, without
absolute consent from the City, is considered a threat to public health and may
receive a reduction of flow or disconnect of flow if a Water Watch, Water
Warning, or Water Emergency is or is not in affect. This reduction or potential
disconnection may occur with or without notice, as judgement of severity has
been decided by the City Administrator and the Public Works Director with the
assistance of the Water Department.

Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the ownerâ€™s
expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
97.08 TESTING OF WASTES.
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHâ€™s are determined from
periodic grab samples).

CHAPTER 99A
BENEFITED SEWER DISTRICTS
Â 
99A.01 Purpose   99A.04 East Annex Sanitary Sewer Connection Fee District
99A.02 Intent    99A.05 Old Portland Road Basin Sanitary Sewer Connection Fee
                 District
99A.03 Procedure Â 
Â 
99A.01 PURPOSE.
The City has determined the necessity of establishing a policy and a procedure
to be utilized to recover the cost of design and construction of major sanitary
sewer facilities in those instances in which a significant number of the
properties to be benefited by such facilities are not sufficiently developed to
permit the recovery of those costs through the special assessment process as
provided in Chapter 384, Division IV of the Code of Iowa . The City hereby
declares its intent to utilize connection fees, as herein provided, to recover
the costs for design and construction of such major sanitary sewer facilities
from property owners who connect to such facilities subsequent to their
construction.
99A.02 INTENT.
It is the intent of this chapter to set forth the method of recovery of
proportional cost shares from those property owners who connect their
properties to major sanitary sewer facilities subsequent to their construction,
so that in the event that all property, other than street and road right-of-
way, which lies within the benefited district is connected to the major
sanitary sewer facilities during their expected useful life, then those
properties shall bear, in the aggregate, up to 100 percent of the cost for
design and construction of such facilities, including legal, administrative,
and interest expenses associated therewith.
99A.03 PROCEDURE.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â In the event the Council determines the necessity for construction of a
major sanitary sewer facility, and determines that the utilization of a
connection fee is the most equitable manner in which to recover the City's
costs associated therewith, the Council shall cause a "Notice of Public Hearing
on the Proposed Adoption of an Ordinance to Establish a Benefited District and
a Connection Fee Schedule" to be published in a newspaper of general
circulation within the City as required by Iowa Code Section 384.38(3).
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â At the public hearing, the owners of property within the proposed
benefited district shall be heard and may offer comments or objections as to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The necessity for the project;
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The calculation of the area benefited by the proposed major sanitary
sewer facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The estimated cost of the proposed facilities; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The proposed connection fee.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Upon concluding the hearing, the Council shall rule upon the objections
presented during the hearing and may consider the adoption of the proposed
connection fee ordinance. Upon consideration of the proposed connection fee
ordinance, the Council may:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Adopt the ordinance as proposed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Delete elements or portions of the proposed major sanitary sewer
facilities from the proposed project and the properties served thereby from the
benefited district proposed; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Amend the ordinance to revise the connection fee.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The connection fee ordinance may provide, at the Council's discretion,
that single family residences within the benefited district, in existence or
under construction upon the effective date of the ordinance, and located within
the corporate limits of the City, are eligible for connection to the major
sanitary sewer facility. In that event, the ordinance shall include the
following provisions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â That the owners of residences on parcels of less than one acre in
size located within the City may connect such residences to the major sanitary
sewer facility upon approval of their application for connection, payment of
the connection fee for the parcel, and construction, at the owner's expense, of
appropriate connection structures, as determined necessary by the City.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â That the owners of residences on parcels in excess of one acre in
size located within the City may connect such residences to the major sanitary
sewer facility upon approval of their application for connection, designation
in writing of a one acre single residence parcel and a remainder parcel,
payment of the connection fee for the area of the one acre residence parcel,
and construction at the owner's expense, of appropriate connection structures,
as determined necessary by the City. Any future development of said parcel
shall necessitate a revised application for connection and payment of the
appropriate connection fee.
Â Â Â All other property located within the corporate limits of the City and
within a benefited district shall be eligible for connection to the major
sanitary sewer facility upon approval of an application for connection by the
owner thereof, as hereafter provided, and payment of the connection fee for
such property, provided such property has been appropriately subdivided for
development, and, where applicable, all sanitary sewer improvements necessary
to serve said property have been constructed, at the owner's expense, and
accepted by the City.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â After adoption, publication and recording by the Clerk of a connection
fee ordinance for a benefited district, all owners of those properties within
the benefited district whose properties are eligible for connection, and who
propose to connect such properties directly or indirectly to the major sanitary
sewer facility, shall make application to the City for such connection. The
submittal of construction plans to the City for sanitary sewer improvements on
property being subdivided for development shall constitute an application to
the City for purposes of this chapter. The sewer connection fee shall be due
and payable at the time application is made to the City for connection to the
major sanitary sewer facility. No connection shall be made to a major sanitary
sewer facility until such application has been approved and until the required
connection fee has been paid. The sewer connection fee shall be paid before the
City will approve the final plat of property subject to the connection fee.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The sewer connection fee shall be in an amount equal to the maximum
acre area of contiguous property, or fraction thereof, within the benefited
district under common ownership which can be lawfully served through such
proposed connection, multiplied by the per acre connection fee or such other
fee basis as determined for the benefited district established in the
connection fee ordinance for that benefited district. The connection fee
ordinance may provide for a graduated connection fee, with annual interest
adjustments, such that property owners who connect in later years pay interest
on the connection fee for their property. The rate of interest applicable to
the connection fee established in each benefited district shall not exceed the
rate of interest applicable to special assessments pursuant to Chapter 74A and
Section 384.60(3) of the Iowa Code in effect on the date that the connection
fee was established for that district by enactment of a connection fee
ordinance.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â The sewer connection fee required by this chapter shall be due and
payable to the City and is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other fees
for connection required under the plumbing code or other provisions of this
Code of Ordinances.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â In the event any property owner connects his or her property within a
benefited district to a major sanitary sewer facility without having made
application therefor or without having received approval thereof or without
having paid the required connection fee established by a connection fee
ordinance, the City shall be entitled to disconnect such private sewer
connection until such time as the property owner has made and received approval
of his or her application, and/or has paid the required connection fee.

Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â "Sanitary sewer utility" means and includes sanitary sewer trunk
lines and sanitary sewer interceptors, sanitary sewer force mains, pumping
stations and detention basins.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â "Connection" means any act that results in a direct or indirect
discharge into a City sewer utility, including but not limited to, the
connection of a private sewer system to a lateral sewer or manhole or the
connection of a lateral sewer serving a subdivision to a trunk sewer or
manhole.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â "Original cost" means all costs incurred in the design, construction
and financing of City sewer utilities necessary to provide sanitary sewer
service to the East Annex Sanitary Sewer Connection Fee District, including but
not limited to, the cost of labor, materials, engineering, fees, legal fees,
closing costs, and interest from the date of construction to payment at the
rate equal to 2.75%.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Fee Schedule. Connection fees shall be imposed as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Connection Fee. A connection fee is established for all existing and
future connections for property directly adjoining and abutting the sanitary
sewer facilities constructed in the Benefitted District according to the
following schedule adjusted annually, which includes increases into which a
reasonable amount of interest has been calculated from the date of construction
of each particular phase of sanitary sewer facilities to the date of payment:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Effective DateÂ Â Â Â Â Â Connection Fee ($/acre)*
Â Â Â Â Â Â May , 2020Â Â Â Â Â Â $6,083.12
Â Â Â Â Â Â July 1, 2021Â Â Â Â Â Â $6,250.40
Â Â Â Â Â Â July 1, 2022Â Â Â Â Â Â $6,422.29
Â Â Â Â Â Â July 1, 2023Â Â Â Â Â Â $6,598.90
Â Â Â Â Â Â July 1, 2024Â Â Â Â Â Â $6,780.37
Â Â Â Â Â Â July 1, 2025Â Â Â Â Â Â $6,966.83
Â Â Â Â Â Â July 1, 2026Â Â Â Â Â Â $7,158.42
Â Â Â Â Â Â July 1, 2027Â Â Â Â Â Â $7,355.28
Â Â Â Â Â Â July 1, 2028Â Â Â Â Â Â $7,557.55

Â Â Â Â Â Â July 1, 2030Â Â Â Â Â Â $7,978.92
Â Â Â Â Â Â **
Â Â Â Â Â Â *An interest rate of 2.75% is applied annually to the connection fee.
Â Â Â Â Â Â ** The connection fee shall increase in each subsequent year by applying
simple interest thereto at the rate of 2.75% percent per annum. The interest
rate will not apply to the connection fee before the construction of the
particular phase of the sanitary sewer facilities in the Benefitted District to
which a property owner may connect has been completed. For example, if a
particular phase of the sanitary sewer facilities is not constructed until
2022, then the connection fee in 2022 for property owners who may connect to
that particular phase of the sanitary sewer facilities would be $6,083.12 and
the fee schedule for those property owners would run from there.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Property Outside City Limits. Pursuant to a 28E Agreement between
the City of Adel and Dallas County, dated March 5, 2018, the City Council may
authorize the connection of properties outside the corporate limits of Adel to
the East Annex Sanitary Sewer. Such properties shall be eligible to connect to
the East Annex Sanitary Sewer upon payment of the connection fee and compliance
with all other requirements of the City Code. These properties have been
included within the boundaries of the East Annex Sanitary Sewer Connection Fee
District.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Fee Outside District. The established connection fee shall apply to any
property outside of the Benefitted District that uses or derives benefit from
any of the sewer facilities constructed for the East Annex Sanitary Sewer
Connection Fee District. The appropriate fee shall be imposed at the time of
determination that a benefit is derived from the property.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Exception Within District. The established connection fee shall not
apply to the following properties within the benefitted district:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Pursuant to the 28E Agreement between the City of Adel and Dallas
County, dated March 5, 2018, the property on which the county's public safety
facility has been built is exempted from paying the connection fee (Parcel Nos.
1127400013 & 1127400012);
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Pursuant to the 28E Agreement between the City of Adel and Dallas
County, dated March 5, 2018, properties that are currently being served by the
county's Ortonville sewer collection system are exempted from paying the
connection fee and Dallas County will instead be responsible for the connection
fees associated with these properties;
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The connection fee shall not apply to any properties within the East
Annex Sanitary Sewer Connection Fee District which do not use or derive benefit
from any sewer facilities constructed for the East Annex Sanitary Sewer
Connection Fee District.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Payment. The determination that a property is to be connected to the
sewer facilities shall occur and the appropriate connection fee shall be paid
prior to the time of release of a final plat for recordation or the issuance of
a building or plumbing permit, whichever occurs first.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Existing Single Family Residence. Any single family residences within
the East Annex Sanitary Sewer Connection Fee District, in existence or under
construction upon the effective date of the ordinance are eligible for
connection to the sanitary sewer utility.
Â Â Â The owners of residences on parcels of less than one acre located within the
East Annex Sanitary Sewer Connection Fee District may connect such residences
to the sanitary sewer utility upon approval of their application for
connection, payment of the connection fee for the parcel, and construction, at
the owner's expense, of appropriate connection structures, as determined
necessary by the City.
Â Â Â Any single family residence existing or under construction upon the
effective date of the ordinance codified in this section located upon a parcel
in excess of one acre may apply for connection upon division of said parcel
into a single family residence parcel and a remainder parcel in the payment of
a single connection fee. Any development of said parcel shall necessitate a
revised application for connection and payment of the appropriate connection
fee. For purposes of this section, subdivision of the property into a single
family residence parcel and a remainder parcel shall only require a reasonably
accurate graphical division of the property and shall not be construed to
require a legal division of the property.
Â Â Â The owners of residences on parcels in excess of one ace located within the
East Annex Sanitary Sewer Connection Fee District may connect such residences
to the sanitary sewer utility upon approval of their application for
connection, division of said parcel into a residence parcel and a remainder
parcel, payment of the connection fee for the residence parcel, and
construction, at the owner's expense, of appropriate connection structures, as
determined necessary by the City.
Â Â Â The connection fee for the remainder parcel shall be payable at such time as
the remainder parcel shall be connected to the sanitary sewer utility. A parcel
may be divided once. For purposes of this section, division of the property
into a residence parcel and a remainder parcel may be accomplished by
submitting a drawing showing a graphical depiction of the two parcels including
dimensions accurate to within a distance of one foot, a legal description of
the entire parcel and a legal description of the residence parcel with such
accuracy as to allow the City to determine a reasonable description of the
remainder parcel. For purposes of this section, the division of property does
not require a subdivision of the property or a plat of survey.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Other Property. All other property located within the East Annex
Sanitary Sewer Connection Fee District shall be eligible for connection to the
sanitary sewer utility upon approval of an application for connection by the
owner thereof, as hereafter provided, and payment of the connection fee for
such property, provided such property has been appropriately subdivided for
development, and, where applicable, all sanitary sewer improvements necessary
to serve said property have been constructed, at the owner's expense, and
accepted by the City.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Procedure. After adoption, publication and recording by the Clerk of a
connection fee ordinance for the East Annex Sanitary Sewer Connection Fee
District, all owners of those properties within the Benefited District whose
properties are eligible for connection, and who propose to connect such
properties directly or indirectly to the sanitary sewer utility, shall make
application to the City for such connection. The submittal of construction
plans to the City for sanitary sewer improvements on property being subdivided
for development shall constitute an application to the City. The sewer
connection fee shall be due and payable at the time application is made to the
City for connection to the sanitary sewer utility. No connection shall be made
to a sanitary sewer utility until such application has been approved and until
the required connection fee has been paid. The sewer connection fee shall be
paid before the City will approve the final plat of property subject to the
connection fee.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Unauthorized Connections Constitute Municipal Infraction. Any
authorized connection(s) to the sanitary sewer utility in the Benefitted
District will constitute a municipal infraction pursuant to Section 96.04 of
the City Code.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Disconnection of Unauthorized Connections. In the event any property
owner connects his or her property within the Benefitted District to a sanitary
sewer utility without having made application therefor or without having
received approval thereof or without having paid the required connection fee
established by a connection fee ordinance, the City shall be entitled to
disconnect such private sewer connection until such time as the property owner
has made and received approval of his or her application, and/or has paid the
required connection fee.

payment at the rate equal to 5%.
2.Â Â Â Fee Schedule. Connection fees shall be imposed as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Connection Fee. A connection fee is established for all existing and
future connections for property directly adjoining and abutting the sanitary
sewer facilities constructed in the benefitted district according to the
following schedule adjusted annually, which includes increases into which a
reasonable amount of interest has been calculated from the date of construction
of each particular phase of sanitary sewer facilities to the date of payment:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Effective DateÂ Â Â Â Â Â Connection Fee ($/acre)*
Â Â Â Â Â Â October 1, 2024Â Â Â $5,682.15

Development Property, within the Agreement, is exempted from paying the
connection fee.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The connection fee shall not apply to any properties within the Old

effective date of the ordinance codified in this section located upon a parcel
in excess of one acre may apply for connection upon division of said parcel
into a single family residence parcel and a remainder parcel in the payment of
a single connection fee. Any development of said parcel shall necessitate a
revised application for connection and payment of the appropriate connection
fee. For purposes of this section, subdivision of the property into a single
family residence parcel and a remainder parcel shall only require a reasonably
accurate graphical division of the property and shall not be construed to
require a legal division of the property.
Â Â Â The owners of residences on parcels in excess of one ace located within the
Old Portland Road Basin Sanitary Sewer Connection Fee District may connect such
residences to the sanitary sewer utility upon approval of their application for
connection, division of said parcel into a residence parcel and a remainder
parcel, payment of the connection fee for the residence parcel, and
construction, at the ownerâ€™s expense, of appropriate connection structures, as
determined necessary by the City.
Â Â Â The connection fee for the remainder parcel shall be payable at such time as
the remainder parcel shall be connected to the sanitary sewer utility. A parcel
may be divided once. For purposes of this section, division of the property
into a residence parcel and a remainder parcel may be accomplished by
submitting a drawing showing a graphical depiction of the two parcels including
dimensions accurate to within a distance of one foot, a legal description of
the entire parcel and a legal description of the residence parcel with such
accuracy as to allow the City to determine a reasonable description of the
remainder parcel. For purposes of this section, the division of property does
not require a subdivision of the property or a plat of survey.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Other Property. All other property located within the Old Portland Road
Basin Sanitary Sewer Connection Fee District shall be eligible for connection
to the sanitary sewer utility upon approval of an application for connection by
the owner thereof, as hereafter provided, and payment of the connection fee for
such property, provided such property has been appropriately subdivided for
development, and, where applicable, all sanitary sewer improvements necessary
to serve said property have been constructed, at the ownerâ€™s expense, and
accepted by the City.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Procedure. After adoption, publication and recording by the Clerk of a
connection fee ordinance for the Old Portland Road Basin Sanitary Sewer
Connection Fee District, all owners of those properties within the benefited
district whose properties are eligible for connection, and who propose to
connect such properties directly or indirectly to the sanitary sewer utility,
shall make application to the City for such connection. The submittal of
construction plans to the City for sanitary sewer improvements on property
being subdivided for development shall constitute an application to the City.
The sewer connection fee shall be due and payable at the time application is
made to the City for connection to the sanitary sewer utility. No connection
shall be made to a sanitary sewer utility until such application has been
approved and until the required connection fee has been paid. The sewer
connection fee shall be paid before the City will approve the final plat of
property subject to the connection fee.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Unauthorized Connections Constitute Municipal Infraction. Any
unauthorized connection(s) to the sanitary sewer utility in the benefitted
district will constitute a municipal infraction pursuant to Section
3.01 of the City Code.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Disconnection of Unauthorized Connections. In the event any property
owner connects his or her property within the benefitted district to a sanitary
sewer utility without having made application therefor or without having
received approval thereof or without having paid the required connection fee
established by a connection fee ordinance, the City shall be entitled to
disconnect such private sewer connection until such time as the property owner
has made and received approval of his or her application, and/or has paid the
required connection fee.

health, safety and general welfare.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code of Ordinances, all

unoccupied, shall have a permanent sidewalk built for the entire width and/or
length of the lot or lots upon which the dwelling, business building, or
commercial building is located, and the sidewalks shall be built for the entire
width and/or length of all sides of the lot or lots which abut a street.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â In the event that no grade has been set or there is no curb and gutter
on the street upon which the sidewalk is to be placed, the Council may waive
the sidewalk requirement on application of the affected property owner and upon

within 120 days after the property owner has been notified that a curb and

shall be verified and placed on record in the office of the Dallas County
Recorder, and shall be a covenant running with the land binding the heirs and
assigns of the property owner.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â When the strict application of standards or requirements established by
this section would cause substantial hardship or impose unreasonable
restrictions regarding the installation of a sidewalk because of natural or
physical conditions or limitations not created by the owner or developer, the
Council may grant such waivers and/or variances from these standards or
requirements as may be necessary pursuant to the following procedure. At such
time when the conditions or limitations are eliminated, the owner or developer
will be required to install such sidewalk within 120 days after notification by
the City.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â The applicant under this subsection shall prepare an application to the
Planning and Zoning Commission for review of the required sidewalk. The
applicant may request a waiver of the sidewalk requirement or a variance of the
sidewalk requirement. Within 45 days after receiving the application, the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend to the Council to either
approve, approve subject to conditions, or disapprove the request. Failure by
the Planning and Zoning Commission to act within 45 days shall be deemed a
recommendation for approval of the request.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The Council shall establish criteria and specific design standards to
assist it and the Planning and Zoning Commission when considering applications
for waivers and/or variances. All such criteria and specific design standards
shall be established in such a way as to insure the orderly and harmonious
development of a City-wide sidewalk system in such a manner as will safeguard
the publicâ€™s health, safety and general welfare.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Upon recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission to the
Council, the applicantâ€™s request will be put on the agenda for the next
regularly scheduled Council meeting for final approval or disapproval by the
Council. If the Council rejects the request, the Council will advise the
applicant of any changes which are desired or that should have consideration
before approval will be given. The applicant shall then submit the revised
original for certification by the Council. The Planning and Zoning Commission
and the Council, in approving or disapproving any requests and in making
requests for alterations or amendments to the request as presented, shall be
governed by the general policies as set out by this section and by the criteria
and specific design standards established by the Council.

standards set forth in this chapter, and is adequately protected from intrusion
by trespassers and from deterioration by the weather. This permit shall be
effective for a period of 365 days from the date of issuance or renewal.
153.06 VACANT BUILDING PERMIT CONDITIONS.
All permits issued are subject to all other applicable conditions of this Code
of Ordinances and the following additional conditions:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Consent to Entry. All applicants and owners holding a permit consent to
the entry of duly authorized officials of the City at all reasonable hours and
upon reasonable notice for the purpose of inspection. Refusal to consent to
entry shall be a violation of this chapter. In addition to issuing a municipal
infraction citation in the event of refusal, the City may file a complaint
under oath to any Court of competent jurisdiction and said Court shall
thereupon issue its order authorizing the appropriate person to enter such
establishment to inspect.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Consent to Emergency Inspections orÂ Emergency Repairs. All applicants
and owners holding a permit consent to the entry of duly authorized officials
of the City if such official has reason to believe than an emergency situation
exists with respect to the building or structure that tends to create an
imminent hazard to health, welfare or safety of the general public, in the
discretion of such official, then such official may enter the building to
inspect the premises, without notifying the responsible party or obtaining a
warrant. If such official finds an emergency situation exists in fact, which
presents an imminent hazard to the health, welfare or safety of the general
public, then such official may cause any reasonable action, including the
employment of necessary labor and materials, to perform emergency repairs to
alleviate the hazard. City employees will confer with legal counsel prior to
entering or causing entry to be made to premises and/or performing any
emergency repairs without prior owner notification and consent. Costs incurred
in the performance of emergency repairs may be paid by the City and if so paid,
the City may levy a special assessment against the property to recover the
costs.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Cooperation by Owner or Responsible Person. All owners holding a permit
or responsible persons identified in a permit application shall cooperate with
and facilitate inspections of the premises at reasonable times pursuant to
reasonable notice to determine compliance with the requirements of this
chapter. Obstructing a duly authorized inspection, including refusing entry or
access to portions of the building subject to the permit, shall be a violation
of this chapter. The owner shall notify the Building Inspector within 30
business days of any changes to the contact information of the owner or
responsible person.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Continued Compliance. For the vacant building permit to remain valid,
the building or structure subject to the permit shall continue to comply with
all the requirements of the vacant building maintenance standards.
153.07 ENFORCEMENT.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Authorized Officials. The Zoning Administrator and the Building
Inspector shall have the authority to enforce the provisions of this chapter

Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Right of Entry. An authorized official has the right to enter
buildings, structures, or premises subject to this chapter at reasonable times,
with the express or implied consent of the owner, responsible person, or
occupant, to inspect in accordance with the Cityâ€™s policy and procedure for
entering onto private property to conduct administrative interior and exterior
inspections for Code administration and enforcement. If entry is refused, it
shall be a violation of this chapter for which a municipal infraction citation
may be issued.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Inspections. An authorized official may inspect the premises and
structures to determine compliance with this chapter at their discretion. All
reports of such inspections shall be in writing, signed or initialed and dated.
An authorized official may engage any expert opinion as deemed necessary to

in this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â To ensure that allowing the building to remain will not be
detrimental to public health, safety and welfare, will not unreasonably
interfere with the reasonable and lawful use and enjoyment of other premises
within the neighborhood.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â To eliminate any hazards to police officers or firefighters that may
enter the premises in times of emergency.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â When issuing orders to repair, the authorized official shall specify
the deadline for completion of the repair required and shall mail the notice to
the owner or responsible person identified in the permit. All work done
pursuant to this chapter shall be done in compliance with any applicable
Building, Fire, Property Maintenance and Zoning Codes and Ordinances.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Reinspections. Reinspections may be conducted after the deadline for

No later than June 1, 2013, following passage of this chapter, and subsequently
within 30 days of a manufacturing, commercial, industrial, or mixed occupancy
building becoming vacant as defined herein, a building owner must complete a
vacant building registration form, which serves as an application for a vacant
building permit.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â There is no charge for the initial application as long as the building
is in compliance with all applicable building codes.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If the building remains vacant for 180 days necessitating the 180-day
inspection, the building owner or representative shall pay the permit or
inspection fee.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Upon completion of the inspection, the building owner or representative
shall remedy as ordered. If no repairs are necessary, the permit is valid for
one year from the 180-day inspection, at which time the inspection process
begins again with the vacant building permit fee being due annually thereafter.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â If the inspection results in necessary repairs being ordered, a
reinspection will be conducted in accord with the provisions of this chapter.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â In the case of a necessary reinspection, the annual permit begins upon
all necessary repairs being made and bringing the building into compliance with
all applicable building codes.
153.09 FEES AND PENALTIES.

reasonably related to the enforcement, an escalating fee established by the
Council through resolution, may be charged for any reinspection following the
initial inspection which resulted in an order for corrective action, and the
first reinspection to determine compliance with an order for corrective action
issued hereunder. There shall be no reinspection fee if the inspection
indicates full compliance, or for a reinspection occurring during the period of
an approved time extension granted for good cause and involving a good faith
effort on the part of the property owner to comply with the order.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Failure to pay reinspection fees within 30 days of mailing an

chapter for which a municipal infraction citation may be issued.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Violations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any violation of a provision of this chapter is a municipal
infraction for which a municipal infraction citation may be issued. Each day
that the violation continues shall constitute a separate violation for which a
municipal infraction citation may be issued.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Abatement of Violations. The issuance of a municipal infraction
citation shall not preclude the City Attorney from instituting appropriate
action to restrain, correct, or abate a violation, or to prevent illegal
occupancy of a structure or premises, or to stop an illegal act, conduct
business, or utilization of the structure or premises.

Â 
160.01 STATUTORY AUTHORITY AND FINDINGS OF FACT.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 414, Code of Iowa,
as amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure
safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Findings of Fact.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of
the community.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by: (i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
160.02 PURPOSE.
It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and preserve the rights,
privileges and property of the City and its residents and to preserve and
improve the peace, safety, health, welfare and comfort and convenience of its
residents by minimizing flood losses with provisions designed to:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Reserve sufficient flood plain area for the conveyance of flood flows
so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public utilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03 DEFINITIONS.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall

structure either (i) before the â€œstart of constructionâ€ of the improvement, or
(ii) if the structure has been â€œsubstantially damagedâ€ and is being restored,
before the damage occurred. The term does not, however, include any project for
improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of State or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions. The term also does not include any alteration of
an â€œhistoric structure,â€ provided the alteration will not preclude the
structureâ€™s designation as an â€œhistoric structure.â€
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Any addition which increases the original floor area of a building
by twenty-five percent (25%) or more. All additions constructed after the

and shall not be for human habitation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Storage of materials or equipment that are buoyant, flammable,
explosive or injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited. Storage of
other material may be allowed if readily removable from the Floodway District
within the time available after flood warning.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Watercourse alterations or relocations (channel changes and
modifications) must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within
the altered or relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations
must be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Any fill allowed in the floodway must be shown to have some
beneficial purpose and shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary.

160.13 FLOODWAY FRINGE (OVERLAY) DISTRICT - FF.
All development within the Floodway Fringe District shall be permitted to the
extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance (or underlying
zoning district) and provided they meet applicable performance standards of the
Floodway Fringe District. All development must be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage and shall meet the following applicable performance
standards. Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no development may
increase the base flood elevation more than one (1) foot. The applicant will be
responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient
technical information to make such determination.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â All development shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse
or lateral movement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the base flood elevation. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed, subject to favorable
consideration by the Board of Adjustment, where existing topography, street
grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods
used must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various
forces and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential structures
located in areas that would become isolated due to flooding of surrounding
ground shall be provided with a means of access which will be passable by
wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this criterion shall not apply
where the Floodplain Administrator determines there is sufficient flood warning
time for the protection of life and property. When estimating flood warning
time, consideration shall be given to the criteria listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa
Administrative Code.

residential buildings shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated
a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level. When
floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State of
Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and
other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the
base flood elevation, is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Fully enclosed areas below the â€œlowest floorâ€ (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access
and low damage potential storage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
electric meter, electrical service panel box, hot water heater, heating, air
conditioning, ventilation equipment (including ductwork), and other similar
machinery and equipment elevated (or in the case on non-residential structures,
optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood
elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
plumbing, gas lines, water/gas meters and other similar service utilities
either elevated (or in the case of non-residential structures, optionally
floodproofed to) a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation or
designed to be watertight and withstand inundation to such a level.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Factory-Built Homes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be

hearing and give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to parties in
interest. At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or
attorney and present written or oral evidence. The Board may require the
appellant or applicant to provide such information as is reasonably deemed
necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or evaluation of a
professional engineer or other expert person or agency, including the
Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal,
conditional use or variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an
appeal, the Board may, so long as such action is in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter, reverse or affirm wholly or in part, or modify the
order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make
its decision, in writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons
for its decision. In granting a conditional use or variance, the Board shall
consider such factors as contained in this section and all other relevant
sections of this chapter and may prescribe such conditions as contained in
Section
160.21.
160.21 FACTORS UPON WHICH THE DECISION TO GRANT VARIANCES IS BASED.
In passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or downstream

The City determines and declares it to be conducive to the health, welfare,
safety and convenience of the City and its residents that a storm water
management utility district be established within the city. Consequently,
pursuant to Code of Iowa SectionÂ 384.84(1), a storm water management utility
district, to be known as the Storm Water Management Utility, is established
that the City shall be and constitute the storm water management utility
district, and that the utility shall comprise and include elements of the
Cityâ€™s storm water drainage and flood protection systems which provide for the
collection, treatment and disposal of storm water. It is further found,
determined, and declared that the elements of the storm water management
utility are of benefit and provide services to all real properties within the
incorporated City limits, including property not directly served by the storm
water drainage system, and that such benefits and services may include (but are
not limited to) the provision of adequate systems of collection, conveyance,
detention, treatment and release of storm water; the reduction of hazard to
property and life resulting from storm water runoff and flooding; improvement
in general health and welfare through reduction of undesirable storm water
conditions and flooding; and improvement to the water quality in the storm
water and surface water system and its receiving waters. It is further
determined and declared to be necessary and conducive to the protection of the
public health, welfare, safety and convenience of the City and its residents
that charges be levied upon and collected from the owners or occupants of all
lots, parcels of real estate, and buildings that discharge storm water or
surface or subsurface waters, directly or indirectly, to the City storm water
drainage system, and that the proceeds of such charges so derived be used for
the purposes of operation, maintenance, repair, replacement and debt service
for construction of the storm water drainage and flood protection improvements
comprising the storm water management utility.

Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â All decisions of the City Council shall be final.
161.10 CREDITS.Â 
It is the Cityâ€™s intent to encourage sound technical design practices that
reduce the negative impact of development on the storm water drainage system
through a credit system. Properties whose impact on the drainage system is
significantly limited or has been effectively reduced through specific controls
shall be entitled to a credit adjustment that may be applied to its storm water
service charge. A credit adjustment application must be filed in writing with
the City Administrator. The application shall include all necessary information
from a registered Iowa Land Surveyor or Professional Engineer to clearly
demonstrate the credits sought, pertinent maps and design calculations, e.g.
pre-development and post-development runoff rates, storage volumes, etc., and
the proposed and/or resulting hydrologic response of the property to rainfall
events. Using the information provided by the applicant, the City Administrator
shall conduct a technical review of the conditions on the property and respond
to the application in writing within 30 days. Billing adjustments required to
implement credits shall be applied retroactively to the date the customer
submitted a complete application. Adjustments shall be made by crediting the
customerâ€™s storm water service charge until any overpayment has been fully
repaid. A pending application for credit shall not constitute a valid reason
for nonpayment of the current storm water service charges. Credit adjustments
shall be applied as follows:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Quantity Reduction (40% maximum).
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Rate Reduction Credit â€“ 25 percent credit. Storm water facilities
that control the post-development peak rate of storm water runoff at the pre-
development rate of the two-year design storm.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Additional Rate Reduction Credit â€“ 10 percent credit. Storm water
facilities that qualify for a rate reduction credit can also qualify for the
additional rate reduction credit if they reduce the post-development peak rate
for the two-year design storm by at least 20 percent of the pre-development
flow rate.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Additional Volume Credit â€“ 5 percent credit. Storm water facilities
that qualify for a rate reduction credit can also qualify for an additional
volume credit if they provide 20 percent more storage volume than required for
the 100-year design storm. This does not include required freeboard above an
emergency spillway.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Quality Credit (10 percent maximum).
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Implement Best Management Practices (BMP) â€“ 5 percent credit per
approved best management practice (BMP). Quality credits will be available to
properties where structural or non-structural storm water BMPs are located and
which are used to treat storm water runoff, specifically total suspended solid
(TSS) loads. Professional techniques such as those published in the Iowa
Stormwater Management Manual, or by the U.S. EPA, National Resource
Conservation Service, American Society of Civil Engineers, and other
professional organizations will be considered. A quality credit can also be
applied in addition to any approved quantity reduction credits, such as a wet
detention pond that is designed to remove at least 80 percent total suspended
solids (TSS).
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Applicants for non-structural storm water BMPs including filter
strips and natural preservation areas may be eligible for credit provided the
ownerâ€™s engineer can provide calculations showing removal of 80 percent TSS.
The owner shall supply maintenance information along with their application.
Any association agreements or contracts for inspection and/or maintenance are
required to be disclosed as part of the application. Indicate the schedule for
major maintenance that will be performed and how many times per year basic
maintenance (such as erosion control and/or mowing) activities are performed.
Inspection reports shall be filed with the City every third year, as calculated
from the original application date, in order to maintain any level of credit.
If a property owner fails to file required inspection reports or if a random
City inspection results in failure, the City will send a letter informing the
property owner of the required action to avoid revocation of the credits. If
the property owner fails to take the required action, the credits will be
revoked until the situation is corrected. No retroactive credits will be given
during said lapse period. Credits will be restored on the effective date of the
submittal of the property ownerâ€™s acceptable response.
161.11 EXEMPTION FROM FEES; SPECIAL CONDITIONS.
In special conditions, the City Administrator may, upon a written request for
an exemption of fees filed with the City, grant fee payment and collection
variances after determining that granting the variance would be in the Cityâ€™s
best interest, will improve efficiency, safety and is practical. Upon granting
of any variance, the City Administrator shall file notice with the City Council
giving reasons for the variance.
161.12 BILLING FOR SERVICE.
Billing and payment for storm water service shall be according to the
following:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Billing. Storm water billing will begin upon water meter installation.
In the case of property without City water service the owner of the said
property will be billed based on:
A.Â Â Â The issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the dwelling or dwelling
unit;
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Ninety days after construction is halted, provided construction is
at least 50 percent complete; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Ninety days after construction is completed, even if a certificate
of occupancy has not been issued for the dwelling or dwelling unit.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Payment of Bills. All fees are due and payable under the same terms and
conditions provided for payment of a combined service account as contained in
Section
92.04 of this Code of Ordinances. Utility service may be discontinued in
accordance with the provisions contained in Section
92.05 if the combined service account becomes delinquent, and the provisions
contained in Section
92.08 relating to lien notices shall also apply in the event of a delinquent
account.
161.13 LIEN FOR NONPAYMENT.Â Â 
Except as provided for in Section
92.07 of this Code of Ordinances, the owner of the premises served and any
lessee or tenant thereof are jointly and severally liable for fees for solid
waste collection and disposal. Fees remaining unpaid and delinquent shall
constitute a lien upon the property or premises served and shall be certified
by the Clerk to the County Treasurer for collection in the same manner as
property taxes.
161.14 ANNUAL REVISION OF RATES.
The City will review the storm water service charges at least yearly and revise
the storm water service charges as necessary to ensure that such charges as
herein established and specified generate adequate revenues to pay the costs of
the maintenance and operation (including replacement and debt service) of a
storm water management system and facilities and that the storm water service
charges continue to provide for proportional distribution of maintenance and
operations cost (including replacements costs and debt service) for a storm
water management system and facilities among the users and users classes. The
liability of a storm water service user to pay for charges as provided in this
chapter shall be contingent, however, upon any such review or revision.
161.15 COMMUNITY STORM WATER INITIATIVE (CSWI) SURCHARGE.
Every person, firm, or corporation whose premises now or hereafter are directly
or indirectly served by a connection to the City Storm Water System shall pay a
CSWI surcharge in the amount of $6.00 per month.

Â 
165.01 TITLE.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited and referred to as the Zoning Code
of the City of Adel, Iowa.
165.02 PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide adequate light and air, to prevent
the overcrowding of land, to avoid undue concentration of population, to
regulate the use of land, and to promote the health, safety, and general
welfare in the City and surrounding unincorporated area.
165.03 INTERPRETATION OF STANDARDS.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall
be held to be minimum requirements. Where this chapter imposes a greater
restriction than is imposed or required by other provisions of law or by other
rules or regulations or provisions of this Code of Ordinances, the provisions
of this chapter shall control. Where for a specific land use the requirements
of any other provision of this Code of Ordinances are more stringent or
restrictive than the requirements set forth herein, nothing herein shall be
construed to waive compliance with such other provision.
165.04 APPLICATION OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS.
The regulations within each district, as set by this chapter, shall be minimum
regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of structure or
land, and particularly, except as hereinafter provided:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â No building, structure, or land shall hereafter be used or occupied,
and no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected,
constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in conformity
with all the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is
located.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â No part of a yard or other open space or off-street parking or loading
space required about or in connection with any building for the purpose of
complying with this chapter shall be included as part of a yard, open space, or
off-street parking or loading space similarly required for any other building.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â No yard or lot existing at the time of passage of the zoning ordinance
codified in this chapter shall be reduced in dimension or area below the
minimum requirements set forth herein. Yards or lots created after the
effective date of such ordinance shall meet at least the minimum requirements
established by this chapter.
Whenever the requirements of this chapter are at variance with the requirements
of any other lawfully adopted rules, regulations, ordinances, deed
restrictions, or covenants, the most restrictive or that imposing the higher
standards shall govern. All structures existing as of the effective date of the
zoning ordinance, and which do not comply with the terms and conditions of this
chapter, shall be considered lawful and shall be allowed to continue and exist
or be reconstructed as they currently exist.
165.05 ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICT PROVISION FOR OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Official Zoning Map. The City shall be divided into districts, as shown
on the Official Zoning Map, which, together with all explanatory matter
thereon, shall be adopted by ordinance. The Official Zoning Map shall be
identified by the signature of the Mayor, attested by the City Clerk, under the
following words: This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map
referred to in Section 165.05 of Ordinance No.______ of the City of Adel, Iowa,
together with the date of adoption. If, in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter and Chapter 414, Code of Iowa, changes are made in district
boundaries or other matter portrayed on the Official Zoning Map, such changes
shall be entered on the Official Zoning Map promptly after the amendment has
been approved by the City Council, with an entry on the Official Zoning Map as
follows: By official action of the City Council, the following changes were
made in the Official Zoning Map. (Indicating the changes by ordinance number
and date of publication.) No amendment of this chapter which involves matter
portrayed on the Official Zoning Map shall become effective until after such
change and entry have been made on said map.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Replacement of the Official Zoning Map. In the event that the Official
Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost, or difficult to interpret because
of the nature or number of changes and additions, the City Council may, by
ordinance, adopt a new Official Zoning Map, which shall supersede the prior
Official Zoning Map. The new Official Zoning Map may correct drafting or other
errors or omissions in the prior Official Zoning Map, but no such correction
shall have the effect of amending the original Official Zoning Map or any
subsequent amendment thereof. The new Official Zoning Map shall be identified
by the signature of the Mayor, attested by the City Clerk, and bearing the Seal
of the City under the following words: This is to certify that this Official
Zoning Map supersedes and replaces the Official Zoning Map adopted as part of
Ordinance No.______ of the City of Adel, Iowa. Unless the prior Official Zoning
Map has been lost or has been totally destroyed, the prior map or any
significant parts thereof remaining shall be preserved, together with all
available records pertaining to its adoption or amendment.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Lands Within Two Miles of City. All regulations within this chapter
shall apply to lands within two miles of the City, generally described and
shown on the Official Zoning Map of the City. The exemption from regulation
granted by Section 358A.2 of the Code of Iowa to property used for agricultural
purposes shall apply to said unincorporated area.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â County Zoning. The specific regulations and districts hereunder shall
be terminated within three months of the establishment of the administrative
authority for County Zoning, or at such date as mutually agreed upon by the
City of Adel and County.
165.06 RULES FOR INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the
Official Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of
streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow such centerlines.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall
be construed as following such lot lines.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Boundaries indicated as approximately following City limits shall be
construed as following such City limits.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to
follow such shorelines, and in the event of change in the shoreline shall be
construed as moving with the actual shoreline; boundaries indicated as
approximately following the centerlines of streams, rivers, or other bodies of
water shall be construed to follow such centerlines.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated
in Subsections 1 through 3 above shall be so construed. Distances not
specifically indicated on the Official Zoning Map shall be determined by the
scale of the map.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at
variance with those shown on the Official Zoning Map, or in other circumstances
not covered in the previous section by Subsections 1 through 5 above, the Board
of Adjustment shall interpret the district boundaries.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Where a district boundary line divides a lot that was in single
ownership at the time of adoption of the zoning ordinance, the Board of
Adjustment may permit, as a special exception, the extension of the regulations
for either portion of the lot, not to exceed 50 feet beyond the district line
into the remaining portion of the lot.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Whenever the City Council vacates and disposes of a street or alley,
adjacent districts shall extend to the centerline of the vacation.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Whenever a variance exists between the Official Zoning Map and the
legal description on an amendment to this chapter, the legal description
applies.

provisions of this chapter are being violated, he or she shall in writing
notify the person responsible for the violation, shall indicate the specific
nature of the violation, and shall order the action necessary to correct the
violation. In case any building or structure is erected, constructed,

structure or land is used in violation of this chapter, the Zoning/Building
Administrator shall order the owner of the affected property to take such
actions as may be required to prevent such unlawful erection, construction,

prevent the occupancy of said building, structure, or land, or to prevent any

Classification Manual, 1972 and the 1977 Supplement thereto, as issued by the
U.S. Department of Commerce and on file in the office of the Department of

numbers, whose characteristics are described. Such group or industry code
numbers are listed in parenthesis as appropriate for ease of reference to the

permitted use it is intended that all individual uses listed by the SIC within
such group or subgroup be permitted unless otherwise stated, subject to all
requirements of this chapter. It is further intended that where an individual
use is listed as a permitted use only that use shall be permitted and all other
uses within the group or subgroup are expressly prohibited.

enforcement of, this chapter.
165.13 ISSUANCE OF CONDITIONAL AND PERMANENT ZONING/BUILDING PERMITS.
It is unlawful for any person to undertake the erection, moving, adding to, or

and/or Permanent Zoning/Building Permit shall have been issued by the Zoning/
Building Administrator, which Conditional/Special Use and/or Permanent Zoning/
Building Permit shall state that the proposed uses of the building or land
conform to the provisions of this chapter. Upon the completion of the
construction project, it is responsibility of the property owner and/or
contractor who applied for such permit, to contact the Zoning/Building
Administrator for a final review or inspection of the property. If the actual
uses of the building or land conform to the provisions of this chapter, the
Zoning/Building Administrator shall issue a Permanent Certificate of Occupancy.
If the actual uses do not conform to the provisions of this chapter, the
Zoning/Building Administrator shall order the owner to undertake such
corrective measures as will result in compliance. The Zoning/Building
Administrator shall maintain a record of all Conditional/Special Use and/or
Permanent Zoning/Building Permits, and copies shall be furnished upon request
to any person.
165.14 EXPIRATION OF CONDITIONAL AND PERMANENT ZONING/BUILDING PERMITS.

Building Permit has not begun within 180 days of its issuance, the permit shall
expire and it shall be canceled by the Zoning/Building Administrator. Written
notice of such cancellation shall be given to the applicant. If the work

Code of Iowa. Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term of any member
whose term becomes vacant. A majority of the members of the Board of Adjustment
shall be persons representing the public at large and shall not be involved in

provisions of this zoning ordinance. Meetings shall be held at the call of the
Chairperson and at such other time as the Board may determine. The Chairperson
or, in the Chairpersonâ€™s absence, the Acting Chairperson may administer oaths
and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings shall be open to the
public. The Board of Adjustment shall, through its Secretary, keep minutes of
its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question or if
absent or failing to vote indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its
examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately
filed in the office of the Board and shall be a public record. All actions of
the Board concerning special exceptions or variances shall also be recorded in
the office of the County Recorder. It shall be the responsibility of the
appellant to record said action and all corresponding stipulations and further
said action shall take effect upon the Board receiving sufficient confirmation
of the same. A copy of said action shall also be filed in the office of the
Zoning/Building Administrator.
165.17 BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT: POWERS AND DUTIES.
The Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers and duties:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Administrative Review. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by
the Zoning/Building Administrator in the enforcement of this chapter. Appeals
to the Board may be taken by any person aggrieved, or by any officer,
department, board or bureau of the City of Adel affected by any decision of the
administrative officer. Such appeal shall be taken within 60 days by filing
with the Zoning/Building Administrator, and with the Board a notice of appeal
specifying the grounds thereof. The Zoning/Building Administrator shall
forthwith transmit to the Board all papers constituting the record upon which
the action appealed is taken. The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the
hearing of the appeal, and give not less than seven or more than 20 daysâ€™
public notice in a paper of local circulation. At said hearing, any party may
appear in person, by agent or by attorney. An appeal stays all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed, unless the Zoning/Building Administrator
from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Board of Adjustment, after the
Notice of Appeal is filed with the Administrator, that by reason of facts
stated in the certificate, a stay would, in the Administratorâ€™s opinion, cause
imminent peril to life and property. In such case proceedings shall not be
stayed other than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Board of
Adjustment or by a court of record on application, on notice to the Zoning/
Building Administrator from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Special Exceptions: Conditions Governing Applications; Procedures. To
hear and decide only such special exceptions as the Board of Adjustment is
specifically authorized to pass on by the terms of this chapter, to decide such
questions as are involved in determining whether special exceptions should be
granted, and to grant special exceptions with such conditions and safeguards as
are appropriate under this chapter, or to deny special exceptions when not in
harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter. A special exception shall
not be granted by the Board of Adjustment unless and until:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A written application for a special exception is submitted
indicating the section of this chapter under which the special exception is
sought and stating the grounds on which it is requested.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the special
exception, and give not less than seven or more than 20 daysâ€™ public notice in
a paper of local circulation. At said hearing, any party may appear in person,
by agent or by attorney.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person, by
agent or attorney.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The Board of Adjustment shall make a finding that it is empowered
under the section of this chapter described in the application to grant the
special exception and that the granting of the special exception will not
adversely affect the public interest.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Variance, Conditions Governing Application; Procedures. To authorize
upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this chapter as
will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special
conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would
result in unnecessary hardship. A variance from the terms of this chapter shall
not be granted by the Board of Adjustment unless and until:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A written application for a variance is submitted demonstrating:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â That special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable
to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â That literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this chapter;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from
the actions of the applicant;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands,
structures, or buildings in the same district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings
in the same district, and no permitted or nonconforming use of land,
structures, or buildings in other districts may be considered grounds for the
issuance of a variance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the
variance, and give not less than seven or more than 20 daysâ€™ public notice in a
paper of local circulation. At said hearing, any party may appear in person, by
agent or by attorney.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person, by
agent or by attorney.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The Board of Adjustment shall make findings that requirements of
this section have been met by the applicant for a variance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The Board of Adjustment shall further make a finding that the
reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance, and
that the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the
reasonable use of land, building, or structure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â The Board of Adjustment shall further make a finding that the
granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of this chapter, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise
detrimental to the public welfare.
Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter.
Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this
chapter and punishable under this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Under no circumstances shall the Board of Adjustment grant a
variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this chapter in the
district involved or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the
terms of this chapter in said district.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Approved Action by Board. The concurring vote of a majority of members
of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or
determination of the Zoning/Building Administrator, or to decide in favor of
the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this
chapter, or to effect any variation in the application of this chapter.
165.18 APPEALS FROM THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
Any person or persons, or any taxpayer, department, board or bureau of the
City, or other areas subject to this chapter aggrieved by any decision of the
Board of Adjustment may seek review by a court of record of such decision in
the manner provided by the laws of the State or Iowa and particularly by
Chapter 414 of the Code of Iowa.
165.19 AMENDMENTS TO ZONING CODE.
The regulations, restrictions, and boundaries may, from time to time, be
amended, supplemented, changed, modified, or repealed, provided that at least
seven daysâ€™ notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in
a paper of general circulation in the City. In no case shall the notice be
published more than 20 days prior to the hearing. Notwithstanding Section 414.2
of the Code of Iowa, as a part of an ordinance changing land from one zoning
district to another zoning district or an ordinance approving a site
development plan, a Council may impose conditions on a property owner which are
in addition to existing regulations if the additional conditions have been
agreed to in writing by the property owner before the public hearing required
under this section or any adjournment of the hearing. The conditions must be
reasonable and imposed to satisfy public needs which are directly caused by the
requested change. In the case, however, of a written protest against a change
or repeal which is filed with the City Clerk and signed by the owners of 20
percent or more of the area of the lots included in the proposed change or
repeal, or by the owners of 20 percent or more of the property which is located
within 200 feet of the exterior boundaries of the property for which the change
or repeal is proposed, the change or repeal shall not become effective except
by the favorable vote of at least three-fourths of all the members of the
Council. The protest, if filed, must be filed before or at the public hearing.
Proposed amendments not recommended by the Planning and Zoning Commission shall
become effective only upon a favorable vote of three-fourths of the members of
the City Council. All zoning amendment application forms shall be approved by
resolution of the City Council.
165.20 COMPLAINTS REGARDING VIOLATIONS.
Whenever a violation of this chapter occurs, or is alleged to have occurred,
any person may file a written complaint. Such complaint, stating fully the
causes and basis thereof, shall be filed with the Zoning/Building
Administrator. The Administrator shall record properly such complaint,
immediately investigate, and take action thereon as provided by this chapter.
165.21 VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
Violation of the provisions of this chapter with any of its requirements
(including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection
with grants of variances or special exceptions) shall constitute a misdemeanor.
Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its
requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $100.00 or
imprisoned for not more than 30 days. Each day such violation continues shall
be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the
City from taking such other legal action as is necessary to prevent any
violation.
165.22 OTHER REMEDIES.
Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the City from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation of this
chapter. In case any building, structure, or sign is erected, constructed,
reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted, or maintained, or any building,
structure, sign, or land is used in violation of this chapter, the City, in
addition to other remedies, may institute any proper action or proceedings to
prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration,
repair, conversion, maintenance, or use, to restrain, correct, or abate such
violation, to prevent the occupancy of the building, structure, or land, or to
prevent any illegal act, conduct, business, or use in or about the premises.
165.23 INTENT OF NONCONFORMING LOTS, NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND, NONCONFORMING
STRUCTURES; NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES AND PREMISES AND NONCONFORMING
CHARACTERISTICS OF USE.
Within the districts established by this chapter there exist lots, structures,
uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful
before the zoning ordinance was passed or amended, but which are prohibited,
regulated, or restricted under the terms of the ordinance or future amendments.
It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue
until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. Further
nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, or used as
grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter and upon which actual building
construction has been carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby
defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position
and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal
of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding,
such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual
construction, provided that work shall be carried on diligently.
165.24 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family
dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of
record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, provided
other limitations imposed by this chapter are complied with. This provision
shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or
width, or both, if the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in
which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only
through the action of the Board of Adjustment except that in the case of
destruction, the same dimensions of any building comprising the same location
may be permitted.
165.25 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
Where at the time of passage of the zoning ordinance lawful use of land exists
which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by the ordinance, and
where such use involves no individual structure with a replacement cost
exceeding $1,000.00, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, provided:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased or extended to
occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of the zoning ordinance.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of the zoning ordinance.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of 12 months, then any subsequent and future use of such land shall
conform to the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which
such land is located.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this
chapter shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.
165.26 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment
of the zoning ordinance which could not be built under the terms of the
ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its
location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such
structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in such a
way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may
be altered to decrease its nonconformity.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of
structure be destroyed by any means or to any extent, it shall be allowed to be
reconstructed to its previous dimensions or to dimensions which decrease the
nonconformity, except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
165.27 NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND PREMISES IN
COMBINATION.
If lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement cost of
$1,000.00 or more, or of structure and premises in combination, exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that would not be
allowed in the district under the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by the zoning
ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use
permitted in the district in which it is located.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of the zoning ordinance, but no such use shall be
extended to occupy any land outside such building.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises, may as a special exception be changed to
another nonconforming use provided that the Board of Adjustment, either by
general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the
proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than

165.48 SUPPLEMENTARY DISTRICT REGULATIONS.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Building Lines on Approved Plats. Whenever the plat of a land
subdivision approved by the Planning Commission and on record in the office of
the County Recorder shows a building line along and frontage for the purpose of
creating a front yard or side street yard line, the building line thus shown
shall apply along such frontage in place of any other yard line required in
this chapter.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Structures to Have Access. Every building hereafter erected or moved
shall be on a lot adjacent to a public street or with access to an approved
private street, and all structures shall be located on lots so as to provide
safe and convenient access for servicing, fire protection, and required off-
street parking.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Erection of More Than One Principal Structure on a Lot. In any
district, more than one structure, housing a permitted or permissible principal
use, may be erected on a single lot, provided that yard and other requirements
of this chapter shall be met for each structure as though it were on an
individual lot.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Accessory Buildings. No accessory building shall be erected in any
required front yard, and no separate accessory building shall be erected within
10 feet of a main building. No accessory building shall be closer than five
feet to the rear or side lot line except that where a garage is entered
perpendicular or near perpendicular directly from an alley, the setback shall
be 15 feet. Accessory buildings located in the rear yard may not occupy more
than 35 percent of the rear yard and the aggregate of all accessory buildings
shall not exceed 750 square feet. No accessory building shall be used without
occupancy of the principal building, and no accessory building shall exceed 18
feet in average height. Garages are limited to 1,200 square feet for lot size
of less than one acre and 2,400 square feet for lot size of one acre or more

(first) floor may project into a required yard, provided these projections are
distant at least two feet from the adjacent side lot line.
Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â Utility Service Lines. Nothing in this chapter shall have the effect
of prohibiting utility service lines.
Â Â Â 13.Â Â Â Paving in Front Yards. Not more than 30 percent of the front yard of
any single-family residence shall be paved, provided that this shall not be
construed to prevent a two-car driveway together with a paved apron leading to
parking space located behind the minimum setback line.
Â Â Â 14.Â Â Â Swimming Pools. Private portable swimming pools, hot tubs, spas, and
similar recreational appurtenances shall not be allowed in front yards. Private
permanent swimming pools shall only be allowed in the back yard. Further, all

Â Â Â 15.Â Â Â Yards and Visibility. On a corner lot in any district, nothing shall
be erected, placed, planted or allowed to grow in such a manner as materially
to impede vision between a height of three and ten feet above the centerline

such corner lots and a line joining points along said street lines twenty-five
feet from the point of the intersection.
Â Â Â 16.Â Â Â Propane Tanks. Propane tanks shall be located in compliance with State
of Iowa requirements and regulations.

permitted.
Â Â Â 18.Â Â Â Free-Standing Carports. Free-standing carports are prohibited.
165.49 ZERO LOT LINE CRITERIA.
Utilization of the zero lot line regulations under this chapter requires the
approval of the entire subdivision in which a zero lot line unit is to be
proposed. Approval of subdivisions shall be limited to generally undeveloped
areas and the review shall follow the procedures required for all rezoning
proposals. Approval of a subdivision for zero lot line regulations shall be so
designated by the symbol ZL following the subdivision name on the district map.
A duplex may be built which utilizes zero lot line regulations when all of the
following conditions have been met:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Each dwelling unit is attached on the side and only one side to the
other dwelling unit and further that the side property line divides each
dwelling unit.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The applicant provides to the City Council and records in the office of
the County Recorder acceptable covenant and deed restrictions on all properties
that are proposed for zero lot line designation, which includes the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Provision for access to the abutting property for the adjacent
property owner and/or representative for the purpose of construction,
reconstruction, repair, and maintenance of the side which all abut the common
lot line.

subsequent changes to any covenants and deed restrictions, but is not a third
party in enforcement of said covenants and deed restrictions.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Restrictions shall be provided to limit changes of color, material, and
design of the dwelling as to be compatible with the attached unit.

165.52 PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
The purpose of this district is to promote and encourage development or
redevelopment of tracts of land on a planned, unified basis by allowing greater
flexibility and diversification than is normally permitted by conventional
single lot development in other zoning districts because of the substantial
public advantages of planned development. Although Planned Unit Developments
(PUDs) may appear to deviate in certain respects from a literal interpretation
of the comprehensive plan, regulations adapted to such unified planning and
development are intended both to accomplish the purposes of zoning and other
applicable regulations to an equivalent or higher degree than where such
regulations are designed to control unscheduled development on individual lots,
and to promote economical and efficient land use through an improved level of
amenities, appropriate and harmonious variety, creative design, and a better
living environment.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Where Permitted. Planned Unit Developments shall be permitted on any
two-acre or larger tract of land that has been zoned or rezoned for PUD
purposes by the Council. Said PUDs may consist of residential, commercial,
industrial, public, semi-public and/or conservancy land uses.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Procedure.
A.Â Â Â Pre-application Conference. In order to eliminate unnecessary expenditures
of time and money, the developer shall first schedule a pre-application
conference with the Code Compliance Officer, who shall involve representatives
of other departments as deemed appropriate. The Code Compliance Officer may
require submittal of a generalized sketch plan providing such information as
follows:
(1)Â Â Â Location and size of the overall site, and of the individual types of
development or uses proposed within the site.
(2)Â Â Â Existing topography, indicating major earthwork areas, storm water runoff
and detention considerations, floodplains, and any problem areas.
(3)Â Â Â Existing trees masses, geological and environmentally important
characteristics.
(4)Â Â Â Generalized vehicular and pedestrian systems and parking areas.
(5)Â Â Â Generalized building locations.
(6)Â Â Â Approximate gross density, and number and types of dwelling units in
accordance with the comprehensive plan; approximate gross floor areas of
commercial and industrial land use.
(7)Â Â Â Generalized utility line considerations with sanitary sewer capacity
limitations so noted.
(8)Â Â Â Generalized public and private ownership boundaries, including common
ownership areas, if any.
The Code Compliance Officer shall have 15 days in which to review and comment
on the pre-application sketch plan. Following the departmentâ€™s review, the
developer may request an informal consideration of the proposal by the
Commission. Said consideration shall be non-binding on either party.
B.Â Â Â Application for Rezoning. Following the pre-application conference the
applicant shall submit a petition for rezoning in accordance with standard City
procedures for rezoning, accompanied by a master plan and related documents
containing the information required by other paragraphs of this section, and
required fees. The petition and master plan shall be referred to the Commission
for study and report, and for public hearing as required by this Zoning
Ordinance for rezoning. The Commission shall review the master plan for
conformity to the standards of this section, and may approve the plan as
submitted; require the petitioner to modify, alter, adjust, or amend the plan
as deemed necessary to preserve the intent and purpose of this section to
promote public health, safety, morals and general welfare; or recommend that it
be denied. The action of the Commission shall be reported to the City Council,
whereupon the Council may approve or disapprove the petition and master plan as
reported or may require such changes thereto as deemed necessary to effectuate
the intent and purpose of this section. All public hearings shall be scheduled
as soon as possible after all required information has been submitted. The
Commission shall report their findings to the Council in a timely manner. In
the event they fail to take action within sixty days after the date of the
public hearing, the petitioner or anyone located within the notification area
as defined for rezoning may request in writing that the Commission complete
their considerations. The Commission shall then take action within the next
thirty days and report their findings to the Council for consideration by the
Council, unless the Council expressly grants the Commission additional time to
complete negotiations, studies, or other items necessary.
C.Â Â Â Final Plans. Final plans for the Planned Unit Development shall be
comprised of site plans and/or preliminary and final subdivision plats as
appropriate to the situation due to requirements of the site planning and
subdivision ordinances or specific provisions of the master plan. Such site
plans and plats shall contain all information and be processed in the manner
set forth in said ordinances, in addition to complying with any specific
provisions of the master plan, and shall generally comply with the development
concepts outlined in the master plan. No public notice or hearing shall be
required for final plans unless required by the master plan or caused to be
required by the Commission or Council as deemed appropriate, provided that
deviation from the master plan may be permitted as refinements to the design
and planning if not defined by this Zoning Ordinance as a substantial
modification requiring amendment to the master plan. Such deviations shall be
expressly set out and shall be approved by the Commission and Council. Final
plans may cover all or part of the Planned Unit Development, provided that a
final plan covering only a part of a PUD is hereby defined as a phase
irrespective of contrary provisions by the master plan and shall demonstrate
the ability to be self-sustaining in terms of access, services, utilities, open
space, economic viability, and other major considerations. If it is the desire
of the petitioner, preliminary plat and/or final site plan approval may be
obtained at the time of the master plan approval by expressly declaring such
intent and filing all information required by the subdivision and site planning
ordinances. Final site plan approval shall not be granted for an unplatted
parcel. Upon approval of final plans, building permits shall be issued in the
same manner as for building permits generally. In any event where platting is
required, no building permits shall be issued until the final plat is approved
and recorded and all other requirements complied with. Final plans shall be
binding on the petitioner and any and all successors in title so long as PUD
zoning applies to the land, unless amended in accordance with the procedures
set forth.
D.Â Â Â Amendments or Modifications. Substantial modification to the master plan
shall be processed in the same manner as a rezoning and additionally shall
comply with the provisions of paragraph B above. Notice and public hearing
requirements and the effect of a denial shall be the same as for a rezoning,
provided that the notification area shall be those property owners legally
required to be notified as opposed to the entire PUD.
Further provided, in the event a requested amendment for a portion of the
entire PUD is denied, such action shall not create any limitations under
rezoning procedure on the filling of an amendment to another portion of the PUD
having a substantially different notification area. Any ambiguities or disputes
between this section and procedures for rezoning shall be resolved in favor of
the more restrictive requirements. Substantial modifications are hereby defined
to include, but are not limited to, the following: increased density;
intensification of use by changing to a lower classification, with conventional
single family being the highest classification and progressing to attached
single-family, multiple-family, commercial offices, retail, warehousing, and
light industry, to heavy industry; addition of uses, or elimination of
conditions or restrictions on a use or uses; increased floor area ratios, or
other modifications considered probable to generate increased traffic, sewage,
water consumption, or other detrimental conditions; significant modifications
to peripheral buffering or screening, setbacks, height, locations of buildings,
drives, or other improvements, which were intended for protection of proximate
properties, provided that substitution of equivalent screening materials shall
not be considered a substantial modification; modifications to the street
pattern, such as that of major streets or continuations of existing streets,
which will have a demonstrable impact on traffic flow such as to effectively
change the functional classification of the street; modifications to access
which may lead to increased congestion, or to additional commercial or
industrial traffic on a local residential street; or other changes deemed
substantial by the Code Compliance Officer. Modifications to final plans shall
follow the procedures of the site planning or subdivision ordinances, as
appropriate, except in the case of a substantial modification as defined above.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Information Required on Master Plan. The following information, plans
and maps shall be submitted as part of the application for a Planned Unit
Development:

L.Â Â Â A statement of intent with regard to selling or leasing all or portions of
the proposed development.
M.Â Â Â Proposed energy conservation methods, such as siting or design or
structures.
N.Â Â Â Proposed phasing timetable.
The above information should be shown in a clear and logical manner at a
legible scale. Sheet size should not exceed 24 inches by 36 inches for paper
copies and Mylar reproducible sheets. The final document is required to be a
PDF file that contains all pages of the PUD.
Generally, existing conditions should be illustrated on a separate sheet for
sake of clarity, although existing topography, access, utility and sewer lines
and other items that are appropriate for understanding the proposal should also
appear on the proposed development plan. It is strongly recommended that an
architect, landscape architect, and civil engineer be employed to prepare the
plans. The Commission or Council may require any additional information which
may be needed to evaluate the proposed PUD on the basis of special or
unforeseen circumstances, or may waive any of the above requirements if it is
found that such information is unnecessary to properly evaluate the proposed
PUD.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Development Controls. Although PUDs are intended to promote and permit
flexibility of design and thereby may involve modifications of conventional
regulations or standards, certain requirements which are set forth below shall
be applied to ensure that the development is compatible with the intent of this
Zoning Ordinance.
A.Â Â Â Any use that is approved and made a part of the master plan, subject to
any conditions attached thereto, shall be permitted.
B.Â Â Â Height, setback, bulk, and other requirements set out in the master plan
shall constitute the basis for and become the zoning requirement for that
particular PUD, provided that refinements may be made through final plan
approval if not defined as a substantial modification; in lack of any special
provisions set out in the master plan, the requirements of the most proximate
zoning district, as defined by use, shall be applied.
C.Â Â Â Project phases shall be substantially and functionally self-contained and
self-sustaining with regard to access, parking, utilities, open space,
screening and transitional elements and other support features, and be capable
of supporting required operation and maintenance activities; temporary
provisions, such as turnarounds or access easements, may be required for this
purpose; the initial phases generally should not be comprised of the most
intensive portions of the PUD, unless the City concurs this is the most
feasible means of developing the property in terms of access, sewer service, or
similar physical constraints, or will permit earlier development of common
amenities.
D.Â Â Â Attention shall be given to mitigation of existing or potential land use
conflicts through proper orientation, open space setbacks, landscaping and
screening, grading, traffic circulation and architectural compatibility. It is
the intent of this section to recognize that appropriate use of design
techniques will provide the required mitigation, and thereby eliminate the need
for certain conventional regulations or standards. Examples of design
techniques, not requirements, are: orienting views, access, and principal
activities away from the land use needing protection by placing those least
compatible activities farthest from the common boundary and those compatible
nearest to create an effective buffer; using setbacks in conjunction with
landscaping can mitigate conflicts by providing a visual buffer, controlling
pedestrian access, softening visual contrast by subduing differences in
architecture and bulk, and reducing heat generated by development, and the use
of dense landscaping can reduce the width of physical separations needed for
such purposes; the use of proper grading will control drainage, can alter
views, subdue sound, and channel access; fences, walls and berms can be used to
channel access and control visual, sound and light pollution; proper
architectural use of color, bulk, materials and shape will enhance
compatibility and reduce contrast, although details added to the building for
esthetic purpose without consideration to form and surroundings may be
detrimental rather than helpful; and proper design of pedestrian ways, streets
and points of access and proper location of parking areas, will reduce
congestion and safety hazards and help prevent introduction of noise,
pollutants and other conflicts into areas with less intensive land use. Other
techniques may also be used.
E.Â Â Â Permanent care and maintenance of common elements such as open space,
recreation amenities, and others shall be provided in a legally binding form.
If the common elements are to be maintained by a home ownersâ€™ association, the
applicant shall file the proposed documents governing the association for
review by legal counsel for compliance with the following requirements at the
time the final plat or site plan is filed:
(1)Â Â Â Membership shall be mandatory for each buyer and any successive buyer.
(2)Â Â Â The open space restrictions shall be in perpetuity, or automatically
renewable, and shall not terminate except by approval of both the ownersâ€™
association and the City;
(3)Â Â Â The ownersâ€™ association shall be responsible for liability insurance,
local taxes, and the maintenance of recreational and other facilities not
dedicated to the City;
(4)Â Â Â Owners shall pay their pro rata share of the cost or the assessment
levied by the association shall become a lien on the property;
(5)Â Â Â The association shall be able to adjust the assessment to meet changes
needed;
(6)Â Â Â No change in open space use or dissolution of the ownersâ€™ association
shall occur without approval by the City.
F.Â Â Â Performance bonds or other security acceptable to the City may be required
to ensure completion of recreational amenities provided in lieu of public
facilities, or for mitigating elements such as screening or public
improvements.
G.Â Â Â Except where the City agrees to other arrangements, a PUD shall be
comprised of a single owner, or a group of owners acting as a partnership or
corporation with each agreeing in advance to be bound by the conditions which
will be effective in the PUD.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Validity. In the event the first development phase has not commenced
within two years after the date of rezoning, or if subsequent phases are
delayed more than two years beyond the indicated development schedule, the
developer shall file appropriate information detailing the reasons for the
delay with the City. The Code Compliance Officer shall review the circumstances
and prepare a report recommending appropriate action to be taken concerning the
PUD.
The Planning and Zoning Commission and Council shall review the matter, and may
continue the PUD zoning with revised time limits; require that appropriate
amendments be made or action taken, such amendments to comply with the
procedures of this section if deemed substantial; continue with PUD zoning for
part of the area, with or without revised time limits, and initiate rezoning of
the remainder to an appropriate district; or initiate rezoning of the entire
parcel to an appropriate district, provided that the rezoning shall not be to a
zone more restrictive than the one applied immediately prior to the rezoning to
PUD except after comprehensive planning analysis. The Commission and Council
may schedule such public hearings as deemed appropriate. Approval of a final
site plan or preliminary plat shall be deemed to commence development, provided
that the permanent placement of construction materials shall have started and
be proceeding without delay within two years after the date of site plan
approval, and a final plat approved and filed with the Dallas County Clerk and
Recorder within one year after the date of preliminary plat approval in the
event a site plan is not required. Failure to comply with this provision shall
void the site plan and preliminary plat approvals, and make the PUD subject to
review as provided above. It shall be the responsibility of the developer to
comply with all prescribed time limits without notice from the City.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Application to Existing PUD Districts. Existing PUD districts shall
comply with the requirements and provisions of this section, provided that no
additional filings shall be required to maintain current valid status, and no
currently expired approvals shall be deemed to have been reapproved by passage
of this section. Validity of existing PUDs shall be computed according to the
time limits set forth herein from the effective date of the ordinance codified
in this section.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Fees.
A.Â Â Â Before any action shall be taken as provided in this section, the party or
parties proposing the change shall pay the fee as established by the City
Council Resolution.
B.Â Â Â Under no condition shall said sum or any part thereof be refunded for
failure of such rezoning or substantial modification to be enacted into law.
C.Â Â Â Site plans and subdivisions in a PUD shall be subject to the normal fees
for such filings.
165.53 ADMINISTRATION: DUTIES OF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL, BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT,
CITY COMMISSION AND COURTS ON MATTER OF APPEAL.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Enforcement and Interpretation. All questions of interpretation and
enforcement shall be first presented to the Zoning/Building Administrator, or

shall be published in a paper of general circulation in the City. In no case
shall the notice be published more than 20 days prior to the hearing.
Notwithstanding Section 414.2, as a part of an ordinance changing land from one
zoning district to another zoning district or an ordinance approving a site
development plan, the Council may impose conditions on a property owner which
are in addition to existing regulations if the additional conditions have been
agreed to in writing by the property owner before the public hearing required
under this section or any adjournment of the hearing. The conditions must be
reasonable and imposed to satisfy public needs which are directly caused by the
requested change. In the case, however, of a written protest against a change
or repeal which is filed with the City Clerk and signed by the owners of twenty
percent or more of the area of the lots included in the proposed change or
repeal, or by the owners of twenty percent or more of the property that is
located within two hundred feet of the exterior boundaries of the property for
which the change or repeal is proposed, the change or repeal shall not become
effective except by the favorable vote of at least three-fourths of all the
members of the Council. The protest, if filed, must be filed before or at the
public hearing. Proposed amendments not recommended by the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall become effective only upon a favorable vote of three-fourths
of the members of the City Council. All zoning amendment application forms
shall be approved by resolution of the Council.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Violations. Violation of the provisions of this chapter with any of its

connection with grants of variances or special exceptions) shall constitute a
misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any
of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than
$100.00. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate
offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City from taking such other
legal action as is necessary to prevent any violation.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Schedule of Fees, Charges, and Expenses. The City Council shall
establish a schedule of fees, charges, and expenses and a collection procedure
for zoning district changes, zoning permits, appeals, and other matters
pertaining to this chapter. The schedule of fees shall be posted in the office
of the Zoning/Building Administrator and the City Clerk and may be altered or
amended only by the Council, as recommended by the Commission.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Complaints Regarding Violations. Whenever a violation of this chapter
occurs, or is alleged to have occurred, any person may file a written
complaint. Such complaint, stating fully the causes and basis thereof, shall be
filed with the Zoning/Building Administrator. The Administrator shall record
properly such complaint, immediately investigate, and take action thereon as
provided by this chapter.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Repeal of Conflicting Ordinances; When Effective. All ordinances or
parts of ordinances in conflict with the Zoning Ordinance are hereby repealed
to the extent necessary to give this chapter full force and effect. This
chapter shall become effective upon publication.

165.55 FENCE AND WALL REGULATIONS.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Permit Required. It is unlawful for any person to construct, alter, or
relocate any fence or landscape wall within the City without first obtaining
the appropriate permit as required by the Zoning Code.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Definition. For the purpose of this chapter it is understood that the
terms fence and wall are synonymous and herein defined as a barrier consisting
of wood, stone or metal intended to prevent ingress or egress, and/or enhance
the appearance of the structure of the landscape.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Materials.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Fences are to be constructed of customarily used materials such as
chain link, wood, wrought iron, aluminum or polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Walls are
to be constructed of brick, stone, textured concrete, precast concrete, tile
block, and similar materials as approved by the building inspector.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Prohibited Materials: A fence or wall may not be designed to cause
pain or injury to humans or animals. Therefore, the use of spikes, broken
glass, barbed wire, razor wire, nails, electrical charge or other similar
materials shall be prohibited, unless specified otherwise herein.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â No woven, twisted, welded or interlaced wire fence shall be erected
and/or located in a residential or commercial district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Barbed Wire and Electrical Fencing: In agriculture and conservation
districts, barbed wire, woven wire, and electrical fencing are permitted,
subject to a minimum setback of 10 feet, and only when used to contain
livestock or to protect crops and plantings in areas containing 10 acres or
more.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â General Requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Fences may be erected along the side and rear property lines in all
districts. In accord with paragraph B of this subsection, the property owner
installing the fence must ensure there is a means for maintaining both sides of
the fence subject to State and local laws and ordinances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â It is the property ownerâ€™s responsibility to maintain the fence on
both sides.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The decorative, finished side of all wood fences must be facing out
(away from the home).
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â No chain link or wired fence of any kind shall be constructed or
maintained with the cut or selvage end of the fencing material exposed at the
top.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â All fences shall be maintained and kept safe and in a state of good
repair.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The property owner erecting the fence is solely responsible for
ensuring the fence is located on his/her property in accordance with the
provisions of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Fences may not be constructed within one-foot inside a public
sidewalk.
Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â No fence shall be constructed in a front yard that is more than 75%
solid or opaque.
Â Â Â Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Fences may not be constructed on lots unless a primary building is
in place, with the exception of a temporary fence for safety as approved by the
City or Zoning Administrator.
Â Â Â Â Â Â J.Â Â Â The City does not enforce restrictive covenants in place and on file
with the County Recorder. Property owners shall be aware of all restrictive
covenants for their platted subdivision.
Â Â Â Â Â Â K.Â Â Â No fence shall be constructed within the clear zone.
Â Â Â Â Â Â L.Â Â Â Fences or walls may be erected in easements in accordance with the
provisions of this section except that no fence or wall may be erected without
the approval of the City Building Inspector and as a condition of that approval
the Building Inspector may require that the applicant acknowledge the rights of
the City as an easement holder and waive any and all damages that might be
otherwise accrued if the City shall need to remove the fence or wall in the
exercise of its rights under the terms of the easement.Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â M.Â Â Â Decorative features such as individual posts, trellises, brick or
stone columns, and similar features constructed as part of a fence shall be
allowed to exceed the maximum fence height by no more than 12 inches.
Decorative features shall not be counted toward the open space percentage of
the fence. Pedestrian entry features which only include arbors, arched entries,
arcades or finials may exceed the maximum allowable fence height in any yard
subject to design review and approval by the Building Inspector.Â 
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Nonconforming Fences. Any fence existing within the City on the
effective date of this section must be maintained, but alterations,
modifications or improvements of more than 50 percent of said fence shall
require the owner to bring the fence into compliance with this section if it is
not already in compliance.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Height and Vision Clearance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The following are the height restrictions in all residential and
commercial districts for fences and walls:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â No fence or wall in any required front yard may exceed four feet
in height. Corner lots with two front yards shall be allowed to have a six-foot
tall fence located in the front yard with the smallest frontage. Such fence
shall be set back a minimum of 10 feet from the property line or adjacent
sidewalk; or in line with the home on the side. All other requirements of this
section apply to a fence on a corner lot.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Fences or walls along the side yard limits shall not exceed six
feet in height. The fence or wall on a side yard may be erected to a height of

165.56 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
This division provides for the administration and enforcement of site plans by
establishing minimum standards for site and building design. The purpose of
this division is to provide guidance and standards for development within the
City in order to guide development in a manner which is conducive to protecting
the health, safety, and general welfare of residents and property owners within
the City. All development and redevelopment of land or property within the City
shall minimize the adverse effects placed upon adjacent properties by
maintaining or improving upon the aesthetic quality of the surrounding area,
and by providing adequate traffic safety, emergency access, water supply,
sewage disposal, management of storm water, erosion and sediment control. Site
plan review and approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be
required of all principal structures other than individual single-family and
two-family residential dwellings in any zoning district. An applicant may
appeal a denial of any site plan application to the City Council.
(Ord. 377 - Jan. 22 Supp.)
165.57 JURISDICTION.
No permit shall be issued for any lot or development requiring the approval of
a site plan except in conformity with this chapter. No development, except
where specified herein, may be created, substantially improved, converted,
enlarged, or otherwise altered without conforming to the provisions of this
chapter, all applicable provisions of the Code of Iowa, as amended, and all
other applicable provisions of this Code of Ordinances, as amended.
(Ord. 377 - Jan. 22 Supp.)
165.58 PROCEDURES.
The property owner, developer, or other representing party on behalf of a
property owner interested in the development of land within the City shall
adhere to the procedures identified in this chapter, in accordance with all
other applicable sections of this Code of Ordinances.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Pre-Application Conference. It is recommended that prior to the
submission of any site plan application a meeting be scheduled with the Zoning
administrative official and other appropriate City department representatives.
The purpose of this conference shall be to discuss the feasibility of the
proposal and to provide the owner with information and guidance regarding
applicable City ordinances, specifications, standards, and procedures, before
the owner enters into binding commitments or incurs substantial expenses. In
addition, the administrative official will identify a development review
schedule best suited to accommodate the applicantâ€™s time schedule and the
Cityâ€™s ability to effectively review the proposal.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Development Review. In order to properly review a site plan proposal,
the applicant shall provide the City with information determined to be
applicable to the project by the Zoning administrative official. Once the
proposal has provided all of the necessary information meeting the requirements
of all applicable City ordinances, the proposal shall be brought before the
Planning and Zoning Commission. Action of the Planning and Zoning Commission
shall be approval, approval subject to conditions, denial, or table for further
review. An applicant may appeal a denial of any site plan application to the
City Council. Development review shall exist as a measurement determined by the
City to meet the objectives outlined by the Envision Adel 2040 Comprehensive
Plan.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Validity of Approval. A site plan shall become effective upon
certification of approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The Planning
and Zoning Commission approval of any site plan required by this chapter shall
remain valid for one year, allowing one one-year extension with approval of the
Planning and Zoning Commission, after which time the site plan shall be deemed
null and void if the development has not been established or actual
construction commenced. For the purpose of this chapter, â€œactual constructionâ€
means that the permanent placement of construction materials has started and is
proceeding without undue delay. Preparation of plans, securing financial
arrangements, issuance of building permits, letting of contracts, grading of
property, or stockpiling of materials on the site do not constitute actual
construction. At the time of site plan approval, the Planning and Zoning
Commission may grant an exemption on the time construction must begin after
their approval is given for a utility service structure.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Amendment. Any site plan may be amended in accordance with the
standards and procedures established herein, including payment of fees,
provided that the Zoning administrative official may waive such procedures for
those minor changes hereinafter listed. Such minor changes shall not be made
unless the prior written approval for such changes is obtained from the Zoning
administrative official. No fees shall be required for such minor changes.
Minor changes include: (i) moving building walls within the confines of the
smallest rectangle that would have enclosed each original approved building;
(ii) relocation of building entrances or exits and shortening of building
canopies; (iii) changing to a more restrictive commercial or industrial use,
provided the number of off-street parking spaces meets the requirement of the
Adel zoning ordinance (this does not apply to residential uses); (iv) changing
angle of parking or aisle, provided there is no reduction in the amount of off-
street parking as originally approved; (v) substituting plant species, provided
a landscape architect, engineer or architect certifies the substituted species
is similar in nature and screening effect.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Existing Development. Any improvement or maintenance to any structure
or site feature must not cause the site or building to become non-compliant
with the regulations set forth in this chapter. If the site or building is
already non-compliant, the change to the building or site proposed by the owner
must not cause them to become more non-compliant. In such instances,
improvements shall be completed in a manner which makes the building, site, or
related items more compliant with the current provisions of this chapter than
they were previous to the improvements. Any improvement proposed to modify the
size of a building, lot, parking area, etc. shall be submitted for review by
the City. If the proposed improvement modifies the size of a building or lot by
less than 25 percent, it shall be submitted for review by City staff and
approved or disapproved by City staff. The Zoning administrative official shall
have the authority to require such a project be reviewed by the Planning and
Zoning Commission if they feel such review is warranted. If the proposed change
is in excess of 25 percent, it shall be submitted for full review and approval
or disapproval by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Nonconforming Uses. Any site or building use permitted under a previous
zoning districtâ€™s regulation shall conform to the regulations of this chapter
under the current site and building design provisions determined to be most
applicable to the nonconforming use by the administrative official.

165.62 SITE AND BUILDING DESIGN STANDARDS.
The following are applicable for all structures and sites proposed in all
zoning districts other than individual single-family or two-family dwellings,
which do not require approval of a site plan.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Review Process.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â As part of the site plan review process, an applicant shall provide
colored architectural elevation drawings for each elevation of the building or
buildings proposed for new construction, addition, alteration, or the like.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The elevation drawings should be provided in 11 by 17-inch format
and digital format unless otherwise approved by the Zoning administrative
official.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Each elevation drawing should include massing dimensions and
callouts of the proposed materials indicated on the elevation. A percentage
breakdown of proposed materials shall be provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â In the event that accessory structures are proposed as a part of the
site plan review process, the Zoning administrative official shall have the
ability to request elevation drawings or colored details of said accessory
structures to ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â At the time of site plan and elevation drawing presentation to the
Planning and Zoning Commission, the applicant may be required to provide
material and color samples of all proposed exterior finishes.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Architectural and Site Design Characteristics â€“ General Provisions for
All Districts.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Connection and Circulation. Sites shall be designed with integrated
sidewalks, walkways, and paths to provide continuous circulation throughout the
site connecting principal structures, dwelling units, parking areas, parking
garages, and other prominent features. Pedestrian connections shall be made
between the internal circulation system and the adjacent public sidewalk or
trail systems.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Screening. Ground mounted utility and mechanical units (condensers,
cooling equipment, generators, meter clusters, transformers, ventilation units,
etc.) shall be adequately screened from public view through the use of walls,
hedges, or other landscape treatment that provide year-round screening. Walls
shall be consistent in architectural style and material to the principal
building. Roof mounted utility and mechanical units (condensers, cooling
equipment, generators, ventilation units, antennas, satellite dishes, etc.)
shall be screened from public view by the use of an opaque screening material
compatible with and integrated into the overall design of the building.
Architectural metal paneling, roof parapet or a combination of the two shall be
considered. Garbage dumpsters and trash receptacles shall be screened through
the use of an enclosure comprised of materials consistent with the principal
building. Where possible an enclosure shall be integral with a building. An
enclosure shall be placed outside of a front yard.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Outdoor Storage and Display.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Outdoor storage and display areas shall be approved as a part of
the site plan review process. In the event that a new or additional storage or
display area is deemed necessary by a property owner for an existing site where
a site plan has already been approved, a site plan meeting the criteria of this
section shall be provided for review and approval by the administrative
official.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All outdoor storage and display areas shall be designed and
placed so as not to impede or pose a threat to existing or planned pedestrian,
automobile, and emergency access routes through a site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Outdoor storage and display areas shall not occupy any portion
of required open space, buffers, off-street parking areas, or other such
required site conditions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Outdoor storage areas shall be provided on a paved surface with
perimeter fencing, landscaping, or related treatment necessary to secure and
integrate the storage area with the remainder of the site. An opaque screen
shall be provided to adequately screen the storage area from a public street
right-of-way or an adjacent zoning district different from the site. Wood
privacy fence or chain link fencing shall not be allowed for screening outdoor
storage areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Exterior Color. The use of bright, bold, or vibrant colors shall be
consistent with the surrounding area and used primarily in accent materials or
similar applications that are not determined to conflict with neighboring
properties or circumvent the Sign Ordinance. This shall not restrict the use of
such colors on multiple material applications if deemed to align with the area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â 360 Architecture. All buildings shall be designed with a consistent
level of detail and interest on all sides.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Architectural and Site Design Characteristics. The regulations
specified under this district shall apply to townhome, row dwelling, and multi-
family dwellings within an R-4 (Multi-family Residential District) and R-5
(Townhouse Residential District) zoning district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All townhome, row, and multi-family dwellings proposed within the
same development shall have a unified architectural theme. Sites where four or
more buildings are proposed shall provide slight differentiation in design
amongst buildings of the same size or number of units to provide for a higher
level of architectural design for the site as a whole.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Each townhome or row dwelling faÃ§ade shall be divided into a maximum
of 20-foot linear sections. Multi-family faÃ§ades shall be divided into a
maximum of 40-foot linear sections. This requirement may be accomplished by the
use of:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Window bays.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Articulation in roof lines through the use of dormers or gables.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Variation in building offsets.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The division of continuous materials.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The use of architectural accents such as chimneys, balconies,
pediments, columns, cornice lines, or moldings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Each building shall be designed with same level of architectural
style on all sides. For townhomes and row dwellings, a minimum of 20% of the
front faÃ§ade shall be comprised of brick and/or stone. For multi-family
developments, a minimum of 35% of the total area of building elevations shall
be comprised of brick and/or stone. In calculating wall surfaces, windows and
doors shall not be considered within the calculation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Exterior building materials along elevations which adjoin a public
or private street shall employ a variety of textures and colors as well as
window and door details.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Variation in building materials used shall take place with the
change in building plane. However, the change in materials shall keep with the
chosen architectural theme.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Any garage door proposed within a townhome, row dwelling, or multi-
family structure shall be integrated into the faÃ§ade so as not to become a
prominent element of the dwelling. Garages proposed within a townhome, row
dwelling or multi-family development shall be integrated into the design of the
overall building and shall incorporate architectural details. This shall be
accomplished with the use of windows, decorative hardware, recessed garage
doors, roof canopies, trellises, columns, trim details, offsets between garages
of adjacent units and paired, single-car garage doors.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Detached garages shall be designed with materials consistent with
those used on the principal buildings within the development. Detached garages
shall not be located along a public street frontage. Detached garaged shall be
discouraged within townhome developments.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Architectural and Site Design Characteristics â€“ Business and

district shall apply to commercial property zoned C-2 and nonresidential uses
as principally permitted within a residential district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The architectural design of all buildings shall be similar in style
and sense of scale to the residential neighborhood it serves or is in proximity
to.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Buildings shall be predominately brick, stone, or similar material
that provides for the appearance of permanency. The use of residential siding
or similar materials consistent with the surrounding neighborhood may be used
as a secondary material. Vinyl siding is prohibited.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The use of building materials shall follow principles of tripartite
architecture where a defined base, middle, and top (roofline) are established.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Architectural and Site Design Characteristics. â€“ General Commercial and
Highway Districts. The regulations specified under this district will apply
specifically to the C-1, and C-3 Districts.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Buildings constructed in a General Commercial or Highway District
shall be designed to sustain interest throughout the entirety of the buildingâ€™s
exterior and reduce the appearance of a box or cube.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Individual buildings within a planned retail center, office park, or
similar environment shall be designed with a compatible architectural style or
theme.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â In order to ensure the longevity and future usability of retail
buildings in excess of 50,000 square feet (e.g., big box retailer, anchor of a
strip mall, etc.) additional articulation and structural offsets shall be
provided to ensure future reuse of the structure by smaller user groups. This
shall be accomplished by visually separating the building into masses conducive
to such reuse.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Buildings within the General Commercial or Highway District shall
incorporate a blend of various primary materials including: (i) aluminum
composite materials; (ii) brick; (iii) cast stone; (iv) cultured stone; (v)
glass; (vi) plate cladding system; and (vii) precast concrete panels. The
primary material shall consist of 75% of faÃ§ades facing a public street right-
of-way. Secondary materials shall include but not be limited to: (i)
architectural metals (insulated metal panels, corrugated metal panels or other
similar materials); (ii) copper flashing; (iii) EIFS; (iv) fiber cement siding;
(v) glass block; (vi) structural composite sandwich paneling; (vii) tile; and
(viii) those materials listed as primary materials. Secondary materials shall
be used to further define and accent the architectural characteristics of a
proposed structure and shall not comprise of more than 25% of the proposed
structure. The primary street-facing faÃ§ade shall consist of a minimum of 30%
glazing. The Planning and Zoning Commission may consider an alternative
material not specifically listed above if the overall design is determined to
provide a unique use of the material and meets the intent of this section in
creating an appearance of permanency and sustained interest throughout the
entirety of the building.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Ribbed metal panels shall not be permitted as an allowed principle
or secondary material within the General Commercial and Highway Districts.
Exception: could be approved if a minimum 24 gauge and concealed fasteners are
used.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â No EIFS shall be allowed within 3 feet of grade.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Principal buildings shall be oriented and located in a manner which
allows for shared access drives and/or parking with adjacent principal
buildings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Automobile and pedestrian corridors should be clearly defined
throughout the proposed site. This should be accomplished through the use of:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Landscaped medians and islands within proposed parking areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Defined pedestrian corridors provided through or around parking
areas between principal buildings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Brick, stone, or similar pavement accents at critical pedestrian
and automobile crossings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Automobile and pedestrian lighting located along primary
corridors within the site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Interior self storage buildings shall be designed and constructed so
that they are compatible with adjoining commercial buildings. In addition, the
following performance standards shall also apply to the design and development
of interior self-storage units:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â All storage units shall gain access from the interior of the
building, no individual unit doors may face the street or be visible from an
adjoining property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â One entrance and one exit overhead door shall be allowed.
Whenever possible, these features shall be located on facades, which face non-
residentially zoned or developed property or the public street. In no case will
these features appear on the front faÃ§ade or public faÃ§ade where other
commercial business takes place.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Commercial tenant space(s) shall be included in the first floor
design, which may include a retail space for the self-storage office. Tenant
spaces shall extend at least 50% of the length of the faÃ§ade which faces a main
parking field or the public street where parking is available between the
building and the public street. The intent is to emulate tenant and multi-
tenant retail storefronts commonly associated with building within commercial
zoning districts.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Ground floor and upper floor facades shall be designed to be
compatible with expected four-sided commercial design in the Cityâ€™s commercial
districts. Examples of such architectural and design features include varied
massing, proportion, faÃ§ade modulation, exterior building materials and
detailing, varied roof line, pedestrian scale, windows, repetition, etc. Views
of storage units through windows shall be mitigated. The building shall look
like a retail or multi-tenant commercial space.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Architectural and Site Design Characteristics â€“ Industrial District.
The regulations specified under this district will apply specifically to the M-
1, M-2, and M-3 districts.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Buildings shall be compatible in architectural style or theme with
surrounding buildings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Buildings shall be designed with emphasis placed upon promoting
interest on those facades facing a public street right-of-way and breaking up
long expanses of continuous walls with specific consideration given to the
treatment of entrances, doors, and window areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Buildings within the Industrial District shall be designed utilizing
primary materials on those elevations facing a public street right-of-way
including: (i) aluminum composite materials; (ii) brick; (iii) cast stone; (iv)
cultured stone; (v) glass; (vi) plate cladding system; (vii) precast concrete
panels; and (viii) fiber cement siding. Secondary materials used on the
remainder of the building and comprising not more than 40% of all elevations
shall include but not be limited to: (i) architectural metals (insulated metal
panels, corrugated metal panels or other similar materials); (ii) EIFS; (iii)
split faced block; (iv) structural composite sandwich paneling; (v) tile; and
(vi) those materials listed as primary materials. Other materials proposed as
secondary materials not specifically described shall meet the intent of this
section in promoting an appearance of permanency.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Mini warehouse/self-storage developments shall comply with the
following requirements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Facades fronting the public right of way and adjoining
residential districts shall be enhanced to add visual character and distinction
different from the interior of the development. Materials on these facades
shall consist entirely of those materials listed as primary materials in this
section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Views of exterior access doors shall be screened from the public
right of way, adjacent residential development and adjacent non-industrial or
non-warehouse retail development.

166.04 APPLICATION OF SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS; LAND DIVISIONS.
The regulations contained herein apply to the subdivision of a lot, tract or
parcel of land into three or more lots, tracts or other division of land for
the purpose of sale, transfer or of building development, whether immediate or
in the future, including the resubdivision or replatting of land or lots. These
regulations shall apply to each situation where there is a dedication of a
street, alley, easement or land for other public uses. The above provisions
shall not be construed to limit the acceptance of deeds to right-of-way or land
for other purposes by the Council or other agency of government when such
acceptance is in the public interest and not for the purpose of circumventing
these regulations.
166.05 AGRICULTURAL LAND EXEMPTION.
The division of land for agricultural use into parcels, all of which are 10
acres or more in area and have 400 feet or more of street or road frontage and
which do not involve the creation of any new street or road, easement or other
dedication, shall be exempt from the requirements of these regulations,
provided however, that the provisions of applicable statutes and regulations
are complied with.
166.06 DIVISION OF PLATTED LOTS.
The division or consolidation of existing platted lots or parts of existing
platted lots by description for the purpose of sale or development shall not be
considered a subdivision within the scope of these regulations. However, any
existing platted lot containing in excess of 15,000 square feet which is to be
divided into three or more parcels intended as primary building sites or when
such division involves a dedication to public use, such division shall fall
within the jurisdiction of these regulations. The division and sale of a minor
portion of any parcel of land for the purpose of adding land to an adjoining
building site, when said adjoining parcel of land constitutes more than 50
percent of the newly created building site, shall not be counted as a division
in determining the jurisdiction of these regulations.
166.07 APPROVALS NECESSARY.
No plat or subdivision falling within the jurisdiction of these regulations
shall be recorded or presented for recording under the provisions of Chapter
354 of the Code of Iowa until all provisions and approvals set forth herein
have been met or obtained.

No officer, employee, or agent of the City shall issue any building permit,
make any water or sewer connection, or issue any permit for any water or sewer
connection for any building or buildings constructed or proposed to be
constructed on land divided contrary to the provisions of these regulations. No
officer, agent or employee of the City shall perform or cause to be performed
any construction or maintenance upon any street or public way purported to be
dedicated as a public street or public way by virtue of being shown on a plat,
unless such plat shall have been approved as provided by these regulations. The
previously noted prohibitions shall not apply to any plat or dedication legally
filed of record before the enactment of these regulations by the City.
166.09 IMPROVEMENTS TO BE COMPLETED.
No final plat shall be approved for recording unless street and utility
improvements necessary to serve the intended occupants of the subdivision have
been completed in a satisfactory manner, as set forth herein, or other
assurances are executed, as provided herein, that such improvements will be
completed. The standards and details of design contained in Sections
166.28 through
166.30 are intended only as minimum requirements and the subdivider should use
standards consistent with the site conditions to assure an economical,
pleasant, and durable neighborhood. All subdivisions shall conform to the
comprehensive plan approved by the Commission and adopted by the Council.

account or by posting surety therefore, and turn lanes that serve or will serve
the subdivision whether located within the subdivision or on a street.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Street Grades. Street grades shall conform with the overall drainage
pattern of the locality of the subdivision and shall fall within the minima and
maxima as follows: arterial street â€“ six percent; local or residential and
collector streets â€“ 10 percent. No street grade shall be less than one-half of
one percent.
Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â Vertical Sight Distances. Change of grade shall conform to current
standards of the City for the type of street in question, provided that in no
case shall there be constructed a sight distance of less than 100 feet,
measured four feet above pavement surface at the ends of the tangent.
Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â Horizontal Sight Distances. A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be
introduced between reverse horizontal curves on collector and arterial streets.
When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point by more
than 10 degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius adequate to
insure a sight distance of not less than 100 feet for collector streets and of
such greater radii as the Planning Commission shall determine for arterial
streets and in other special cases.
Â Â Â 13.Â Â Â Pedestrian Ways. Pedestrian ways may be required by the Planning
Commission so as to allow cross access for pedestrians in very long blocks. In
general, blocks of 800 feet or more in length should have a pedestrian way near
the center of the block.
Â Â Â 14.Â Â Â Standard Right-of-Way Widths. For all streets, alleys and other
thoroughfares hereafter dedicated and accepted, the minimum right-of-way widths
shall not be less than the minimum dimensions for each classification of public
way as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Arterial Streets â€“ 70 feet or as set forth in the General Plan or
other plan adopted by the Planning Commission or the Council.

Improvements. Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be allowed
under conditions adequate to protect future public interests.
166.29 BLOCKS.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Block Length. Intersecting streets determining block lengths shall be
provided at such intervals as to serve cross traffic adequately and to meet
existing streets and customary subdivision practice in the immediate area.
Blocks shorter than 450 feet and longer than 1,200 feet in residential
districts should be avoided. Blocks longer than 600 feet should be avoided in
business districts.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Block Width. The width of a block shall be sufficient to allow for two
tiers of lots with alley or utility easement if required. Blocks intended for
business or industrial use shall be of such width as may be best suited for the
contemplated use of the property, taking into consideration the probable
arrangement of parking and truck loading and maneuvering upon the property.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Very Large Lots and Blocks. When a tract is subdivided into larger than
normal lots or parcels, such lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to permit
the logical location and opening of future streets and appropriate
resubdivision with provision for adequate utility connections for such
resubdivision. Easements for the future openings and extension of such streets
may, at the direction of the Planning Commission, be made a requirement of the
plat.
166.30 LOTS.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Minimum Lot Dimensions. Lot sizes shall meet or exceed the requirement
of the Zoning Regulations as to lot size and shall as near as practical meet or
exceed the typical lot size for existing building sites in the immediate
vicinity. Each lot shall be a buildable site after taking into account all yard
spaces required by the Zoning Regulations. Excessive lot depth in relation to
width shall be avoided. In general, the ratio of width to depth should be one
to one and one-half.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Corner Lots Wider. Corner lots in residential areas shall be enough
wider than inside lots so as to allow an appropriate setback from both streets.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Side Lines Perpendicular. Side lines of lots shall be approximately at
right angles to straight street lines and radial to curved street lines.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Double Frontage. Lots with street frontage at both front and rear shall
be avoided except when backing on an arterial street.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Street Frontage. Each lot shall have frontage on a street. An alley
shall not suffice as a sole means of access.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Reversed Frontages and Key Lots. Reversed frontages at cross street
intersections shall be avoided except where it will match existing development.
Key lots, being those inside lots fronting on side streets, shall be avoided
except where they are matching existing development and other lots are
excessively deep. Key lots shall be prohibited where they disrupt utility or
drainage easements. Reverse frontage and normal corner lots when adjacent to a
key lot shall have additional width to allow full front yard setbacks on both
streets. Homes on streets with several reversed frontage lots shall be required
to face the same direction.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Outlots shall be prohibited.
166.31 EASEMENTS.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Utility Easements. Utility easements shall be 20 feet wide, falling
half on adjoining lots along rear lot lines. They shall be planned for easy and
continuous access for maintenance, shall be continuous through the block and
shall connect as nearly in line as possible with adjoining easements. To
facilitate the use of easements, rear lot lines in curvilinear platting shall
form straight lines for as long a distance as feasible. Side lot easements may
be 10 feet wide. Where topography dictates, the full width of an easement may
fall on one lot.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Drainage Easements. Drainage easements for storm sewers or open
channels may be required where storm drainage cannot be practically carried
under streets or on other rights-of-way. Open channel drainage easements may be
required where there is evidence that the natural drainage for a large area
traverses the subdivision. Drainage easements shall be sufficient in width so
that motorized equipment may be used in their maintenance.
166.32 IMPROVEMENTS.
Every subdivision shall contain normal improvements before acceptance or have
such improvements assured by the posting of a bond or other device as set forth
herein. Improvements shall include:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Monuments. Permanent monuments shall be set at each corner at the
perimeter of the subdivision and at the corner of each block within the
subdivision and at the corner of each lot. All monuments shall be metallic, at
least 30 inches long, and installed with an inert cap indicating the Iowa
registration number of the land surveyor.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Storm Drainage. Storm drainage shall be provided with sufficient
capacity to handle all surface water traversing the subdivision. The design of
waterways, pipes, culverts and catch basins shall conform with standard
practice, specific plans and standard specifications of the City. All storm
drainage piping shall be cleaned, inspected, and tested per standard
specifications of the City prior to acceptance.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Sanitary Sewers. Sanitary sewers shall be installed for service to each
lot according to standard specifications of the City and shall meet the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources regulations. The City may require over-sizing
of the system to allow greater capacity for future use, and in said event,
there shall be an arrangement or an agreement whereby the subdivider will be
reimbursed in a satisfactory manner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where public sanitary sewers are reasonably available, the
subdivider shall connect to these systems. Where it is unlikely that public
sanitary sewer services will be provided in an economically practical and
timely fashion, the creation of the subdivision via the platting procedure is
dependent upon satisfactory evidence that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The lots created would be an appropriate division of land and
shall not hinder the future upgrade of public services to a level as envisioned
in the Comprehensive Plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Any on-site wastewater treatment system must be approved by
Dallas County or the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The proposed subdivision is an infill project within an existing
neighborhood.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The subdivision shall create a small number of lots, generally
no more than two to three.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The subdivider shall include dry sewers where public sewer system is
not available unless this requirement is waived by the City Council. All sewer
piping shall be cleaned, inspected, and tested per standard specifications of
the City prior to acceptance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Where sewage pumping stations are required, the location will be
determined by the Cityâ€™s Engineer. The subdivider will install the lift station
together with all required appurtenances and force main. The subdivider will be
reimbursed in the proportion of which the area outside the subdivision, but
served by the pumping station, bears to the total area served by the pumping
station. If the subdivider connects to a sewer leading to a sewage pumping
station, subdivider will be required to pay to the City of Adel his pro rata
share of the cost of the pumping station and force main according to the ratio
of area the subdivision has to the total area served by the sewage pumping
station.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Water Supply. Water supply shall be completed to each lot in accordance
with the design standards and standard specifications of the City. Fire
hydrants shall be installed in a pattern approved by the City. All public water
supply plans and specifications shall meet the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources and City regulations. The City may require over-sizing of the system
to allow greater capacity for future use, and in said event, there shall be an
arrangement or an agreement whereby the developer will be reimbursed in a
satisfactory manner.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Grading. Grading shall be completed to official grade on all streets
for the full width of the right-of-way, and fills shall be compacted
sufficiently to assure adequate support for permanent paving, as set forth by
City specifications.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Paving. Paving of a permanent type shall be completed on all streets in
accordance with the standard specifications of the City and in conformity with
any official street plans which may be adopted by the Planning Commission or by
the Council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Minimum pavement thickness shall be six inches reinforced or seven
inches of non-reinforced Portland cement concrete.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Six inches of granular material to be placed under all new roads may
be required unless a geotechnical analysis has been provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â An appropriate amount of ballast shall also be used when deemed
necessary by the Public Works Director.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â A minimum of six-inch subdrains on both sides of the street to drain
water from the street and provide an outlet for sump pumps shall be installed
and connected to proper storm sewer drains. In some cases, a separate â€œminiâ€
storm sewer system may be required.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Six-inch concrete driveways.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Curb and gutter â€“ six inches by 30 inches (standard vertical) or
roll back six-inch radius.
Typical cross sections of streets will be provided by the Public Works
Director. Standard installations for sanitary sewer, storm drainage and water
supply shall be installed before paving, even though such facilities cannot be
connected with the City system at the time of approval of the plat.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Minimum Paving Widths. For all streets and other thoroughfares, the
minimum paving widths shall not be less than the minimum dimensions for each
classification of public way as follows and consistent with the Major Streets
Plan:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Arterial Streets* â€“ 31-foot paving back to back of curb.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Collector Streets â€“ 31-foot paving back to back of curb.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Local or Residential Street â€“ 29-foot paving back to back of curb.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Cul-de-Sac Turn-Around â€“ 90-foot paving back to back of curb.
*Greater widths may be required. Each situation will be reviewed on a case by
case basis.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Utilities. All utility services shall be made available to each lot in
such a manner as will eliminate the necessity for disturbing the street paving,
curbs, gutter, and drainage structures when connections are made. All utilities
shall be placed underground and in accordance with standard specifications of
the City.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Inspections and Testing. An appropriate number of inspections and tests
determined by the City Engineer shall be provided for by the subdivider so as
to meet the requirements of the engineer. All test results shall be submitted
to the City and a letter certifying that all improvements have been completed
according to the City with be provided by the City Engineer. All inspection and
testing costs will be borne by the subdivider.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Final Plans. Upon completion of construction of any such utilities or
improvements, one set of reproducible tracings of complete as-built final
plans, dated, signed and certified by the engineer in charge, shall be filed
with the Clerk showing all features as actually installed, including materials,
size, location depth or elevation, numbers, ends of lines, connections, wyes,
valves, storm sewer drains, inlets and all other pertinent information. There
shall be no connections made to such utilities serving the subdivision until
the foregoing has been complied with.
Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â Sidewalks. The subdivider shall provide for the installation of
sidewalks along all newly created lots, including sidewalks on adjacent
existing streets. Sidewalks shall be built according to the standards and
specifications of the City. The subdivider shall indicate in the application
for approval of a preliminary or final plat those sidewalks that will be
constructed at the time of installation of public improvements, and those that
the subdivider would like the Council to defer until a later date. If the
Council agrees to defer construction of the sidewalks, sidewalks shall be
constructed at the time a principal structure is built upon the adjacent lot or
lots or within five years of plat approval, whichever is earlier.
Notwithstanding the above, the Council may require the sidewalkâ€™s construction
at the time adjacent roadway construction takes place or at any other time as
noted in the final plat approval. At the time sidewalk construction is required
as provided above, such construction shall be completed at the sole cost and
expense of the person or entity that owns the property or lot at the time of
construction.
A.Â Â Â Sidewalks shall be five feet wide and located within the right-of-way with
the outer edge one foot from the right-of-way line.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Sidewalks will be installed by developer on streets adjoining the
subdivision and having double frontage lots prior to final plat approval. The
sidewalks will be installed on street side that adjoins the subdivision unless
waived by the City Council.
Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â Driveway Approaches. Driveways shall be hard surface (asphalt or
concrete) from the traveled portion of the street to the property line and
shall be installed when the lot is developed.
Â Â Â 13.Â Â Â Maintenance. Developers shall provide for the perpetual maintenance of
any and all subdivision improvements that are not dedicated to the City or
other governmental entity, by establishing an owner's association or other
person, whether an individual or individuals, in a manner and form that is
acceptable to the City. Such improvements may include but are not limited to
storm water detention and infiltration basins; buffer yards, landscaping,
fencing or walls, and other screening; subdivision signs, directional signs,
traffic signs and pavement markings; and on-site lighting.
MODIFICATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT
166.33 MODIFICATION OF REQUIREMENTS.
The strict application of the terms of these regulations may be modified by
three-fourths vote of the Council upon the recommendation of the Planning
Commission in the event that it is found that any specific provision is
impractical in its application to a specific parcel of land because of
characteristics peculiar to said parcel and the intent of these regulations
will not be compromised.
166.34 ENFORCEMENT.
The Public Works Director shall be responsible for the enforcement of these
regulations. All employees and officials of the City shall report in writing to
the Public Works Director any violation or suspected violation of these
regulations.
166.35 DEVELOPMENT APPLICATION PARK LAND DEDICATION.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â This Park Land Dedication section is effective for any plat that has
not received final approval prior to adoption.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â For purposes of this section the term â€œdevelopment applicationâ€ means
any presentation or filing with the City for residential development purposes
of any subdivision of land over which the City has subdivision review and
approval authority, or the filing or presentation of any site plan, PUD, PUD
specific plan, permitted conditional use plan or development, subdivision
master plan or area development plan, over which the City has approval
authority or a declaration of horizontal property (condominium) regime pursuant
to Code of Iowa Chapter 499B.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â All persons making a development application shall dedicate to the
City, within the land covered by the development application, land for park and
recreational purposes sufficient to meet the requirements of this section.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â In each tract of land covered by a development application, there shall
be reserved and dedicated to public use 10 acres of land for park purposes for
each 1,000 people, based upon the projected population of the completed
development application as calculated in accordance with this section. Such
dedication shall be prorated to the amount indicated by the projected
population to the nearest 1,000 square feet of land to be dedicated, but in any
event, no dedication of land for park use shall contain a total for park usage
of less than 10,000 square feet of land so dedicated. For purposes of this
section, property subject to a horizontal property condominium regime under
Code of Iowa Chapter 499B shall be treated as single-family detached.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â For purposes of this section, population in the completed area covered
by the development application will be determined by multiplying the number of
housing units projected in the area covered by the development application for
each use category times the anticipated average per unit as given below. The
quantity calculated for each residential type shall be added together and the
sum shall be the projected population for purposes of the development
application. For the purposes of this section, the following population
estimates per residential type will be used:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Single-family detached: 2.90 people.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Single-family attached: 2.59 people.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Multi-family unit: 1.82 people.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The City may require that all land dedicated under this section be
configured or located to optimize aggregations of land and thus may require
that the dedicated land be adjacent to the land affected by other development
applications or to otherwise maximize usefulness of the land in accordance with
the City's Comprehensive Plan and Parks and Trails Master Plan.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â This section shall not apply to any development application which does
not include residential development, provided, however, to the extent any
development application includes residential uses then dedication of park land
shall be required to the extent determined in accordance with this section.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â For purposes of this section the water area of ponds, streams,
retention basins, detention basins and other bodies of water, or the land area
of buffer park easements and site plan open space requirements, shall not be
included in determining any area dedicated for park purposes.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â The dedication of land for park purposes shall include dedication of a
corridor or point of connection for public pedestrian access, the areas of
which shall be included in determining compliance with this section.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â The required land dedication under this section shall be reduced when
the person making the development application provides public access by
easement to recreational facilities, playgrounds, unobstructed open spaces,
ball fields, soccer fields, tennis courts, basketball courts, volleyball
courts, picnic shelters, recreational trails and other similar non-duplicated
recreational facilities which have been (or will be) constructed and maintained
by the applicant. There shall not be any credit for swimming pools, clubhouses,
and other similar facilities. In order to determine the credit the City shall
ascertain the fair market value of the land required to be dedicated under this
section and from such value subtract the cost of the recreational facilities
constructed by the applicant and provided under this section. The person making
the development application shall then only be required to dedicate land equal
in value to the remainder.
Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â As an alternative to dedication under this section, any person filing
a development application may provide jointly with other persons for the
dedication of land in an amount at least equal to the amount required under
this section, at a location which is not part of the land for which approval is
sought, provided such alternative is within the same neighborhood park area as
the land for which a development application has been made, that the
alternative jointly provided will provide for a park with a total land area of
at least five (5) acres, consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and that such
alternative dedication of land is or has actually been dedicated to the City
and has been accepted by the City for use in accordance with the Comprehensive
Plan and Parks and Trails Master Plan.
Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â Where application of the formula set forth in subsection 4 of this
section results in a dedication requirement of less than 10,000 square feet the
person making or filing the development application may elect to dedicate
10,000 square feet of land or fulfill their obligation by participating in an
option provided by Subsection 10 of this section, but such alternative
participation shall be based upon the actual calculation under Subsection 4 of
this section and not upon the equivalent of 10,000 square feet of land.
Â Â Â 13.Â Â Â Subsections 10 and 11 of this section notwithstanding, any entity
required to comply with this section may present an alternate plan which meets
the purposes of this section as a means of complying herewith. It will be the
burden of the entity presenting such plan to establish that such plan meets the
purposes of this section. Any such plan shall be first reviewed by the Planning
Commission. Any alternate proposal must directly and proportionately benefit
the development. A plan may include a payment in lieu of land dedication equal
to the fair market value of the land to be dedicated. Such payment may be used
only for park and recreation facility purposes consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan.
Â Â Â 14.Â Â Â This section shall not apply to any development application containing
three or fewer single-family residential units. A person making or filing a
development application shall not divide land into separate plats in order to
seek a waiver under this provision. Where a development application is made for
multiple contiguous tracts within any two years the City may treat all the
development applications as one for purposes of this section.
Â Â Â 15.Â Â Â No declaration of a condominium regime and under Code of Iowa Chapter
499B, nor any conversion of an apartment to a condominium under Code of Iowa
Section 499B.3 shall be completed before the person or entity filing the
declaration shall have complied with the land dedication requirements of this
chapter.
Â Â Â 16.Â Â Â If any subsection or provision of this section is held invalid by a
court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect the validity of
any other provisions of this section which can be given effect without the
invalid portion or portions and to this end each subsection and provision of
this section is severable.
Â Â Â 17.Â Â Â Any person making or filing a development application or any person,
entity, or developer affected by any decision made by any department acting
under this chapter, may appeal to the City Council by filing notice of appeal
with the City Clerk and a filing fee of $100.00 payable to the City of Adel to
be credited to the general fund of the City. Such appeal shall be taken within
10 days from the decision of the department acting under this chapter and shall
set out in detail the reasons and grounds for the appeal. The City Clerk shall
forthwith transmit to the City Council all papers constituting the record upon
which the action appeal is taken. An appeal stays all proceedings in
furtherance of the appeal.
Â Â Â 18.Â Â Â The City Council shall upon the filing of an appeal fix a reasonable
time for a hearing, giving public notice thereof as well as due notice to the
parties in interest. All interested persons may offer oral or written testimony
at the public hearing on the appeal. A vote of three members of the City
Council may affirm, modify, or reverse any decision of any department acting
under this chapter.
Â Â Â 19.Â Â Â Any person, entity, or developer aggrieved by any appeal decision of
the City Council may within 30 days from the date of the City Council rendering
a decision, appeal therefrom to the district court of Dallas County, Iowa, in
accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure, Division XIV, entitled
Certiorari.
