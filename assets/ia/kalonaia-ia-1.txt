46.02 Cigarettes and Tobacco 46.04 Minors in Taverns
Â 
46.01Â Â Â CURFEW.
The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote the
public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and specifically
to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults responsible for
minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors committed after
the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences and criminal
activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.
1.Â Â Â Definitions. For use in this section, the following terms are defined:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â â€œEmergency errandâ€ means, but is not limited to, an errand relating to
a fire, a natural disaster, an automobile accident or any other situation
requiring immediate action to prevent serious illness, bodily injury, or loss
of life.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â â€œKnowinglyâ€ means knowledge that a responsible adult should reasonably
be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that responsible
adultâ€™s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful or careless
adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult responsibility
through an objective test. It is therefore no defense that an adult responsible
for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or
whereabouts of the minor.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â â€œMinorâ€ means any unemancipated person under the age of 18 years.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â â€œNonsecured custodyâ€ means custody in an unlocked multipurpose area,

or used as a secure detention area, and the person arrested is not physically
secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically
accompanied by a law enforcement officer or a person employed by the facility
where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to
providing nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate
juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the personâ€™s
parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but
not for longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or
magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â â€œPublic placeâ€ includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys, and sidewalks dedicated to public use and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises, whether publicly or privately owned,
that are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited
commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is
permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has
access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is
considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â â€œResponsible adultâ€ means a parent, guardian or other adult
specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have
custody or control of a minor.

either side of the place where the minor resides and the adult responsible for
the minor has given permission for the minor to be there.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The minor is present at or is traveling between home and one of the
following:

which the minor is permitted by law to be engaged or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of work;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Minorâ€™s place of religious activity or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of the religious activity;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Governmental or political activity or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of the activity;

the U.S. Constitution guarantees of free exercise of religion, freedom of
speech, freedom of assembly or, if traveling, within one hour after the end or

falls within one of the above exceptions.
5.Â Â Â Enforcement Procedures.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in the
absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driverâ€™s license,
a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance, use his
or her best judgment in determining age.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody. Grounds for arrest are that
the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the personâ€™s
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any nonsecured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into
custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into custody,
the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the minor as
soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible for the
minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at such
time as the court may direct.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minorâ€™s parent, guardian or other person
legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the
law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative
of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person
who is known to the child.
6.Â Â Â Penalties.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Responsible Adultâ€™s First Violation. In the case of a first violation
by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall, by certified mail, send to the
adult responsible for the minor, written notice of the violation with a warning
that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew
ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with applicable
penalties.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Responsible Adultâ€™s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as defined
in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows the minor
to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a municipal
infraction.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Minorâ€™s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a minor,
the law enforcement officer shall give the minor a written warning, which
states that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the
curfew ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with applicable
penalties, or, at the law enforcement officerâ€™s discretion, may issue the minor
a citation for a first violation.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Minorâ€™s Second Violation. For the minorâ€™s second and subsequent
violations of any of the provisions of this section, the minor is guilty of a
municipal infraction.

  in fact exist. If compliance is not secured following notice and hearings, we
  recommend you review the situation with your attorney before proceeding with

Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a

installation of a sanitary sewer in said street for the purpose of serving the
property in accordance with the following:
1.Â Â Â Application and Deposit. A written request for such installation, and a
sum equal to the cost as estimated by the City of construction from the point
where the sanitary sewer is presently installed and terminates to the point
where the most distance boundary of the ownerâ€™s lot abuts the said public
street, shall be submitted to the Council.
2.Â Â Â Construction. Upon receipt of the deposit, the City shall construct the
sanitary sewer for the purpose of serving the property of the applicant
(builder), as soon as such construction can reasonably be accomplished.
3.Â Â Â Additional Costs. In the event the actual cost to the City of installation
of the sanitary sewer is in excess of the estimated cost, the builder agrees to
reimburse the City for the actual additional cost within 30 days after the
presentation of a bill for such additional cost.
4.Â Â Â Lien Authorized. In the event of the failure of the builder to reimburse
the City, as specified in Subsection 3 above, the total of the additional cost
shall be certified to the County Treasurer as a special assessment lien against
the builderâ€™s real estate. In the written request for installation of the
sanitary sewer, the landowner shall waive all objections to jurisdiction and
rights to notice and consent to the entry of such a special assessment lien
against the real estate.
5.Â Â Â Connecting Property. The expense of connecting the property of the builder
to the sanitary sewer laid in the public street shall be borne by the builder,
in addition to the cost of constructing said sewer, but such connection shall
be under the supervision of the City.

such a sewer, the applicant shall post with the City a surety bond, in an
amount to be set by the Council and made a matter of record in the minutes of
the Council, which shall be in an amount equal to but not less than 110 percent
of the total estimated cost of the installation for the full distance from the
termination point of the presently existing sewer to the point where the
farthest boundary of the applicantâ€™s land abuts the public street, and the bond
shall guarantee the installation of the sewer in as short a time as reasonably
possible and shall further indemnify the City for the cost of completing the
project in the event the applicant fails to complete the project within a

Company the right to impose, collect, or remit a franchise fee, provided such
denial is affirmed by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date of
the final agency order from which the appeal is taken.

160.02Â Â Â STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSE.
1.Â Â Â The Legislature of the State of Iowa has, in Chapter 414 of the Code of
Iowa, as amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to
secure safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
2.Â Â Â Findings of Fact.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation
which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of
the community.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by:
(i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
3.Â Â Â Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Paragraph 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows so
that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03Â Â Â GENERAL PROVISIONS.
1.Â Â Â Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter shall apply
to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City which are located within the
boundaries of the Floodplain (Overlay) District as established in this section.
2.Â Â Â Establishment of Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM) for Washington County and Incorporated Areas, City of Kalona, Panels

part of the Flood Insurance Study for Washington County is hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be the Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The Washington
County Flood Insurance Study is hereby adopted by reference and is made a part
of this chapter for the purpose of administering floodplain management
regulations.
3.Â Â Â Rules for Interpretation of Floodplain (Overlay) District. The boundaries
of the Floodplain (Overlay) District areas shall be determined by scaling
distances on the official Flood Insurance Rate Map. When an interpretation is
needed as to the exact location of a boundary, the City Administrator shall
make the necessary interpretation. The Board of Appeals shall hear and decide
appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision,
or determination made by the City Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
4.Â Â Â Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used, and no structure
shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
5.Â Â Â Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
6.Â Â Â Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
7.Â Â Â Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated Floodplain (Overlay) District areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create
liability on the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
8.Â Â Â Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.

authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. The applicant shall be
required to submit certification by a professional engineer or land surveyor,
as appropriate, registered in the State of Iowa, that the finished fill,
building floor elevations, flood proofing, or other flood protection measures
were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to
the use or occupancy of any structure.
160.05Â Â Â STANDARDS FOR FLOODPLAIN (OVERLAY) DISTRICT.
All uses must be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and meet the
following applicable performance standards. Where base flood elevations and
floodway data have not been provided on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The
applicant will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources
with sufficient technical information to make such determination.
1.Â Â Â All Development. All development within the Floodplain (Overlay) District
shall:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement.
(Paragraph A â€“ Ord. 2023-349 â€“ Dec. 23 Supp.)
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood damage.

structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the base flood elevations. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
base flood elevations and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed subject to favorable
consideration by the Board of Adjustment, where existing topography, street
grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods
used must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various
forces and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential structures
located in areas that would become isolated due to flooding of surrounding
ground shall be provided with a means of access that will be passable by
wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this criterion shall not apply
where the Administrator determines there is sufficient flood warning time for
the protection of life and property. When estimating flood warning time,
consideration shall be given to the criteria listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa
Administrative Code.
3.Â Â Â Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be flood proofed to such a level. When
flood proofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State of
Iowa shall certify that the flood proofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and
other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the
base flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.

elevation.Â Â Â 
(Paragraph C â€“ Ord. 2023-349 â€“ Dec. 23 Supp.)
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
plumbing, gas lines, water/gas meters, and other similar service utilities
either elevated (or in the case of non-residential structures, optionally
floodproofed to) a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation or
designed to be watertight and withstand inundation to such a level.
(Paragraph D â€“ Ord. 2023-349 â€“ Dec. 23 Supp.)
5.Â Â Â Factory-Built Homes.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including those
placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be elevated
on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the structure is a
minimum of one foot above the base flood level.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including those
placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be anchored
to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may
include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground
anchors. Anchorage systems may include, but are not limited to, use of over-
the-top or frame ties to ground anchors as required by the State Building Code.
6.Â Â Â Utility and Sanitary Systems.

constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
7.Â Â Â Storage of Materials and Equipment. Storage of equipment and materials
that are flammable, explosive, or injurious to human, animal or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or:
(i) not subject to major flood damage and be anchored to prevent movement due
to flood waters; or (ii) readily removable from the area within the time
available after flood warning.
8.Â Â Â Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as levees,
flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the base flood
with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for adequate
interior drainage. In addition, structural flood control works shall be
approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
9.Â Â Â Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must be

subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the base flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50 lots
(whichever is less) shall include base flood elevation data for those areas
located within the Floodplain (Overlay) District.
11.Â Â Â Accessory Structures to Residential Uses. Detached garages, sheds, and
similar structures that are incidental to a residential use are exempt from the
base flood elevation requirements where the following criteria are satisfied.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage potential. Its
size shall not exceed 600 square feet in size. Those portions of the structure
located less than one foot above the BFE must be constructed of flood-resistant
materials.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage potential
purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure shall not
be used for human habitation.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building site so
as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The structure shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation, collapse,
and lateral movement.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The structureâ€™s service facilities such as electrical and heating
equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above the base
flood elevation.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The structureâ€™s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of Subsection 4(A) of this section.
Exemption from the base flood elevation requirements for such a structure may
result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of the structure
and its contents.
12.Â Â Â Recreational Vehicles.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of Subsection 5
of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built homes when
the following criteria are satisfied.

180 consecutive days; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than 180
consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements of
Subsection 5 of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built
homes.
13.Â Â Â Pipeline Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be buried
in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent
rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
14.Â Â Â Maximum Damage Potential Uses. All new or substantially improved maximum
damage potential uses shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated
a minimum of one foot above the elevation of the 500-year flood, or together
with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level.
When flood proofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the
State of Iowa shall certify that the flood proofing methods used are adequate
to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces
and other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below
the base flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are flood proofed shall be maintained by the Administrator. Where
0.2% chance flood elevation data has not been provided in the Flood Insurance
Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute
such data. The applicant will be responsible for providing the Department of
Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make such
determinations.
160.06Â Â Â ESTABLISHMENT OF VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
1.Â Â Â The Board of Appeals may authorize upon request in specific cases such
variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances
granted must meet the following applicable standards.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection
for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the applicant

conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
Â Â Â M.Â Â Â Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this chapter.
3.Â Â Â Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed

ALTERNATE SUBDIVISIONS
170.30Â Â Â PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT(PUD).
Land permitted as PUD (planned unit development) may include two or more uses
that would require classification of two or more zoning districts or tracts of
land which include varying lot sizes to protect environmental features. The PUD
encourages the more efficient use of land through the incorporation of both
public and private open spaces to accent and enhance both the architectural and
natural features of a development and provide for natural stormwater management
systems. A development plan and development agreement are required for all PUD-
permitted use combinations. The City and the subdivider of the PUD area shall
address the private and public open space and recreation area requirements and
the means to satisfy such requirements in the development agreement. All PUD
areas shall comply with the intent and purpose of this chapter with the
flexibility to create equivalent recreational facilities while accommodating
the mixed uses present in such developments.
1.Â Â Â Site Development. The site for a planned unit development shall consist of
a single parcel of land or an integrated group of parcels. The site may include
areas of land which are topographically unsuitable for the erection of
structures but which may be incorporated into the development plan as an
element of the open space system. The PUD shall be identified on the
Preliminary and Final Plat as a cluster or mixed-use PUD subdivision.
2.Â Â Â Zoning Required. Development of PUD subdivision shall be approved for
necessary zoning at the time of Final Plat approval and subject to all
regulations listed in
Chapter 165 of this Code of Ordinances, except as allowed in this section, as a
condition of approval of the Final Plat.
3.Â Â Â Procedure. Planned Unit Development subdivisions shall follow the same
approval procedures as a major subdivision, except as identified in this
section.
4.Â Â Â Professional Required. Professional talents of qualified land planners,
licensed landscape architects, Iowa Licensed Professional Engineers, and other
specialists deemed necessary shall be utilized in the preparation of a planned
unit development to assure developments of the quality desired by the City.
5.Â Â Â Design Standards. The general improvement and design standards within this
chapter shall govern the PUD subdivision. Variations allowed below are granted
with the approval of the Preliminary and Final Plats.
170.31Â Â Â CLUSTER PUD SUBDIVISION.
The purpose of this section is to permit the development of cluster or
conservation residential subdivisions in which buildings and dwellings are
grouped closer together and on smaller sized lots than otherwise permitted in
this chapter. The concept of conservation subdivision design will provide for
flexibility in lot layout to fit the natural characteristics of the land and
will permit more usable open space, common ground, and recreational areas. The
provisions of this section shall not be construed to apply to any other section
of this chapter. However, all other sections of this chapter shall apply to
conservation subdivisions unless specifically exempted by this section. The
following provisions apply:
1.Â Â Â The zoning district lot, yard, and bulk requirements may be varied
provided that adequate open space shall be included to ensure that the average
land area per dwelling unit shall be equal to or greater than that permitted
for the district in which the development is located.
2.Â Â Â The total land area of the subdivision divided by the total number of
single residential units provides the average land area per residential unit.
Total land area of the subdivision shall include all open space and common and
recreational areas, but shall not include land set aside for ponds and lakes
within the subdivision or the traffic surface area of the streets.
3.Â Â Â Open space, common ground, or recreational areas shall be provided for the
use and benefit of all family dwelling units in the development and the same
stated in the covenants.
4.Â Â Â A conservation subdivision shall be placed to protect environmental areas
as the purpose of the cluster subdivision. The easement shall protect the land
for disturbing activities such as removal of vegetation, filling, grading,
excavating, or any other manmade activity that is not meant to protect
environmental features. The City may require additional building development
buffers adjacent to conservation easements. Environmental areas include but are
not limited to:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Wetlands as identified by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Floodplains as identified by FEMA;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Forests, prairie, or other habitats; and
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Historic or archaeological sites.
5.Â Â Â The majority of the grouped lots should abut the open space or common or
recreational area with the remainder of the lots provided access through a
walkway easement and with appropriate screening provided.
6.Â Â Â In no case shall approval be granted to subdivisions which include lots
containing less than 50 percent of the minimum lot area required by the zoning
district for the area.
7.Â Â Â As a condition of approving the cluster subdivision and permitting
exceptions to the standard subdivision requirements, the subdivider shall
submit with the Final Plat, a subdividerâ€™s agreement regarding the liability
for and maintenance of the open space, common ground, and recreation areas. A
statement shall be included on the Final Plat indicating the open space
covenants and designating the entity that maintains and enforces the covenants.
8.Â Â Â The City may accept dedication of the conservation easement to the common
open space as long as the open space is accessible to the residents of the City
and the City has access to maintain the common open space.
170.32Â Â Â MIXED-USE PUD SUBDIVISION.
The purpose of this section is to permit the development of mixed-use
subdivisions that includes two or more land uses that would not be allowed
within one zoning district. The mixed-use PUD subdivision allows a subdivider
to state their intent for mixed-use development and prevent the need for zoning
district changes in the future. The mixed-use subdivision procedure shall occur
with the procedure to zone the area for a PAD District. The following
provisions apply:
1.Â Â Â The subdivision shall provide the required open space as described in this
chapter. The open space shall be utilized as a landscape buffer or barrier
separating the residential units from the other uses.
2.Â Â Â The Final Plat shall indicate the use of each lot.
3.Â Â Â The subdivider shall indicate variations from traditional design standards
in this chapter. Variations are only allowed for minimum lot sizes, minimum
block lengths, alley development, street pavement width, and street right-of-
way width.
4.Â Â Â The Commission and Council shall determine the subdivision is consistent
with the policies and recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan as described in
Section
170.61 of this chapter.
170.33Â Â Â NON-RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT.
The following provisions shall apply to non-residential subdivisions:
1.Â Â Â General. If a proposed subdivision includes land that is used for
commercial or industrial purposes, the layout of the subdivision with respect
to such land shall make such provision as the Council may require. A
nonresidential subdivision shall be subject to all the requirements of this
chapter, as well as such additional standards required by the Council, and
shall conform to the proposed land use and standards established in the
Comprehensive Plan and other City regulations.
2.Â Â Â Standards. In addition to the principles and standards in these
regulations (which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions), the
applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the street,
parcel, and block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the uses
anticipated, and takes into account other uses in the vicinity. The following
principles and standards shall be observed:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and dimensions to
the types of industrial development anticipated.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Street rights-of-way and pavement shall be adequate to accommodate the
type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated thereupon.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Special requirements may be imposed by the City with respect to street,
curb, gutter, and sidewalk design and construction.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Special requirements may be imposed by the City with respect to the
installation of public utilities, including water, sewer, and stormwater
drainage.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas from
potential nuisance from a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision,
including the provision of extra depth in parcels backing up on existing or
potential residential development and provisions for a permanently landscaped
buffer strip when necessary.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic,
shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or
potential residential areas.
170.40Â Â Â RESERVED.
REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
170.50Â Â Â IMPROVEMENTS FOR COMPLIANCE.
The subdivider shall, at such subdividerâ€™s expense, install and construct all
improvements required by this chapter. All required improvements shall be
reviewed by the Zoning Administrator and City Engineer, and shall be installed
and constructed in accordance with the design standards established for such
improvements by the City, and as shown on the approved Preliminary Plat.
170.51Â Â Â EXTENT OF IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.
The proposed subdivision shall provide adequate facilities and services to
accommodate the demands from the maximum number of potential residents or
occupants. The essential services and facilities shall include, but not be
limited to: streets, water service, wastewater treatment and disposal,
stormwater management, electrical service, and telecommunications service, and
conform to the Standards for Design and Development sections of this chapter
and other regulations and standards adopted by the City. The improvements for a
subdivision planned in phases shall be designed and implemented to allow the
project to function effectively and independently at the completion of each
successive phase.
170.52Â Â Â IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.
The improvements set forth shall be considered the minimum necessary to assure
and protect the public health, safety, and welfare. These minimum improvements
shall be installed before the Final Plat is approved or as detailed in this
chapter and shall be in accordance with the following criteria:
1.Â Â Â Water Supply System. The subdivider shall provide the subdivision with a
complete water supply system, which shall provide for the distribution through
all the proposed area and a water connection for each lot.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â City water main system shall be installed in the subdivision including
hydrants, valves, and all other appurtenances which shall be extended into and
through the subdivision to the boundary lines, and which shall provide for a
water connection for each lot, and shall be connected to the City water system.
Under some circumstances the City may require, as a condition for approval of
the plat, installation of a water main that is larger than necessary to meet
the needs of the platted area but necessary to complete the City water
distribution system as it relates to both the area being platted and other
areas. In such event, the City will pay the subdivider the difference in cost
of pipe and installation between the larger water main and the diameter of the
water main reasonable to meet the foreseeable needs of the proposed area. The
City may establish a pro rata distribution of the additional cost to be shared
by the City and developers of adjacent areas to be served by the upgraded
system. The water main system, including fixtures shall, upon inspection,
approval, and acceptance by the City, become the property of the City.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Individual wells and central water systems may be utilized for service
to all or a part of the proposed subdivision depending upon the availability of
City service.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Alternate water supply systems consisting of individual wells or a
central water system shall be installed to provide potable water service to
each lot in the event that the City water system is not immediately available
to the proposed subdivision area. The distance requirement for connection to
City service shall be as stated in Section
90.03 of this Code of Ordinances. The lot size requirements and well and system
specifications shall be as required by the County Department of Health and Iowa
Department of Natural Resources regulations. The individual lot owners shall
submit copies of the well permit and certification from the Board of Health for
each well prior to the City issuing the occupancy permit. Individual lot owners
or homeowners associations shall retain ownership of the systems and shall,
through agreements, provide for the maintenance and repair of the respective
water supply systems.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If the City requires that a connection to a public water supply
main be eventually provided as a condition of approval of an individual well or
central water system, the subdivider shall make arrangements for the future
City water service at the time of Final Plat approval. In such cases, adequate
easements must be provided in anticipation of the future City water main
extension and adequate monetary security be provided to insure compliance.
2.Â Â Â Sanitary Sewer System. The subdivider shall provide the subdivision with a
complete sanitary sewer system, which shall make adequate provision for the
collection and disposal of sanitary sewage from each lot with consideration
given to the present and reasonably foreseeable needs.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â City sanitary sewer collection system shall be installed in the
subdivision including piping, all necessary appurtenances, and pumping
equipment, to provide for the collection of sanitary sewage from all lots or
parcels and extended through to the boundary lines as necessary and connected
to the Cityâ€™s sanitary sewer system. Under some circumstances the City may
require, as a condition for approval of the plat installation of sanitary sewer
lines and accessories that are larger than necessary to meet the needs of the
platted area but necessary to complete the City sanitary sewer collection
system as it relates to both the area being platted and other areas. In such
event, the City will pay the subdivider the difference in cost of the lines and
accessories and installation between the greater capacity system and the
proposed collection system reasonable to meet the foreseeable needs of the
proposed service area. The City may establish a pro rata distribution of the
additional cost to be shared by the City and developers of adjacent areas to be
served by the upgraded system. The sanitary sewer collection system including
all accessories shall, upon inspection, approval and acceptance by the City,
become the property of the City.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Alternate methods of collection and disposal of sanitary sewage may be
utilized for service to all or part of the proposed subdivision, depending upon
the availability of the Cityâ€™s sanitary sewer system and the Cityâ€™s
requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Individual on-site sewer systems may be used on lots within the
proposed subdivision in the event that City sanitary sewer system is not
immediately available. Compliance with the distance requirement for connection
to City service shall be as stated Chapter
95.05 of this Code of Ordinances. The lot size requirements, separation
distances, and system specifications shall be as required by the County
Department of Health. The individual lot owner shall submit to the City copies
of the approved permits for the on-site system issued by the County Board of
Health prior to the City issuing the occupancy permit. Covenants submitted with
the Final Plat shall be attached to those lots with on-site systems and detail
operating and maintenance requirements recommended by the County Board of
Health.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If the City plans indicate that a connection to the Cityâ€™s sanitary
sewer collection system would be available to the subdivision area within a
period of less than 10 years, the City may require that the subdivider install
sanitary sewer lines, laterals, and mains within all or part of the proposed
subdivision to a point in the subdivision boundary where a future connection
with the public sewer shall be made. Sewer lines shall be extended to the lot
property line on each affected lot and, during each residence construction,
extended into the home to connect with the main residential discharge line when
public service becomes available. Such sewer line shall be capped until ready
to use and the total subdivision collection system shall conform to the
requirements and standards of the City. In such cases, adequate easements must
be provided in anticipation of the future dedication to the City. Provisions
shall be made in the performance bond or escrow agreement for the completion of
the installation and connections to the Cityâ€™s sewer lines and the dedication
of said system.
3.Â Â Â Storm Sewer System. The subdivider shall provide an adequate storm sewer
drainage system to convey the stormwater naturally flowing through the site and
that from within the developed site. The improvements shall utilize the
extension of existing storm sewer lines from adjacent areas or the installation
of new drainage lines and fixtures in combination with on-site retention or
open waterways and conveyance to a discharge location. These improvements shall
extend to the boundaries of the subdivision so as to provide for extension to
adjoining properties. Under some circumstances the City may require, as a
condition for approval of the plat, installation of storm sewer improvements
that are of larger capacity than necessary to meet the needs of the platted
area, but necessary to complete the City storm sewer system as it relates to
both the area being platted and other adjacent drainage areas. In such event,
the City will pay the subdivider the difference in cost of the pipe, fixtures,
and installation between the larger capacity sewer system and the size of sewer
system reasonable to meet the foreseeable needs of the proposed subdivision and
the natural drainage of the surrounding area. The City may establish a pro rata
distribution of the additional cost to be shared by the City and landowners who
develop the adjacent drainage areas. The storm sewer system, including those
accessories as agreed, shall, upon inspection, approval, and acceptance by the
City, become the property of the City.
Adequate provisions shall be made for the disposal of stormwater, subject to
the approval of the Council and to the satisfaction of the City Engineer. In
the storm sewer design phase, consideration shall be given to the basic
principles of stormwater management and alternatives, such as â€œconservation
design principlesâ€ or the provisions of any stormwater management plan adopted
by the City.
4.Â Â Â Streets. The subdivider shall be responsible for the design and
installation of all streets within the proposed subdivision including
participation in appurtenant improvements such as traffic control signs and
equipment and street name signs.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Streets shall be provided, including the grading of the entire street
right-of-way or alley and providing appropriate paving, including curb and
guttering on all streets. All streets or alleys shall be of such width and
shall be constructed in accordance with the standards found in this chapter and
with other plans and specifications approved by the City. The streets shall,
upon final approval and acceptance by the City, become the property of the
City.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Traffic control signs shall be provided for all streets and
intersections within and abutting the subdivision and street name signs for all
streets within the subdivision. The subdivider shall reimburse the City for all
costs associated with the purchase and installation of the required signs.
5.Â Â Â Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be required to be installed in all developments
and shall be placed along each lot frontage on both sides of the street and any
additional new or existing public street frontage within or adjacent the
subdivision. A request to waive the sidewalk installation may be submitted with
the preliminary plat.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Sidewalks shall be constructed on a lot or lots or portions of adjacent
lots by the property owners as a requirement of the building permit. An
occupancy permit for any dwelling or building shall not be issued until said
sidewalk has been constructed.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If the sidewalks cannot be installed prior to desired occupancy, the
Zoning Administrator or Building Official may issue a temporary certificate of
occupancy, accompanied by a letter of violation, and grant a delay of the
installation of six months. In addition, the property owner shall place in an
escrow account, established by the City, an amount which shall cover the
anticipated cost of the sidewalk installation required for the lot.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The remaining sidewalks shall be constructed and installed in any
subdivision by the property owners, in all blocks where after seven years or 75
percent of the lots have been improved. The completion of the sidewalk to the
subdivision boundary shall be required to connect to an existing sidewalk for
access to a route to a school, park, or trail. The sidewalks on one side of the
interior subdivision street with the greatest number of improved lots shall be
completed to comply with this requirement. The installation shall be completed
at the sole cost and expense of the property or lot owners at the time of said
construction. The construction of the sidewalks across undeveloped lots shall
be of a two-inch layer of Portland concrete cement. The width and location of
the constructed sidewalk shall be the same as the other subdivision sidewalks.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â In appropriate circumstances, public access ways, walkways, or
sidewalks shall be required to be installed by the owner across private land
for purposes of providing access to nearby subdivision, schools, recreation
trails, parks, open green space areas, or other facilities where public access
is judged to be necessary. Crosswalks within a subdivision shall comply with
the regulations as noted in Subsection 170.65(1)(C) of this chapter. The
crosswalks shall be installed at the same time as other sidewalks on the same
block. A minimum of a 10-feet wide easement shall be utilized and may also be
required to accommodate utilities and drainage facilities.
6.Â Â Â Street Lighting. The installation of overhead street lighting shall be
required in accordance with Section
170.64(6) of this chapter. Pole and fixture selection shall be compatible with
other equipment utilized within the City. The subdivider shall pay the cost and
installation of the streetlights with underground service connections.
7.Â Â Â Electric and Utility Service Installation. The subdivider shall provide
for all private utilities, including but not limited to gas, electric power,
telephone, wired internet, and cable installation to each lot. The subdivider
shall be responsible for complying with the utility requirements of this Code
of Ordinances. The subdivider shall also be responsible for making the
necessary arrangements for the installation, including payment of any
construction or installation charges, with each of the serving utilities.
8.Â Â Â Planting. Planting may be proposed by the subdivider or required by the
Zoning Ordinance along rear or side lot lines which border any divided
highways, major arterials, or frontage roads, or to provide a buffer between
properties of different use classifications. Such plantings shall be
illustrated on the Preliminary Plat.
9.Â Â Â Fencing. The subdivider shall furnish and install fences required by the
Zoning Ordinance for a buffer or separation between properties with different
use classifications or as otherwise required by the City or any authority
thereof. Fences required abutting agricultural use property shall be installed
as agreed between the affected property owners.
10.Â Â Â Other Improvements. The owner and subdivider of the land being platted
shall be responsible for the installation of walkways as necessary, grading,
seeding and sodding of all lots, and the installation of street and traffic
control improvements and other public appurtenances as required by the City
Engineer. All such improvements shall be under the direction of the appropriate
City authority.
170.53Â Â Â EASEMENTS REQUIRED.
Easements shall be provided in land being subdivided when specified by City
officials and when necessary for purposes of providing access to or use of
various public facilities including but not limited to essential and accessory
utility services, drainage ways, trails, public access ways, and the projected
areas for the same on lands planned for future development. All said easements
shall remain open without any obstruction, and no building structures of any
kind, whether permanent, temporary, or â€œportableâ€ shall be permitted within
said easement areas. All easement areas shall be made accessible in order to
allow ease of entry and permit repair and maintenance activities as needed
within said area. Property line fences, landscaping materials, or driveways may
be installed in said easement areas upon condition that said components or
obstructions shall be removed at the expense of the property owner in case of
repair, maintenance, installation, or excavation within the area. All required
easements shall be clearly shown and labeled on the subdivision plats and
described further in the subdivision ownerâ€™s statement of deed dedication using
commonly accepted standard easement provision language.
170.54Â Â Â OPEN SPACE DEDICATION.
All residential subdivisions and other districts, which may contain residential
use, shall be so designed as to meet the neighborhood park and open space needs
of its residents. Such needs may be met by dedication and acceptance of public
parkland or by reservation by covenant of private open space, provided, there
shall exist sufficient covenants running with the land to insure adequate
maintenance by the property owners benefiting from such open space. In those
proposed subdivisions where the City Trail Plan details passage through all or
a part of the area, the gross area dedicated to the trail system shall be
included in the open space dedication required for the subdivision.
STANDARDS FOR DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
170.60Â Â Â POLICY STATEMENT.
The standards and details of design contained herein are intended only as
minimum requirements (unless specifically noted otherwise) to allow the general
layout of the subdivision to be adjusted to a wide variety of circumstances.
However, in the design and development of the plat, the subdivider should use
standards consistent with the site conditions to provide an economical,
attractive, and quality community.
170.61Â Â Â CHARACTER OF DEVELOPMENT AND CONFORMANCE TO COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.
The Commission and Council shall have the right to retain or modify the type
and character of development that will be permitted in the subdivision, and may
require that certain minimum regulations regarding this matter be incorporated
in the ownerâ€™s statement or deed restrictions. Such regulations shall be
intended to protect the appearance and value of the area surrounding the
proposed subdivision and also to assure the implementation of the intended
character and community style in the same. A â€œstatement of characterâ€ shall
generally refer to the intended uses to be established in the proposed
subdivision and may refer to variables such as land uses, building square
footage, building setbacks, size or height of structures, or other physical
characteristics of the intended development. The term â€œcharacterâ€ does not
refer to plat details such as lot sizes, lot line locations, or other technical
details outlined on the proposed subdivision plat. No subdivision shall be
approved and accepted by the City unless it conforms to the minimum
requirements contained herein. When standards are not explicitly stated in this
chapter, design requirements revert to the most current version of the Iowa
Statewide Urban Design and Specifications (SUDAS). In addition to these
requirements, all subdivision shall comply with the following:
1.Â Â Â The general nature, extent of lots, street layout, and uses detailed in
the Comprehensive Plan and other such plans including, but not limited to, a
Major Street Plan or Park and Trails Plan as adopted by the City, and other
ordinances adopted by the City.
2.Â Â Â City standards and regulations as adopted by the Council, boards,
commissions, and agencies of the City (City Engineer).
3.Â Â Â All applicable statutes, rules, and regulations of the State of Iowa and
its duly constituted agencies.
170.62Â Â Â LAND USE CONSIDERATIONS AND SUITABILITY.
Land within a proposed subdivision which is found to be unsuitable for any
primary use building construction by reason of flooding, ponding, poor
drainage, adverse soil conditions, adverse geological formations,
unsatisfactory topography, or other conditions likely to be harmful to the
public health, safety, or general welfare shall not be developed for said
construction, unless such unsuitable conditions are corrected to the
satisfaction of the City. Other land features that shall be deemed to be
unusable for construction shall be any that are judged to be an environmentally
sensitive land feature including wetlands and adjacent drainage areas important
to the natural function of the wetlands, steep slopes, and significant tree
stands. In this case the City may require the subdivider to proceed under a
cluster PUD subdivision, described herein.
1.Â Â Â Council-Required Exclusions. Prior to the approval of the Preliminary
Plat, the Council shall, with a recommendation from the Commission, prepare a
report stating the reasons for the exclusion of the area from building
development and for needed protection of the designated area or the surrounding
area outside of the proposed subdivision or both. The report shall be forwarded
to the subdivider and state options for including the designated area in the
subdivision as part of an open space, trail area, or inclusion in part of the
stormwater design area. The subdivider shall be provided the opportunity to
present data for a proposed use of the area, which will provide protection and
preservation of the involved area and afford the subdivider an acceptable use
of the area. Upon receipt of the subdividerâ€™s proposal, the Council shall,
after receipt of the Commission review and recommendation regarding the same,
review and act upon the proposal. The Council may approve the proposal, modify
the proposal, or defer the proposal to further consideration of alternative
uses of the area.
170.63Â Â Â LAND SUBJECT TO FLOODING.
Any area of land in a proposed subdivision which is detailed within the Flood
Hazard Area on a FEMA Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) adopted by the
City shall utilize the land use regulations and guidelines as provided in the
Floodplain Management Ordinance as adopted by the City. (See
Chapter 160)
170.64Â Â Â DESIGN STANDARDS.
The design standards for improvements herein contained are intended only as
minimum requirements so that the general arrangement and layout of a
subdivision may be adjusted to a wide variety of circumstances. In addition to
the standards set forth in this chapter, the Council, with assistance of the
City Engineer, may from time to time adopt by resolution, technical standards
for public improvements. Such technical standards may vary for classes of
improvements and shall contain the minimum acceptable specifications for the
construction of said improvements. Upon adoption by the Council by resolution,
the technical standards for public improvements shall have such force and
effect as if they were fully set forth herein.
1.Â Â Â Water Main System. The required water infrastructure improvements,
including fire hydrants, for the proposed subdivision shall be designed and
installed in accordance with the Code of Iowa, the applicable standards and
requirement of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, Chapters
90 through
93 of this Code of Ordinances, the City Technical Standards, and the Board of
Health regulations. The plans and specifications for the improvements shall be
prepared and signed by an engineer registered in the State of Iowa. Said water
system lines and fixtures shall be established within public street rights-of-
way, or public easements of sufficient width to allow adequate access for
future maintenance, repair, and reconstruction of said facilities, including
excavation. Water supply lines, including the location of all fire hydrants,
shall be shown on the Preliminary Plat.
2.Â Â Â Sanitary Sewer System. The sewage collection system and pumping system (if
required) for the proposed subdivision shall be designed and installed in
accordance with the Code of Iowa, the applicable standards and requirement of
the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, Chapters
95 through
100 of this Code of Ordinances, the City Technical Standards, and the Board of
Health regulations. The plans and specifications for the improvements shall be
prepared and signed by an engineer registered in the State of Iowa. Said
sanitary sewage collection lines and accessories shall be established within
public street right-of-way or public easements of sufficient width to allow
adequate access for future maintenance, repair and reconstruction of said
facilities, including excavation. Main sewer collection lines shall be shown on
the Preliminary Plat. Storm sewerage, foundation drains, roof drains, and
similar installations shall not be connected to the sanitary sewer system as
noted in Chapter
97.01 of this Code of Ordinances.
3.Â Â Â Storm Sewer System.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The storm sewer system shall be designed and installed to convey the
stormwater naturally flowing through the site prior to the development, and
that from within the subdivision after all improvements are installed and
structures are completed on all lots according to the allowed use.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Underground storm sewer pipe shall be installed throughout the
subdivision and connected to an existing storm sewer (if available) or to an
approved outfall. Facilities shall be designed to convey drainage through the
site equivalent to the 100-year storm in a developed state.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â On-site drainage facilities shall be designed to provide sufficient
detention facilities to reduce the release rate to the equivalent of a five-
year recurrence interval storm when the property was in an undeveloped state.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Plans and specifications for the improvements shall be prepared and
signed by an engineer registered in the State of Iowa and submitted along with
a copy of the design computations with the construction plans.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The storm sewer lines shall be adequately sized to receive drainage
from foundation drains or sump pumps. Sump pump drain lines shall be installed
at the back of the curbs on both sides of the streets unless PCR storm sewer
pipe has been installed which could collect and convey sump pump drainage. Sump
pump drain lines will be required unless it can be shown by the subdivider that
they are not needed to the satisfaction of the City with recommendation by the
City Engineer.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all
buildings and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the general
storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid
concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent lots.

Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Proposed streets shall be adjusted to the contour of the land where
possible to provide usable lots and streets of reasonable gradient.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â In general, streets shall be of a width at least as great as that
of the streets so continued or projected.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed 500 feet in length and shall be
limited to protect environmentally sensitive areas as described in Section
170.69 of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â No dead-end streets and alleys will be permitted except at
subdivision boundaries. A temporary cul-de-sac or T turn-around area shall be
provided where the street terminates at the subdivision boundary when the
street length is greater than 150 feet or one lot depth. The street surface
shall be extended to the subdivision boundary and exclude the curb and gutter
through the cul-de-sac or T turn-around area. The diameter of the street
surface for the temporary cul-de-sac shall be 80 feet. The T turn-around shall
be a section 14 and one half feet by 15 feet on each side of street. The
surface of the turnaround should be the same as the surface of the street. A
temporary easement shall be provided on the adjacent property for the temporary
cul-de-sac or T-turn around area. The subdivider shall provide to the City a
bond or suitable escrow in the amount of the accepted estimate to remove the
temporary turn-around area surface, install curb and gutter on the street
surface through the area, and install suitable fill material in the vacated
area with seeded grass.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Intersection Design -
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Intersections of more than two streets at a point shall not be
permitted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Intersection of street centerlines shall be between 80 degrees and
100 degrees.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Off-center street intersections will not be allowed.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Additional Design Considerations. The arrangement, width, grade, and
location of all streets in the proposed subdivision shall conform to the
extension of arterial and collector streets as shown on the Comprehensive Plan
and within good design parameters to the topographic conditions of the site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Future and Planned Streets -
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Where the plat submitted covers only part of a larger tract of
land owned by the same proprietor, a sketch of the prospective future street
system for the adjacent land shall be furnished, and the overall street system
arrangement evaluated during the plat consideration. Easements for the future
rights-of-way openings and extensions for streets and utilities to the boundary
of the land owned may be made a requirement of the initial plat approval.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal lots or
parcels, such lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to permit the logical
location and openings for the extension of the future streets and utility
connections with the appropriate resubdivision of the tract. Easements for the
future right of- way openings and extensions for streets and utilities may be
made a requirement of the initial plat approval.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Under some circumstances the City may require, as a condition for
approval of the Final Plat, dedication and improvement of a street having a
width greater than that necessary to meet the needs of the platted area, but
necessary to complete the City street system as it relates to both the area
being platted and the adjacent areas. In such event, the City will pay the
subdivider the difference in cost of improving the wider street and the street
width reasonable to meet the foreseeable needs of the subdivision taken alone
or through to the boundary of property owned by the same subdivider. The City
may establish a pro rata distribution of the additional cost to be shared by
the City and developers of adjacent areas to be served by the upgraded street.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Where a proposed subdivision borders an existing narrow street,
partially improved street, or when City plans or zoning setback regulations
indicate plans for realignment or widening a street that would require use of
some of the area in the proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall be required
to dedicate, at no cost to the City, the needed area and to share in the
expense of the street improvement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Frontage Streets. Where a subdivision borders on or contains an
existing or proposed arterial street, stream corridor, or utility or highway
right-of-way, the City may require, for the protection of the residential
properties and to afford separation from the barrier, limits to or specific
requirements for the lot access and arrangement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Lots shall be designed so as to back onto the primary arterial
and front onto a parallel service street, no access shall be provided from the
arterial street and screening shall be provided in a strip of land along the
rear property line of such lots.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â A frontage or service road, separated from the primary arterial
by a planting or grass strip and having access thereto at suitable points.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â Lots backing a stream barrier or highway right-of- way may
require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such barrier at
a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, such as
for park purposes in residential districts.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â In commercial and industrial developments, the streets and other
access ways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings and
the provisions of alleys, truck loading and maneuvering areas, and walks and
parking areas so as to minimize the conflict of movement between the various
types of traffic, including pedestrian.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Street Name and Name Signs.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Street names shall be in accordance with the Official Street Name
Map as provided in
Chapter 139 of this Code of Ordinances. Streets that are in alignment with
others already existing shall bear the name of the existing streets.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Street name signs are to be placed at all intersections within or
abutting the proposed subdivision. The type and location of said signs is to be
approved by the Council and the City shall install all street name signs. The
subdivider shall deposit with the City at the time of approval of the
construction plans an amount equal to the estimated cost of the installation of
all street name signs detailed on the plan.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Traffic Control Signs. All intersections within or abutting the
proposed subdivision shall have traffic control signs as recommended by the
City Engineer utilizing SUDAS regulations and approved by the City. The signs
shall be installed by the City and the subdivider shall provide the
installation cost as outlined for street name signs.
5.Â Â Â Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be required along both sides of any street in
all residential districts and in commercial and industrial districts unless a
waiver is requested. Crosswalks shall utilize the same specifications as
sidewalks. In specified areas, the City may require the installation of a
sidewalk greater than five feet in width. In these cases, the City may pay for
the difference in cost between the five feet width and the greater width
sidewalk.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Five feet wide sidewalks shall be placed adjacent to each lot frontage
or location in the street right-of-way or easement. One edge of the five feet
wide or greater sidewalk shall be placed three inches outside the property
line.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Sidewalks shall be a minimum width of five feet wide and a minimum
thickness of four inches made of Portland concrete cement with greater
thicknesses as noted in Section
136.08 of this Code of Ordinances. Optional six-feet wide sidewalks and above
shall be a minimum thickness of five inches made of Portland concrete cement.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The grade, elevations, and slope of sidewalks shall comply with that
noted in Sections
136.08(7),
136.08(8), and
136.08(9), as detailed in this Code of Ordinances and the American with
Disabilities Act (ADA).
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Required sidewalk widths along designated trail routes as identified in
the Comprehensive Plan, Master Trails Plan, or other approved plans shall be a
minimum of eight feet in width.
6.Â Â Â Street Lighting. Selected lighting fixture and pole options shall be in
accordance with City standards and in concurrence with the available selections
from and service agreement with the Cityâ€™s electrical supplier, Alliant Energy.
Street light wiring shall be placed underground for new residential
subdivisions unless determined impractical or unfeasible by the electric
utility. General arrangement for lights shall place units at street
intersections and mid-way on normal length block. The City Engineer shall
review the proposed street lighting plan for adequate illumination for traffic
and pedestrian safety in accordance with accepted standards.
7.Â Â Â Electric and Utility Services. All private utilities, including but not
limited to gas, electric power, telephone, wired internet, and cable shall be
located underground within all residential zoning districts. All private
utility equipment and installation shall be designed and installed to meet the
standards set forth by the City, Alliant Energy, or the other service providers
to the City. The Commission may recommend to the Council, after obtaining
approval from the serving utility or agency, that underground requirements be
waived if topographical, soil, or other conditions make such installation
unreasonable. Transformers, switching boxes, pedestals, and other necessary
utility equipment shall be placed within easements or public rights-of-way
provided for such facilities. Overhead utilities with underground service lines
may be permitted in commercial and industrial zoning districts.
170.65Â Â Â LOT AND BLOCK STANDARDS.
1.Â Â Â Block Design. The block lengths, widths, and shapes shall be appropriate
for the use contemplated within the applicable zoning requirements, be suitable
for the topographic features and provide for convenient traffic access,
control, circulation and safety.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Residential development block length shall not be less than 600 feet
and not more than 1,320 feet. Wherever appropriate, a block along an arterial
or collector street shall not be less than 1,000 feet length to minimize the
number of access points.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Residential development block width shall be sufficient to permit two
tiers of lots, with utility easements, but in no case shall the width be less
than 200 feet. Exceptions shall be permitted with a single tier of lots
adjacent to an arterial street, railroad, or other barrier, and the width shall
include a minimum 10-feet buffer strip.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Crosswalks may be required at or near the middle of blocks over 800
feet long or in areas where curved streets require excessive out of distance
travel. The crosswalks shall be required where deemed essential to provide
access to schools, parks and playgrounds, library, or other community
facilities.
2.Â Â Â Lot Design. The lot size, width, depth, shape, and orientation shall be
appropriate for the location and terrain of the proposed subdivision, and for
the type of development and use contemplated, and be compatible with the lot
design of adjacent land uses.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Minimum lot dimensions and sizes shall conform to the zoning ordinance
requirements applicable to the districts designated for the area in which the
proposed lots will be located.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Every lot within a proposed subdivision shall front on a publicly
dedicated street and have access to an existing or planned public street,
except as provided for in
Chapter 165 of this Code of Ordinances. Lots shall not front or have direct
access to arterial streets unless the existing street design or conditions
require the exception. When necessary, lots that front an arterial street shall
utilize a frontage road to minimize the number of access points.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Double frontage and reversed frontage lots shall be avoided except
where essential to provide separation of residential development from arterial
streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
Those lots shall front the street with lesser traffic volume. A planting screen
easement of at least 10 feet, across which there shall be no right of access,
shall be provided along the line of lots abutting such an arterial street or
other disadvantageous use.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Corner lots shall be 10 feet or more, greater in width at the building
line than that on the adjacent interior lots in the contiguous block when
designated to front on the same street.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Side lines of lots shall approximate right angles, meaning between 80
degrees and 100 degrees, to straight street lines and radial angles to curved
street lines except where a variation will provide better street and lot
layout.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal lots or parcels,
such lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to permit the logical location and
opening of future streets from the extension of adjacent streets and provide
for adequate utility extension and connections with the resubdivision into
smaller lots. Easements providing for the future openings and extension of such
streets and utilities may be made a requirement on the preliminary plat.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Outlots are discouraged. Assigned lots with inadequate area for
building purposes should be designated for open or recreational areas and the
maintenance of the same provided by incorporation into the trails dedication or
through covenants attached to individual lots or the entire subdivision.
170.66Â Â Â EASEMENTS REQUIRED.
Easements shall be required for several uses including, but not limited to,
those noted in this chapter. Unless otherwise clearly indicated on the plat and
attachments, all designated easements for essential services and infrastructure
shall convey to the City, its successors, and assigns, the perpetual right
within the designated easement area to construct, install, operate, maintain,
and remove the said essential service and infrastructure located above or below
grade, including the right to trim or remove vegetation within such easement
area where necessary to secure a clearance of not less than four feet from
wires or poles, and the right to extend to any private service provider the
right to use, separately or jointly with the City, the areas in the easement
for the purposes enumerated as detailed.
1.Â Â Â Essential Services. Where alleys are not provided, or where otherwise
required by the present or future placement of public and private utilities and
for drainage purposes, easements of not less than 10 feet in width shall be
granted by the owner along front, and where necessary, along rear and/or side
lots lines for essential service requirements as agreed upon between the City
and the same service providers. Except where prohibited by topography, the side
and rear easements shall be centered on lot lines and the placement of all
easements shall provide for continuity of alignment from block to block.
Easements of greater width may be required along lot lines, or across lots when
necessary for the placement of larger distribution lines or connections and
access to, and maintenance of, all essential services.
2.Â Â Â Easements Along Streams and Watercourses. Wherever any stream or surface
watercourse is located in an area that is being subdivided, the subdivider
shall, at their own expense, make adequate provisions for the proper drainage
of surface water from the area being subdivided and shall provide and dedicate
to the City an easement along said stream or watercourse, conforming
substantially with the line of such watercourse and with a minimum width of 15
feet of contiguous access up on each bank, such width as approved by the City
as necessary for the proper maintenance of the watercourse. Under some
circumstances the City may require, as a condition for approval of the plat,
easement dedication of an area larger than necessary to meet the drainage flow
and maintenance needs of the platted area, but necessary to maintain the
watercourses as it relates to the drainage flow of the area being platted and
other upstream areas required to convey water flow from a 100-year storm event.
All said drainage easements must be kept free of any obstructions including
landscaping features, fences, berms, re-grading, or similar activities that
alter or change the drainage patterns through the easement area.
3.Â Â Â Miscellaneous Easements. Access and maintenance easements shall be
provided for additional infrastructure needs including, but not limited to:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Pedestrian crosswalks near the middle of long blocks for improved
circulation or access to schools and other community facilities.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Pedestrian walkways to parks or trails located in the interior of
blocks.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Trails and accessories designated as part of private or public
recreation facilities.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Placement of public or private essential services not otherwise
provided by normal lot easements.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Screen planting as required between residential and commercial or
industrial lots.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Other needs as detailed in this chapter or as required in other City
ordinances.
170.67Â Â Â OPEN SPACE REQUIRED.
Open space shall be required to be dedicated for public use within any new
residential subdivision, resubdivision, and residential areas of mixed-use
subdivisions to provide for parks, playgrounds, and recreational areas. The
open space areas shall comply with public parkland, recreational trails, and
other facilities as detailed on the Comprehensive Plan and other approved
plans. The dedication of land to the City shall be accomplished by providing
the City with a properly executed warranty deed conveying the required land to
the City without cost to the City.
1.Â Â Â Area Required. The minimum amount of land required for the parkland open
space shall be based on the classification of the residential development. The
dedication is required when the gross area of the subdivision or area involved
would require open space of two or more acres. The determination of the area
shall exclude the property to be dedicated for streets, alleys, easements, and
other public ways as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â R-1 and R-1(60) Single Family ResidentialÂ Â Â Five percent of area
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â R-2 Two-Family ResidentialÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Six percent of area
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â R-3 Multi-family ResidentialÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Seven percent of area
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â R-4 Mobile Home ResidentialÂ Â Â Â Â Â Eight percent of area
2.Â Â Â Waterways and Ponds. The open space dedication area may include waterways,
ponds, and stormwater retention/detention areas with the maximum area of all
the waterways, ponds, and stormwater retention/detention areas limited to 30
percent of the total required open space.
3.Â Â Â Perimeter Open Area Location. Where proposed subdivisions abut undeveloped
lands, open space shall be placed adjacent to the subdivision boundaries with
the undeveloped land, to allow the open space area to be increased in size when
the adjacent property is developed.
4.Â Â Â Alternate Means of Dedication of Land, Master Agreement. If the land to be
developed is a part of a larger area being developed by a single developer or
by a group of developers who enter into a single agreement with the City, the
developers may enter into a written agreement with the City providing for the
dedication of the land relating to the present development in a future
subdivision plat, which land shall be dedicated for open space serving the
larger area under development by the developers. The written agreement between
the City and the developers shall establish the timetable for the dedication of
land by the developer.
5.Â Â Â Design Considerations. The following shall be considered by the Commission
and Council when determining the parameters of the open space to be dedicated:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The shape of the dedicated parcel should accommodate development of
suitable facilities for the subdivision said parcel is intended to serve. In
general, no parcel less than two acres shall be reserved for open space if it
will be impractical or impossible to secure additional lands to increase its
area. The open space shall form a single parcel of land except where two or
more parcels would be in the public interest under the requirement that the
parcels be connected by a path or strip of land not less than 15 feet wide.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The open space shall be so located so as to be reasonably accessible to
all inhabitants of the subdivision it is intended to serve. Public access to
the open space shall be provided either by adjoining street frontage or public
easements with the area. The easements shall be sufficiently wide so that
maintenance equipment will have reasonably convenient access to the land.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â A minimum of 60 percent of the open space shall be suitable for dry
ground recreational use. Fifty percent of the dry ground area should not exceed
three percent grade, and the remainder of such area should not exceed five
percent grade. Exceptions may be given in cases of exceptional topography and
natural amenities in cluster PUD subdivisions.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Existing or proposed open space and recreational facilities in
adjoining lands may serve in whole or in part the open space area needs of the
proposed subdivision with suitable agreement with the City.
170.68Â Â Â SCHOOL AND PARK SITES RESERVED.
When a tract of land within a proposed subdivision is designated in the
Comprehensive Plan or other official plans for a park or recreation site and/or
open space area which is in excess of the dedication requirements for the
subdivision provided in this chapter, or is a proposed school site, the
subdivider shall reserve such sites, designate the same on the plat, and honor
the options to purchase for a limited time. Park and other public recreation
sites shall be reserved for purchase within two years of the approval of the
Preliminary Plat. School sites shall be reserved for three years after the
approval of the same. The purchase price in all cases shall be the raw land
value prior to the subdivision planning as established by a certified land
appraiser. In addition, the price shall include one-half of the cost for
grading and paving, including curbs, of the portion of any streets contiguous
to the site, and any taxes and interest incurred by the subdivider between the
date of reservation and the date of purchase by the public agency. If the
reserved sites are not acquired by the City or other public agencies within the
specified time periods, the subdivider may subdivide the sites and revise the
plat. The appropriate public body may release the reserved sites before the
specified time periods by certifying to the Council that it does not intend to
acquire such sites within the specified time period.
170.69Â Â Â SITE AND AREA PROTECTION.
1.Â Â Â Preservation of Natural Features. Existing features which would add value
to a proposed residential development, the surrounding area, or to the City as
a whole, such as trees, watercourses, scenic features, ground cover,
environmentally sensitive areas, and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be
preserved and retained to the maximum extent possible in the design of the
proposed subdivision. No trees shall be removed from any proposed subdivision
nor any change of grade of the land affected until approval of the Preliminary
Plat and construction plans has been granted. When a proposed subdivision
contains such features, the subdivider shall prepare and present a protection
or preservation plan with the construction plans for approval. The City may
require the subdivider to proceed under a cluster PUD Subdivision, described
herein.
2.Â Â Â Soil Erosion and Sediment Control. The subdivider shall prepare plans and
submit copies of permit applications for the pollution control measures to be
implemented during the construction activities. A General Stormwater Permit No.
2 application shall be prepared for the Iowa Department of Natural Resources
when applicable. Such pollution prevention plans shall be submitted with the
grading plans included with the construction plans. A subdivider shall grade
any portion of the area within the proposed subdivision only in conformity with
the approved grading plan and install the erosion control measures as detailed.
170.70Â Â Â RESERVED.

enforcement of this chapter.
4.Â Â Â No public improvements over which the Council has control shall be made
with City funds, nor shall any City funds be expended for street maintenance,

170.81Â Â Â SEVERABILITY.
If any section or provision of this chapter is adjudged invalid or
unconstitutional, such adjudication shall not affect the validity of the
chapter as a whole, or any section or part thereof not adjudged invalid or
unconstitutional.
170.82Â Â Â CONFLICTING ORDINANCES.
Nothing contained herein shall serve to abrogate, limit, repeal, or otherwise
modify any other ordinances or regulations except as expressly set forth
herein. If any provision of this regulation conflicts with any other provision
of this chapter or with any other regulations or ordinances, the most
restrictive shall apply.
170.83Â Â Â EXCEPTIONS.
Where the strict application of standards or requirements established by this
chapter would cause substantial hardship on a particular proposed subdivision,
a petition to grant exceptions from such standards may be recommended by the
Commission and granted by the Council.
1.Â Â Â Hardship and Special Conditions. Consideration will be given to a request
for relief from the strict enforcement of the standards of this chapter where
application would result in extraordinary hardship to the owner or subdivider.
The request and action shall make a finding of fact after consideration of all
of the following conditions and evidence:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Special circumstances affecting said property such that the strict
application of the regulations would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of
the land.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The exception is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right of the owner.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The condition was not created by an action or actions of the owner or
subdivider.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical
conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the
owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, with the
application of the regulations.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The conditions upon which the request is based are unique to the
property involved and are not applicable, generally, to other property.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The granting of the exception will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in
the neighborhood in which the property is located.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â The granting of the exception will not have the effect of nullifying
the intent and purpose of this chapter. In no case shall any exception or
modification be more than a minimum easing of the requirements as needed to
eliminate the hardship.
2.Â Â Â Special Application and Consideration. An application for any such
exception shall be made in writing by the subdivider at the time when the
Preliminary or Minor Plat is filled for consideration. The application shall
clearly and fully state all the facts relied upon by the subdivider and shall
be supplemented with maps, plans and other additional data, which may aid the
Commission and Council in the review of the request. During consideration of
the application, the Commission and Council shall consider the nature of the
proposed and existing land use, the above detailed conditions and the required
compliance with any zoning ordinance section. The Commission shall provide a
recommendation to the Council and detail any conditions. The Council in
granting exceptions may require such conditions as necessary, in its judgment,
to secure substantially the objectives of the standards or requirements of this
chapter. A three-fourths majority vote of the Council is required for granting
exceptions.
170.84Â Â Â VACATION OF PLATS, STREETS AND OTHER PUBLIC LANDS.
A procedure shall be presented to allow the proprietors of lots within an
official plat a method to vacate any portion of the same official plat. The
procedure extends to the City, which wishes to vacate part of an official plat,
which had been conveyed to the City or dedicated for public use, having found
the land to be of no further benefit to the public. The procedure is presented
to comply with Sections 354.22 and 354.23 of the Code of Iowa.
1.Â Â Â Application, Review, Recommendations and Action. The proprietors of lots
within an official plat who wish to vacate any portion of the official plat
shall file an application for vacation with the Council, provided the Council
would have jurisdiction to approve the plat at the time the application is
filed. The Council shall also submit an application for vacation of any part of
an official plat, previously conveyed to the City or dedicated to the public
and which has been deemed to be of no further benefit to the public. The Zoning
Administrator shall receive the application and appropriate submissions. The
Zoning Administrator shall forward copies of the application and submissions to
the Planning and Zoning Commission for consideration at their next regular
monthly meeting. A public hearing date for the Council consideration of the
application shall also be set by the Zoning Administrator.

made:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The Planning and Zoning Commission meeting notice shall be of
general publication and posting at City Hall. For the private property vacation
application meeting, a written notice of the meeting and purpose shall be sent
to all proprietors and mortgagees within the official plat that are within 300
feet of the area to be vacated. If a portion of the official plat adjoins a
river or state-owned lake, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be
notified of the proposed meeting. For a City area vacation application meeting,
a written notice of the meeting and purpose shall be sent to the adjoining
property owners. The Commission shall make a recommendation to the Council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The Council public hearing notice shall be served in the manner as
provided in Iowa rules of civil procedure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Additional notification for vacation of private property shall be
provided. An official notice shall be served upon the proprietors and
mortgagees within the official plat that are within 300 feet of the area to be
vacated. If a portion of the official plat adjoins a river or State-owned lake,
the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be served written notice of the
proposed vacation. Notice of the proposed vacation shall be published twice,
with 14 days between publications, stating the date, time, and place of the
hearing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Published notice of the hearing for the vacation of City areas
and other public lands shall be as that prescribed in the Iowa Rules of Civil
Procedure. In addition, a written notice shall be served upon the property
owners adjoining the area.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The Council shall approve the vacation by resolution or by ordinance
and provide an instrument for the conveyance of those vacated areas.
2.Â Â Â Recording. Validation of the vacation of the official plat or portion of
the official plat is enacted upon the recording of all of the following
documents:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â An instrument signed, executed, and acknowledged by the City, all the
proprietors, and mortgagees within the area of the official plat to be vacated,
declaring the plat to be vacated.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Private property vacation instrument shall state the existing lot
description for each proprietor along with an accurate description of the
involved land area after the lots are vacated.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The City may convey the vacated property by deed or may convey the
property to adjoining proprietors through the vacation instrument. The use of
the vacating document shall include a list of the adjoining proprietors to whom
the vacated property is being conveyed along with the corresponding description
of each parcel being conveyed. The recorded vacating document when so prepared
is equivalent to a deed of conveyance and the instrument shall be filed and
indexed as a conveyance by the recorder and auditor.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A resolution by the City approving the vacation and providing for the
conveyance of all areas in the vacation including those which were previously
set aside or dedicated for public use.

adequately described for assessment and taxation purposes without reference to
the vacated lots.
3.Â Â Â Selected Public Highways. The vacation of private property on any part of
an official plat shall not close or obstruct any public highway.
4.Â Â Â Restrictions Continue. The vacation of a portion of an official plat shall

the use of property within an official plat shall be modified or revoked by
recording a consent to the modification or removal, signed and acknowledged by
the City, proprietors, and mortgagees within the plat.
