deny, or revoke any matter shall be considered in light of the facts and
circumstances then existing and as may be reasonably foreseeable, and due
consideration shall be given to the impact upon the public health, safety and

day a violation exists or continues.
      B.   A municipal infraction classified as an environmental violation is

last known mailing address, return receipt requested, or by publication in the
manner as provided in Rule of Civil Procedure 1.310 and subject to the
conditions of Rule of Civil Procedure 1.311. A copy of the citation shall be
retained by the issuing officer, and the original citation shall be sent to the

alternative relief may include, but is not limited to, an order for abatement
or injunctive relief.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.22[8])

Notes
  † EDITOR’S NOTE: A suggested form of notice for the abatement of nuisances is
  included in the Appendix of this Code of Ordinances. Caution is urged in the use
  of this administrative abatement procedure, particularly where cost of abatement
4 is more than minimal or where there is doubt as to whether or not a nuisance does
  in fact exist. If compliance is not secured following notice and hearings, we
  recommend you review the situation with your attorney before proceeding with
  abatement and assessment of costs. Your attorney may recommend proceedings in
  court under Chapter 657 of the Code of Iowa rather than this procedure.

the premises or in any parking lots or areas, including but not limited to
public rights-of-way, adjacent to the premises:

appeal shall be scheduled within seven days of the receipt of notice of appeal.

identities and addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders,
notice by one publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area

1   Deep and shallow wells, as defined in IAC 567-40.2(455B): A deep well is a
well located and constructed in such a manner that there is a continuous layer
of low permeability soil or rock at least five feet thick located at least 25
feet below the normal ground surface and above the aquifer from which water is
to be drawn. A shallow well is a well located and constructed in such a manner
that there is not a continuous layer of low permeability soil or rock (or
equivalent retarding mechanism acceptable to the department) at least five feet
thick, the top of which is located at least 25 feet below the normal ground
surface and above the aquifer from which water is to be drawn.
2   The separation distances are dependent upon two factors: the type of piping
that is in the existing sewer or drain, as noted in the table, and that the
piping was properly installed in accordance with the standards.
3   Solid wastes are those derived from the treatment of water or wastewater.
Certain types of solid wastes from water treatment processes may be land-
applied within the separation distance on an individual, case-by-case basis.
4   Solid waste means garbage, refuse, rubbish, and other similar discarded
solid or semisolid materials, including but not limited to such materials
resulting from industrial, commercial, agricultural, and domestic activities.

shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from
periodic grab samples).

satisfactory to the City, such as a State-licensed plumber, to inspect the
buildings to confirm and document that there is no sump pump or other
prohibited discharge into the wastewater collection system. The City may
periodically re-inspect any building or premises to determine compliance with
the requirements of this chapter. An inspection performed by other than a City
employee will require the completion and return of an inspection form provided
by the City. When ownership of any home or other building is transferred, the
building must have a re-inspection completed and passed within 90 day of the
sale date.
100.05 REMOVAL OF CONNECTIONS.
   1.   Any property owner who previously made any connection or installation
in violation of this chapter shall immediately remove such connection or
correct such an installation. If not removed or corrected within 30 calendar
days after notice of the violation has been delivered personally or by
certified mail to the owner, the City shall impose a surcharge in the amount
provided by this chapter. The time frame for making corrections may be extended
upon the approval of the City Clerk for up to 90 days for cause, beyond the
initial 30-day period.
   2.   The owner of a building or premises found to not be in conformance with
this chapter during periodic re-inspections shall be subjected to a surcharge
as provided herein starting from the previous date of inspection.
100.06 SURCHARGE.
   1.   Any property owner or contractor/builder refusing to allow the property
under their control to be inspected in accordance with this chapter, in order
to determine compliance, shall within 30 days of the date that admittance to
the property is refused or denied, immediately become subject to a monthly
surcharge which shall be applied to the sanitary sewer component of their
utility bill. This surcharge shall commence on the 1 st day of the month
following the month when either the property owner or contractor/builder
refuses to allow the property under their control to be inspected by the City
or to otherwise validate compliance in accordance with this chapter to the
City. This surcharge shall continue as long as no documentation satisfactory to
the City, to ascertain compliance with this chapter, has been provided to the
Building Official. This surcharge is intended to offset the added costs
associated with having to treat and collect clear water unnecessarily when the
status of a property’s connection to the sanitary sewer system cannot be
ascertained.
   2.   A surcharge of $100.00 per month is hereby imposed on every sewer bill
to property owners for the following conditions:
      A.   Not in compliance with this chapter.
      B.   Refusal of property inspection.
100.07 NUISANCE.
   The City may require a property to connect its sump pump discharge line to a
City storm sewer or drainage tile, if available, and if, in the determination
of the City it is necessary because the discharge from the sump pump is
creating a nuisance or hazardous situation.
100.08 PENALTY.
   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall become
liable to the City for any expense, loss or damage occasioned the City by
reason of such violation. The City will also retain any and all civil remedies
including, but not limited to, injunction or abatement actions to remedy a
violation.
100.09 HEARING.
   Any person aggrieved by any provision of this chapter must request a hearing
before the City Council within 30 days following an inspection or the
imposition of the surcharge. The finding of the City Council shall be final.
Any person aggrieved by the actions of the City Council under the provisions of
this chapter may seek such relief through the Courts as provided by law.

152.02 STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
   1.   The Legislature of the State of Iowa has, in Chapter 414 of the Code of
Iowa, as amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to
secure safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
   2.   Findings of Fact.
      A.   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of
the community.
      B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by: (i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
   3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Paragraph 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
      A.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
      B.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
      C.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
      D.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
152.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   1.   Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter shall
apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Ventura shown on the

prepared as part of the Flood Insurance Study for Cerro Gordo County, in (are)
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be the Official Floodplain Zoning
Map. The Cerro Gordo County Flood Insurance Study is hereby adopted by
reference and is made a part of this chapter for the purpose of administering
floodplain management regulations.
(Subsection 2 – Ord. 201 – Nov. 22 Supp.)
   3.   The boundaries of the zoning district areas shall be determined by
scaling distances on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map. When an interpretation
is needed as to the exact location of a boundary, the Zoning Administrator
shall make the necessary interpretation. The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall
hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any
requirement, decision, or determination made by the Zoning Administrator in the
enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   4.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no
structure shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without
full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
   5.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter
to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
   6.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
   7.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated Floodplain (Overlay) District areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create
liability on the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
   8.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.

152.05 ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOODPLAIN (OVERLAY) DISTRICTS.  
   The floodplain areas within the jurisdiction of this chapter are hereby
divided into the following districts:
   1.   Floodway Fringe (Overlay) District (FF) – those areas identified as
Zone AE on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map but excluding those areas
identified as Floodway;
   2.   General Floodplain (Overlay) District (GF) – those areas identified as
Zone A on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map, and;
152.06 STANDARDS FOR FLOODWAY FRINGE (OVERLAY) DISTRICT FF.  
   All development within the Floodway Fringe (Overlay) District must be
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and meet the following
applicable performance standards. Where base flood elevations have not been
provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources
shall be contacted to determine (i) whether the land involved is either wholly
or partly within the floodway or floodway fringe and (ii) the base flood
elevation. Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no development may
increase the Base Flood Elevation more than one (1) foot. The applicant will be
responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient
technical information to make such determination.
   Review by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources is not required for the
proposed construction of new or replacement bridges or culverts where (i) the
bridge or culvert is located on a stream that drains less than two (2) square
miles, and (ii) the bridge or culvert is not associated with a channel
modification that constitutes a channel change as specified in 567-71.2(2),
Iowa Administrative Code.
(Ord. 201 – Nov. 22 Supp.)
   1.   All Development. All development within the Floodway Fringe (Overlay)
District shall:
      A.   Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement.

governmental agencies including approval when required from the Iowa Department
of Natural Resources.
   2.   Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the base flood elevations. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
base flood elevations and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed subject to favorable
consideration by the Board of Adjustment, where existing topography, street
grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods
used must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various
forces and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential structures
located in areas that would become isolated due to flooding of surrounding
ground shall be provided with a means of access that will be passable by
wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this criterion shall not apply
where the Administrator determines there is sufficient flood warning time for
the protection of life and property. When estimating flood warning time,
consideration shall be given to the criteria listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa
Administrative Code.
   3.   Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved non-
residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)

elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
   4.   All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
      A.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
         (1)   A minimum of two openings, with positioning on at least two
walls, having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
         (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
         (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
      Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access
and low damage potential storage. Where the distance between the floor and
ceiling of the fully enclosed area below the "lowest floor" is five feet or
more, the applicant shall be required to sign and record with the City Clerk a
Non-Conversion Agreement that ensures the lower enclosed area remains compliant
with the criteria outlined in this subsection.
      B.   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.

elevation.
(Paragraph C – Ord. 201 – Nov. 22 Supp.)
      D.   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
plumbing, gas lines, water/gas meters and other similar service utilities
either elevated (or in the case of non-residential structures, optionally
floodproofed to) a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation or
designed to be watertight and withstand inundation to such a level.
(Paragraph D – Ord. 201 – Nov. 22 Supp.)
   5.   Factory-Built Homes:
      A.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the structure
is a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation.
(Paragraph A – Ord. 201 – Nov. 22 Supp.)
      B.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame
ties to ground anchors. Anchorage systems may include, but are not limited to,
use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors as required by the State
Building Code.

that are flammable, explosive or injurious to human, animal or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or:
(i) not subject to major flood damage and be anchored to prevent movement due
to flood waters; or (ii) readily removable from the area within the time
available after flood warning.
   8.   Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as
levees, flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the base
flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for
adequate interior drainage. In addition, structural flood control works shall
be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
   9.   Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must be
designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations must be
approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
   10.   Subdivisions. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and
subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all

152.08 ESTABLISHMENT OF VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   1.   The Zoning Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in specific
cases such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary
hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.
      A.   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
      B.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
      C.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      D.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance
coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
      E.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.

variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an appeal, the Board may, so
long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance,
reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in
writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision.
In granting a variance, the Board shall consider such factors as contained in
this section and all other relevant sections of this ordinance and may
prescribe such conditions as contained in Subsection 4 of this section.
   3.   Factors upon Which the Decision of the Board of Adjustment Shall Be
Based. In passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
      A.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
      B.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
      C.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.
      D.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      E.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the City.

development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
      I.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for the area.
      J.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      K.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood water expected at the site.
      L.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and bridges.
      M.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
chapter.
   4.   Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this
chapter. Such conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:

170.03 GARAGES AND ACCESSORY BUILDINGS.  
   The location of garages and accessory buildings shall be governed by the
following:
   1.   In any residential district a private garage is permitted in the side
or rear yard on the same lot with a dwelling, either as a separate building, or
a separate room within or attached to the dwelling. When wholly or partially
within the limits of the side yard and attached to the principal building or a
separate room within a principal building, such garage shall be considered as a
part of such principal building and shall conform to all yard and space
requirements as specified in this chapter for principal buildings. When wholly
or partially within the limits of a rear yard and attached to a principal
building or a separate room within a principal building, such garage, if one
story in height, may extend into the rear yard the distance its rear wall is
beyond the rear wall of the principal building.
   2.   No private garage shall exceed 864 square feet in area or have a side
wall height greater than 10 feet or a peak height greater than 18 feet. The
garage must be compatible with the architecture and construction of similar
dwellings and other buildings in the neighborhood. Metal buildings of pole type
or machine shed type construction are not permitted. The building must be sided
with a house type siding and the roof shall be the same as the existing area
building. No galvanized or colored steel siding or roofing is permitted.
   3.   In any business district, public or private garages or accessory
buildings are permitted on any part of the lot.
   4.   Each detached private garage or accessory building shall be not less
than five feet from a party lot line or alley line. When any part of such
building is within 50 feet of any street or public place upon which the lot
abuts, such building shall be not less than five feet from any lot line which

a garage or carport is entered directly from an alley, it shall not be located
closer than 10 feet from the alley right-of-way line.
   5.   No detached garage or accessory building is permitted within the limits
of a front yard, unless entirely below natural ground level.
   6.   If any portion of a detached garage or other accessory building is
within a side yard of a principal building on the same lot, such garage or
building shall not be nearer to the side lot line than would be required for
the building wall of a principal building on the same lot. In interpreting this
regulation each 12 feet in height of the accessory building shall be considered
a story.
   7.   No detached garage or accessory building may be placed in any rear yard
or any side yard so that any part of such building is nearer a street line than
is permitted for a wall of a principal building on the same lot or abutting
lot.
   8.   Accessory buildings or garages within a rear yard may occupy not more
than 35 percent of such area. Accessory buildings or garages must be erected

and no accessory building or garage shall be used unless the principal building
on the lot is also being used. Accessory buildings or garages may be connected
to the principal building by a breezeway with setbacks for the principal
structure. An addition may be made to an existing principal structure which
extends past the front of an existing legally established detached accessory
structure or garage, provided no connection or attachment is made between the
existing structure and the addition unless setbacks can be met as required for
a principal structure.
   9.   If an adjacent lot is built upon, an accessory building or garage must
be entirely to the rear of the line of any principal building on such adjacent
lot. No accessory building or garage shall degrade adjacent property by
obstructing views, inhibiting solar access, or hindering ventilation. There
shall be no more than one detached accessory building or garage per lot.
   10.   Structures less than 100 square feet and not on permanent foundation,
shall be exempt from the requirement of obtaining a construction permit
provided only one such structure shall be permitted per residential dwelling
and located only in rear and side yards not closer than two feet from the
property line. Such structures may include tool sheds, dog houses, play houses,
ice houses, air conditioning units, satellite dish antennas not to exceed 36-
inch diameter, and similar structures as determined applicable by the Zoning
Administrator. No dog house, play house, in addition to hunting or fishing
structures, ice fishing shacks or other mobile or transient structures intended
for used other than permanent storage shall be used for purposes of an
accessory building or use. Accessory buildings larger than 100 square feet in
size which require a Building Permit shall be required to use the same
construction materials or have the same appearance of the principal use
building or structure on the lot.
   11.   Membrane Storage Structures may be erected on a temporary basis to
facilitate special events or construction of permanent structures. Membrane

use and development of all such tracts for mobile home parks as provided for in
Chapter 146 of this Code of Ordinances. The development plans shall be referred
to the Planning and Zoning Commission for study and report. If no report is
transmitted within 60 days of referral, the City Council may take action
without further awaiting the report. If the Commission approves the plans, they
shall then be submitted to the Council for consideration and action. The
approval and recommendations of the Commission shall be accompanied by a report
stating the reasons for approval and specific evidence and facts showing that
the proposed mobile home park plan meets the conditions provided for in this
Zoning Code. (See Chapter 146 of this Code of Ordinances for further
regulations governing mobile home parks.)
170.05 CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS.

171.01 INTENT.
   Within the districts established by this Zoning Code, there exist lots,
structures, uses of land and structures and characteristics of use which were
lawful prior to adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code but are prohibited,
regulated or restricted under the terms of this Zoning Code or future
amendments. It is the intent of this Zoning Code to permit these
nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their
survival. It is further the intent of this Zoning Code that nonconformities
shall not be enlarged upon or extended or be used as grounds for adding other
structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
171.02 NONCONFORMING USES.
   The following requirements shall apply to nonconforming uses and buildings:
   1.   Except as specified in Subsection 7 of this section, the lawful use of
a building existing at the time of the adoption of the Zoning Code may be
continued, although such use does not conform with the provisions hereof. Such
use may be continued provided no structural alterations, except those required
by law or ordinance, are made therein.
   2.   If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a
building may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or more
restricted classification.
   3.   If a nonconforming building is removed, the future use of such premises
shall be in conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Code.
   4.   If the nonconforming use of a building is discontinued for a period of
six months, the use of the same shall thereafter conform to the provisions of
the district in which it is located.
   5.   When a nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use or to a
more restricted nonconforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to
a less restricted use.
   6.   If, by amendment to this Zoning Code, any property is hereafter zoned
to a more restricted district by a change in district boundaries, or the
regulations and restrictions in any district are made more restrictive or of a
higher classification, the provisions of this Zoning Code relating to the
nonconforming use of buildings or land existing at the time of the enactment of
the Zoning Code shall apply to buildings or land occupied or used at the time
of the passage of such amendment.
   7.   No nonconforming building which has been damaged by fire, explosion,
Act of God or the public enemy to the extent of more than 65 percent of its
value shall be restored until a permit is secured from the Board of Adjustment,
as provided in Section
173.04(4) of this Code of Ordinances.

obtaining a permit, the permit fee shall be doubled. The payment of such double
fee shall not relieve any persons from fully complying with the requirements of
this chapter in the execution of the work.
   3.   Penalties. Violations of these buildings regulations may be punishable
as provided in Section
1.14 or as a municipal infraction in accordance with
Chapter 3 of this Code of Ordinances. Each day a violation continues shall be
considered a separate offense. Nothing herein shall prevent the City from
taking such other legal action as is necessary to prevent any violation.
   4.   Other Penalties. In addition to other remedies provided by law, the
City may institute injunction, mandamus, abatement or any other appropriate
action, actions, proceedings or proceedings to prevent, enjoin, abate, or
remove such unlawful location, erection, construction, reconstruction,
enlargement, change, maintenance or use.
   5.   Abatement. The imposition of any other prescribed penalty shall not
preclude the City from instituting appropriate actions or proceedings to
prevent an unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair,
conversion, maintenance or use; or to restrain, erect or abate a violation; or
to prevent the occupancy of a building, structure or premises.
172.05 AMENDMENTS AND CHANGES.

any proposed amendment or change signed by the owners of 20 percent or more,
either of the area of the lots included in such proposed change, or of those
immediately adjacent in the rear thereof, extending the depth of one lot or not
to exceed 200 feet from the street frontage of such opposite lots, such
amendment shall not become effective except by the favorable vote of at least
three-fourths of all members of the Council.

173.01 CREATION AND MEMBERSHIP.
   A Board of Adjustment, hereinafter referred to as the Board, is hereby
established. The Board shall consist of five members appointed by the Mayor,
subject to the approval of the Council, for staggered terms of five years.
Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired terms of any member whose term
becomes vacant. Members shall be removable for cause by the appointing
authority upon written charges and after public hearing. All members of the
Board shall serve without compensation. The Board, subject to the approval of
the Council, may employ such clerical and technical assistance as may be needed
to carry on its work.
173.02 CHAIRPERSON AND MEETINGS.
   The Board shall adopt its own rules of procedure, not in conflict with this
Zoning Code or Code of Iowa, to enable it to perform its functions and duties.
The Board shall elect its own Chairperson, who shall serve for one year. Such
Chairperson or, in the absence the Chairperson, the Acting Chairperson may
administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. Meetings of the Board
shall be held at the call of the Chairperson and at such other times as the
Board may determine. All meetings of the Board shall be open to the public. The
City Clerk or such other City employee as the Council may designate shall serve
as the Secretary of the Board. In the absence of the Secretary, the Chairperson
of the Board may appoint one of the members of the Board to act as Secretary
Pro Tem for the meeting. The Board shall have the power to call on any City
Department for assistance in the performance of its duties, and it shall be the
duty of such Department to render such assistance as may reasonably be
required. The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of
each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating
such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official
actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the Board.
173.03 APPEALS.
   Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer,
department, board or bureau of the City affected by any decision of the Zoning
Administrator. A fee of $75.00 shall be charged at the time the appeal is
filed. Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by the
rules of the Board, by filing with the officer from whom the appeal is taken
and with the Board a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The
Zoning Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. The
Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, give public
notice thereof and decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing
any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. An appeal stays all
proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Zoning
Administrator certifies to the Board, after the notice of appeal shall have
been filed with said official, that by reason of facts stated in the
certificate a stay would, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator, cause
imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be
stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board
or by a Court of record on application or notice to the Zoning Administrator
and on due cause shown.
173.04 JURISDICTION.
   The Board shall have the following powers:
   1.   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any
order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the Zoning Administrator
in the enforcement of this Zoning Code.
   2.   To hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of this Zoning Code
upon which the Board is required to pass under this Zoning Code.
   3.   Where the street or lot layout on the ground actually varies from the
street and lot lines as shown in the Zoning Map, the Board shall interpret the
map and the provisions of this Zoning Code in such a way as to carry out the
intent and purposes of this Zoning Code for the particular district or section
in question.
   4.   To permit the reconstruction, within one year, and use as before of a
nonconforming building destroyed or damaged to more than sixty-five percent
(65%) of its value by explosion, fire, act of God, or public enemy or other
calamity, where the Board finds that the public needs require a continuance of
the nonconforming use and that such continuance would not primarily permit a
continuation of a monopoly.
   5.   To permit the erection and use of a building or the use of premises in
any location for a public service corporation for public utility purposes which
is determined reasonably necessary for the public convenience or welfare except
in a Residential District.
   6.   To authorize, upon appeal, in specific cases such variance from the
terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest, where,
owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions herein
will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of this Zoning Code
shall be observed and substantial justice done. The Board shall be satisfied by
the evidence heard before it that the granting of such a variance will
alleviate a hardship approaching confiscation as distinguished from a special
privilege sought by the owner.
   7.   To determine, in cases of uncertainty, the classification of any use
and to determine, in cases of uncertainty, industrial uses which may be
established in any industrial district according to the terms of Paragraph
166.11(1)(E) and Paragraph
166.12(1)(E) of this Zoning Code.
   8.   To permit the erection and use of any accessory building on a lot
before the erection of a principal building on such lot as provided herein,
provided such use is temporary and for a period of time not to exceed one year.
   9.   To permit the extension of an existing building or use into a more
restricted district immediately adjacent, under such conditions as will
safeguard the character of the more restricted district, provided that such
extension shall not be permitted more than 50 feet beyond the boundary line of
the district in which such building or use is authorized.
   10.   To permit any use in a district that is not specifically prohibited in
such district, and that is in keeping with and appropriate to the uses
authorized in such district by the provisions of this Code of Ordinances.
173.05 VOTING.
   In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the Board may, in conformity with
the provisions of this Zoning Code, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may
modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from and may
make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made,
and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal
is taken. The concurring vote of three members of the Board shall be necessary
to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the Zoning
Administrator, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which
it is required to pass under this Zoning Code or to affect any variation of
this Zoning Code. It is not the intention to grant the Board the power or
authority to alter or change the Zoning Ordinance or Zoning Map. Such power and
authority rest solely with the Council in the manner provided in Section
172.05 of this Code of Ordinances.
173.06 RELIEF THROUGH COURTS.
   Any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by a decision of the
Board under the provisions of this Zoning Code or any taxpayer or any officer,
department, board or bureau of the City may seek such relief through the courts
as provided by statute.

180.01 SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the Planned Unit Development (PUD) Code.
180.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the PUD District is to provide for well-planned developments
that conform with the intent of the Comprehensive Plan. Although PUD
developments may appear to deviate in certain aspects from a literal
interpretation of the Comprehensive Plan, the Planned Unit Development District
and its accompanying guidelines and regulations are intended to allow freedom
of design in order to promote developments which will be an asset to the City,
by equaling or surpassing the quality of developments resulting from the
application of more conventional zoning regulations. More specifically, it is
the intent to:
   1.   Flexibility. Promote and permit flexibility that will encourage a more
creative and imaginative approach in development which results in a more
efficient, aesthetic, desirable and economic use of land, while maintaining the
density and intensity of use.
   2.   Adjacent and Existing Development. Provide minimal effect upon adjacent
properties and existing development.
   3.   Utilities. Promote development that can be conveniently, efficiently
and economically served by existing municipal utilities and services or by
their logical extension.
   4.   Special Site Features. Promote flexibility in design, placement of
buildings, and use of open space, pedestrian and vehicular circulation
facilities, and off-street parking areas in a manner that will best utilize the
potential of sites characterized by special features of geography, geology,
topography, size or shape.
   5.   Natural and Historic Features. Provide, where it is shown to be in the
public interest, for the preservation of historical features and such natural
features as streams, drainage ways, floodplains, ponds/lakes, topography, rock
outcroppings, unique areas of vegetation, stands of trees and other similar
natural assets.
   6.   Recreational Facilities. Provide for more adequate recreational
facilities and other public and common facilities than would otherwise be
provided under conventional land development.
   7.   Natural Setting. Provide for the enhancement of the natural setting
through careful and sensitive placement of manmade facilities and plant
materials.
180.03 REVIEW APPLICATION PROCEDURE.
   The reviewing and processing of any proposed PUD shall be in two steps:
   1.   Pre-Application. Pre-application conference with sketch.
   2.   Application. Application for PUD plan approval.
180.04 PRE-APPLICATION SKETCH.
   In order to eliminate unnecessary expenditures of time and funds, the
developer shall present to the Zoning Administrator a pre-application sketch
plan. The Zoning Administrator will involve any City staff department heads
necessary. This sketch should show the generalized over-all plan for
development of the proposed PUD area. Included as part of the over-all sketch
plan, should be the following elements:
   1.   Site. Location and size of site.
   2.   Topography. Existing topography with major earth work areas, major
storm water runoff considerations, and problem drainage way areas so indicated.
   3.   Environmental Characteristics. Existing tree masses and other
geological and environmentally important characteristics.
   4.   Traffic and Parking. Generalized vehicular and pedestrian systems and
parking areas.
   5.   Buildings. Generalized building locations.
   6.   Density. Approximate gross density, and number and types of dwelling
units and the approximate gross floor areas of commercial and industrial land
uses.
   7.   Utilities. Generalized utility line considerations with sanitary sewer
capacity limitations so noted.
   8.   Lot Ownership. Generalized public and private ownership boundaries,
including common ownership areas, if any.
   9.   Sun and Wind. Generalized building locations shall reflect that
consideration is given to the positive and negative effects of sun and wind.
   10.   Schedule. Generalized flow chart indicating construction schedule.
   11.   Filing Fee. A fee of $50.00 plus $25.00 for each acre in the
development.
The Zoning Administrator shall have 15 days in which to review and comment on
the pre-application sketch plan.
180.05 APPLICATION FOR PUD PLAN APPROVAL.
   After the pre-application conference, application for PUD plan approval
shall be made to the Council. The Council shall refer the application to the
Planning and Zoning Commission for review and recommendation. Such
recommendations shall be forwarded to Council within 45 days of referral. Upon
written request and approval by Council, an additional 45 days may be granted
for a recommendation. All technical assistance to the Commission on the
application shall be coordinated by the Zoning Administrator. The application
shall include the following written and visual materials and copies shall be

Code of Ordinances and the final development plan as approved by the Council,
which covenant shall be recorded in the office of the County Recorder.
   9.   Additional Matters. Additional easement or agreements required by the
Council at the time of preliminary plan approval.
180.06 COUNCIL ACTION ON PUD APPLICATION.
   The Council shall by resolution grant approval of or reject the PUD
application. If the application is rejected, the Council will advise the owner
or developer of any changes which are desired, or should have consideration,
before approval will be given. Upon approval of the PUD application, a
certification of approval signed by the Mayor and attested by the City Clerk
shall be affixed to the original application. Such action may be taken by the
Council only after complying with the requirements for notice and hearing as
required by Section 172.05 of this Code of Ordinances.
180.07 DESIGN STANDARDS.  
   Even though PUDs promote and permit flexibility of design, certain standards
must be applied to assure compatibility of the project with the intent of this
chapter. These standards are as follows:
   1.   Permitted Uses. Normal permitted uses are those of a residential
character including single-family (detached or attached), two-family and/or
multiple-family dwellings and the usual accessory buildings, such as garages,
storage space, maintenance structures, and buildings for recreational purposes.
Commercial uses, limited to those specifically approved by the City Council,
are permitted provided that such uses are primarily for the service and
convenience of the residents of the development. Such commercial uses are
encouraged to be located within residential buildings, however, if any such use
is proposed to be contained within a separate free-standing structure:
      A.   It must be so designed to reflect the residential character of the
development; and
      B.   It may contain an identification sign no more than four square feet,
placed flush on one wall and generally not observable from the periphery of the
development.
   No building permit for a free-standing commercial structure will be issued
and/or no certificate of occupancy for commercial use of any residential
structures will be issued until 60 percent of the development’s dwelling units
have been issued a certificate of occupancy.
   2.   Density. The permitted maximum dwelling unit density shall not exceed
what is allowable in the zoning district in which the PUD is constructed. Where
a PUD is proposed and is contained within two or more zoning districts, density
shall be determined by adding the maximum dwelling units allowable for each
proportional part.
   3.   Tract Size. There is a minimum tract size of two acres.
   4.   Parking. All parking must meet the requirements of the zoning district
in which the PUD is constructed. Where a PUD is proposed, and is contained
within two or more zoning districts, parking requirements shall be determined
by the Council, but shall not be any less restrictive than the existing
requirements in the zones in which the PUD is constructed. Parking lot design
consideration shall be as follows:
      A.   Parking areas shall be treated as an integral part of the
development in scale, location, and character.
      B.   Parking areas shall be so arranged to discourage through traffic.
      C.   As appropriate, parking areas shall be screened from adjacent
structures and streets with hedges, plantings, fences, earth berms, changes in
grade, and/or similar examples.
      D.   Parking areas shall be so designed to allow for drainage of surface
water without erosion, flooding, and other inconveniences.
   5.   Height. There shall be no maximum height requirement. However, heights
shall be regulated to the extent that they relate to the proposed development
and to the general area within which the development is proposed to be located.
   6.   Open Space. A major portion of any PUD is its open space provisions.
The desirability is closely tied to the integration of open space with the
total development. This section sets forth the overall objective desired for
PUDs. Therefore, no quantitative standards are stated in this section. Quality
standards acknowledge the separate and multiple functions of open preservation
of natural site amenities. In designing the PUD, consideration shall be given
to such functions. All land in the PUD indicated as common land and common open
space shall be maintained by one of the following methods:
      A.   If the land is deeded to a Homeowner’s Association (HOA), the
developer shall file a declaration of covenants and restrictions that will
govern the association, to be submitted with the application for the PUD.
   The provisions shall include, but not be limited to:
         (1)   The HOA must be set up before the dwellings are sold.
         (2)   Membership must be mandatory for each home buyer and any
successive buyer.
         (3)   The open space restrictions must be permanent.
         (4)   The HOA must be responsible for liability insurance, taxes, and
the maintenance of recreational and other facilities.
      B.   All or any part of the open space system may be conveyed to and City
by joint agreement of the developer and the City, and such conveyance may be by
dedication or easement.
   7.   Additional Requirements. PUD plans, where applicable, shall comply with
the final plat requirements of the Subdivision Regulations (Chapter 185 of this
Code of Ordinances).
   8.   Other Considerations. A number of major factors should undergo
evaluation as a portion of design standards. These include:
      A.   Natural drainage areas shall be retained as appropriate and, if
necessary, improved.
      B.   Due consideration shall be given to preserving natural site
amenities and minimizing the disturbance to the natural environment.
      C.   Existing trees shall be preserved wherever possible. The location of
trees is to be considered in designing building locations, underground
services, and paved areas.
      D.   If the development includes floodplain areas, they shall be
preserved as permanent open space.
      E.   Due consideration shall be given to the natural topography and major
grade changes shall be avoided. If the development includes hillsides and
slopes, special evaluation shall be given to geological conditions, erosion and
topsoil loss. If unfavorable development conditions exist, the Council may
restrict clearing, cutting, filling, or other substantial changes in the
natural conditions of the affected area.

thoroughly familiar with the subdivision requirements and with the proposals of
the City Plan affecting the territory in which the proposed subdivision lies.
185.05 VARIANCES.
   Where in the case of a particular proposed subdivision, it can be shown that
strict compliance with the requirements of this chapter would result in
substantial hardships or injustices to the subdivider, or that these conditions
would result in inhibiting the achievement of the objectives of this chapter,
the Commission may recommend to vary, modify or waive the requirements so that
substantial justice may be done and public interest secured; provided, such
variance, modification or waiver will not have the effect of nullifying the
intent and purpose of this chapter. In no case shall any variation or
modification be more than a minimum easing of the requirements. Such variances
and waivers may be granted only by the affirmative vote of the members of the
Council.
185.06 CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.
   Any regulations or provisions of this chapter may be changed and amended

before such plat has been approved by the Council shall forfeit and pay the
penalty of not more than $50.00 for each lot so transferred or sold or agreed
or negotiated to be sold, and a description by metes and bounds shall not
exempt the transaction from such penalties. Each day that such violation
continues after such fine has been assessed constitutes a separate offense.
185.08 FINAL APPROVAL; DATA REQUIRED.
   In obtaining final approval of a proposed subdivision by the Commission and
the Council, the subdivider shall submit a preliminary plat, a performance
guarantee and a final plat in accordance with this chapter. The only exception
to the above requirements shall be in the case of minor subdivisions, for which
the requirement to provide the preliminary plat and performance guarantee shall
be waived.
185.09 PRELIMINARY PLAT PROCEDURE.
   1.   Filing Copies. The subdivider shall first prepare and file with the
Commission nine copies of a preliminary plat conforming in detail to the
requirements set forth in this chapter.
   2.   Referral; Examination. The Commission shall forthwith refer one copy to
the Clerk and two copies to the City’s engineer. The City’s engineer shall
carefully examine the plat as to its compliance with the laws and ordinances of
the City, the existing street system, and good engineering practices and shall,
as soon as possible, submit findings in duplicate to the Commission together
with one copy of the plat received.
   3.   Passing; Recommendations. The Commission shall, upon receiving the
report from the City’s engineer, as soon as possible, consider the report and

190.01 PURPOSE.  
   The Site Plan Review procedure provides for special review in addition to
plan review required by other regulations and/or sections of this Code of
projects that have potentially significant effects on traffic circulation or a
significant effect on land uses in adjacent neighborhoods. The procedure
provides for review and evaluation of site development features and possible
mitigation of unfavorable effects on surrounding property. It is the intent and
purpose of this chapter to establish a procedure which will enable the City to
plan for and review certain proposed improvements of property within specified
zoning districts of the City in order to accomplish the following:
   1.   Promote and permit flexibility that will encourage a more creative and
imaginative approach in development and result in a more efficient, aesthetic,
desirable and economic use of land;
   2.   Provide minimal effect upon adjacent properties and existing
development (to this end, the Planning and Zoning Commission may make
appropriate requirements);
   3.   Promote development that can be conveniently, efficiently and
economically served by existing municipal utilities and services or by their
logical extension;
   4.   Provide for the enhancement of the natural setting through careful and
sensitive placement of manmade facilities and plant materials;
   5.   Encourage adequate provision for surface and subsurface drainage in
order to assure that future development of other areas of the City will be
available;
   6.   Provide suitable screening of parking, truck loading, refuse disposal,
outdoor storage areas and noise from adjacent and nearby property.
190.02 INITIAL REVIEW PROCEDURE.
   1.   A Site Plan review is required whenever a person or other group wishes
to develop any tract or parcel of land within all zoning districts, except for
any detached single-family residence and two-family residences including any
accessory structure thereto; new construction of nonresidential accessory
buildings less than 1,000 square feet in gross floor area; and additions to
existing nonresidential buildings when the addition is less than 10 percent of
the existing building’s gross floor area or the addition does not exceed 1,000
square feet, whichever is more restrictive. Said person shall cause to be
prepared a Site Plan of such development and shall submit nine copies of said
Site Plan to the Building Official for review. An additional seven copies will
be submitted at the time of review by the Council. The provisions of this
section shall be applicable to the redevelopment, enlargement or extension of
any commercial or industrial uses and structures existing as of January 1,
2017. The Site Plan shall contain such information and data as outlined herein.
   2.   A copy of the Site Plan shall be referred to the Building Official, or
such other person as shall be designated from time to time by the Council, who
shall review said Site Plan as to its compliance with the ordinances of the
City, its effect upon public utilities and the public street system.
   3.   Whenever any person proposes to develop any tract or parcel of land or
modify any existing development which requires a Site Plan submittal, a pre-
application conference may be required. The conference shall include the
applicant or representative, City Administrator, the City Building Official,
and the Public Works Director. The purpose of the conference shall be to
acquaint the City Staff with proposed development and to acquaint the applicant
or representative with the procedures and with any special problems that might
relate to the development. The applicant shall furnish a legal description of
the property to be developed at the time of the pre-application conference.
   4.   The Building Official shall forward a copy of the Site Plan to each
member of the Planning and Zoning Commission. The Commission shall, after
receiving the Building Official’s report, review the Site Plan for conformity
with the regulations and design standards contained herein, and may confer with
the developer on changes deemed advisable in such Site Plan.
   5.   The Commission shall consider the Site Plan within 30 days of the date
of submission of the Site Plan.
   6.   The Commission may, in its discretion, hold a public hearing on the
Site Plan of the proposed development and prescribe the notice thereof and to
whom such notice shall be given.
   7.   The Commission shall, upon receipt of the recommendation of the
Building Official, either approve or deny the Site Plan.
   8.   No building permit for any structure, for which a Site Plan is
required, shall be issued until the Site Plan has been approved by City Staff
or City Engineer.
   9.   Upon final action by the Commission on any Site Plan, a copy of said
Site Plan with the action of the Commission noted thereon and signed by the
Chairperson shall be filed with the City Clerk.
   10.   If the Building Official finds that any construction or proposed
construction or occupancy of a development on a tract of land for which a Site
Plan has been approved will not comply with the Site Plan as approved, or if
the Building Official finds that the construction and development of the tract
is not being carried out in accordance with the development schedule filed with
the Site Plan, the Building Official shall suspend all building permits for the
development and order all construction stopped until such time as the owner of
the project, or any successors in interest, shall have provided the Building
Official with proof satisfactory to said Building Official that the Site Plan
will be complied with. Any person aggrieved by any decision or action of the
Building Official under this subsection may appeal such action or decision to
the Board of Adjustment.
   11.   If the owner or developer of a tract of land for which a Site Plan has
been approved determines that an extension of time is necessary or that a
modification of the Site Plan would provide for a more appropriate or more
practicable development of the site, the owner or developer may apply for an
amendment of the Site Plan. The Commission may grant an extension of time or a
modification of a previously approved Site Plan if it determines that such
modification of the Site Plan would provide for a more appropriate development
of the site.
190.03 DESIGN STANDARDS.

            b.   TR-55 Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds as developed by the
USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service,
            c.   Hydrographs. The calculations shall be certified by an
engineer, architect, or landscape architect licensed in the state of Iowa and
familiar with such calculations.
      C.   The design requirements of the On-site Storm Water Management
facilities are as follows:
         (1)   For new developments where On-site Storm Water Management
facilities are required as set forth in these regulations, the maximum
allowable storm water runoff from the site in the post-developed condition as
calculated for a five-year design storm shall be limited to the storm water
runoff rate for the site in the pre-developed condition based on a five-year
design storm. The discharge rate shall be controlled at the detention/retention
facilities outlet and NOT by the size of the storm sewer pipe serving the site.
Retention facilities may be used in lieu of detention facilities with approval
from the building official.
         (2)   A safe overflow path shall be designed for storms exceeding the
capacity of the detention/retention basin.
         (3)   Regional storm water management facilities are encouraged.
         (4)   For new residential developments, storm water detention or
retention is not allowed within any front or
side yard setbacks required by the Zoning Ordinance, or within 25 feet
from the estimated rear building line unless otherwise approved by the Building
Official. A single lot detention or retention will not be allowed within three
feet of rear building lot line.
         (5)   Dry-bottomed detention basins shall be oversized by 10
percent to help offset anticipated sedimentation. An alternative to over-sizing
is the construction of a series of sediment trapping fore bays in the basin
with firm bottoms which allow routine removal of sediment.
         (6)     Maximum side slopes of detention/retention basins shall not
exceed 3:1.
         (7)   Provisions shall be made to keep the bottom of the detention
basin dry unless a permanent pond or lake is being utilized for retention.
   10.   The proposed development shall be designed and the buildings and
improvements located in such a manner as not to unduly diminish or impair the
use and enjoyment of adjoining or surrounding property and to such end shall
have such buffers, screen fences and landscaping as may be proper and shall
minimize the adverse effects on such adjoining property from automobile
headlights, illuminations of required perimeter yards, refuse containers, and
impairment of light and air. For the purpose of this section, the term “use and
enjoyment of adjoining property” means the use and enjoyment presently being
made of such adjoining property, unless such property is vacant. If vacant, the
term “use and enjoyment of adjoining property” means those uses permitted under
the zoning district in which such adjoining property is located.
   11.   The proposed development shall not unduly increase the public danger
of fire or diminish the public safety, and shall be designed to adequately
safeguard the health, safety and general welfare of the public and of persons
residing and working in the development and in the adjoining or surrounding
property.
   12.   The proposed development and all structures therein shall be designed
in such a manner as to create a quality environment and shall be
architecturally and aesthetically harmonious and attractive.
