the leaks and spills of hazardous substances, these regulations are promulgated
to establish responsibility for the treatment, removal and cleanup of hazardous
substance spills within the City limits.
36.02   DEFINITIONS.
For purposes of this chapter the following terms are defined:
1.   “Cleanup” means actions necessary to contain, collect, control, identify,
analyze, clean up, treat, disperse, remove, or dispose of a hazardous
substance.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[1])
2.   “Hazardous condition” means any situation involving the actual, imminent,
or probable spillage, leakage, or release of a hazardous substance onto the
land, into a water of the State, or into the atmosphere which creates an
immediate or potential danger to the public health or safety or to the
environment.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[4])
3.   “Hazardous substance” means any substance or mixture of substances that
presents a danger to the public health or safety and includes, but is not

means. “Hazardous substance” may include any hazardous waste identified or
listed by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection
Agency under the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended by the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, or any toxic pollutant listed under
Section 307 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as amended to January 1,

(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[7])
36.03   CLEANUP REQUIRED.
Whenever a hazardous condition is created by the deposit, injection, dumping,
spilling, leaking or placing of a hazardous substance, so that the hazardous
substance or a constituent of the hazardous substance may enter the environment
or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters, including ground
waters, the responsible person shall cause the condition to be remedied by a
cleanup, as defined in the preceding section, as rapidly as feasible to an
acceptable, safe condition. The costs of cleanup shall be borne by the
responsible person. If the responsible person does not cause the cleanup to
begin in a reasonable time in relation to the hazard and circumstances of the
incident, the City may, by an authorized officer, give reasonable notice, based
on the character of the hazardous condition, said notice setting a deadline for
accomplishing the cleanup and stating that the City will proceed to procure
cleanup services and bill the responsible person for all costs associated with
the cleanup if the cleanup is not accomplished within the deadline. In the
event that it is determined that immediate cleanup is necessary as a result of
the present danger to the public health, safety and welfare, then no notice
shall be required and the City may proceed to procure the cleanup and bill the
responsible person for all costs associated with the cleanup. If the bill for
those services is not paid within 30 days, the City Attorney shall proceed to
obtain payment by all legal means. If the cost of the cleanup is beyond the
capacity of the City to finance it, the authorized officer shall report to the
Council and immediately seek any State or federal funds available for said
cleanup.

evacuate people from the area threatened by a hazardous condition caused by the
person.

condition caused by that person, including the costs of assessing the injury,
destruction or loss.

the City in responding at and to the scene of a hazardous condition caused by
that person.

hazardous substance shall notify the State Department of Natural Resources and
the Police Chief of the occurrence of a hazardous condition as soon as possible
but not later than six hours after the onset of the hazardous condition or
discovery of the hazardous condition. The Police Chief shall immediately notify
the Department of Natural Resources.

46.02 Cigarettes and Tobacco
 
46.01   CURFEW.
The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote the
public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and specifically
to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults responsible for
minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors committed after
the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences and criminal

be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that responsible
adult’s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful or careless

whereabouts of the minor.

where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to

juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the person’s
parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but
not for longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or
magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
   E.   “Public place” includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys, and sidewalks dedicated to public use and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises, whether publicly or privately owned,
that are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited
commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is
permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has
access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is
considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.

specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have

the U.S. Constitution guarantees of free exercise of religion, freedom of
speech, freedom of assembly or, if traveling, within one hour after the end or
before the beginning of the activity.
   D.   The minor is on an emergency errand for a responsible adult;
   E.   The minor is engaged in interstate travel through the City beginning,
ending or passing through the City when such travel is by direct route.
4.   Responsibility of Adults. It is unlawful for any responsible adult
knowingly to permit or to allow a minor to be in any public place in the City
within the time periods prohibited by this section unless the minor’s presence
falls within one of the above exceptions.
5.   Enforcement Procedures.
   A.   Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in the
absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driver’s license,
a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance, use his
or her best judgment in determining age.

the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the person’s
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any nonsecured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into

minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at such
time as the court may direct.
   D.   Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minor’s parent, guardian or other person
legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the
law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative
of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person
who is known to the child.
6.   Penalties.
   A.   Responsible Adult’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation
by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall, by certified mail, send to the
adult responsible for the minor, written notice of the violation with a warning
that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew
ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with applicable
penalties.
   B.   Responsible Adult’s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as defined
in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows the minor
to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a municipal
infraction.
   C.   Minor’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a minor,
the law enforcement officer shall give the minor a written warning, which
states that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the
curfew ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with applicable
penalties, or, at the law enforcement officer’s discretion, may issue the minor
a citation for a first violation.

Notes
  † EDITOR’S NOTE: A suggested form of notice for the abatement of nuisances is
  included in the Appendix of this Code of Ordinances. Caution is urged in the use
  of this administrative abatement procedure, particularly where cost of abatement
4 is more than minimal or where there is doubt as to whether or not a nuisance does
  in fact exist. If compliance is not secured following notice and hearings, we
  recommend you review the situation with your attorney before proceeding with
  abatement and assessment of costs. Your attorney may recommend proceedings in
  court under Chapter 657 of the Code of Iowa rather than this procedure.

convincing evidence that an owner, manager, employee, contemporaneous patron,
or guest of an adult establishment commits any of the following acts either on
the premises or in any parking lots or areas, including but not limited to
public rights-of-way, adjacent to the premises:

the Iowa Department of Transportation or any other state vehicle registration
office identifies a person or entity as the lessee of the vehicle, that lessee

person or entity listed on that vehicle registration may be deemed the vehicle
owner and held jointly and severally responsible for a violation of this
section.
2.   VEHICLE OWNER'S CIVIL LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN TRAFFIC OFFENSES

detected crossing a marked stop line or the intersection plane at a system
location when the traffic signal for that vehicle's direction is emitting a
steady red light or arrow, the Vehicle Owner shall be subject to a civil fine
as scheduled below in section 7.
   B.   If a vehicle is detected traveling at a speed above the posted limit,
the Vehicle Owner shall be subject to a civil fine as scheduled below in

subsection 5 of this section, and other defenses may be considered in
connection with the appeal process.
   D.   In no event will an Automated Traffic Citation be sent or reported to
the Iowa Department of Transportation or similar department of any other state
for the purpose of being added to the Vehicle Owner's driving record.
3.   NOTICE OF VIOLATION; FINE
   A.   Upon a Hudson Police Officer's determination that the Automated Traffic
Enforcement System has detected a violation described in subsections 2(C), a
notice of the violation will be mailed to the Vehicle Owner for each violation
recorded by an Automated Traffic Enforcement System or traffic control signal
monitoring device. The Automated Traffic Enforcement Contractor shall mail the
notice within 30 days after receiving information about the Vehicle Owner. The
notice shall include the name and address of the Vehicle Owner; the vehicle
make, if available and readily discernable, and registration number; the
violation charged; the time; the date; and the location of the alleged
violation; the applicable fine and monetary penalty which shall be assessed for
late payment; information as to the availability of an administrative hearing
in which the notice may be contested on its merits; and that the basis of the
notice is a photographic record obtained by an Automated Traffic Enforcement
System.
   B.   Any violation of subsection 2(C) above shall be subject to a civil fine
as stated in Section 7. All civil fines shall be payable to the City of Hudson.
4.   CONTESTING AN AUTOMATED TRAFFIC CITATION
   A.   Vehicle Owner who has been issued an Automated Traffic Citation may
contest the citation as follows:
      (1)   In no event will an Automated Traffic Citation be sent or reported
to the Iowa Department of Transportation or similar department of any other
state for the purpose of being added to the Vehicle Owner's driving record. By
submitting in a form specified by the City a request for an administrative
hearing to be held at the Hudson Police Department before an administrative
appeals board (the "Board") consisting of one or more impartial fact finders.
Such a request must be filed within 30 days from the date on which Notice of
the violation is sent to the Vehicle Owner. After a hearing, the Board may
either uphold or dismiss the Automated Traffic Citation and shall mail its
written decision within 10 days after the hearing, to the address provided on
the request for a hearing. If the citation is upheld, then the Board shall
include in its written decision a date by which the fine must be paid, and on
or before that date, the Vehicle Owner shall either pay the fine or submit a
request pursuant to the next paragraph.
      (2)   By submitting in a form specified by the City a request that in
lieu of the Automated Traffic Citation, a municipal infraction citation be
issued and filed with the Clerk of Courts of the Iowa District Court in Black
Hawk County. Such a request must be filed within 30 days from the date on which
Notice of the violation is sent to the Vehicle Owner. Such a request will
result in a court order requiring the Vehicle Owner to file an answer and
appearance with the Clerk of Court, as well as setting the matter for trial
before a judge or magistrate. If the Court finds the Vehicle Owner guilty of
the municipal infraction mandated court costs will be added to the amount of
the fine imposed by this section.
5.   EXCEPTIONS TO OWNER LIABILITY. There shall be no liability pursuant to
this section if:
   A.   In no event will an Automated Traffic Citation be sent or reported to
the Iowa Department of Transportation or similar department of any other state
for the purpose of being added to the Vehicle Owner's driving record. The
operator of the vehicle in question was issued a municipal infraction for the
violation in question pursuant to Hudson Code 3.01 or was issued a uniform
traffic citation for the violation in question pursuant to Chapter 321 of the
Code of Iowa; or
   B.   The violation occurred at any time after the vehicle in question or its
state registration plates were reported to a law enforcement agency as having
been stolen, provided, however, the vehicle or its plates had not been
recovered by the Vehicle Owner at the time of the alleged violation; or
   C.   The vehicle in question was an authorized emergency vehicle; or
   D.   The officer inspecting the recorded image determines that the vehicle
in question was lawfully participating in a funeral procession; or
   E.   The officer inspecting the recorded image determines that the vehicle
in question entered the intersection in order to yield the right-of-way to an
emergency vehicle.
6.   FAILURE TO TIMELY PAY OR APPEAL. If the recipient of an Automated Traffic
Citation does not either pay the fine by the due date stated in the citation or
appeal the citation as provided herein, a municipal infraction may be filed by
the Hudson Police Department and a fine may be sought in accordance with Hudson
Code 3.01 rather than section 7 below. If the Court finds the Vehicle Owner
guilty of the violation, mandated court costs will be added to the amount of
the fine imposed by this section. If the recipient of an Automated Traffic
Citation does not either pay the fine by the due date stated on the original
citation or successfully challenge the citation as provided herein, the City
may file a municipal infraction against the Vehicle Owner in accordance with
the Hudson Municipal Code 3.01 and 364.22 of the Code of Iowa, seeking judgment
for the applicable civil fine provided in section 7 plus state mandated filing
fee and court costs. If a judgment is entered for the City in the municipal
infraction proceeding, the City may, subject to applicable law, pursue
enforcement of the judgment together with interest as permitted by law.
Collection of that judgment may include referral to the State of Iowa Income
Offset program administered by the Department of Administrative Services, State
Accounting Enterprise. Notwithstanding the City's right to file a municipal
infraction, the City may first seek voluntary payment of the fine by sending a
written request for payment to the Vehicle Owner and/or referring the matter to
a private service agent to conduct collection in accordance with all applicable
laws.

publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the
vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice
under Subsection 2 of this section. The published notice may contain multiple
listings of abandoned vehicles but shall be published within the same time
requirements and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed notice

procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more wheels or
other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable. The police

91.01   PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to encourage the conservation of water and
facilitate the equitable distribution of charges for water service among
customers.
91.02   WATER USE METERED.
All water furnished customers shall be measured through meters furnished by the
City and installed by the City. The owner of a building separated into two or
more apartments or units may either have one water meter installed to service
the building or may request separate meters for each unit. If separate meters
are requested, each meter (including irrigation meters) must have its own
outside stop box, or the meters must be located in a common utility room with
outside access. City personnel will not enter said room through an apartment or
business. The building manager or owner shall furnish a key or key code to the
City to allow for access to any common utility room. If multiple stop boxes are
installed, each stop box and/or meter must be clearly marked to identify the
unit which it services. If the property owner does not meet the conditions for
separate meter accounts as stated in this section, or only one meter is used to
serve multiple units, then the utility accounts for the multi-unit building
shall be titled in the property owner’s name. Owners of property not in
compliance with this section as of May 1, 2011, but who have proven to the City
through a City inspection that individual shutoffs are available per residence
to disconnect service per the City’s demands are not required to comply with
this section as to any meter in existence as of such date. Landlord is required
to give the City access to property within 48 hours of City’s request. If
landlord fails to comply with request and City is not allowed into the property
to disconnect service, then landlord will be liable for any water usage
occurring more than 48 hours after the City’s request for access.
91.03   FIRE SPRINKLER SYSTEMS; EXCEPTION.
Fire sprinkler systems may be connected to water mains by direct connection
without meters under the direct supervision of the Superintendent. No other
open, unmetered connection shall be incorporated in the system, and there shall
be no valves except a main control valve at the entrance to the building which
must be sealed open.
91.04   LOCATION OF METERS/REMOTE READERS.
All meters shall be so located that they are easily accessible to meter readers
and repairmen and protected from freezing. To facilitate the reading of the
water meter, the City may install a remote reading device to the water meter
that enables the City to read the meter from outside the premises. The device
is the property of the City and no person shall disconnect it from the meter,
tamper with it, or otherwise damage or interfere with its operation. Upon
request of the customer, the City will temporarily disconnect the remote device
to enable the customer to reside the property or other types of remodeling. The
device must be reconnected by the City. The City will charge the customer a fee
for this service of $25.00 to be paid at the time of the disconnection and if
not so paid, the fee will be added to the customer’s next water bill.
91.05   METER SETTING.
The property owner shall provide all necessary piping and fittings for proper
setting of the meter including a valve on the discharge side of the meter.
Meter pits may be used only upon approval of the Superintendent and shall be of
a design and construction approved by the Superintendent.
91.06   METER INSTALLATION FEE. 
There shall be a fee charged to the property owner for each new installation of
a water meter in accordance with the schedule of such fees approved by
resolution of the City Council.
91.07   METER REPAIRS.
Whenever a water meter owned by the City is found to be out of order the
Superintendent shall have it repaired. If it is found that damage to the meter
has occurred due to the carelessness or negligence of the customer or property
owner, or the meter is not owned by the City, then the property owner shall be
liable for the cost of repairs.
91.08   FIRE HYDRANT METERS.
Persons may request the City to temporarily install a fire hydrant water meter
to provide a source of water for activities such as filling swimming pools,
watering sod and other large volume needs. Upon completion of the hydrant meter
application form acknowledging the party requesting the water meter will be
responsible for the care of requested equipment; including but not limited to
damage done to the water meter or any additional equipment from the City, and
upon the receipt of a deposit fee as determined by the Superintendent but not
to exceed the sum of $1,300.00, the City will install a water meter on a City
fire hydrant per the request. In addition to the rental deposit of the
aforementioned sum, the person requesting the fire hydrant will be responsible
for costs of all water used as reflected by the water meter and the base rental
payment of $50.00. Upon return of the rented meter, inspection by the
Superintendent of the equipment and the confirmation of no damages, and payment
in full for the water usage and rental fee, City will release the held rental
deposit.
91.09   IRRIGATION METERS.
1.   Irrigation Meters. A “prime meter” measures water consumed and disposed
through the public water and sanitary sewer system respectively. “Irrigation
meters” may additionally be installed to measure water that is not disposed
through the public sanitary sewer treatment system. The water used for
irrigation meters would include water for swimming pools, yards, gardens, or
other uses where sanitary sewer charges are not applicable. Irrigation meters
shall be installed not more than four feet from the prime meter and shall be
installed parallel to the prime meter. Sewer charges shall not apply to water
amounts measured by irrigation meters. The water rate to be charged for
irrigation meters shall be at the same rate as provided in Section
92.02 of this Code of Ordinances, and there shall not be any base rate charged.
Shut off valves are required ahead and after the irrigation meter and must be
within one foot of the meter. A back flow preventer (approved by the City) to
protect against contamination of the water system must be installed after the
irrigation meter. The irrigation meter must be installed with the arrow on the
meter being in the direction of the flow of water to the owner. Underground
irrigation systems are allowed in City right-of-way with the understanding that
any repair of the irrigation system caused by maintenance of utilities will be
at the owner’s expense. Electrical conduit shall be installed in all buildings
in accordance with specifications provided by the Water Department of each
meter.
2.   Owner’s Responsibility.
   A.   Meter must be purchased from the City, with a written request at City
Hall, and meter supplied within 24 hours of initial request. Owner is
responsible for all costs associated with installation of irrigation meter,
including meter and equipment. No installment payments on equipment purchased
by owner or contractor will be allowed.
   B.   The owner shall complete all installation work within 90 days of
receipt of the meter, in compliance with this Code of Ordinance, including the
inspection of the irrigation meter installation by building officials prior to
its use.
   C.   Owner must allow the building official 24 hours after inspection
request to complete the inspection.
   D.   The owner, at the owner’s expense, is responsible to exchange the
irrigation meter for an updated meter when the City implements a meter system
upgrade. If the owner does not upgrade the meter within 30 days of City
installing an upgraded primary meter at location or have an inspection
scheduled with the Building Official, the owner will by required to disconnect
the irrigation meter system and re-install plumbing such that all water flows
through the primary meter and have an inspection scheduled with the Building
Official. Owner is responsible for all costs associated with disconnection of
irrigation meter, including meter and equipment. The City may purchase the
irrigation meter from the owner at a price not to exceed $100.00; purchase
price will be based on staff recommendation.
   E.   The owner is responsible for costs and repair due to any damage to
sidewalks or streets with installation of sprinkler system in City right-of-
way.
91.10   RIGHT OF ENTRY.
The Superintendent shall be permitted to enter the premises of any customer at
any reasonable time to read, remove, or change a meter. After initial contact
and right of entry denied, the Superintendent shall send a certified letter
requesting permission to enter the premises within 30 days after the mailing of
the certified letter to read, remove, or change a meter. If no access is
granted, the water will be shut off and a $75.00 reconnect fee will be billed
to the property owner. The property owner then has the option to install an
external meter pit at the owner’s expense.

92.01   SERVICE CHARGES.
Each customer shall pay for water service provided by the City based upon use
of water as determined by meters provided for in
Chapter 91. Each location, building, premises or connection shall be considered
a separate and distinct customer whether owned or controlled by the same person
or not. After water has passed through a water meter for a specific account, no
reduction will be made on any bill for water services because of water leakage.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
92.02   RATES FOR SERVICE.
Water service shall be furnished at the following monthly rates within the
City:
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
1.   First 150 cubic feet used per month - $17.86 (minimum charge)
2.   All over 151 cubic feet used per month - $0.0643 per cubic foot.
(Ord. 893 – Apr. 24 Supp.)
92.03   RATES OUTSIDE THE CITY.
Water service shall be provided to any customer located outside the corporate
limits of the City which the City has agreed to serve at the same rates
provided in Section
92.02. No such customer, however, will be served unless the customer shall have
signed a service contract agreeing to be bound by the ordinances, rules, and
regulations applying to water service established by the Council.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.4 & 384.84)
92.04   BILLING FOR WATER SERVICE.
Water service shall be billed as part of a combined service account, payable in
accordance with the following:
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
1.   Bills Issued. The Clerk shall prepare and issue bills for combined service
accounts on the last day of each month.
2.   Bills Payable. Bills for combined service accounts shall be due and
payable at the office of the Clerk by noon on the twentieth day of the
following month. The customer understands that should the account balance
reflect a debit or credit balance after making a payment, the difference will
reflect in the next billing cycle to be paid. If the difference is more than
$1,000.00 owed, it is subject to late payment charges. Accounts in arrears will
need to be paid in full each month. Customers agreeing to ACH transactions
shall authorize the City to initiate debit entries to the customer’s checking
account indicated on the agreement and the depository financial institution
named on the agreement to debit the same to such account. The customer
acknowledges that the origination of ACH transactions to the customer’s account
must comply with the provisions of the U.S. law. The authority is to remain in
full force and effect until the City has received a written notification from
the customer of its termination in such time and in such manner as to afford
the City and the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it.
3.   Multi-Unit Billing. For any multi-unit building where two or more tenants
are served through a single water meter and service pipe, the property owner
shall be responsible for payment of bills for water services furnished to the
multi-unit building. The City will not bill any individual tenant for services
under such circumstances. However, if the building has separate meters for each
unit in the building, the tenants of the building shall be billed for their own
individual accounts, provided that each water meter has a meter lockout
installed.
4.   Late Payment Penalty. Bills not paid when due shall be considered
delinquent. A late payment penalty of $10.00 or five percent of the amount due,
whichever is greater, shall be added to each delinquent bill. The City Clerk is
authorized to waive the penalty in instances where circumstances seem to
justify the waiver, but no more than one waiver per 12-month period is allowed
per property or customer. Payments made timely but resulting in funds reversed
due to lack of good funds will be regarded as a delinquent bill.
5.   Income Offset Program. All combined service accounts whose amount due
balances have remained delinquent for a period of no less than five months may
be enrolled in the State of Iowa Income Offset Program. The City will assess a
fee for enrolling an account in the Income Offset Program.
6.   Budget Billing. Budget billing is an agreed upon average of the last 12
months of usage by the current homeowner. This payment amount is paid no matter
the usage until the Clerk’s office determines the homeowner needs to align the
account to zero. Budget billing is not available for tenants. All tenants are
required to maintain the actual usage billing process. The customer and Hudson
Utilities (water, sewer, garbage, storm sewer) agree to the following terms for
monthly billing through the budget process:
   A.   The customer agrees to pay utility bills on a monthly budget billing
agreement in equal monthly payments as indicated on the agreement, subject to
normal terms and conditions of the Hudson Utilities (water, sewer, storm sewer,
and garbage). Irrigation is handled based on actual usage.
   B.   The customer understands the payment amount is based on estimated usage
of the last 12 months. If there is no 12-month history, an agreed upon amount
will be determined based on prior water bills or estimated usage size of
household.
   C.   The customer understands that should the account balance reflect a
debit or credit balance after making the current payment that reflects an
amount equal to or greater than the current payment, the customer can contact
City Hall to ask for alignment of the budget payment at any time or the City
Clerk staff may notify of options to align the customer’s account when
necessary and notify the customer by mail after the change. City Hall may align
credit balances to offset the next payment (SKIP payments).
   D.   If the customer’s account requires an alignment, accounts in arrears
will need to be paid in full prior to the computation of the new monthly
payment amount. And a new agreement is required with customer signature for all
changes made. If the customer fails to contact the Clerk’s office within 30
days of the notice, the Clerk’s office will proceed to align account
accordingly and remove the customer from budget billing.
   E.   The customer understands that failure to make the regular payments by
noon on the twentieth of the month may result in being charged a late payment
penalty (five percent of the balance due with a minimum late fee of $10.00 per
month), and the customer may no longer be eligible for budget payment service.
All penalties must be paid with the next scheduled monthly payment (budget
payment plus late charge fees assessed). ACH customers, those where the City
pulls the ACH payment to be drawn automatically, will not be assessed a late
charge unless the payment is considered insufficient for payment.
   F.   The non-sufficient funds payment (NSF) will be treated as a non-payment
and subject to late fee charges and possible other charges associated with the
NSF payment. ACH NSF payments must be paid by the customer to City Hall within
five business days of notice and should be paid with cash. There is a $30.00
charge for NSF payments.
   G.   The customer will notify, in writing, the utility billing office of the
customer’s wish to stop budget billing. A check will be enclosed for any
outstanding balance on the account.
92.05   SERVICE DISCONTINUED.
Water service to delinquent customers shall be discontinued or disconnected in
accordance with the following:
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
1.   Notice. If a combined service account bill is not paid within five days
following the date that the bill is due and payable or if a deposit of good
funds is not provided within three business days following written notice from
the City Clerk that a check for payment of the account was returned for
insufficient funds, the City Clerk shall notify each delinquent customer that
service will be discontinued or disconnected if payment of the combined service
account, including late payment charges, is not received by the date specified
in the notice of delinquency. Such notice shall be sent by ordinary mail to the
customer in whose name the delinquent charges were incurred and shall inform
the customer of the nature of the delinquency and afford the customer the
opportunity for a hearing prior to the discontinuance or disconnection.
2.   Notice to Landlords. If the customer is a tenant, and if the owner or
landlord of the property or premises has made a written request for notice, the
notice of delinquency shall also be given to the owner or landlord. If the
customer is a tenant and requests a change of name for service under the
account, such request shall be sent to the owner or landlord of the property if
the owner or landlord has made a written request for notice of any change of
name for service under the account to the rental property.
3.   Hearing. If a hearing is requested by noon of the day preceding the shut
off, the City Clerk shall conduct an informal hearing and shall make a
determination as to whether the discontinuance or disconnection is justified.
The customer has the right to appeal the Clerk's decision to the Council, and
if the Council finds that discontinuance or disconnection is justified, then
such discontinuance or disconnection shall be made, unless payment has been
received.
4.   Final Notice. If the customer has not made payment of the outstanding debt
within 12 days of the delinquent date or requested a hearing, or if payment
arrangements have not been made pursuant to a hearing before the City Clerk,
the City will attach a red door tag to the door of the property. This notice
will give the customer a 24-hour notice before the water will be shut off or
disconnected. A flat rate of $10.00 per month will be charged when a red door
tag is placed on a resident's door.. Such notice may be placed only on Monday
through Thursday of any week. If the required payment is not timely made,
service shall be discontinued or disconnected. If access to the water meter in
unavailable to the City, the property owner or an agent designated by the owner
in writing shall, upon request by the City, provide access to the meter to
allow disconnection. If the property owner or agent fails to provide such
access within 48 hours after issuance of written notice, excluding weekends and
holidays observed by the City, the owner shall be charged with a municipal
infraction.
5.   Fees. A customer who doesn't pay the outstanding debt after a red door tag
is attached to said customer's door will have service shut off or disconnected
at noon the next business day. No water shutoffs or disconnections will occur
on Fridays. The cost to restore service is a $75.00 service charge plus all
outstanding debt on the account, there are no exceptions to restoring service.
Service is restored between work hours of 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Monday through
Friday.

93.01   PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a means and method for the extension
of water mains to serve property not served by an existing water line so as to
preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort and
convenience of the residents of the City.
93.02   DEFINITIONS.
For use in this chapter, the following terms are defined:
1.   “Builder” means the owner of land who causes a water main to be installed
under the provisions of this chapter. Such term includes the heirs, successors
or assigns of such owner.
2.   “Estimated cost” means a cost estimate prepared by a registered
professional engineer or qualified contractor experienced in the installation
of water main pipe and appurtenances. All such estimates are subject to the
approval of the Council and in the event of any disagreement as to the amount
of estimated costs, the materials to be used, or installation methods, the
determination of the Council shall be final and conclusive.
93.03   CONSTRUCTION BY CITY AT OWNER’S REQUEST.
An owner of land abutting or adjoining a public street where no water main has
been installed may make application to the Council for the installation of a
water main in said street for the purpose of serving the property in accordance
with the following:
1.   Application and Deposit. A written request for such installation, and a
sum equal to the total estimated cost of the installation from the point where
the water main is presently installed and terminates to the point where the
most distant boundary of the owner’s lot abuts the said public street, shall be
submitted to the Council.
2.   Construction. Upon receipt of the deposit, the City shall construct the
water main for the purpose of serving the property of the applicant (builder),
as soon as such construction can reasonably be accomplished.
3.   Additional Costs. In the event the actual cost to the City of installation
of the water main is in excess of the estimated cost, the builder agrees to
reimburse the City for the actual additional cost within 30 days after the
presentation of a bill for such additional cost.
4.   Lien Authorized. In the event of the failure of the builder to reimburse
the City, as specified in subsection 3 above, the total of the additional cost
shall be certified to the County Treasurer as a special assessment lien against
the builder’s real estate. In the written request for installation of the water
main, the landowner shall waive all objections to jurisdiction and rights to
notice and consent to the entry of such a special assessment lien against the
real estate.
5.   Maximum Cost. The additional cost of installation, as contemplated in
subsections 3 and 4 above, shall not exceed 110 percent of the estimated cost.
6.   Connecting Property. The expense of connecting the property of the builder
to the water main laid in the public street shall be borne by the builder, in
addition to the cost of constructing said water main, but such connection shall
be under the supervision of the City.
93.04   CONSTRUCTION BY OWNER.
In the event an owner of land abutting or adjoining a public street in which no
water main has been previously installed desires to construct said water main
at the owner’s own expense, the owner may do so, after making proper
application to the City and receiving a permit to install such a water main, in
accordance with the following:
1.   City Supervision. The installation of such a water main by a landowner at
the owner’s expense shall be under the strict supervision of the City and
shall, in all ways, conform to the requirements and specifications of the City.
2.   Surety Bond. When making application to the City for a permit to install
such a water main, the applicant shall post with the City a surety bond, in an
amount to be set by the Council and made a matter of record in the minutes of
the Council, which shall be in an amount equal to but not less than 110 percent
of the total estimated cost of the installation for the full distance from the
termination point of the presently existing water main to the point where the
farthest boundary of the applicant’s land abuts the public street, and the bond
shall guarantee the installation of the water main in as short a time as
reasonably possible and shall further indemnify the City for the cost of
completing the project in the event the applicant fails to complete the project
within a reasonable time, and shall further indemnify the City for all damages
to public property incurred in the installation, and shall further hold the
City harmless for any and all other damages arising from the installation of
the water main.
3.   Ownership of Water Main. After the water main has been installed, it shall
become the property of the City.
4.   Cost Approval. For purposes of determining connection charges and
reimbursement under Sections
93.05 and
93.06 below, costs incurred by the owner shall be certified to the City and
only so much of said costs as are approved by the City shall be used in
determining connection charges and reimbursement as provided herein.
93.05   CONNECTION CHARGE.
Following the installation of an extension to the water system under the
provisions of this chapter, there shall be paid to the City a connection charge
in an amount equal to one-half the lineal construction cost for the full width
of any lot, tract, or parcel of ground to be served by a connection to such
water main. Such connection charge shall be paid to the City prior to making
any connection to said water main.
93.06   BUILDER REIMBURSED.
Upon receipt by the City of any connection charges under Section
93.05 above, the City shall deduct and retain an amount equal to one-half the
lineal construction cost for the full width of the builder’s property served by
the water main and shall then remit to the builder the balance of such
connection charges until said builder has been reimbursed for the expense of
such installation less cost attributable to the property of the builder.
93.07   RIGHTS OF CITY.
All decisions in connection with the manner of installation of any extension
and maintenance thereof shall remain in the exclusive control of the City and
such extension shall be the property of the City and no other person shall have
any right, title or interest therein.
93.08   CONSTRUCTION BY CITY WITHOUT OWNER’S REQUEST.
1.   The City may extend water mains to serve property within the City not
served by an existing water line. Following the installation of an extension to
the water system, there shall be paid to the City a front footage charge. The
front footage charge shall be equal to $16.00 per foot both in Hudson and
outside of City limits, with a minimum charge of $32.00 per lineal foot of
water main installed, except as otherwise agreed upon by the City prior to the
effective date of this provision. A development shall pay a minimum of $32.00
per lineal foot of water main installed, unless a developer pays the cost of
the extension pursuant to the City’s Development Ordinance (
Chapters 165 through
170 of this Code of Ordinances). Further, the City may, at its discretion,
elect to add additional charges based on unusual circumstances which increase
the costs to the City. The front footage charge shall be paid before the tap is
made to the main.
2.   The City shall maintain payment records.
3.   Front footage and corner lot calculations for purposes of determining the
appropriate charge shall be determined as set forth below:
   A.   The front footage charge is applicable to all types of tracts of land
irrespective of the use with the exception of agricultural farm land adjacent
to a building or buildings whose owner desires water service for use only at
the building site. The owner may elect to pay only for the frontage of the
site, but never less than 200 feet of said frontage. The remaining frontage
would be subject to payment of the front footage charge in effect at the time
of payment.
   B.   A tract of land bordered by more than one dedicated City street right-
of-way is considered a corner lot and shall be deemed to have frontage equal to
the total footage bordering dedicated City street right-of-way divided by the
number of streets bordering the lot to produce the average frontage, however,
any corner lot having a frontage of more than 200 feet will be calculated by
using 200 feet as a maximum in the averaging procedure, and the excess over 200
feet will be charged at the front footage rate. The Superintendent shall
establish administrative policies for three-sided tracts and special
situations.
   C.   The front footage charge will be increased to anyone who requires a
service line larger than 6-inch by an amount in proportion to the construction
cost of the larger water main required.
   D.   The corner lot averaging formula is an effort to appropriately allocate
the water main extension costs to lots having two or more frontages. The
following should be considered in regard to corner lots.
      (1)   More water main is required; therefore, more cost is incurred by
the City to serve a corner lot.
      (2)   The owner/developer may not receive more benefit from water service
because of the extra water main and cost.
   E.   An owner may have a large corner lot or tract and subsequently divide
it for two or more building lots. The intent is that the front footage will be
paid for each lot as the lots are divided at the time of building construction
and water service line extension. A maximum of 200 feet shall be applied to the
corner lot averaging formula to place a maximum on the effect of averaging. As
shown on the following example, Tract A, with frontages of 360 feet and 500
feet would have a 200 x 200 foot corner averaged and the additional 160 feet
plus 300 feet added to produce a 660 foot frontage which would be multiplied by
the current front footage rate. As long as that parcel remains as one unit of
land with one service line, no further charges would apply. When such a tract
is re-platted and additional footage is created, as the five lots shown with
dashed lines, the calculation would be as follows:
Lot 1 – 130 feet + 150 feet ÷ 2 = 140 feet
Lot 2 – 110 feet
Lot 3 – 120 feet
Lot 4 – 200 feet
Lot 5 – 150 feet
which amounts to a total of 720 feet, less the 660 feet previously paid, equals
60 feet, which would be payable at the current rate. The five lots would be
entitled to one service line each. As shown by the example calculations above,
the payment is for a specific number of feet of frontage. When the re-platting
increases or decreases that footage, an additional charge or credit is
applicable. The original amount of footage may have been paid at a rate other
than the current rate. Any additional footage is payable at the current rate.
The City’s water main extension policy is explained in more detail with the
following examples. These examples are given to provide better understanding
and consistency to the method of calculation used for parcels of property.
Method of Calculation of Front Footage Charge to a Corner Lot,
Which Is Subsequently Re-Platted:
The example shown below is to demonstrate the methods of calculating the front
footage for a large corner lot, which is subsequently replatted. This method is
intended to prevent the owner from evading the intent of the front footage
payment requirements by platting a large tract, paying the front footage with
the advantages of the corner lot averaging and subsequently building several
buildings with separate ownerships and separate water services.

Method of Calculation of Front Footage Charge to a Corner Lot,
Using the Average Frontage and the 200 Foot Maximum Provision:
180 feet + 190 feet = 370 feet ÷ 2 = 185 feet
times the current front footage rate

93.09   WATER MAIN EXTENSIONS IN DEVELOPMENTS.
Developers should cover the entire cost of a water main extension for the
development, as provided in the Development Ordinance (
Chapters 165 through
170 of this Code of Ordinances). There shall be no front footage tap charges
for water main extensions installed by a developer pursuant to said section.

Chapter 135 of this Code of Ordinances.
96.05   CONNECTION REQUIREMENTS.
Any connection with a public sanitary sewer must be made under the direct
supervision of the Superintendent and in accordance with the following:
1.   Old Building Sewers. Old building sewers may be used in connection with
new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test conducted by
the owner and observed by the Superintendent, to meet all requirements of this
chapter.
2.   Separate Building Sewers. A separate and independent building sewer shall
be provided for every occupied building; except where one building stands at
the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can
be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard, or
driveway. In such cases the building sewer from the front building may be
extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer.
3.   Installation. The installation and connection of the building sewer to the
public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the State Plumbing Code and
applicable rules and regulations of the City. All such connections shall be
made gastight and watertight. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and
materials must be approved by the Superintendent before installation.
4.   Water Lines. When possible, building sewers should be laid at least 10
feet horizontally from a water service. The horizontal separation may be less,
provided the water service line is located at one side and at least 12 inches
above the top of the building sewer.
5.   Size. Building sewers shall be sized for the peak expected sewage flow
from the building with a minimum building sewer size of four inches.
6.   Alignment and Grade. All building sewers shall be laid to a straight line
to meet the following:
   A.   Recommended grade at one-fourth inch per foot.
   B.   Minimum grade of one-eighth inch per foot.
   C.   Minimum velocity of two feet per second with the sewer half full.
   D.   Any deviation in alignment or grade shall be made only with the written
approval of the Superintendent and shall be made only with approved fittings.
7.   Depth. Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the
building at an elevation below the basement floor. The depth of cover above the
sewer shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost.
8.   Sewage Lifts. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to
permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain
shall be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building
sewer.
9.   Pipe Specifications. Building sewer pipe shall be free from flaws, splits,
or breaks. Materials shall be as specified in the State Plumbing Code except
that the building sewer pipe, from the property line to the public sewer, shall
comply with the current edition of one of the following:

96.07   SEWER TAP.
Connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the “Y”
branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If no properly
located “Y” branch is available, a saddle “Y” shall be installed at the
location specified by the Superintendent. The public sewer shall be tapped with
a tapping machine and a saddle appropriate to the type of public sewer shall be
glued or attached with a gasket and stainless steel clamps to the sewer. At no
time shall a building sewer be constructed so as to enter a manhole unless
special written permission is received from the Superintendent and in
accordance with the Superintendent’s direction if such connection is approved.
96.08   INSPECTION REQUIRED.
All connections with the sanitary sewer system before being covered shall be
inspected and approved, in writing, by the Superintendent. As soon as all pipe
work from the public sewer to inside the building has been completed, and
before any backfilling is done, the Superintendent shall be notified and the
Superintendent shall inspect and test the work as to workmanship and material;

All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from
periodic grab samples).

100.05 Others Required to Connect
 
100.01   PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a means and method for the extension
of sewers to serve property not served by an existing sewer line so as to
preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort and
convenience of the residents of the City.
100.02   DEFINITION.
For the purpose of this chapter, “builder” means the owner of land who causes a
sanitary sewer to be installed under the provisions of this chapter. Such term
includes the heirs, successors or assigns of such owner.
100.03   CONSTRUCTION BY CITY AT OWNER’S REQUEST.
An owner of land abutting or adjoining a public street where no sanitary sewer
has been installed may make application to the Council for the installation of
a sanitary sewer in said street for the purpose of serving the property in
accordance with the following:
1.   Application and Deposit. A written request for such installation, and a
sum equal to the cost as estimated by the City of construction from the point
where the sanitary sewer is presently installed and terminates to the point
where the most distant boundary of the owner’s lot abuts the said public
street, shall be submitted to the Council.
2.   Construction. Upon receipt of the deposit, the City shall construct the
sanitary sewer for the purpose of serving the property of the applicant
(builder), as soon as such construction can reasonably be accomplished.
3.   Additional Costs. In the event the actual cost to the City of installation
of the sanitary sewer is in excess of the estimated cost, the builder agrees to
reimburse the City for the actual additional cost within 30 days after the
presentation of a bill for such additional cost.
4.   Lien Authorized. In the event of the failure of the builder to reimburse
the City, as specified in subsection 3 above, the total of the additional cost
shall be certified to the County Treasurer as a special assessment lien against
the builder’s real estate. In the written request for installation of the
sanitary sewer, the landowner shall waive all objections to jurisdiction and
rights to notice and consent to the entry of such a special assessment lien
against the real estate.
5.   Connecting Property. The expense of connecting the property of the builder
to the sanitary sewer laid in the public street shall be borne by the builder,
in addition to the cost of constructing said sewer, but such connection shall
be under the supervision of the City.
100.04   CONSTRUCTION BY OWNER.
In the event an owner of land abutting or adjoining a public street in which no
sewer has been previously installed desires to construct said sewer at the
owner’s own expense, the owner may do so, after making proper application to
the City and receiving a permit to install such a sewer, in accordance with the
following:
1.   City Supervision. The installation of such a sewer by a landowner at the
owner’s expense shall be under the strict supervision of the City and shall, in
all ways, conform to the requirements and specifications of the City.
2.   Surety Bond. When making application to the City for a permit to install
such a sewer, the applicant shall post with the City a surety bond, in an
amount to be set by the Council and made a matter of record in the minutes of
the Council, which shall be in an amount equal to but not less than 110 percent
of the total estimated cost of the installation for the full distance from the
termination point of the presently existing sewer to the point where the
farthest boundary of the applicant’s land abuts the public street, and the bond
shall guarantee the installation of the sewer in as short a time as reasonably
possible and shall further indemnify the City for the cost of completing the
project in the event the applicant fails to complete the project within a
reasonable time, and shall further indemnify the City for all damages to the
public street incurred in the installation, and shall further hold the City
harmless for any and all other damages arising from the installation of the
sanitary sewer.
3.   Ownership of Sewer Line. After the sewer has been installed, it shall
become the property of the City.
100.05   OTHERS REQUIRED TO CONNECT.
Following the installation of a sanitary sewer under the provisions of this
chapter, owners of land abutting or adjoining a public street in which such
sewer has been installed, being persons other than the builder, shall be
obliged to connect any sewage generating facilities into said sanitary sewer,
as required by Section
95.05 of this Code of Ordinances.
100.06   BUILDER REIMBURSED.
1.   Cost Approval. For purposes of determining connection charges and
reimbursement under this section, costs incurred by the builder shall be
certified to the City and only so much of said costs as are approved by the
City shall be used in determining connection charges and reimbursement.
2.   Connection Charge. Following the installation of an extension to the sewer
system under the provisions of this chapter there shall be paid to the City a
connection charge in an amount equal to one-half the lineal construction cost
for the full width of any lot, tract, or parcel of ground to be served by a
connection to such sewer main. Such connection charge shall be paid to the City
prior to making any connection to said sewer main.
3.   Builder Reimbursed. Upon receipt by the City of any connection charges
under this section, the City shall deduct and retain an amount equal to one-
half the lineal construction cost for the full width of the builders property
served by the sewer main and shall then remit to the builder the balance of
such connection charges until said builder has been reimbursed for the expense
of such installation less cost attributable to the property of the builder.
100.07   BUILDING SEWERS INSTALLED.
Each sanitary sewer constructed in a public street or right-of-way, whether
constructed by the City or by a private party, shall include a stub to each
abutting or adjoining lot line of the street or right-of-way on which the sewer
is installed. Each party responsible for installing such sewer shall provide
the City with an accurate map showing the location of each of such stubs within
30 days of the completion of the installations.
100.08   CONSTRUCTION BY CITY WITHOUT OWNER’S REQUEST.
1.   The City may extend sanitary sewer mains to serve property within the City
not served by an existing sanitary sewer line. Following the installation of an
extension to the sanitary sewer system, there shall be paid to the City a front
footage charge. The front footage charge shall be equal to $16.00 per foot both
in Hudson and outside of City limits, with a minimum charge of $32.00 per
lineal foot of sanitary sewer main installed, except as otherwise agreed upon
by the City prior to the effective date of this provision. A development shall
pay a minimum of $32.00 per lineal foot of sanitary sewer main installed,
unless a developer pays the cost of the extension pursuant to the City’s
Development Ordinance (
Chapters 165 through
170 of this Code of Ordinances). Further, the City may, at its discretion,
elect to add additional charges based on unusual circumstances which increase
the costs to the City. The front footage charge shall be paid before the tap is
made to the main.
2.   The City shall maintain payment records.
3.   Front footage and corner lot calculations for purposes of determining the
appropriate charge shall be determined as set forth in Section
93.08 of this Code of Ordinances.
4.   A tap fee shall be determined as set forth in Section
90.06.
100.09   SANITARY SEWER MAIN EXTENSIONS IN DEVELOPMENTS.
Developers should cover the entire cost of a sanitary sewer main extension for
the development, as provided in the Development Ordinance (
Chapters 165 through
170 of this Code of Ordinances). There shall be no front footage tap charges
for sanitary sewer main extensions installed by a developer pursuant to said
section.

4.   "Best Management Practices (BMPs)" means the methods or techniques found
to be the most effective in achieving an objective such as preventing or
minimizing pollution. For this program, BMPs refer to methods and techniques
used by Food Establishments to minimize the deposition of FOG. An example of
BMP is scaping excess food or solidified grease from cooking utensils, to be
disposed of in the trash, before washing.
5.   "Fats, Oils, and Greases (FOG)" means the organic polar compounds derived
from animal and/or plant sources that contain multiple carbon chain
triglyceride molecules. These substances are detectable and measurable using
analytical test procedures established in 40 CFR 136, as may be amended from
time to time. All are sometimes referred to herein as "grease" or "greases." A
wide range of food preparation activities can generate fats, oils, and greases.
6.   "Food Establishment (FE)" means a place where food is prepared and
intended for individual portion service, whether consumption occurs on or off
the premises. These facilities include but are not limited to, restaurants,
food manufacturers, food processors, commercial kitchens, hospitals, schools,

nursing homes, and care facilities.
7.   "Grease Interceptor" means an appurtenance or appliance that is installed
in a sanitary drainage system to intercept non-petroleum fats, oils, and
greases from wastewater. There are two types of great interceptors: gravity
grease interceptors and hydro-mechanical grease interceptors.
   A.   "Gravity Grease Interceptor" means plumbing appurtenances of not less
than 500 gallons capacity that are installed in the sanitary drainage system to
intercept free-floating fats, oils, and greases from wastewater discharge.
Separation is accomplished by gravity during a retention time of not less than
30 minutes. Gravity grease interceptors shall be installed outside for ease of
inspection and hauling.
   B.   "Hydro-Mechanical Grease Interceptor" means a passive plumbing
appurtenance or appliance that is installed in a sanitary drainage system to
intercept non-petroleum fats, oils, and greases from wastewater discharge.
Hydro-mechanical grease interceptors are identified by flow rate, separation,
and retention efficiency. The design incorporates air entrainment, hydro-
mechanical separation, interior baffling, barriers in combination or
separately, and external flow control.
8.   "Grease Containment Device" means any device or system that removes fats,
oils, and greases from a waste stream.
9.   "Water Hauler" means any person, firm, or entity engaging in the
collection, removal, or transportation of wastewater for the purpose of
disposal at the wastewater treatment facilities.
10.   "Water Pollution Control Facilities" or "wastewater treatment facilities"
means the publicly owned structures, equipment, and processes required to
collect, convey, and treat wastewater.
102.02 PURPOSE.
This program sets forth the uniform requirements for users of the City of
Hudson's wastewater treatment facility to capture and dispose of fats, oils,
and greases in accordance with Ordinance 101, enabling the City to comply with
all applicable State and Federal regulations. No food establishment may
intentionally allow the direct or indirect discharge of any fats, oils, or
greases into the sanitary sewer system in such amounts as to cause interference
with the collection and treatment systems. Both new and existing FE facilities
that generate in excess of 100 mg/l fats, oils, and greases as a result of food
manufacturing, processing, preparation, or food service shall be subject to
these requirements.
102.03 EXISTING ESTABLISHMENTS.
The existing facility is deemed complaint if there is a grease interceptor or
other grease containment device in place and the following conditions are all
met:
1.   The FE continues to use the interceptor or other grease containment
device.
2.   The interceptor or other grease containment device is of sufficient
capacity and design.
3.   The interceptor or other grease containment device is operated and
maintained so as to comply with the 100 mg/l FOG discharge limit.
Third party testing of a facility's waste stream, at the cost of the facility,
shall be done annually to ensure the limits are being met. If a representative
sample is unable to be collected, documentation regarding the design capacity
of the grease containment device may be supplemented. Records of operation and
maintenance will also be required in either scenario.
If the existing FE is deemed noncompliant, due to a lack of grease containment
equipment or not meeting the requirements listed above, the City will order the
installation of an adequate grease interceptor. Deadlines for the completion of
this process can be found below. The City will contact each FE with their
designated "Risk Level."
1.   High Risk Establishments
   A.   Notification of high-risk designation on or about March 1, 2023
   B.   Permit application, interceptor proposal, and all applicable fees due
not later than December 31, 2023
   C.   Implementation of FOG program completed by December 31, 2024
2.   Medium Risk Establishments
   A.   Notification of medium risk designation on or about March 1, 2023
   B.   Permit application, interceptor proposal, and all applicable fees due
no later than December 31, 2023
   C.   Implementation of FOG program complete by July 1, 2024
3.   Low Risk Establishments
   A.   Notification of low risk designation on or about March 1, 2023
   B.   Permit application, interceptor proposal, and all applicable fees due
no later than December 31, 2023.
   C.   Implementation of FOG program complete by December 31, 2024
FEs which are unable to install or replace a grease interceptor due to physical
constraints or economic hardship may appeal to the City for approval of an
alternative grease control technology. Such appeal should be submitted in
writing and include detailed descriptions of the physical or financial
constraints and of the alternative grease control technology which it proposes
to utilize.
Regardless of compliance, each FE must submit a FOG application and comply with
the requirements of this program. This includes proper documentation, cleaning,
maintenance, and inspections. Penalties will apply to FEs that violate any part
of this program.
102.04 NEW ESTABLISHMENT.
After the effective date of this program, any permitted construction of a food
establishment shall include an adequately sized grease interceptor. The owner
of the FE must complete a FOG application based on the design capacity of the
grease interceptor before being granted a food or occupancy permit.
102.05 GREASE INTERCEPTORS.
Grease interceptors shall be installed at the expense of the owner or operator
of the FE which is contributing wastewater to the water pollution control
facility. A proposed grease interceptor design is required with the submittal
of the FOG application if a facility is deemed to be noncompliant. Grease
interceptors shall be designed and implemented according to the standards
listed below.

9.   All waste streams containing FOG or reasonably likely to contain FOG
within the FE shall be directed into one or more appropriately sized grease
interceptors before discharge to the sewer system. Discharge lines that are not
grease laden, which are not likely to contain FOG, or which contain sanitary
wastes shall not be connected to the grease interceptor.
10.   Bioremediation media is only allowed with written permission from the
wastewater treatment facility. This request must be made before the
implementation of the bioremediation media and must demonstrate that the FE has
the appropriate FOG system in place. Additional testing may apply.
11.   Gravity grease interceptors shall be installed outside the building and
below surface grade and shall have access manholes, with a minimum diameter of
24 inches, over each chamber and sanitary tee. Access manholes shall extend
from the grease interceptor to at least the finished surface grade and be
designed to prevent storm or surface water inflow. The manholes shall also have
readily removable covers to facilitate inspection and grease waste hauling. The
minimum size of a gravity grease interceptor shall be no smaller than 500
gallons.
12.   Hydro-mechanical interceptors shall be located downstream of each fixture
or multiple fixtures in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Ready
access shall be provided for cleaning, servicing, and inspection, at all times.
13.   Hydro-mechanical and gravity grease interceptors shall be equipped with
devices to control the rate of water flow so that the water flow does not

written City of Hudson approval. The following conditions must be met when a FE
wants to self-clean:
   A.   The grease interceptor is no more than 100 GPM in size.
   B.   Proper on-site material disposal methods are implemented (ex. Absorb
material to dewater before disposing of in the trash) or FOG is placed in a
leakproof, sealable container(s) located on the premises for a hauler to pump
out
   C.   Detailed records are maintained and readily available for inspection
2.   Grease containment devices shall be cleaned as often as necessary to
ensure that sediment and floating materials do not accumulate to impair the
efficiency of the system as designed and approved. Grease containment devices
shall be completely evacuated a minimum of every sixty (60) days, or more
frequently when one of the following conditions is met:
   A.   Twenty-five (25) percent or more of the wetted height of the grease
trap or grease interceptor, as measured from the bottom of the device to the
invert of the inlet/outlet of each chamber, contains floating materials,
sediment, or FOG. Each chamber shall be evaluated separately for the purposes
of measurement and the requirement for evacuation.
   B.   There is a history of non-compliance with this program.
   C.   The discharge exceeds FOG or other pollutant levels determined by the
wastewater treatment facility.
3.   Each grease containment device, when cleaned, shall be fully evacuated,
and immediately put back into service. Following the cleaning, the system shall
be subject to inspection. The maximum period between cleanings may be increased
or decreased based on the inspection records. This change will be denoted on
the FOG permit.
4.   Annually, the City of Hudson will contact each of the food establishments
for inspections and permit renewals. While the City of Hudson staff is onsite,
they will need access to the food preparation facility, all documentation
associated with maintenance/cleaning, and the interceptor and other grease
containment device.

street, avenue, right of way or alley or reasonably promoting the efficient
operation of any such improvement. If the City has a reasonable alternative

facilities, the City shall attempt to secure said funds and provide them to the
Company to compensate the Company for the costs of relocation.

and the date, time, and place for hearing on the matter.
122.12   HEARING.
The Mayor shall conduct a hearing at which both the licensee and any

fail to appear without good cause, the Mayor may proceed to a determination of
the complaint.

part of the record the reasons for such revocation or refusal. The licensee, or

insurance and may be reinstated only upon filing a new license or certificate.

presumed to have adequate public liability coverage.
6.   Permit and License Fees. The City shall charge a fee for the license and
permit. The fees shall be set by resolution of the Council.
7.   Notification. Prior to beginning work, the permit holder shall be
responsible for notifying the abutting property owners within 60 feet of the
work being done of the nature and extent of the work and the proposed start and
finish dates. At least 48 hours prior to the commencement of the excavation,
excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, the person performing the
excavation shall contact the Statewide Notification Center and provide the
center with the information required under Section 480.4 of the Code of Iowa.

excavations without a permit, provided they have made a reasonable effort to
inform the City Police Department, the street department, the Building
Official, the City Clerk’s office, and the utility companies whose underground
utility lines may be involved or affected in any manner. Those involved in the
work shall make written applications for a permit at the earliest practical
time.
9.   New Subdivisions. A license as specified herein shall be required, but
permit fees will not be applicable for installation or construction of public
improvements within new subdivisions. A separate inspection fee and bond
requirements are established in Chapter 170 of this Code of Ordinances.
10.   Safety Measures. Any person, firm, or corporation cutting a pavement or
surface or performing work in the right-of-way shall provide adequate
barricades, signage, fencing, and warning lights meeting standards adopted or
specified by the City and shall place such devices so as to protect the public
from hazards, vehicles, equipment, materials, excavated material, and similar
items. The City may require greater protection than that required by current
City standards if the circumstances warrant. All costs incurred by the City in
providing or maintaining adequate barricades, signage, fencing, or warning
lights shall be paid to the City by the permit holder prior to issuance of a
permit. Where traffic conditions warrant, the contractor may be required to
provide flag persons, if in the judgment of the designated City staff the
public safety requires it. Compliance with the City ordinances and regulations
shall not be deemed to waive the requirement that the contractor shall comply
with all the requirements of the labor safety laws and the rules of the Iowa
Department of Labor, nor shall any failure be deemed a responsibility of the
City.
11.   Backfilling and Restoration. Streets, sidewalks, alleys, and other public
property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in accordance
with the standards promulgated by the Urban Standard Specifications for Public
Improvements (SUDAS) as amended by the City and in a manner satisfactory to the
City, at the sole expense of the permit holder. All work shall be subject to
inspection by the City. Backfill shall not be deemed completed, or resurfacing
of any improved street or alley surface begun, until such backfill is inspected
and approved by the designated City staff. No project shall be considered
complete unless all disturbed areas are restored in the manner satisfactory to
the City and until the designated City staff agrees to the restoration in
writing. The permit holder shall provide the City with notice at least 24 hours
prior to the time when inspection of backfill or restored disturbed area is
desired. Should any excavation in any street, alley, or parking be discontinued
or left open and unfinished for a period of 24 hours after the approved
completion date, or in the event the work is improperly done, the City has the
right to finish or correct the work and charge any expense therefor to the
permit holder.
12.   Responsibility for Costs. All costs and expenses incident to the

City.
135.10   REMOVAL OF STRUCTURES IN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY.
City regulation of the use of the right-of-way by abutting private property
owners is necessary for the following reasons: (i) to assure that such right-
of-way remains free of unnecessary impediments to the placement, maintenance,
and repair of streets, alleys, road signs, sidewalks, and above and below
ground public utilities; and (ii) to minimize tort liability that may arise
from injuries to persons or property occurring on, or as a consequence of,
structures located within the right-of-way. Abutting private property owners
are entitled to the use of the right-of-way only to obtain necessary and
otherwise lawful pedestrian and vehicular ingress and egress to private
property. The subsections set forth below shall apply to the removal of
driveways, sidewalks, structures and other man-made objects in the right-of-
way.
1.   Driveways. A driveway in use on the effective date of the ordinance
codified herein for the purpose of providing vehicular ingress and egress
across the right-of-way to a garage or all-weather surface parking area located
on abutting private property, which ceases after the effective date of this
section to be used for such a purpose, shall be removed from the curb cut to
the property line. The area disturbed shall be restored and reseeded and the
driveway curb cut shall be removed and replaced in accordance with City
standard specifications. Such removal to the property line shall not be
required if all of the following conditions are met:
   A.   The property owner desires to use the driveway for vehicle parking
only.
   B.   The portion of the driveway located upon private property is hard
surfaced and sufficient in size to accommodate at least one parked full-sized
four-wheel drive vehicle. “Sufficient in size” means an area measuring a
minimum of 10 feet wide and 20 feet long.
   C.   The parking of vehicles on the driveway is otherwise lawful and does
not violate the nuisance provisions of this Code of Ordinances, including (but
not limited to) those relating to the parking of vehicles on private property.
2.   Sidewalks. A sidewalk in use on the effective date of this section for the
purpose of providing pedestrian ingress and egress across the right-of-way to a
residence, business, or related structure located on abutting private property,
which ceases after the effective date of this section to be used for the
purpose and which does not meet the City standard specifications for location,
shall be removed from the curb stop to the property line. The area disturbed
shall be restored and reseeded.
3.   Other Structures. Any structure or other man-made object (excluding
driveways and sidewalks) located on the right-of-way in use on the effective
date of this section for any purpose, which ceases after the effective date of
this section to be used for the purpose it served on the effective date of this
section, shall be removed from the curb, or from its starting point on the
right-of-way to the property line. The area disturbed shall be restored and
reseeded. Any structure or other manmade object (excluding driveways and
sidewalks) located on the right-of-way which has not ceased to serve its
original purpose, but which must be removed in order to accomplish necessary
public improvements or public utilities installations in such right-of-way,
shall be removed at the expense of the public utility and shall not be
restored, rebuilt, or replaced on the right-of-way. The area disturbed shall be
restored and reseeded at the expense of the public utility.
4.   Responsibility for Removal. Except as otherwise specified herein, the
costs and responsibility for removal of structures and objects from the right-
of-way and for the performance of all work required to comply with this
section, shall be borne by the owner of the property abutting the right-of-way.
5.   Refusal to Comply. Should the required removal not be performed within the
time specified by the City to the owner, the City shall perform the removal and
assess the cost thereof against abutting property owner by certifying the cost
of the removal to the County Treasurer, to be collected in the same manner as a
property tax is collected. Notice to the owner shall be given by written notice
mailed to the responsible party at the party’s last known address as shown by
the records of the County Treasurer, by both certified mail-return receipt, and
ordinary first class mail. Notice shall be complete upon mailing.
6.   Authority to Adopt Additional Policies. The City Council shall have the
authority to adopt, by written resolution, any written policy, rule or
specification relating to or amplifying the terms of this section. Once
adopted, the policy, rule or specification shall have the same authority, force
and effect as the ordinance codified in this section. Copies of all such
policies, rules and specifications shall be on file with the City Clerk and
Building Official and shall be available for inspection by members of the
public. Photocopies shall be provided upon request.
7.   Penalties. In addition to any criminal or civil penalty that may be
imposed, the violator of this section shall be liable to the City for all
direct and indirect costs incurred to correct the deficiency or violation,
including but not limited to corrective work performed by the City and any
contractor hired by the City.
135.11   PROPERTY OWNER’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAINTENANCE.
The abutting property owner shall maintain all property outside the lot and
property lines and inside the curb lines upon public streets and shall keep
such area in a safe condition, free from nuisances, obstructions, and hazards.
In the absence of a curb, such property shall extend from the property line to
that portion of the public street used or improved for vehicular purposes. The
abutting property owner shall not be required to remove diseased trees or dead
wood on the publicly owned property or right-of-way. Maintenance includes, but
is not limited to, timely mowing, trimming trees and shrubs, and picking up
litter and debris. The abutting property owner may be liable for damages caused
by failure to maintain the publicly owned property or right-of-way.† 6  Such
areas outside the lot and property lines and inside the curb lines (the
“parking”) shall be planted with grass or, if special permission is obtained
from the Council by the abutting property owner, may be paved with concrete or
asphalt. No rock, gravel, or sand surfaces shall be allowed, as the same
creates a potential hazard to pedestrians.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[2c])
 
Notes
6 † EDITOR’S NOTE: See also Section 136.04 relating to property owner’s
  responsibility for maintenance of sidewalks.
135.12   FAILURE TO MAINTAIN.
If the abutting property owner does not perform an action required under the
above section within a reasonable time, the City may perform the required
action and assess the cost against the abutting property for collection in the
same manner as a property tax.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[2e])
135.13   DUMPING OF SNOW.
It is unlawful for any person to throw, push, or place or cause to be thrown,
pushed or placed, any ice or snow from private property, sidewalks, or
driveways onto the traveled way of a street or alley so as to obstruct gutters,
or impede the passage of vehicles upon the street or alley or to create a
hazardous condition therein; except where, in the cleaning of large commercial
drives in the business district it is absolutely necessary to move the snow
onto the street or alley temporarily, such accumulation shall be removed
promptly by the property owner or agent. Arrangements for the prompt removal of
such accumulations shall be made prior to moving the snow. The cost of removal
of such deposits by the City shall be assessed against the owner of the
property from which the snow was removed at such rates as may, from time to
time, be established by the Council.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[2])
135.14   DRIVEWAY CULVERTS.
The property owner shall, at the owner’s expense, install any culvert deemed
necessary under any driveway or any other access to the owner’s property, and
before installing a culvert, permission must first be obtained from the City.
In the event repairs are needed at any time with respect to culverts, it shall
be the responsibility of the property owner to make such repairs, and, in the
event the owner fails to do so, the City shall have the right to make the
repairs. If the property owner fails to reimburse the City for the cost of said
repairs, the cost shall be certified to the County Treasurer and specially
assessed against the property as by law provided. The City shall specify the
type of culvert.
135.15   ERECTION OF POLES.
All electric and telephone companies, now or hereafter organized and
established by franchise may be authorized and empowered to erect, maintain,
and use along, and upon, and over and across the streets, avenues, alleys and
public highways, such posts, cross arms, brackets, wires and other fixtures as
may be necessary to carry the electric current to their customers and
consumers; provided, always, such posts, cross arms, brackets, wires and other
fixtures shall be erected and put in place under the direction and to the
satisfaction of the City.
135.16   REMOVAL OF POLES.
Any pole now set in any of the streets, avenues, alleys, or highways that, in
the judgment of the Council, and in the best interests of the City, should be
removed, may be ordered removed by servicing notice upon the owners thereof,
and if said poles are not removed within five days after the service of the
notice, then the City shall cause the same to be removed and the expense
thereof shall be collected from said parties by suit in any court having
jurisdiction.
135.17   MAILBOXES.
It is unlawful to place any mail box where any part of the box extends to
closer than six inches from the front face of the curb, or in close enough
proximity to the traveled portion of a street or alley so as to interfere with
the operation of snow removal equipment. The City shall not be liable for
replacing mailboxes installed in violation of this section or so as to
interfere with the operation of equipment used in removing snow from the
traveled portion of the street or alley. If a snow removal equipment hits a
mailbox that has been properly installed, the City will replace the mail box
for a value of up to $50.00; if the property owner desires to replace the mail
box, the City will reimburse the owner for up to a cost of $50.00 upon
submittal of bills and inspection of the location by City staff. If the
property owner seeks additional cost reimbursement, a hearing may be scheduled
with the Public Works Committee upon written notification request received by
the City Clerk from the property owner.

1.   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a just, equitable,
and practicable method, to be cumulative with and in addition to any other
remedy provided by the Building Code, Housing Code, or otherwise available by
law, whereby buildings or structures that from any cause endanger the life,
limb, health, morals, property, safety, or welfare of the general public or
their occupants may be required to be repaired, vacated, or demolished. The
purpose of this chapter is not to create or otherwise establish or designate
any particular class or group of persons who will or should be especially

2.   Scope. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all dangerous
buildings, as herein defined, which are now in existence or which may hereafter
become dangerous in this jurisdiction.
145.03   ALTERATIONS, ADDITIONS AND REPAIRS.
All buildings or structures which are required to be repaired under the
provisions of this chapter shall be subject to the provisions of the Building
Code.
145.04   ADMINISTRATION.
The Building Official is hereby authorized to enforce the provisions of this
chapter. The Building Official shall have the power to render interpretations
of this chapter and to adopt and enforce rules and supplemental regulations in
order to clarify the application of its provisions. Such interpretations,
rules, and regulations shall be in conformity with the intent and purpose of
this chapter.
145.05   VIOLATIONS.
It is unlawful for any person to erect, construct, enlarge, alter, repair,

provided by this chapter and the Building Code.
145.07   BOARD OF APPEALS.
In order to hear and decide appeals of orders, decisions, or determinations
made by the Building Official relative to the application and interpretations
of this chapter, there shall be and is hereby created a Board of Appeals
consisting of members who are qualified by experience and training to pass upon
matters pertaining to building construction and who are not employees of the
jurisdiction. The Building Official shall be an ex officio member and shall act
as secretary to said Board but shall have no vote upon any matter before the
Board. The Board of Appeals shall be appointed by the Council and shall hold
office at its pleasure. The Board shall adopt rules and procedures for
conducting its business and shall render all decisions and findings in writing
to the appellant, with a duplicate copy to the Building Official. Appeals to
the Board shall be processed in accordance with the provisions contained in
Section
145.13 of this chapter. Copies of all rules or regulations adopted by the Board
shall be delivered to the Building Official, who shall make them freely

facilities, or otherwise, is determined by the health officer to be unsanitary,
unfit for human habitation or in such a condition that is likely to cause
sickness or disease.
16.   Whenever any building or structure, because of obsolescence, dilapidated
condition, deterioration, damage, inadequate exits, lack of sufficient fire
resistant construction, faulty electric wiring, gas connections or heating
apparatus, or other cause, is determined by the Fire Chief to be a fire hazard.

145.10   NOTICE AND ORDER OF BUILDING OFFICIAL.
1.   Commencement of Proceedings. When the Building Official has inspected or
caused to be inspected any building and has found and determined that such
building is a dangerous building, the Building Official shall commence
proceedings to cause the repair, vacation, or demolition of the building.
2.   Issuance of Notice and Order. The Building Official shall issue a notice
and order directed to the record owner of the building. The notice and order
shall contain:

145.09 of this chapter.
   C.   A statement of the action required to be taken as determined by the
Building Official.
      (1)   If the Building Official has determined that the building or
structure must be repaired, the order shall require that all required permits
be secured therefor and the work physically commenced within such time (not to
exceed 60 days from the date of the order) and completed within such time as
the Building Official shall determine is reasonable under all of the
circumstances.
      (2)   If the Building Official has determined that the building or
structure must be vacated, the order shall require that the building or
structure shall be vacated within a time certain from the date of the order as
determined by the Building Official to be reasonable.

determine is reasonable.
   D.   Statements advising that if any required repair or demolition work

prevent further occupancy until the work is completed, and may proceed to cause
the work to be done and charge the costs thereof against the property or its
owner.
   E.   Statements advising: (i) that any person having any record, title, or
legal interest in the building may appeal from the notice and order or any
action of the Building Official to the Board of Appeals, provided the appeal is
made in writing as provided in this chapter and filed with the Building
Official within 30 days from the date of service of such notice and order; and
(ii) that failure to appeal will constitute a waiver of all rights to an
administrative hearing and determination of the matter.

the holder of any mortgage or deed of trust or other lien or encumbrance of
record; the owner or holder of any lease of record; and the holder of any other
estate or legal interest of record in or to the building or the land on which
it is located. The failure of the Building Official to serve any person
required herein to be served shall not invalidate any proceedings hereunder as
to any other person duly served or relieve any such person from any duty or
obligation imposed by the provisions of this section.
4.   Method of Service. Service of the notice and order shall be made upon all
persons entitled thereto either personally or by mailing a copy of such notice
and order by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to each
such person at their address as it appears on the last equalized assessment
roll of the county or as known to the Building Official. If no address of any
such person so appears or is known to the Building Official, then a copy of the
notice and order shall be so mailed, addressed to such person, at the address
of the building involved in the proceedings. The failure of any such person to
receive such notice shall not affect the validity of any proceedings taken
under this section. Service by certified mail in the manner herein provided
shall be effective on the date of mailing.
5.   Proof of Service. Proof of service of the notice and order shall be
certified to at the time of service by written declaration under penalty of
perjury executed by the person effecting service, declaring the time, date, and
manner in which service was made. The declaration, together with any receipt
card returned in acknowledgement of receipt by certified mail shall be affixed

within the time specified therein and no appeal has been properly and timely
filed, the Building Official shall file in the office of the County Recorder a
certificate describing the property and certifying: (i) that the building is a
dangerous building; and (ii) that the owner has been so notified. Whenever the
corrections ordered shall thereafter have been completed or the building
demolished so that it no longer exists as a dangerous building on the property
described in the certificate, the Building Official shall file a new
certificate with the County Recorder certifying that the building is no longer
dangerous, whichever is appropriate.
145.11   REPAIR, VACATION AND DEMOLITION.
The following standards shall be followed by the Building Official (and by the

said charge against the property involved. If the Council orders that the
charge shall be assessed against the property, it shall confirm the assessment,
cause the same to be recorded on the assessment roll, and thereafter said
assessment shall constitute a special assessment against and a lien upon the
property.
6.   Contest. The validity of any assessment made under the provisions of this
chapter shall not be contested in any action or proceeding unless the same is
commenced within 30 days after the assessment is placed upon the assessment
roll as provided herein. Any appeal from a final judgment in such action or
proceeding must be perfected within 30 days after the entry of such judgment.
7.   Authority for Installment Payment of Assessments with Interest. The
Council, in its discretion, may determine that assessments in amounts of
$500.00 or more shall be payable in not to exceed five equal annual

in installments, the number of installments, whether they shall bear interest,
and the rate thereof shall be by a resolution adopted prior to the confirmation
of the assessment.
8.   Lien of Assessment. Immediately upon its being placed on the assessment
roll, the assessment shall be deemed to be complete, the several amounts
assessed shall be payable, and the assessments shall be liens against the lots
or parcels of land assessed, respectively. The lien shall be subordinate to all
existing special assessment liens previously imposed upon the same property and
shall be paramount to all other liens except for State, County and property
taxes with which it shall be upon parity. The lien shall continue until the
assessment and all interest due and payable thereon are paid. All such
assessments remaining unpaid after 30 days from the date of recording on the
assessment roll shall become delinquent and shall bear interest at the rate of
seven percent per annum from the said date.
9.   Report to Assessor and Tax Collector. After confirmation of the report,
certified copies of the assessment shall be given to the assessor and the tax
collector for the City, who shall add the amount of the assessment to the next
regular tax bill levied against the parcel for municipal purposes.
10.   Filing Copy of Report with County Auditor. If the County Assessor and the
County tax collector assess property and collect taxes for the City, a
certified copy of the assessment shall be filed with the County Auditor on or
before August 10. The descriptions of the parcels reported shall be those used
for the same parcels on the County Assessor’s map books for the current year.
11.   Collection of Assessment Penalties for Foreclosure. The amount of the
assessment shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as
ordinary property taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same
penalties and procedures and sale in case of delinquency as provided for
ordinary property taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection, and
enforcement of property taxes shall be applicable to such assessment. If the
Council has determined that the assessment shall be paid in installments, each
installment and any interest thereon shall be collected in the same manner as

147.14   POST-CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER MANAGEMENT.
1.   PURPOSE.
   A.   The U.S. EPA's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
("NPDES") permit program ("Program") administered by the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources ("IDNR") requires that cities meeting certain demographic and
environmental impacts criteria obtain from the IDNR and NPDES permit for the
discharge of stormwater from a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4). The
City's MS4 Permit is on file at the office of the City Clerk and is available
for public inspection during regular office hours.
   B.   As a condition of the City's MS4 Permit, the City is obliged to
develop, implement, and enforce a program to address stormwater runoff from new
construction and reconstruction projects for which State NPEDS General Permit
#2 stormwater permit coverage is required, by adopting a POST-CONSTRUCTION
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE designed:
      (1)   To require water quality and quantity components be considered in
the design of new construction and implemented when practical:
      (2)   To promote the use of stormwater detention and retention, grass
swales, buffer strips, and proper operation and maintenance of these
facilities;
      (3)   To allow the use of bio-retention swales and riparian buffers where
practical and the soils and topography are suitable to ensure such measures
will be effective in accomplishing the purpose of the Ordinance;
      (4)   To prohibit construction activities from commencing until the plans
for post-construction runoff controls have been submitted to the City;
      (5)   To allow the City to have the ability to access private property
for the purpose of enforcement procedures to promote compliance with the State
NPDES General Permit #2, which require post-construction compliance by
Applicants
   C.   No state or federal funds have been made available to assist the City
with inspections, monitoring, and/or enforcing the Program.
   D.   Terms used in this Ordinance shall have the meanings specified as
follows:
      (1)   "Applicant" means any person, firm, or entity applying for a permit
to develop, grade, or construct within the corporate limits of the City.
      (2)   Terms used in this chapter shall have the meaning specified in the
Program.
2.   PROCEDURE FOR POST-CONSTRUCTION.
   A.   Each Applicant who is required to have coverage under General Permit
No. 2 for a site, shall install post-construction stormwater management
facilities as set forth herein and as approved by the City during site plan,
platting, or construction plans.
   B.   Each Applicant or its successor person(s) or entity shall be
responsible for maintaining all stormwater management facilities as approved by
the City.
   C.   For sites equal to or greater than one acre, each Applicant must
provide to the City as-built plans detailing dimensions and elevations as well
as a certification that stormwater management facilities were built as part of
the approved development that include the site. For sites less than one acre
that are part of a common plan of development and for which the Applicant
establishes that stormwater management facilities were or will be built to
address all properties (either collectively or individually) within the
development, each Applicant must provide the City a copy of the Notice of
Discontinuation for General Permit No. 2 applicable to the property.
   D.   Each Applicant must include in their site design those stormwater
management facilities that will convey drainage through the property to one or
more detention and/or treatment areas such that no development shall cause
downstream property owners, water courses, channels, or conduits to receive
stormwater runoff from the proposed development site at a peak flow rate
greater than that allowed by policy or standard in effect at the time of
approval of the development unless such requirements are waived by the City.
Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the City from changing the policies or
standards in the future, nor from requiring the site to comply with the new
requirements.
   E.   Each Applicant shall comply with all other applicable City, state, or
federal permit requirements as they apply to the City or to the property.
   F.   At the discretion of the City, the applicant may satisfy the post-
construction stormwater management requirements by ensuring the conveyance of
the stormwater discharge from the property to the regional detention facility.
For purposes of this Ordinance, a "regional detention facility" shall be wet or
dry detention basins, which are designed to accept stormwater runoff from two
or more sites that are required to obtain a state NPDES General Permit No. 2
and that otherwise comply with all city, state, federal permit requirements, as
they apply to stormwater management requirements for those sites.
3.   MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF STORMWATER UTILITIES.
   A.   Prior to the issuance of any permit that has a stormwater management
facility as one of the requirements of the permit, the Applicant or owner of
the site must execute a maintenance easement agreement that shall be binding on
all subsequent owners of land served by the stormwater management facility. The
agreement shall provide for access to the facility at reasonable times for
periodic inspection by the City, or its contractor or agent, to ensure that the
facility is maintained in proper working condition to meet design standards and
any other provisions established by this Ordinance. The easement agreement
shall be recorded by the City in the land records.
   B.   Maintenance of all stormwater management facilities shall be ensured
through the creation of a formal maintenance covenant that must be approved by
the city and recorded into the land record at the time of final approval. As
part of the covenant, a schedule shall be developed for when and how often
maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the stormwater management
facility. The covenant shall also include plans for periodic inspections by the
Applicant, owner, or assigns to ensure proper performance of the facility.
   C.   The City shall be permitted to enter and inspect any property subject
to regulation under this section as often as is necessary to document
maintenance and repair needs and determine compliance with the requirements of
this Ordinance. If a Responsible Party owning, controlling, or possessing a
property has security measures that require identification and clearance before
entry to its property, such Responsible Party shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access by the City. By way of specification but not
limitation:
      (1)   A Responsible Party shall allow the City ready access to all parts
of the property for purposes of inspection, examination, and copying of records
related to compliance with this Ordinance.
      (2)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction that obstructs the safe and
easy access to property to be inspected and shall be promptly removed by the
Responsible Party at the written or oral order of the City and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the Responsible
Party.
      (3)   An unreasonable delay in allowing the City to access property is a
violation of this chapter.
   D.   Parties responsible for the operation and maintenance of a stormwater
management facility, shall make records of the installation and of all
maintenance and repairs, and shall retain said records. Copies of the as-built
plans and records of all self inspections, maintenance, and repairs, shall be
kept on-site and shall be made available to the City during the inspection of
the facility and at other reasonable times upon request.
   E.   In the event that a stormwater management facility is found by the City
to be non-compliant with the plans as submitted and approved or is found to be
in need of maintenance, the Responsible Party will be notified in writing of
such deficiencies. Upon receipt of such notice, the responsible party shall
have fifteen (15) days to correct such deficiencies. After proper notice and if
the Responsible Party fails to make the repairs or perform the maintenance, the
City may have such work performed and assess the owner(s) of the facility for
the cost of repair work and any penalties; and the cost of the work shall be a
lien on the property, or prorated against the beneficial users of the property,
and may be placed on the tax bill and collected as ordinary taxes by the City.
In addition, easements and covenants recorded upon the applicant's property,
shall provide mechanisms for the establishment of a lien by the City for any
and all costs incurred by the City pursuant to this chapter to aid in efficient
and cost effective collection of sums so expended, including, but not limited
to attorney's fees associated with collection.
4.   PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT AND PARTICIPATION. The permittee shall implement a
public involvement and participation program that includes the following:
   A.   Establish Stormwater Advisory Committee - the permittee shall establish
a stormwater advisory committee to participate in decision making, holding
public hearings, and working with volunteer groups. Businessmen, developers,
homeowners, members of environmental groups, and members of the public at large
shall be allowed to participate, if interested. However, the permittee may
place reasonable limits on the total number of individuals participating in the
group. The scope of an existing committee may be expanded to include stormwater
issues.
147.15   ENFORCEMENT.
1.   Violation of any provision of this chapter may be enforced by civil action
including an action for injunctive relief.
2.   In any civil enforcement action, administrative or judicial, the city
shall be entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees and costs from a person who is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have violated this chapter.
3.   Violation of any provision of this chapter may also be enforced as a
municipal infraction within the meaning of Iowa Code 364.22, pursuant to
Chapter 3, Hudson City Code.
4.   Enforcement pursuant to this section shall be undertaken by the City
Administrator upon the advice and consent of the City Attorney.
147.16   APPEALS.  
Anyone claiming to be aggrieved by a determination made by the Erosion Control
Officer may within twenty (20) days of the date of such determination appeal to
the City Clerk or designee shall review the determination of the Erosion
Control Officer and if reasonable ground exists, shall modify, withdraw or
order compliance with said determination. Anyone claiming to be aggrieved by
the determination made by the City Clerk or designee shall have such rights of
appeal as provided by the law.
147.17   FEES ESTABLISHED.  
The City Council may establish fees by resolution for permit applications,
permit renewal applications, inspections, and for the review and processing of
documents necessitated by this chapter. When such fees are established a
submittal shall not be considered unless the appropriate fee has been submitted
to the city.

MONITORING OF DISCHARGES
148.66   APPLICABILITY.  
This section applies to all facilities that have storm water discharges
associated with industrial activity, including construction activity.
148.67   ACCESS TO FACILITIES.  
The City shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to
regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to determine
compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has security measures in force
that require proper identification and clearance before entry into its
premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the City.
1.   Facility operators shall allow the City ready access to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of
records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge
storm water, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state
and federal law.
2.   The City shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such
devices as are necessary in the opinion of the City to conduct monitoring and/
or sampling of the facility's storm water discharge.
3.   The City shall have the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
4.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the City and shall not be replaced.
The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
5.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the City access to a permitted facility is
a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this chapter. A person who
is the operator of a facility with an NPDES permit to discharge storm water
associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the
City reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting
any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
6.   If the City has been refused access to any part of the premises from which
storm water is discharged, and are able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need
to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder,
or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community,
then the City may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent
jurisdiction.

provide, at the owner's or operator's own expense, reasonable protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal
storm drain system or watercourses through the use of structural and
nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises,
that is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to
implement, at such person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural
BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate
storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES
permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated with commercial,
industrial or construction activities, to the extent practicable, shall be
deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part
of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance
with requirements of the NPDES permit.
148.72   DETENTION REQUIREMENTS FOR REDEVELOPMENT.
Any redevelopment of a lot to repair, replace of add-on to the existing
improvements, that generate runoff greater than that discharged prior to
redevelopment shall require detention. Said detention facilities shall, at a
minimum, provide for the increase volume of runoff generated by the
redevelopment (preferably for runoff from the whole development), unless the
original detention facility was designed for the proposed new redevelopment.
148.73   FEE IN LIEU OF DETENTION.
If a developer can demonstrate that detention facilities are unfeasible to
construct, the City may grant exception to the detention requirement and said
developer shall pay a fee in lieu of constructing storm water detention
facilities. The fee shall be based on the type of development/zoning, the
runoff coefficient set by the City, and a fee of $3,000.00 per acre prorated by
the runoff coefficient. The fee is calculated as follows:
 
Category                                               Runoff Coefficient

objectionable effects of competition in respect to the size and placement of
signs.
   D.   To enhance the physical appearance of the City by protecting the man-
made and natural beauty of the area.
   E.   To protect pedestrians and motorists from damage or injury that might
result from the improper construction, placement, or use of signs.
   F.   To protect the public by reducing the obstructions and distractions
which might cause traffic accidents.
   G.   To preserve the value of private property by assuring the compatibility
of signs with nearby land uses.

   B.   No sign shall be permitted within the line of sight triangles formed at
the intersection of a public right-of-sight-way with an access, driveway, or
alley, nor shall any sign be permitted within the line of sight triangles
formed at the intersection of two rights-of-way, with two sides of the
respective triangles being measured in length along the street boundaries
measured from their point of intersection, and the third side being a line
connecting the ends of the two sides already established. (see Figures 7, 8,

167.05   SOLAR ENERGY STANDARDS.
1.   Purpose: The purpose of this Section is to provide a regulatory means for
the construction and operation of solar energy installations that are small (50
kW or less) or large (50 kW or greater) in Hudson, subject to reasonable
restrictions, which will preserve the public health, safety, and welfare.
Hudson adopts these provisions to promote the efficient use of the City’s solar
energy resources.
2.   Regulatory Framework:
   A.   Large solar energy facilities (50 kW or greater) may only be
constructed in areas that are zoned “A-1” Agricultural District, upon approval
of a use exception by the Board of Adjustment.
   B.   Small solar energy facilities (50 kW or less) may be constructed in any
zoning district as either a principal or accessory use. Small solar energy
installations that are constructed as an accessory use to a principal permitted
use, and meet the setback, height, and power output requirements of this
section shall not require special exception approval and shall only require a
building permit. All small solar power energy facilities that are constructed
as a principal permitted use, or small solar power energy facilities that do
not meet height, or power requirements of this section, shall require Special
Exception Approval.
   C.   Solar Energy Installations: are permitted accessory use in all zoning
classifications subject to certain requirements set forth in this ordinance.
Solar energy systems that do not meet the standards listed below will require
approval of a Special exception permit.
3.   Definitions.
   A.   Solar Energy System: A solar energy system whose primary purpose is to
harvest energy by transforming solar energy into another form of energy or
transferring heat from a collector to another medium using mechanical,
electrical, or chemical means.
   B.   Building-Integrated Solar Energy Systems: A solar energy system that is
an integral part of a principal or accessory building, rather than a separate
mechanical device, replacing or substituting for an architectural or structural
component of the building. Building-integrated systems include but are not
limited to photovoltaic or hot water solar energy systems that are contained
within roofing materials, windows, skylights, and awnings.
   C.   Concentrating Solar Power (also called concentrated solar power,
concentrated solar thermal, and CSP) are systems that: generate power by using
mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight, or solar thermal
energy, onto a small area. Electricity is generated when the concentrated light
is converted to heat, which drives a heat engine (usually a steam turbine)
connected to an electrical power generator or powers a thermochemical reaction.
   D.   Grid-intertie Solar Energy System: A solar energy system that is
connected to an electric circuit served by an electric utility company.
   E.   Ground-Mount: A solar energy system mounted on a rack or pole that
rests or is attached to the ground. Ground-mount systems can be either
accessory or principal uses.
   F.   Off-grid Solar Energy System: A solar energy system in which the
circuits energized by the solar energy system are not electrically connected in
any way to electric circuits that are served by an electric utility company.
   G.   Passive Solar Energy System: A solar energy system that captures solar
light or heat without transforming it to another form of energy or transferring
the energy via a heat exchanger.
   H.   Photovoltaic System: An active solar energy system that converts solar
energy directly into electricity.
   I.   Renewable Energy Easement, Solar Energy Easement: An easement that
limits the height or location, or both, of permissible development on the
burdened land in terms of a structure or vegetation, or both, for the purpose
of providing access for the benefited land to wind or sunlight passing over the
burdened land.
   J.   Renewable Energy System: A solar energy or wind energy system.
Renewable energy systems do not include passive systems that serve a dual
function, such as a greenhouse or window.
   K.   Roof-Mount: a solar energy system mounted on a rack that is fastened to
or ballasted on a building roof. Roof-mount systems are accessory to the
structure they are mounted to.
   L.   Roof Pitch: The final exterior slope of a building roof calculated by
the rise over the run, typically but not exclusively expressed in twelfth such
as 3/12, 9/12, 12/12.
   M.   Solar Access: Unobstructed access to direct sunlight on a lot or
building through the entire year, including access across adjacent parcel air
rights, for the purpose of capturing direct sunlight to operate a solar energy
system.
   N.   Solar Collector Surface: Any part of a solar collector that absorbs
solar energy for use in the collector’s energy transformation process.
Collector surface does not include frames, supports and mounting hardware.
   O.   Solar Daylighting: A device specifically designed to capture and
redirect the visible portion of the solar spectrum, while controlling the
infrared portion, for use in illuminating interior building spaces in lieu of
artificial lighting.
   P.   Solar Energy: Radiant energy received from the sun that can be
collected in the form of heat or light by a solar collector.
   Q.   Solar Energy System: A device, array of devices, or structural design
feature, the purpose of which is to provide for generation of electricity, the
collection, storage and distribution of solar energy for space heating or
cooling, daylight for interior lighting, or water heating.
   R.   Solar Heat Exchanger: A component of a solar energy device that is used
to transfer heat from one substance to another, either liquid or gas.
   S.   Solar Hot Air System: (also referred to as Solar Air Heat or Solar
Furnace) An active solar energy system that includes a solar collector to
provide direct supplemental space heating by heating and re-circulating
conditioned building air. The most efficient performance typically uses a
vertically mounted collector on a south-facing wall.
   T.   Solar Hot Water System: (also referred to as Solar Thermal) A system
that includes a solar collector and heat exchanger that heats or preheats water
for building heating systems or other hot water needs, including residential
domestic hot water and hot water for commercial processes.
   U.   Solar Mounting Devices: Racking, frames, or other devices that allow
the mounting of a solar collector onto a roof surface or the ground.

3.   Principal or Accessory Use. Antennas and towers may be considered either
principal or accessory uses, but in any event, shall comply with all of the
requirements of this section of this Ordinance relating to principal and/or
accessory uses. A different existing use of an existing structure on the same
lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot.
4.   Lot Size. For purposes of determining whether, the installation of a tower
or antenna complies with zoning district development regulations, including
(but not limited to) setback requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other
such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though
the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lot.
5.   Inventory of Existing Sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower
shall provide the Zoning Administrator an inventory of its existing towers,
antennas, or sites for towers or antennas, that are either within the
jurisdiction of the City, or within one (1) mile of the border thereof,
including specific information about the location, height, and design of each
tower. The Zoning Administrator may share such information with other
applicants applying for a special exception permit under this section or other
organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the City,
provided however, that the Zoning Administrator is not, by sharing such
information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are
available or suitable.
6.   Exemption for Certain Towers of Governmental Bodies. Communications towers
and/or antennas erected by city, county, or state governmental bodies for
public safety or other essential public purposes shall be exempt from the
provisions of this section.
7.   State or Federal Requirements. All towers shall meet or exceed current
standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the
State or federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas.
If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers
and antennas governed by this section shall bring such towers and antennas into
compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of
the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a different
compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling State or federal agency.
Failure to bring all towers and antennas into compliance with such revised
standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the City to require the
removal of the tower or antenna at the owner’s expense.
8.   NIER. The NIER (non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation) emitted from a
communications tower or associated equipment shall not exceed the most recently
adopted standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI-95.1).
9.   Height. Towers (including top mounted appurtenances) shall not exceed the

towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance
with standards contained in applicable State or local building codes and the
applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries
Association, as amended from time to time. If upon inspection, the City
concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and
constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to
the owner of the tower, the owner shall have a period of thirty (30) days to
bring such tower into compliance with such codes and standards. Failure to
bring such tower into compliance within said thirty (30) day period shall
constitute grounds for the City to require the removal of the tower or antenna
at the owner’s expense.
13.   Nonessential Services. Towers and antennas shall be regulated and
permitted pursuant to this section and shall not be regulated or permitted as
essential services, public utilities, or private utilities.
14.   Tower Removal. The tower owner and/or operator shall notify the Zoning
Administrator when a tower is removed, no longer in use, or is knocked down or
damaged to such an extent that major structural repairs are required. If a
tower is removed, knocked down, blown down, or damaged to such an extent that
major structural repairs are required, said tower shall not be reconstructed or
replaced without prior review and approval by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and Council. If said damaged tower is abandoned or inoperable with
no intention by the owner to replace said tower, the tower shall be removed in
a timely fashion at the expense of the tower owner or the property owner where
the tower is located, as directed by the Zoning Administrator. Any antenna or
tower that is not operated for a continuous period of twelve (12) months shall
be abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove the same
within ninety (90) days of receipt of notice from the City notifying both the
tower owner and the owner of the property on which the tower is located, of
such abandonment. Failure of the tower owner or property owner to remove an
abandoned antenna or tower within said ninety (90) days shall be grounds for
the City to require the removal of the tower or antenna at the expense of the
tower owner or property owner. If there are two (2) or more users of a single
tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease
using the tower. If the City is required to remove a tower at the expense of
the tower owner or property owner, the costs of removal, if not paid by the
tower owner, or by the owner of the property on which the tower is located,
within thirty (30) days of the City’s written demand for payment, shall be
reported to the City Clerk, who shall levy the cost thereof as an assessment,
which shall be a lien on the real estate on which the tower is located. The
City Clerk shall certify such assessments to the County Treasurer to be paid by
the owner of the property on which the tower is located, in installments in the
same manner as property taxes, as provided by law.
15.   Interference. Any signal interference complaints associated with
communication towers or related equipment shall be addressed in accordance with
FCC rules and procedures.
16.   Lighting. No towers shall be artificially lighted unless required by the
FAA or other federal or State authority. If lighting is required, the lighting
alternatives and design chosen must cause the least disturbance to the
surrounding views and/or the surrounding or abutting properties.
17.   Coloration. Towers, accessory structures, and other related components
shall use paint or coloration which blends in, to the maximum extent possible,
with the surrounding environment and surrounding buildings.
18.   Aesthetics. Towers and antennas shall meet the following requirements:
   A.   Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to
any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce
visual obtrusiveness to the maximum extent possible.
   B.   At the tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures
shall, to the maximum extent possible, use materials, colors, textures,
screening, and landscaping that will blend them into the natural setting and
surrounding buildings.
   C.   If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the
antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment shall be of a
neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of
the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as
visually unobtrusive as possible.
19.   Property Owner Information. It shall be the responsibility of the tower
owner to furnish to the City any change in name or address of the owner of the
property upon which the tower is situated.
20.   Tower Separation Requirements. If any tower is removed from a site within
the City for any reason, including, without limitation, a tower that is knocked
down, blown down, or damaged to such an extent that major structural repairs
are required, or if the tower is removed for any other reason, and if a new or
replacement tower is proposed on the same property and the same location, such
new or replacement tower may be considered for erection at the same location on
the same property, subject to compliance with the review process and standard
contained in this section. Any such application shall be subject to review and
approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council. The tower
separation requirements of this section shall not, in and of themselves,
necessarily serve as a basis for denial of such an application. The Commission
and Council may waive the tower separation requirements with respect to said
application if, after considering all relevant circumstances, including whether
the applicant has clearly demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commission
and the Council that all practical and feasible co-location alternatives have
been investigated, considered, and appropriately rejected, and, based upon all
other relevant factors and circumstances, the Commission and Council determine
that approval of the application shall serve the interests of the community.
21.   Tower Design. In furtherance, of the goal set forth in subsection 1(d) of
this section – to strongly encourage co-location of communication antennas on
existing towers or other existing structures – each applicant proposing to
construct a new communication tower shall be required to design the proposed
new tower so as to accommodate the co-location of the antenna arrays of at
least three (3) additional telecommunications carriers or providers, in
addition to the antenna requirements of the applicant proposing to construct
the new tower.

26.   Factors Considered in Granting Special Exception Permits for Towers. The
Commission and Council shall consider the following factors in determining
whether to issue a special exception permit, although the Commission and
Council may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one (1) or more of
these criteria if the Commission and Council conclude that the goals of this
Development Ordinance are better served thereby:
   A.   Height of the proposed tower.
   B.   Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential
district boundaries.
   C.   Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties.
   D.   Surrounding topography.
   E.   Surrounding tree coverage and foliage.
   F.   Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual
obtrusiveness. This consideration shall involve evaluation of any proposed
camouflage design options and whether any such camouflage options are in
character with the surrounding area and that the proposed design achieves the
desired camouflage effect.
   G.   Proposed ingress and egress.
   H.   Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or
alternative technologies not requiring the use of towers or structures.
27.   Availability of Suitable Existing Towers, Other Structures, or
Alternative Technology. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant
demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the Commission and Council that
no existing tower, structure or alternative technology that does not require
the use of towers or structures can accommodate the applicant’s proposed tower
structure and/or antennas. An applicant shall submit information requested by
the Zoning Administrator related to the availability of suitable existing
towers, other structures, or alternative technology. Evidence submitted to
demonstrate that no existing tower, structure, or alternative technology can
accommodate the applicant’s proposed antenna may consist of any of the
following:
   A.   No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area
which meet applicant's reasonable and technologically sound engineering
requirements.
   B.   Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet
applicant’s reasonable and technologically sound engineering requirements.
   C.   Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural
strength to support applicant’s proposed antenna and related equipment, and
still meet applicable structural requirements described in this section.
   D.   The applicant’s proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the
antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the
applicant’s proposed antenna such that the applicant’s antenna would not be
technologically feasible.
   E.   The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in
order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or
structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development
are presumed to be unreasonable, based on reasonable technological and/or
engineering criteria.
   F.   The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that
render existing towers and structures unsuitable, based on reasonable
technological and/or engineering criteria.
   G.   The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does not
require the use of towers or structures, such as a cable microcell network
using multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to a wire line
system, is unsuitable, based on reasonable technological and/or engineering
criteria. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new tower or antenna
development shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable..
28.   Setbacks. The following setback requirements shall apply to all towers
for which a special exception permit is required:
   A.   Towers must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements
that are applicable to principal uses on the property where the proposed tower
will be situated.
   B.   Guy wire and other structural support elements and accessory buildings
must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements that are
applicable to principal uses on the property where the proposed tower will be
situated.
   C.   If tower are established on properties located adjacent to a freeway,
State highway, a major or minor arterial street/roadway or collector street,
the tower structure shall be located at least the height of said tower in
distance from the adjacent said public right-of-way.
29.   Location and Installation.
   A.   Residential Districts. Communication towers intended to serve personal
and amateur radio operators, including hobby radio operators (i.e. private
radio operators) shall be permitted within any residential zoning district as
an accessory use to a principal permitted residential use, subject to the
following requirements:
      (1)   Said private radio communication towers in residential districts
shall not be located in front of any residence and not within any required side
or rear yard areas. If the tower is supported with guy anchors or other
radiating support structure, said anchors or support structure shall not be
allowed within five (5) feet of a rear or side property line. Said anchors or
support structure shall not be allowed within a required front yard.
      (2)   The maximum allowable height of a fixed tower including antennas
and appurtenances serving private radio operators and also including roof
mounted communication antennas within a residential zoning district serving
private radio communication towers shall be eighty (80) feet. Said maximum
height shall be measured from the average natural grade of the property
immediately adjacent to the tower.
      (3)   Prior to the installation of any private radio communication tower
in a residential zoning district, the owner/operator shall submit to the Zoning
Administrator an application for a special exception permit as outlined in this
section. For those proposed towers or roof mounted antennas that have an
overall height of less than forty (40) feet as measured from the natural grade,
the Zoning Administrator may issue a special exception permit without any
further review by the Commission or the Council.
      (4)   If the overall height of the proposed private radio communication
tower or antenna exceeds forty (40) feet above the natural grade, the request
shall be reviewed by the Commission and the Council. The owner/applicant shall
submit evidence that the tower and if roof mounted, the tower and building to
which it is attached, are constructed to specifications of tower industry
standards. The owner/applicant shall be responsible for providing a statement
from an independent structural engineer that the proposed tower or antenna
structural specifications satisfy basic industry safety standards as described
in this section.
   B.   Communication tower structures intended for use for commercial purposes
or by any entity other than a private radio operator shall be strongly
discouraged within the City in any zoning district that allows residential uses
as a principal permitted use. However, in those instances where an applicant
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commission and the Council that the
interests of the community will be served by the installation of a tower in any
such residential zoning district, such application may be granted, provided
that said proposed tower shall be of an acceptable camouflage design and shall
not exceed eighty (80) feet in overall height. The Commission and Council shall
determine whether the proposal to the place the tower in any such residential
zoning district is in conformity with the purposes set forth in subsection 1 of
this section, and otherwise meets all of the applicable requirements of this
section. No two-legged or multi-legged lattice structure or guy wire supported
towers shall be permitted in any residential zoning district under any
circumstances. Commercial and private communication equipment, including
antennas and accessory support facilities (i.e. small detached structures), may
be permitted within any such residential zoning district only when all of the
following are met:
      (1)   It is proposed to affix communication antennas to a camouflaged
tower, existing structure such as a church steeple, water tower, telephone or
electric pole, or other acceptable camouflage design.
      (2)   The antenna and accessory communication equipment shall be
camouflaged or heavily screened so as to be an unobtrusive and unnoticeable
within the neighborhood as possible.
      (3)   The applicant demonstrates compliance with all of the applicable
requirements of this section.
      (4)   Subject to review and approval by the Commission and the Council,
if applicable.
   C.   Commercial Districts. Communication towers intended for use for
commercial purposes or by any entity other than a private hobby radio operator
shall be permitted as a principal permitted use in the following zoning
districts: A-1, except as limited herein, C-1, C-2, M-1, M-2, or PD, upon site
plan review and approval by the Commission and the Council.
30.   Towers as Principal Permitted or Accessory Uses. Towers that are proposed
as principal permitted uses or accessory uses shall be subject to the following
standards:
   A.   Towers proposed to be established as principal permitted or accessory
uses in the “A-1” Agriculture Zoning District shall be guided by the City’s
Land use map. There are many “A-1” Districts within the City which are located
adjacent to “R” Residential zoning districts, and which have not yet been
rezoned for development purposes. Therefore, in order to discourage the
establishment of commercial communication towers immediately adjacent to or
within existing residential neighborhoods, the land use map shall be utilized
as a guide in evaluating which properties are designed as future residential
development areas. It is the intent of this section that towers proposed to be
established in the “A-1” District must be located in those areas intended for
commercial or industrial development areas and shall not be permitted in those
areas designated for future residential development as indicated on the City’s
land use map, except as otherwise expressly provided in subsection 29 (B) of
this section. Said towers shall be governed by the following standards outlined
herein.
   B.   Towers proposed to be established as principal permitted or accessory
uses in “A-1”, “M-1”, “M-2” or “PD” Districts shall be limited to an overall
height, as measured from natural grade, of two hundred-fifty (250) feet. All
such towers that are one hundred-fifty (150) feet or less in overall tower
height must be of monopole construction.
   C.   Towers proposed to be established as principal permitted or accessory
uses in “C-1”. “C-2” or “PD” zoning districts shall be limited in overall
height to one hundred-twenty (120) feet. All such towers must be of monopole
construction.
   D.   All towers proposed to be established as principal permitted or
accessory uses shall be located on the lot so that the distance from the base
of the tower to any adjoining property line, or leased property boundary, meets
the minimum building setback requirement for the zoning district in which the
tower is located.
   E.   Guy wires or radiating tower support structures, if utilized in
conjunction with a tower, shall maintain a setback from the property lines
equal to the building setback requirement in the zoning district in which it is
located.
   F.   All towers proposed to be established as principal permitted or
accessory uses shall be certified by a registered engineer stating that the
tower structure will withstand wind pressures of eighty (80) miles per hour
with one-half inch ice load. If said tower is roof-mounted the same engineering
certification shall be provided for both the tower and the building to which it
is attached.
   G.   Camouflage design options for the tower structure and related
facilities shall be evaluated based on the requirements of this section. It is
the intent of this regulation to seek out and pursue camouflage design options
to the maximum extent possible.
   H.   Security fencing, measuring at least six (6) feet in height, shall be
required around the base of the tower and also around guy anchors of any tower,
and shall also be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device, unless
waived by the Council, as it deems appropriate.
   I.   The following requirements shall govern the landscaping surrounding
towers for which a special exception permit is required; provided, however, the
Council may waive such requirements if the goals of this Ordinance would be
better served thereby.
      (1)   Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant
materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from property
used for residences. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at
least four (4) feet wide and six (6) feet high at the time of planting, located
outside the perimeter of the compound.
      (2)   In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal,
the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived by the Commission and
Council.
      (3)   Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site
shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as
towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property
perimeter may be considered a sufficient buffer.
   J.   Upon completion of tower site construction, a placard containing the
name, address, and telephone number of the principal owner or operator of the
tower shall be affixed in a location so that it is clearly visible at the
perimeter of the site. Said placard shall not exceed three (3) square feet in
area. The pertinent ownership information on the placard shall be kept current
and updated as needed.
   K.   Separation distances between towers shall be applicable for and
measured between the proposed tower and preexisting towers. The separation
distances shall be measured by drawing or following a straight line between the
base of the existing tower and the proposed tower based, pursuant to a site
plan, of the proposed tower. The separation distances (listed in linear feet)

Other zoning districts where tower structures are generally prohibited may
be considered for the installation of towers and related communication
equipment, including antennas and accessory support facilities under the
same guidelines as outlined in subsection 29(B), residential districts,
provided that said consideration does not conflict with any other
requirements of this chapter.
Roof-mounted towers shall be permitted in any allowable commercial or
industrial zoning district as specified herein subject to the following
standard: maximum height of the tower shall be forty (40) feet above the roof
upon which the tower is established, but not more than one hundred-twenty (120)
feet above ground level.
   L.   Every application for a special exception permit to install a
communication tower or antenna in the City shall comply with all provisions of
this section, all provisions of this chapter, including but not limited to,
compliance with all on-site parking requirements including driveway/aisle
access requirements of this chapter applicable to the site on which the
communication tower or antenna will be installed, and all other provisions of
this code which are applicable to this site, the installation of the tower or
antenna, and all other provisions of this code which are in a any way
applicable to said application.
   M.   In granting a special exception permit under this section, the Planning
and Zoning Commission and City Council may impose reasonable conditions to the
extent such conditions are deemed necessary to satisfy the purposes of this
section and in order to minimize any adverse effect or impact of the proposed
tower on adjoining properties.
167.08   MAINTENANCE OF LANDSCAPE AND/OR OPEN SPACE BUFFERS AND EASEMENTS.
1.   Maintenance. Maintenance of landscape and/or open buffers and easements
shall be the responsibility of the property owner. “Landscape buffer” or “open
space buffer” means an area which acts as a buffer between two (2) land uses of
different intensity that visibly separates one (1) use from another or shields
or blocks noise, lights or other nuisances and is required to include trees and
shrubs and may include fences and/or berms and consists of a type of screening
required under subsection 2. A site plan for all required landscape buffers or
open space buffers or screening required under subsection 2 shall be submitted
to the Planning and Zoning Commission and Hudson City Council for approval.
2.   Screening. The intent of screening regulations is to lessen the
transmission from one (1) lot to another of noise, dust, glare; to lessen
visual pollution by providing an impression of separation of spaces or entirely
shielding one (1) land use from another; and/or establishing a sense of privacy
from visual or physical intrusion. The provisions of this section are necessary
to safeguard the public health, safety, and welfare.
   A.   General Screening Standard. Every development shall provide sufficient
screening so that neighboring properties are shielded from any adverse external
effects of that development; and the development is shielded from the negative
impact of adjacent uses including streets.
   B.   Compliance with General Standard. The following Table 8, in conjunction
with the explanations set forth in paragraph C concerning types of screens,
establishes screening requirements that presumptively satisfy the general
standard established in paragraph A of this subsection.

description.
 
The zoning classifications contained in Table 7 are keyed to those
classifications described in
Chapter 166 of this ordinance. The letter designations within Table 7 refer to
the types of screening described in paragraph C of this subsection. The table
indicates the type of screening that is presumptively required between two (2)
uses. Where such screening is required the applicant or burdened use is
responsible for installation prior to receiving an occupancy permit for the use
in question.
   C.   Descriptions of Screens. The following three (3) basic types of screens
are established and are used as the basis for the table of screening
requirements set forth in paragraph B of this subsection.
      (1)   Broken Screen, Type A: A screen composed of intermittent visual
obstructions from the ground to a height of at least twenty (20) feet. The
broken screen is intended to create the impression of a separation of spaces
without necessarily eliminating visual contact between the spaces. It may be
composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or
existing vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetation screens or natural
vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density
of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation.
The screen may contain deciduous plants.
      (2)   Semi-Opaque Screen, Type B: A screen that is opaque from the ground
to a height of three (3) feet, with intermittent visual obstruction from above
the opaque portion to a height of at least twenty (20) feet. The semi-opaque
screen is intended to partially block visual contact between uses and to create
a strong impression of the separation of spaces. The semi-opaque screen may be
composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or
existing vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetation screens or natural
vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density
of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation.
At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual obstructions shall not contain
any completely unobstructed openings more than ten (10) feet wide. The zone of
intermittent visual obstruction may contain deciduous plants.
      (3)   Opaque Screen, Type C: A screen that is opaque from the ground to a
height of at least six (6) feet, with intermittent visual obstructions from the
opaque portion to a height of at least twenty (20) feet. An opaque screen is
intended to exclude all visual contact between uses and to create a strong
impression of partial separation. The opaque screen may be composed of a wall,
fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation.
Compliance of planted vegetation screens or natural vegetation will be judged
on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject
species, or field observation of existing vegetation. At maturity, the portion
of intermittent visual obstructions shall not contain any completely
unobstructed openings more than ten (10) feet wide. The zone of intermittent
visual obstruction may contain deciduous plants.
   D.   Storage Areas. The outdoor storage of materials, equipment, or
supplies, when permitted in any commercial or industrial district, shall be so
located or screened, fenced, or landscaped so as to effectively prevent
visibility of such storage from all abutting residential zoning districts or
abutting existing residential uses. Such screening shall be sufficient if it
prevents visibility of such storage area by persons traveling on public rights-
of-way or standing at grade level on the side or rear lot lines of such
property. Such screening shall comply with the standard for an opaque screen
Type C as described in paragraph C(3) of this subsection.
167.09   NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
1.   General. A lawful, or authorized, nonconforming building or structure
existing at the time of adoption of this Ordinance may be continued,
maintained, and repaired, except as otherwise provided in this Section even
though said building or structure may not conform with the regulations of this
Ordinance for the District in which it is located. A nonconforming building or
structure in existence at the adoption hereof that was not a lawful, or
authorized, building or structure under previous zoning ordinances shall not be
authorized to continue as a nonconforming building or structure pursuant to
this Ordinance, or amendments thereto. Nothing in this Ordinance shall prevent
the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition any part of any building or
structure declared unsafe.
2.   Alteration or Enlargement of Building and Structures. A nonconforming
building or structure shall not be added to or enlarged in any manner unless
said building or structure including additions and enlargements, is made to
conform to all the regulations of the District in which it is located;
provided, however, that if a building or structure is conforming as to its use,
but nonconforming as to yards or height or off-street parking space, said
building or structure may b enlarged or added to provided that the enlargement
of addition complies with the yard and height and off-street parking
requirements of the District in which said building or structure is located. No
nonconforming building or structure shall be moved in whole or in part to
another location on the lot unless every portion of said building or structure
is made to conform to all of the regulations of the District in which it is
located.
3.   Building Vacancy. A building or structure or portion thereof, that is
nonconforming which is or hereafter become vacant and remains unoccupied for a
continuous period of one (1) year shall not thereafter be occupied except by a
use which conforms to the use regulations of the District in which it is
located.
4.   Destruction of Nonconforming Building or Structure. If any nonconforming
building or structure is destroyed by any means, it shall not be reconstructed
if the cost is more than fifty (50) percent of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred, in which case reconstruction shall be in
accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance. If the damage is less than
stated above, it may be restored, reconstructed or used as before provided that
it be completed within one (1) year of such happening, and be built of like or
similar material.
5.   Change of Uses. A nonconforming use of a conforming building or structure
may be expanded or extended into any other portion of the structure provided
the structure was manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building. If such a nonconforming use, or a
portion thereof, is changed to a conforming use, any future use of such
building, structure or portion thereof shall be in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which such building or structure is located. A
vacant or partially vacant conforming building or structure may be occupied by
a nonconforming use for which the building or structure was designed or
intended if occupied within a period of one (1) year after the effective date
of this Ordinance, but otherwise it shall be used in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which it is located.
6.   The use of a nonconforming building or structure may be changed to a use
of the same or a more restricted district classification; but where the use of
nonconforming building or structure is changed to a use of a more restricted
district classification it thereafter shall not be changed to a use of a less
restricted district classification; provided, however, that a building or
structure that is nonconforming at the time of adoption of this Ordinance is
not in violation. For the purpose of this subsection only, the “R-1” District
shall be considered the most restrictive and the “M-2” District the least
restrictive District.
167.10   NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
1.   General. A lawful, or authorized, nonconforming use existing at the time
of adoption of this Ordinance may be continued, maintained, and repaired,
except as otherwise provided in this Section even though said use may not
conform with the regulations of this Ordinance for the District in which it is
located. Any nonconforming use in existence at the adoption hereof that was not
a lawful, or authorized, use under previous zoning ordinances shall not be
authorized to continue as a nonconforming use pursuant to this Ordinance, or
amendments thereto.
2.   Extension or Expansion of Use. Said nonconforming use may not be extended
or expanded, nor shall it occupy more lot area than was in use on the effective
date of this Ordinance.
3.   Discontinuance of Use. If said nonconforming use or any portion thereof is
discontinued for a period of one (1) year, or changed, any future use of such
land, or change in use, shall be in conformity with the provisions of the
District in which said land is located.

169.05   VARIANCES.
1.   Purpose and Findings of Fact. The Board of Adjustment, after a public
hearing, may determine and vary the regulations of this Ordinance in harmony
with their general purpose and intent, only in the specific instances
hereinafter set forth, where the Board of Adjustment makes written findings of
fact in accordance with the standards hereinafter prescribed and further, finds
that there was no practical difficulties or particular hardships in the way of
carrying out the strict letter of the regulations of this Ordinance.
2.   Applications for Variance. An application for a variance shall be filed in
writing with the Zoning Administrator. Said applications shall contain such
information as the Board of Adjustment may, by rules, require.
3.   Standards for Variance. The Board of Adjustment shall not vary the
regulations of this Ordinance, as authorized in this Section, unless there is
evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
   A.   Special conditions and circumstances exist which are unique to the
land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
   B.   Literal interpretation of the provisions of this Ordinance would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the
same district under the terms of this Ordinance. In other words, an unnecessary
hardship would result from literal enforcement of this Ordinance.
   C.   Special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of
this applicant.
   D.   Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any
special privilege that is denied by this Ordinance to other lands, structures,
or buildings in the same district.
4.   Further Requirements.
   A.   The Board of Adjustment shall make a finding that the reasons set forth
in the application justify the granting of the variance, and that the variance
is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land,
building, or structure.
   B.   The Board of Adjustment shall further make a finding that the granting
of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this
Ordinance and the Hudson Comprehensive Plan, and will not be injurious to the
neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
   C.   In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Ordinance.
Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made part of the terms under
which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this title and
punishable under
Chapter 167 .
   D.   Under no circumstances shall the Board of Adjustment grant a variance
to allow for use not permissible under the terms of this Ordinance in the
District involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the
terms of this Ordinance in the District.
   E.   If property lines cannot be determined through existing surveys or
property markers, the request must be accompanied by a certified survey.
169.06   SPECIAL EXCEPTION AND OTHER POWERS OF THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
1.   Special Exception.
   A.   Purpose: The development and administration of this Ordinance is based
upon the division of the City into Zoning Districts, within which Districts the
use of land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures
in relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however,
that there are certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics,
cannot be properly classified in any particular District or Districts, without
consideration in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land
and of the public need of the particular use at the particular locations. Such
special exceptions fall into two categories:
      (1)   Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public
interest, and
      (2)   Uses entirely private in character, but of such an unusual nature
that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their
impact upon neighboring property or public facilities.
   B.   Initiation of Special Exceptions: Any person having a freehold interest
in land, a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, or a
contractual interest which may become a freehold interest of an exclusive
possessory interest, either of which is specifically enforceable, may file an
application to use such land for one (1) or more of the special exceptions
provided for in this Ordinance in the zoning district in which the land is
located.
   C.   Application for Special Exception: An application for a special
exception shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator on a form as the Zoning
Administrator shall prescribe. The application shall be accompanied by such
plans and/or date prescribed by the Board of Adjustment and shall include a
statement indicating the Section of this Ordinance under which the special
exception is sought and stating the grounds on which it is requested.
   D.   Hearing on Application: Upon receipt of the proper form of the

170.14   CHARACTER OF DEVELOPMENT TO BE IN STATEMENT OF PLAT.
The City Planning and Zoning Commission and the Council may require that
certain minimum regulations regarding type and character of subdivision
development be incorporated in the owner’s statement of plat. Such regulations
shall be intended to protect the character and development of the platted
subdivision, as well as that of the surrounding development.
170.15   IMPROVEMENTS; BOND OR CASH REQUIRED.  
1.   Before the final Plat of any subdivided area shall be approved and
recorded, the subdivider shall make and install the improvements required in
this section. In lieu of final completion of the required improvements and
before the plat is approved, the subdivider shall enter into a contract with
the City to ensure the completion of the improvements within a specific time
period. The performance of such contract shall be secured with the Council by
the filing of a bond (or cash) to be approved by the Council. The bond or cash
shall not be less than the approximate cost of the improvements as estimated by
the City Engineer.
   A.   The subdivider shall provide the City with “as built” plans showing the
exact location of all underground utilities as well as the exact location of
connections on each lot.
2.   The required improvements are as follows:
   A.   Street Grading and Surfacing: All streets shall be filled or excavated
to the established grade and surfaced to the specifications of the City Council
and Planning and Zoning Commission (see Section
170.25 and
170.26).

by the City Engineer. Adequate provisions shall be made for the disposal of
storm water, subject to the approval of the Council and to the satisfaction of
the City Engineer.
   C.   Other Improvement: The City Council and the Planning and Zoning
Commission will also require certain other street improvements, including
installation of sidewalks within the street area; the installation of walkways
as necessary; grading, seeding, or sodding of all lots; and the planting of any
required trees in the parking areas. All such improvements shall be under the
direction of the appropriate City authority.
   D.   Installation of Utilities Required: All electrical, telephone,
communication, street lighting, traffic signals, television wires and cables,
and any other public utility or associated service providing service within any
such subdivision shall be installed at the discretion of the appropriate
utility or agency.
170.16   PARKS, RECREATIONAL AREAS.
Where a small park or other recreational area shown on a plan prepared by the
City Planning and Zoning Commission as part of the Comprehensive Plan for the
City and adopted by the Council is located in whole or in part in the

deems such requirements to be reasonable, require the dedication or reservation
of such area within the subdivision for park, playground, or other recreational
purposes.
170.17   SUBDIVIDER TO PROVIDE DRAINAGE, DEDICATE EASEMENTS IN PRESENCE OF
STREAMS OR OTHER WATERCOURSES.
Whenever any stream or surface watercourse is located in an area that is being
subdivided, the subdivider shall, at his/her own expense, make adequate
provisions for the proper drainage of surface water and shall also provide and
dedicate to the City an easement along such streams and watercourses.
170.18   LOT LINES.
All side lines of lots shall be right angles to straight street lines, or
radial to curved street lines, unless a variation to this rule will give a
better street and lot plan. Lots with double frontage shall be discouraged.
However, if double frontage lots are platted, then the following restriction
shall apply:
1.   Double frontage lots and reversed frontage lots shall be avoided except
where necessary to provide separation of residential development from traffic
arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
2.   Lot shall not derive access from a major or secondary arterial. Where
driveway access from a major or secondary arterial may be necessary for several
adjoining lots, the Commission may require that such lots be served by a
combined access drive in order to limit possible traffic hazard on such street.
Where possible, driveways should be designed and arranged so as to avoid
requiring vehicles to back into traffic on major or secondary arterials.
170.19   REQUIRED LOT DIMENSIONS.
The minimum dimensions for lots in a subdivision shall be as shown in Section
165.25 and Table 1 of the City of Hudson Zoning Ordinance. In no case shall a
lot that is to be used for residential purposes contain less area than is
required by the lot area regulation of the zoning district in which the
property is located.
170.20   CORNER LOTS.
Corner lots in subdivisions on major street intersections, and at all other
points likely to be dangerous, shall have a radius of not less than fifteen
(15) feet at the street corner. On business lots, a chord may be substituted
for the circular arc. Corner lots shall not be less than seventy (70) feet in
width.
170.21   BUILDING LINES.
1.   Building lines in subdivisions shall be shown on the plat and included in

parts of buildings to be set back to such building lines.
170.22   DIVISIONS TO ALLOW OPENING, EXTENDING OF STREETS: EASEMENTS.
1.   Where a parcel of land is subdivided into larger tracts than ordinarily
used for building lots, such parcel shall be divided so as to allow for the
opening of major streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent minor streets.
2.   Easements providing for the future opening and extension of such streets
may, at the discretion of the Council, be made a requirement of the plat.
170.23   RELATION OF STREETS TO ADJOINING STREET SYSTEMS.
New subdivisions shall make provisions for the continuation of the principal
existing streets in adjoining additions (or their proper projection where
adjoining property is not subdivided) insofar as they may be necessary for
public requirements. In general, such streets shall be of a width as great as
that of the streets so continued or projected but shall not be less than the
minimum width requirements.
170.24   STREET SYSTEM TO COMPLY WITH CITY’S PLAN: INTERSECTING, PARALLEL
STREETS.
1.   The street system of a subdivision shall be so arranged to comply, as far
as practicable, with the major street plan of the City, providing such a plan
is in force.
2.   Intersecting streets, if possible, shall be near ninety (90) degree angles

All electrical, telephone, communication, street lighting, traffic signals,
television wires and cables, and any other public utility or associated service
providing service within any such subdivision shall be installed entirely
underground by the developer thereof in accordance with the rules, regulations,
and specifications of the public utility or agency providing such service. The
subdivider shall furnish information that satisfactory arrangements have been
made with the serving public utility or agency. The Commission may recommend to

direction of the appropriate City authority. Sidewalks shall be installed
according to the provisions of the City and shall be installed at the time of
construction or within one year following issuance of occupancy permit.
170.32   NONRESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
1.   A nonresidential subdivision shall conform to the proposed land use plan
established in the Comprehensive Plan, as well as be subject to all the
requirements as set forth in this Ordinance. If a proposed subdivision includes
land that is zoned for commercial or industrial purposes, the layout of the
subdivision with respect to such land shall make such provisions as the
Commission may require. A nonresidential subdivision shall be subject to all
the requirements of these additional regulations. Site plan approval and
nonresidential subdivision plat approval may proceed simultaneously at the
discretion of the Commission.
2.   In addition to the principles and standards outlined in this Ordinance,
which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the applicant shall

that the streets and easements affecting such lot are brought to the grade
established in the construction plans.
3.   No building permit shall be issued for the final ten (10) percent of lots,
or the final five (5) lots of a subdivision, whichever is greater, until all
public improvements required by the Council for the plat have been fully
completed and dedicated to the City.
170.34   PLACES.
Where it is desired to subdivide a parcel of land, which, because of its size
or location, does not permit a normal lot or street area, there may be
established a “place.” Such a place may be in the form of a court, non-
connecting street or other arrangement, provided, however, that proper access
shall be given to all lots from a dedicated place (street or court). If any
dead-end place, court or cul-de-sac is more than two hundred and fifty (250)
feet in length, it shall terminate in an open space, preferable circular,
having a minimum radius of sixty (60) feet. Except in unusual instances, no
dead-end street or place shall exceed six hundred (600) feet in length.

A recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be forwarded to
the City Council.
1.   Vacation of Plats: The owners of lots within an official plat who wish to
vacate any portion of the official plat shall file a petition with the Planning
and Zoning Commission for review and recommendation. After review by the
Commission, the petition and recommendation are filed with the City Council,
and they shall set a time and place for a public hearing on the petition.
Written notice of the public hearing shall be provided to property owners
within three hundred (300) feet of the area to be vacated. If a portion of the
official plat adjoins a river or state-owned lake, the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources shall be published twice, with fourteen (14) days between
publications, stating the date, time, and place of the public hearing. The
official plat or portion of the official plat shall be vacated upon recording
of all of the following documents:
   A.   An instrument signed, executed, and acknowledged by all the property
owners and mortgages within the area of the official plat to be vacated,
declaring the plat to be vacated. The instrument shall state the existing lot
description for each property along with an accurate description to be used to
describe the land after the lots are vacated.

for the conveyance of those areas included in the vacation which were
previously set aside for dedicated or public use.
   C.   A certificate of the County Auditor that the vacated part of the plat
can be adequately described for assessment and taxation purposes without
reference to the vacated lots. No part of this Section authorizes the closing
or obstructing of public highways. The vacation of a portion of an official
plat shall not remove or otherwise affect a recorded restrictive covenant,
protective covenant, building restriction, or use restriction. Recorded
restrictions on the use of the property within an official plat shall be
modified or revoked by recording a consent to the modification or removal,
signed, and acknowledged by the proprietors and mortgages within the official
plat.
2.   Vacation of Streets and Other Public Lands. The City may vacate a part of
an official plat that has been conveyed to the City or dedicated to public
which is deemed by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council to be of
no benefit to the public. The City shall vacate by resolution following a
public hearing or by ordinance and the vacating instrument shall be recorded.
The City may convey the vacated property by deed or may convey the property to
adjoining property owners through the vacation instrument. If the vacating
instrument is used to convey property then the instrument shall include a list
of adjoining property owners to whom the vacated property is being conveyed
along with the corresponding legal description of each parcel being conveyed. A
recorded vacation instrument which conforms to this Section is equivalent to a
deed of conveyance and the instrument shall be filed and indexed as a
conveyance by the County Recorder and County Auditor. A vacation instrument
recorded pursuant to this subsection shall not operate to annul any part of an
official plat except as provided for in Section
170.31 (1)(a).
170.36   PLATS OUTSIDE OF CORPORATE LIMITS.
All proposed subdivision plats for property lying outside of, but within two
(2) miles of, the corporate limits of the City of Hudson shall submit such
proposed plats as described herein and shall develop such subdivisions in
accordance with those provisions stated herein as authorized by Iowa Code,
Chapter 354.
170.37   WAIVER OF SUBDIVISION REQUIREMENTS.
1.   Waivers Granted by the City Council
   A.   General. Where the Council finds that extraordinary hardships or
practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations
and/or the purposes of these regulations may be served to greater extent by an
alternative proposal; it may approve waivers to these subdivision regulations
to that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured,
provided that such waiver shall not have the effect of mollifying the intent
and purpose of these regulations; and further provided the Council shall not
approved waivers unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence
presented to it in each specific case that:
      (1)   The granting of a waiver will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health, or welfare, or injurious to adjacent properties.
      (2)   The conditions upon which the request for a waiver is based are
unique to the property for which the waiver is sought and are not applicable to
generally to other property.
      (3)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of these regulations are carried out.
      (4)   The waiver will not in any manner vary the provisions of this
Development Ordinance or Official Street Plan.
      (5)   The waiver shall not, by any standard in this Development
Ordinance, create a nonconforming use or building.
   B.   Conditions: In approving waivers, the City Council may require such
conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the
standards or requirements of these regulations.
   C.   Procedures: A petition for any such waiver shall be submitted in
writing by the subdivider at the time when the preliminary plat is filed for
the consideration of the Commission. The petition shall state fully the grounds
for the application and all the facts relied upon by the petitioner.
2.   Waivers Granted by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The Commission may
waive the subdivision process if the real estate in question is too small to be
built upon and the resulting parcels are of sufficient size that the waiver
would not create a nonconforming use or building.
170.38   SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.
Any provisions of these regulations may be changed and amended from time to
time by the City Council provided, however, that such changes and amendments
shall not become effective until after study and recommendation by the Planning
and Zoning Commission and in accordance with the regulations and provisions of
the City of Hudson and the Code of Iowa.

to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety
code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
The term also does not include any alteration of a "historic structure,"
provided the alteration will not preclude the structure's designation as a
"historic structure."
   B.   Any addition which increases the original floor area of a building by
25 percent or more. All additions constructed after the effective date of the
first floodplain management regulations adopted by the community shall be added

171.02   STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSE.
1.   The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 364, Code of Iowa, as
amended, delegated the power to cities to exercise any power and perform any
function it deems appropriate to protect and preserve the rights, privileges,
and property of the City or of its residents, and to preserve and improve the
peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort, and convenience of its residents.
2.   Findings of Fact.
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Hudson are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community.
   B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by:
(i) The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding, and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
   C.   This ordinance relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this Ordinance to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the City of Hudson and its
residents and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and
comfort and convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses
described in SECTION
171.02(2)(A) of this Ordinance with provisions designed to:
   A.   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows so
that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
   B.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
   C.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
   D.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazards.
   E.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
171.03   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
1.   Lands to Which Ordinance Apply. The provisions of this Ordinance shall
apply to all lands and development which have significant flood hazards. The
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Black Hawk County and Incorporated Areas,
City of Hudson, Panels 19013C0278G, 0279G, 0283G, 0286G, 0287G, 0288G, 0289G,
and 0291G dated May 8, 2024, which were prepared as part of the Black Hawk
County Flood Insurance Study, shall be used to identify such flood hazard areas
and all areas shown thereon to be within the boundaries of the base flood shall
be considered as having significant flood hazards. The Flood Insurance Study
for Black Hawk County is hereby adopted by reference and is made a part of this
ordinance for the purpose of administering floodplain management regulations.
2.   Rules for Interpretation of Flood Hazard Boundaries. The boundaries of the
Special Flood Hazard areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the
official Flood Insurance Rate Map. Where uncertainty exists with respect to the
precise location of the base flood boundary, the location shall be determined
on the basis of the base flood elevation at the particular site in question.
When an interpretation is needed as to the exact location of a boundary, the
City Zoning Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The Board of
Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an
error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the City Zoning
Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this Ordinance.
3.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used, and no structure
shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full
compliance with the terms of this Ordinance and other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this Ordinance.
4.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this Ordinance
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this Ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the
provision of this Ordinance shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this Ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency
only.
5.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this Ordinance shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
6.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
Ordinance are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This Ordinance
does not imply that areas outside the designated areas of significant flood
hazard will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Ordinance shall not
create liability on the part of the City of Hudson or any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or
any administrative decision lawfully made there under.
7.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
Ordinance is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this Ordinance shall not be affected thereby.
171.04   ADMINISTRATION.
1.   Appointment, Duties, and Responsibilities of Local Official.

improvements and market value of the structure prior to the improvements.
      (8)   Such other information as the Administrator deems reasonably
necessary (e.g., drawings or a site plan) for the purpose of this Ordinance.
   C.   Action on Permit Application - The Administrator shall, within a
reasonable time, make a determination as to whether the proposed floodplain
development meets the applicable standards of this Ordinance and shall approve
or disapprove the application. For disapprovals, the applicant shall be
informed, in writing, of the specific reasons therefore. The Administrator
shall not issue permits for variances except as directed by the Board of
Adjustment.
   D.   Construction and Use to be as Provided in Application and Plans -
Floodplain Development Permits based on the basis of approved plans and
applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in
such approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement, or
construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance. The applicant shall
be required to submit certification by a professional engineer or land
surveyor, as appropriate, registered in the State of Iowa, that the finished
fill, structure flood elevations, floodproofing, or other flood protection
measures were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance,
prior to the use or occupancy of any structure.
171.05   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT STANDARDS.
1.   General Floodplain Standards. All development must be consistent with the
need to minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance
standards. Where base flood elevations have not been provided in the Flood
Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to
determine (i) whether the land involved is either wholly or partly within the
floodway or floodway fringe and (ii) the base flood elevation. Until a
regulatory floodway is designated, no development may increase the Base Flood
Elevation more than one (1) foot. The applicant will be responsible for
providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical
information to make such determination.
Review by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources is not required for the
proposed construction of new or replacement bridges or culverts where (i) the
bridge or culvert is located on a stream that drains less than two (2) square
miles, and (ii) the bridge or culvert is not associated with a channel
modification that constitutes a channel change as specified in 567-71.2(2),
Iowa Administrative Code.
   A.   All development within the special flood hazard areas shall:
      (1)   Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement.
      (2)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
      (3)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
   B.   Residential Structures - All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than 1.0 ft. above the
base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed (subject to favorable
consideration by the City Council), where existing topography, street grades,
or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods used
must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various
forces and hazards associated with flooding.
All new residential structures located in areas that would become isolated due
to flooding of surrounding ground shall be provided with a means of access that
will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this
criterion shall not apply where the Administrator determines there is
sufficient flood warning time for the protection of life and property. When
estimating flood warning time, consideration shall be given to the criteria
listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa Administrative Code.
   C.   Non-residential structures - All new or substantially improved non-
residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, or together
with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level.
When floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State
of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces,
and other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below
the base flood elevation, is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
   D.   All new and substantially improved structures:
      (1)   Fully enclosed areas below the "lowest floor" (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be

180 consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy the
requirements of section
171.05(1)(E) of this Ordinance regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-
built homes.
   M.   Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be buried in the streambed
and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due to
channel degradation and meandering.
   N.   Maximum Damage Potential Development - All new or substantially
improved maximum damage potential development shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the elevation of
the 500-year flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be
floodproofed to such a level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional
engineer registered in the State of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing
methods used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities,
impact, and uplift forces, and other factors associated with the 0.2% annual
chance flood; and that the structure, below the 0.2% annual chance flood
elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water. A record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in
relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator. Where 0.2% chance flood
elevation data has not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The
applicant will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources
with sufficient technical information to make such determinations.
2.   Special Floodway Provisions. In addition to the General Floodplain
Standards, development within the floodway must meet the following applicable
standards. The floodway is that portion of the floodplain which must be
protected from developmental encroachment to allow the free flow of flood
waters. Where floodway data has been provided in the Flood Insurance Study,
such data shall be used to define the floodway. Where no floodway data has been
provided, the Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to provide a
floodway delineation. The applicant will be responsible for providing the
Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make
such determination.
   A.   No development shall be permitted in the floodway that would result in
any increase in the base flood elevation. Consideration of the effects of any
development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption that an equal
degree of development would be allowed for similarly situated lands.
   B.   All development within the floodway shall:
      (1)   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
      (2)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
      (3)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
   C.   No development shall affect the capacity or conveyance of the channel
or floodway of any tributary to the mainstream, drainage ditch, or any other
drainage facility or system.
   D.   Structures, buildings, recreational vehicles, and sanitary and utility
systems, if permitted, shall meet the applicable General Floodplain standards,
and shall be constructed or aligned to present the minimum possible resistance
to flood flows.
   E.   Structures, if permitted, shall have a low flood damage potential and
shall not be for human habitation.
   F.   Storage of materials or equipment that are buoyant, flammable,
explosive, or injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. Storage
of other materials may be allowed if readily removable from the floodway within
the time available after flood warning.
   G.   Watercourse alterations or relocations (channel changes and
modifications) must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within
the altered or relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations
must be approved by Department of Natural Resources.
   H.   Any fill allowed in the floodway must be shown to have some beneficial
purpose and shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary.
   I.   Pipeline river or stream crossings shall be buried in the streambed and
banks or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due to channel
degradation and meandering or due to the action of flood flows.
171.06   VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
1.   The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in specific cases such
variances from the terms of this Ordinance that will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this Ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances
granted must meet the following applicable standards.
   A.   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local code or ordinances.
   B.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
   C.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   D.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection
for structures than what is ordinarily required by this Ordinance, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and
(ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
   E.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
2.   Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board of Adjustment Shall be Based
- In passing upon applications for Variances, the Council shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this Ordinance and:
   A.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
   B.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other land or downstream to
the injury of others.
   C.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
   D.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
   E.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
City.
   F.   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
   G.   The availability of alternative locations is not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
   H.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
   I.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for the area.
   J.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles.
   K.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood water expected at the site.
   L.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
   M.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this Ordinance.
3.   Conditions Attached to Variances - Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this
Ordinance. Such conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
   A.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
   B.   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
   C.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
   D.   Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes, levees,
and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the Department of
Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative to achieving
the purpose of this Ordinance.
   E.   Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the flood
protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration, rate
of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated with
the regulatory flood. The Council shall require that the applicant submit a
plan or document certified by a Registered professional engineer that the
Floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
171.07   NONCONFORMING USES.
1.   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before
the passage or amendment of this Ordinance, but which is not in conformity with
the provisions of this Ordinance, may be continued subject to the following
conditions:
   A.   If such use is discontinued for six (6) consecutive months, any future
use of the building premises shall conform to this Ordinance.
   B.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
   C.   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than fifty
(50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred,
unless it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance.
This limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with
existing state or local health, sanitary, building, or safety codes or
regulations or the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National
Register of Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude
its continued designation.
2.   Except as provided in SECTION
171.05II(1)(B), any use which has been permitted as a Variance shall be
considered a conforming use.
171.08   PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
Violations of the provisions of this Ordinance or failure to comply with any of
the requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this
Ordinance or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction
thereof be fined not more than $500.00 (FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS) or imprisoned for
not more than 30 (THIRTY) days. Nothing herein contained prevents the City of
Hudson from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy violation.
171.09   AMENDMENT.
The regulations and standards set forth in this Ordinance may from time to time
be amended, supplemented, changed, or repealed. No amendment, supplement,
change, or modification shall be undertaken without prior approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
