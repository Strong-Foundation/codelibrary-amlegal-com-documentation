individuals with cardiovascular disease and individuals with impaired
respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructed airway
disease.

danger to health and a material public nuisance.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â As a result, the Clear Lake City Council has adopted the foregoing as
justification for this Section with the purpose of protecting the public health
and welfare by prohibiting smoking in certain public places, which are more
specifically defined below, to guarantee the right of non-smokers to breathe
smoke-free air and to recognize the public's need to breath smoke-free air as a
priority over an individual's desire to smoke.

system of the City.
3.Â Â Â A City-approved backflow preventer must be installed after the irrigation
meter to protect against contamination of the water system.
4.Â Â Â The irrigation meter must be installed horizontal to the floor with the
arrow of the meter being in the direction of the flow of water to the outside.
5.Â Â Â No underground irrigation systems are allowed in the public right-of-way.
The City will furnish the meter and the meter must be installed by a licensed
plumber.Â  The full cost of the meter and a one hundred dollar ($100.00) deposit
shall be paid by the customer or property owner prior to the installation of
the meter.Â  Sewer service charges shall not apply to the water measure by the
irrigation meter.
91.11Â  WATER FOR CONSTRUCTION USE.
Water for building construction purposes shall be furnished by meter
measurement only after suitable deposit has been made (the minimum deposit
being $10.00 and the amount to be determined by the City, depending upon the
size of the construction work contemplated.)Â  All water for building or
construction purposes must pass through one and the same meter.
91.12Â  MULTI-FAMILY DWELLINGS.
Each individual dwelling unit in any multi-family dwelling constructed after
the effective date of the 2003 Code of Ordinances shall be served by a separate
water meter.Â  All meters in the multi-family dwelling shall be installed in a
meter bank and each individual dwelling unit must have a separate shutoff
valve.
91.13Â  METER TESTING.
The City shall have access to all water meters at any reasonable time for the
purpose of inspecting or testing a meter.Â  The City shall test the meter of any
customer upon written request submitted to the Superintendent.Â  If the meter is
found not to be over two percent (2%) fast, the customer shall pay a testing
charge of twenty dollars ($20.00) which, if not paid at the time of testing,
shall be charged to the customerâs utility bill.Â  If the meter is found to be
more than two percent (2%) fast the City shall test and adjust the meter at no
charge to the customer.
91.14Â  METER READINGS.
1.Â Â Â If a meter cannot be read for three consecutive months as a result of the
meter reader not being able to gain entrance to the premises, and if the
customer fails to read the meter and deliver the information to the Clerk,
water service to the premises shall be discontinued.
2.Â Â Â If there is a variance in the readings on the water meter and the remote
reader, the reading on the water meter shall be considered to be correct for
billing purposes.

fifty percent (150%) of the rates provided in Section 92.02.Â  No such customer,
however, will be served unless the customer shall have signed a service
contract agreeing to be bound by the ordinances, rules and regulations applying
to water service established by the Council.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.4 & 384.84)

due shall be added to each delinquent bill.
92.05Â  SERVICE DISCONTINUED.
Water service to delinquent customers shall be discontinued in accordance with
the following:
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
1.Â Â Â Notice.Â  The Utility Billing Clerk shall notify each delinquent customer
that service will be discontinued if payment of the combined service account,
including late payment charges, is not received by the date specified in the
notice of delinquency.Â  Such notice shall be sent by ordinary mail and shall
inform the customer of the nature of the delinquency and afford the customer
the opportunity for a hearing prior to the discontinuance.
2.Â Â Â Notice to Landlords.Â  If the customer is a tenant, and if the owner or
landlord of the property has made a written request for notice, the notice of
delinquency shall also be given to the owner or landlord.
3.Â Â Â Hearing.Â  If a hearing is requested by noon of the day preceding the shut
off the City Administrator shall conduct an informal hearing and shall make a
determination as to whether the disconnection is justified.Â  The customer has
the right to appeal the Administratorâs decision to the Council, and if the
Council finds that disconnection is justified, then such disconnection shall be
made, unless payment has been received.
4.Â Â Â Fees.Â  A fee of twenty dollars ($20.00) during normal business hours and
thirty-five ($35.00) after normal business hours shall be charged before
service is restored to a delinquent customer.Â  No fee shall be charged for the

92.06Â  LIEN FOR NONPAYMENT.
The owner of the premises served and any lessee or tenant thereof shall be
jointly and severally liable for water service charges to the premises.Â  Water
service charges remaining unpaid and delinquent shall constitute a lien upon
the premises served and shall be certified by the Clerk to the County Treasurer
for collection in the same manner as property taxes.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
92.07Â  LIEN EXEMPTION.
The lien for nonpayment shall not apply to a residential rental property where
water service is separately metered and the rates or charges for the water
service are paid directly to the City by the tenant, if the landlord gives
written notice to the City that the property is residential rental property and
that the tenant is liable for the rates or charges.Â  The City may require a
deposit not exceeding the usual cost of ninety (90) days of water service be
paid to the City.Â  The landlordâs written notice shall contain the name of the
tenant responsible for charges, the address of the rental property and the date
of occupancy.Â  A change in tenant shall require a new written notice to be
given to the City within ten (10) business days of the change in tenant.Â  When
the tenant moves from the rental property, the City shall refund the deposit if
the water service charges are paid in full.Â  A change in the ownership of the
residential rental property shall require written notice of such change to be
given to the City within ten (10) business days of the completion of the change
of ownership.Â  The lien exemption does not apply to delinquent charges for
repairs to a water service.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
92.08Â  LIEN NOTICE.
A lien for delinquent water service charges shall not be certified to the
County Treasurer unless prior written notice of intent to certify a lien is
given to the customer.Â  If the customer is a tenant and if the owner or
landlord of the property has made a written request for notice, the notice
shall also be given to the owner or landlord.Â  The notice shall be sent to the
appropriate persons by ordinary mail not less than thirty (30) days prior to
certification of the lien to the County Treasurer.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
92.09Â  CUSTOMER DEPOSITS.
There shall be required from every customer not the owner of the premises
served a deposit in an amount equal to three times the minimum monthly charge
intended to guarantee the payment of bills for service.Â  A homeowner who
receives two (2) consecutive disconnect notices shall pay a deposit in an
amount equal to three times the minimum monthly charge.Â  A homeowner's deposit
may be refunded following twelve months of consecutive timely payments.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
92.10Â  TEMPORARY VACANCY.
A property owner may request water service be temporarily discontinued and shut
off at the curb valve when the property is expected to be vacant for an
extended period of time.Â  There shall be a twenty dollar ($20.00) fee collected
for shutting the water off at the curb valve and a twenty dollar ($20.00) fee
for restoring service.Â  During a period when service is temporarily
discontinued as provided herein there shall be no minimum service charge
provided that the property owner has a licensed plumber remove the water meter
and return it to the water plant.Â  The City will not drain pipes or pull meters
for temporary vacancies.

Â 
1Â Â Â Deep and shallow wells, as defined in IAC 567-40.2(455B): A deep well is a
well located and constructed in such a manner that there is a continuous layer
of low permeability soil or rock at least five3 feet thick located at least 25
feet below the normal ground surface and above the aquifer from which water is
to be drawn.Â  A shallow well is a well located and constructed in such a manner
that there is not a continuous layer of low permeability soil or rock (or
equivalent retarding mechanism acceptable to the department) at least five feet
thick, the top of which is located at least 25 feet below the normal ground
surface and above the aquifer from which water is to be drawn.
2Â Â Â The separation distances are dependent upon two factors: the type of piping
that is in the existing sewer or drain, as noted in the table, and that the
piping was properly installed in accordance with the standards.
3Â Â Â Solid wastes are those derived from the treatment of water or wastewater.
Certain types of solid wastes from water treatment processes may be
landâapplied within the separation distance on an individual, case-by-case
basis.
4Â Â Â Solid waste means garbage, refuse, rubbish, and other similar discarded
solid or semisolid materials, including but not limited to such materials
resulting from industrial, commercial, agricultural, and domestic activities

Charge
Â 
100.01Â  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish the Storm Water Utility, authorize
charges, rates and fees for use of, and discharge to, the public storm and
surface water drainage system, to provide a process for appeals from certain
decisions of the Council relating to such charges, and to provide for
collection of delinquent charges.Â  The Council finds that the construction,
operation and maintenance of the Cityâs storm water system should, in part, be
funded through user charges imposed for the discharge of storm and surface
water to the storm water drainage system, thereby charging those persons and
activities using or receiving service from that system.Â  The City may be
required to provide increased quantity or quality controls to mitigate those
impacts of pollutants from discharging storm and surface waters into the storm
water system.Â  Therefore, it is appropriate to impose a storm and surface water
user charge upon all users of property which may discharge, directly or
indirectly, into the storm water system.
100.02Â  DEFINITIONS.
The following words shall have the following definitions when used in this
chapter, and any resolution and order adopted pursuant hereto, unless the

1.Â Â Â âConnectionâ means the physical act or process of directing or allowing
the flow of storm and surface waters to the storm sewer or drainage line, or
joining onto an existing side sewer, for the purpose of connecting private
impervious surface or other storm and surface water sources or systems to the
public storm and surface water system.Â  It also includes creation or
maintenance of impervious surface that causes or is likely to cause an increase
in the quantity or decrease in quality or both from the natural state of storm
water runoff, and which drains, directly or indirectly, to the storm and
surface water system.
2.Â Â Â âDate of impositionâ or âimposition dateâ means the first day of each
month or such other date designated by the Council at which time a charge is
imposed and becomes the legal obligation of the user.Â  The obligation may
include the cost of services to be provided during the billing period or for
services previously provided to the same person under this chapter.
3.Â Â Â âDaysâ means calendar days unless otherwise specified.
4.Â Â Â âEquivalent service unitâ or âESUâ means a measurement unit based on the
impervious surface area of an average improved single family dwelling lot or

deemed to be 3,000 square feet of impervious surface.
5.Â Â Â âImpervious surface areaâ means all land area that has been altered from
its natural state such that it does not allow the infiltration and retention of
water equivalent to that of undisturbed soil.Â  This includes, but is not
limited to:Â  pavement, buildings, decks, parking areas, and compacted gravel
areas.Â  âImpervious surfaceâ does not include improved streets, roads, and
sidewalks within the public right-of-way; bike paths; railroad beds or quarry
excavation areas and temporary service roads in the excavation areas.Â  Rather
such facilities are deemed to be a part of the public surface water drainage
conveyance system or to constitute non-impervious surfaces.

building that accommodates more than one (1) residential living unit and in
which each residential living unit has a separate water meter.
7.Â Â Â âOccupantâ means the person residing or doing business on the property.Â 
In a family or household situation, the occupants responsible for the
obligation herein imposed are the adult heads of the household, jointly and
severally.Â  In a dwelling or office sharing situation, the adult occupant
legally responsible for the management or condition of the property shall be
responsible.
8.Â Â Â âOther developed userâ means any parcel, lot or property other than a
single family dwelling unit or a multi-family dwelling unit.
9.Â Â Â âOwnerâ means the legal owner(s) of records as shown on the tax rolls of
Cerro Gordo County, or where there is a recorded land sale contract, the
purchaser thereunder.
10.Â Â Â âPersonâ means any individual, public or private corporation, political
subdivision, governmental agency, municipality, partnership, association, firm,
trust, or any other legal entity whatsoever.

family dwelling or a duplex with a single water meter exists at any time as the
imposition of the charge.
13.Â Â Â âStorm and surface water drainage systemâ means any combination of
publicly owned storm and surface water quantity and quality facilities, pumping
or lift facilities, storm and secondary drain pipes and culverts, open
channels, creeks, ditches and rivers, force mains, laterals, manholes, catch
basins and inlets, including the grates and covers thereof, detention and
retention facilities, laboratory facilities and equipment, and any other
publicly owned facilities for the collection, conveyance, treatment and

management.Â  The occupant of occupied property is deemed the user.Â  If the
property is not occupied, the person who has the right to occupy it shall be
deemed the user.
100.03Â  STORM WATER UTILITY ESTABLISHED.
Pursuant to the authority of Section 384.84 of the Code of Iowa, as amended,
the Council hereby establishes a storm water utility in the City.Â  The entire
City, as increased from time to time, shall constitute a single storm and
surface water drainage system district.Â  The provisions of this chapter shall
become effective on July 1, 2003.
100.04Â  CHARGES AND FEES.
The Council may establish charges, rates, and fees for the use of the Cityâs
storm and surface water system, and for services provided by the City relating
to that system, which may include delinquency and interest charges and
penalties.Â  Such charges and fees shall be just and equitable based upon the
actual costs of operation, maintenance, acquisition, extension and replacement
of the Cityâs system, the costs of bond repayment, regulation, administration,
and services of the City.Â  Except as specifically provided in this chapter or
by resolution and order, all charges and service fees shall be due and payable
in advance of provision of service.Â  All billing procedures shall be the same
as for water usage and may be billed on the same bill as part of a combined
service account.
1.Â Â Â Service Charge.Â  Each customer shall pay for public storm water drainage
$1.50 per month per equivalent service unit.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Effective July 1, 2008, and on each successive July 1 thereafter, the
monthly billing per equivalent service unit for public storm water drainage
shall be increased automatically by three percent (3%) or an amount equal to
the twelve month percent change to the increase in the Consumer Price Index-All
Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the preceding month of March, whichever is the
lesser amount.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Effective January 1, 2009, the monthly billing per equivalent service
unit for public storm water drainage shall increase by twenty-five cents
($0.25).
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Effective January 1, 2010, the monthly billing per equivalent service
unit for public storm water drainage shall increase by twenty-five cents
($0.25).
2.Â Â Â The City may from time to time amend this chapter to change the amount of
rates to be charged for the storm water drainage system.
100.05Â  STORM WATER UTILITY USER CHARGE.
1.Â Â Â There is hereby established a storm water utility system user charge.Â 
This charge hereby is imposed on every user within the City of the storm and
surface water drainage system on the imposition date.Â  The charge may be
required to be paid in advance of the provision of service for the billing
period.Â  The charge due for the billing period shall be the obligation of the
user of the public storm system on the imposition date, notwithstanding whether
the user is the addressee of the bill.
2.Â Â Â The charge shall be the personal obligation of the user on the imposition
date, regardless of whether that person has any ownership interest in the
property.Â  This charge shall constitute a debt due the City as of the date of
imposition.
3.Â Â Â Any person who has paid the full amount due in advance of receiving
service shall be entitled to a refund if the person ceases to be the user.Â  The
refund shall be effective on the date the property is vacated or sold and based
on the number of days remaining in the billing period.Â  The refund is waived
unless a written request for refund is filed within thirty (30) days of
vacating or selling the property.Â  The request shall include documentation
reasonably deemed adequate by the City.Â  Notwithstanding any other provision,
the new user shall be responsible for the remaining balance of the service
charge, which may be billed immediately or added to the bill for the next
period.
4.Â Â Â There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the owner of the real
property, as shown in the records of the County Assessor, is the occupant.
5.Â Â Â The storm water utility user charge shall be imposed upon any person who
uses or discharges to the public storm and surface water drainage system by:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Maintaining impervious surface connected to (directly or indirectly)
and capable of discharge to the public surface water management systems; or
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Actually discharging storm or surface water into the system; or
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Making a specific request for storm and surface water management
service.
Said charge shall be charged for all users of properties within the boundaries
of the City.Â  A property, whether unimproved or containing impervious surface,
is presumed to discharge storm water to the storm and surface water drainage
system, and to generate a demand for storm and surface water drainage services.
100.06Â  CALCULATION OF EQUIVALENT SERVICE UNITS AND AMOUNT OF CHARGE.
This section shall be used to determine the number of equivalent service units
(ESUs) for a property for purposes of determining the amount of the storm water
utility (SWU) service charges.
1.Â Â Â Single family residential dwelling units and multi-family residential
dwelling units shall be charged at a rate of one (1) ESU per water meter.
2.Â Â Â Other developed users shall be charged at a rate of two (2) ESUs per water
meter.
3.Â Â Â Any agricultural use of land or other user that does not have a water
account with the City shall be considered exempt from the storm water utility
(SWU) service charges.
100.07Â  ADJUSTMENT OF ESU DETERMINATION.
1.Â Â Â Any Other Developed User with an impervious surface area equal to or less
than the impervious area for an ESU may request an adjustment of the storm
water utility service charge to one ESU.
2.Â Â Â The request for adjustment from two (2) ESUs to one (1) ESU shall be
submitted to the City in writing on forms provided by the City requesting an
adjustment of the applicable number of ESUs.
3.Â Â Â The request for adjustment shall be submitted within ninety (90) days of
receipt of the first billing of the storm water utility service charge to that
user.
4.Â Â Â Any request for adjustment shall include sufficient documentation to allow
the City to determine from the documentation provided the impervious surface
area.
5.Â Â Â Within twenty (20) days after receipt of the request for adjustment, the
City shall review the adjustment.Â  If the City determines the impervious area
is less than the area of an ESU, the parcel shall be classified as subject to
the charge of one (1) ESU.Â  The City shall adjust for any previous payments
greater than one (1) ESU.Â  If the City determines there is insufficient
information to complete the evaluation, the City shall notify the applicant and
request additional information.Â  If the City determines the impervious area is
greater than the impervious area of an ESU, the City shall notify the applicant
the request for the adjustment is denied.
6.Â Â Â If the City requests additional information, the applicant shall submit
additional information within twenty (20) days after the determination by the
City.Â  If additional information is not submitted within twenty (20) days, the
request for the adjustment shall be considered to have been withdrawn.
100.08Â  BILLING.
1.Â Â Â The City shall send a bill for the amount due by regular mail to every
user in the City.Â  Mailing to the user of record as shown in the City water
billing records shall satisfy this requirement.Â  The billing period shall be
the same as for water usage.
2.Â Â Â The recipient has twenty (20) days from the billing date to file a notice
of non-occupancy.Â  The notice shall indicate the relationship of the recipient
to the property (e.g. owner, lessor, mortgagee), whether on the imposition date
the property was occupied, and if so, by whom.
3.Â Â Â Upon receipt of the notice, the City shall determine who is obligated for
payment.Â  Based on this determination, the City shall:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Issue a new bill to the occupant if the property was occupied by
someone other than the original recipient;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Reissue the bill to the recipient if it is found that that person was
the occupant;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Issue a bill to the owner as the user, if the property was not
occupied.
The City may take into account any reasonably reliable information available to
it, including utility records.
4.Â Â Â Failure to file the notice so that it is actually received by the City
within the twenty (20) days of the mailing date of the bill shall conclusively
establish that the original addressee was the user on the imposition date.
5.Â Â Â Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any person may agree
in writing to be responsible for payment of the charge.Â  Upon filing of such a
writing with the City, subsequent bills shall be sent to that person, and that
person shall be deemed to be the user.
6.Â Â Â It is a violation of this chapter to knowingly provide false information
to the City regarding any fact related to billing of a storm water utility
service charge or other charge of the City.
100.09Â  DELINQUENCY, COLLECTION, INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
1.Â Â Â Charges imposed under this chapter are deemed delinquent when not paid in
full by the due date provided in a billing for the charge.
2.Â Â Â It is unlawful and a violation of this chapter for any person to discharge
wastewater into the Cityâs storm water utility system.Â  It is also unlawful and
a violation of this chapter to maintain a connection to or use the Cityâs storm
water utility system without paying the appropriate charges and fees
established in this chapter or any rule adopted pursuant hereto.Â  Even if no
billing is received, such charges shall be due and owning and the user is
obligated to pay any charges in a timely fashion.
3.Â Â Â Delinquent charges may be collected pursuant to the same procedure as with
delinquent water bills by the City, with the assistance of City legal counsel,
without further action or authorization by the Council.
4.Â Â Â Delinquent charges may be recovered by the City in the same manner as
provided in Chapter 92.
5.Â Â Â In addition to remedies provided for collection of a debt, the City may
seek a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting continued occupancy of
premises, requiring disconnection of the premises from the public storm water
utility system, and termination of water and sewer service to the userâs
premises.
6.Â Â Â The Council may prescribe, by resolution and order, a schedule of interest
and penalty charges to be imposed upon delinquent charges.
7.Â Â Â In a collection action under this chapter, the City shall be entitled to
its costs and reasonable attorney fees, including at trial and on appeal, if it
is the prevailing party.
8.Â Â Â In addition to the right of the City to bring a civil action to collect
any delinquent charges or enforce any provision of the chapter, the City may
take any of the following actions to secure payment:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The City may refuse to issue any permit to any person who is delinquent
in any payment due under this chapter.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The City may terminate provision of storm and surface water service to
premises used by the user.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The City may terminate sanitary sewer service to premises used by the
user.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The City may terminate water service to the premises used by the user.
Termination of service pursuant to this subsection shall be according to
procedures adopted under Section 100.10.Â  If the City terminates service as
provided in this subsection, the cost of such disconnection shall be added to
the amount of any other delinquent charges and shall be recoverable in the same
manner as are such charges.
9.Â Â Â The owner and the tenant must comply with the same procedures as set out
in Section 92.06.Â  All obligations of the owner and tenant shall be the same as
stated in Section 92.07.
10.Â Â Â Where a lien against the property can be imposed when the owner is
liable, it shall exist from the date the bill was last brought current in the
same manner as with a lien for water service.Â  The provisions of Section 92.08
shall apply to delinquent storm water utility bills.
100.10Â  REQUEST FOR SERVICE; DISCONNECTION FROM SERVICE; USE RECLASSIFICATION;
TERMINATION OF USER CHARGES.
1.Â Â Â The opening of a water billing account shall be deemed to be a specific
request for provision of storm and surface water service to that property.
2.Â Â Â Any user of the public storm water utility system may disconnect property
served by the system from service and terminate further user charges by
terminating an active water billing account to the property.
3.Â Â Â Any user of the public storm water utility may remove all or part of the
impervious surface on the property served by the system and apply for use
reclassification by utilizing the procedure in this section.Â  Removal of
impervious surface shall entitle the user to submit a request for an
administrative adjustment within sixty (60) days after removal of the
impervious surface.
4.Â Â Â If at any time an impervious surface is added to a property, the City
shall consider such an addition as a reconnection to the storm water utility
and as a specific request for storm water utility service.
100.11Â  ADOPTION OF RULES; INTERPRETATIONS AND APPEALS.
1.Â Â Â Adoption of Rules.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The Council may, by resolution and order, promulgate rules pertaining
to matters within the scope of this chapter.

hearing.Â  Not less than four (4) or more than twenty (20) days before such
hearing, public notice of such hearing shall be given by publication in a
newspaper of general circulation within the City.Â  Such notice shall include

modification is made.Â  All rules shall be effective upon adoption by the
Council and shall be filed in the office of the City.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Notwithstanding paragraphs B and C of this subsection, a rule maybe

interest of the affected parties, including the specified reasons for such
prejudice.

Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A determination that the person is obligated to pay the service charge
imposed herein.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A dispute as to the proper calculation of the amount due from the
person.Â  This does not include, however, an objection to the overall
establishment of the storm water utility charge or the amount per ESU
established by the Council or the establishment of classes of impervious
surface area.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â A discretionary decision implementing a rule adopted by the Council if
an appeal is provided in the Order adopting the rule.
3.Â Â Â The appeal shall be filed in writing and must be actually received by the

such topics be added to the agenda of its meeting.
4.Â Â Â During a review or evaluation by the City, the Grantee shall fully
cooperate with the City and shall provide such non-confidential information and
documents as the City may need to reasonably perform the review.
5.Â Â Â As a result of the review, the City or Grantee may determine that a change
in the terms of the franchise may be required, that the cable system or
franchise requirements should be updated, changed, revised or that additional
services should be provided.Â  If the change is consistent with the terms of
this chapter and implementation of the change would not unreasonably add to the
cost of providing cable services, Grantee and the City will, in good faith,
negotiate the terms of the change and any required amendment to this chapter.
6.Â Â Â Should the City or the Grantee allege that the other is not negotiating in
good faith, then the matter will be submitted to the Council for review.Â  The
Council will afford adequate notice of a hearing in order that both sides are
given an opportunity to be heard.Â  After hearing the facts, the Council will
recommend appropriate measures in an effort to resolve the dispute and thereby
resume discussions.Â  The Council shall limit its decision to the issue of good
faith.
7.Â Â Â Any determination by the Council shall be subject to a de novo review by a
court of competent jurisdiction.

110.26Â  CONDITIONS OF SALE.
If a renewal or extension of the Granteeâs franchise is denied or the franchise
is lawfully terminated, and the City either lawfully acquires ownership of the
system or by its actions lawfully effects a transfer of ownership of the system
to another party, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at the price
determined pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 627 of the Cable
Act.Â  The Grantee and the City agree that in the case of a final determination
of a lawful revocation of the franchise, at the Granteeâs request, which shall
be made in its sole discretion, the Grantee shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to effectuate a transfer of its system to a qualified third party.Â 
The City further agrees that during such a period of time, it shall authorize
the Grantee to continue to operate pursuant to the terms of its prior
franchise; however, in no event shall such authorization exceed a period of
time greater than six (6) months from the effective date of such revocation.Â 
If, at the end of that time, the Grantee is unsuccessful in procuring a
qualified transferee or assignee of its system which is reasonably acceptable
to the City, the Grantee and the City may avail themselves of any rights they
may have pursuant to Federal or State law, it being further agreed that the
Granteeâs continued operation of its system during the six-month period shall
not be deemed to be a waiver, or an extinguishment, of any rights of either the
City or the Grantee.
110.27Â  TRANSFER OF FRANCHISE.
The Granteeâs right, title or interest in the franchise shall not be sold,
transferred, assigned or otherwise encumbered, other than to an entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Grantee, without
the prior consent of the City, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.Â 
No such consent shall be required, however, for a transfer in trust, by
mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title or
interest of the Grantee in the franchise or system in order to secure
indebtedness.Â  Within thirty (30) days of receiving the request for transfer,
the City shall, in accordance with FCC rules and regulations, notify the
Grantee in writing of the information it requires to determine the legal,
financial and technical qualifications of the transferee.Â  If the City has not
taken action on the Granteeâs request for transfer within one hundred twenty
(120) days after receiving such request, consent by the City shall be deemed
given.
110.28Â  PURCHASE BY CITY.
Subject to applicable Federal, State and local law, at the expiration of this
franchise, the City may, in lawful manner and upon the payment in readily
available funds of fair market value, determined on the basis of the system
valued as a going concern, purchase the system.Â  Subject to applicable Federal,
State and local law, upon the lawful revocation of the franchise, the City may,
in lawful manner and upon the payment in readily available funds of an
equitable price, purchase the system.
110.29Â  NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
In the event that the City believes that the Grantee has not complied with the
terms of the franchise, it shall notify Grantee in writing of the exact nature
of the alleged noncompliance.
110.30Â  GRANTEEâS RIGHT TO CURE OR RESPOND.
Grantee shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of the notice described in
Section 110.29:Â  (a) to respond to the City contesting the assertion of
noncompliance or (b) to cure such default; or (c) in the event that, by the
nature of default, such default cannot be cured within the thirty-day period,
initiate reasonable steps to remedy such default and notify the City of the
steps being taken and the projected date that they will be completed.
110.31Â  PUBLIC HEARING.
In the event that Grantee fails to respond to the notice described in Section
110.29 pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 110.30, or in the event
that the alleged default is not remedied within sixty (60) days after the
Grantee is notified of the alleged default, the City shall schedule a public
meeting to investigate the default.Â  Such public meeting shall be held at the
next regularly scheduled meeting of the City which is scheduled at a time which
is no less than five business days therefrom. The City shall notify the Grantee
of the time and place of such meeting and provide the Grantee with an
opportunity to be heard.
110.32Â  ENFORCEMENT.
Subject to applicable Federal and State law, in the event the City, after such
meeting, determines that Grantee is in default of any provision of the
franchise, the City may:
1.Â Â Â Foreclose on all or any part of any security provided under the franchise,
if any, including without limitation, any bonds or other surety; provided,
however, the foreclosure shall only be in such a manner and in such amount as
the City reasonably determines is necessary to remedy the default;
2.Â Â Â Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other equitable
relief;
3.Â Â Â In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the
franchise, declare the franchise agreement to be revoked; or
4.Â Â Â Seek specific performance of any provision which reasonably lends itself
to such remedy, as an alternative to damages.
5.Â Â Â In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of this
chapter, and after giving the Grantee ninety (90) daysâ notice and opportunity
to cure, assess a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day until the
substantial default is cured.
6.Â Â Â Any final action by the City adverse to Granteeâs interest and disputed by
Grantee, shall be reviewable by court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to
State and Federal law.
110.33Â  IMPOSSIBILITY OF PERFORMANCE.
The Grantee shall not be held in default or noncompliance with the provisions
of the franchise or suffer any enforcement or penalty relating thereto where
such noncompliance or alleged defaults are caused by strikes, acts of God,
power outages, or other events reasonably beyond its ability to control.
110.34Â  SYSTEM BUILD OUT.
The system shall be in place and in full operation within twelve (12) months
after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the failure
of which is a major breach of this chapter and shall be sufficient cause for
its timely repeal by the City, with notice to the company.

Section 364.2 of the Code of Iowa.
111.02Â  COMPANY FACILITIES.
The Company shall install, maintain, repair, renovate, and replace its
facilities with due diligence in a good and workmanlike manner, and the poles,
wires and appliances shall be placed and maintained so as not to unnecessarily
interfere with the travel on said streets, alleys, and public places in said
City. Specifically, Company facilities shall not interfere with City water,
sanitary sewer, storm sewer or any other municipal facilities or other City
public uses of the City rights-of-way. The Company shall construct and maintain
its facilities in such a way as to minimize interference with existing and
proposed public works improvements. The Company shall make best efforts to
coordinate its activities with the activities and facilities of other
franchised or permitted users of the rights-of-way and utility easements.
111.03Â  INDEMNIFICATION.
The Company shall indemnify, defend, and hold the City harmless from and
against all liability or damage and all claims or demands arising out of the
Company's acts or omissions related to its operations within the City pursuant

a reasonable period of time of the pendency of any claim or action against the
City arising out of the exercise by the Company of its franchise rights. The
Company shall be permitted, at its own expense, to appear and defend or to
assist in defense of such claim.
111.04Â  EXCAVATIONS.
In making any excavations in any street, alley, avenue or public place,
Company, its successors and assigns, shall perform such activities in a manner
that minimizes inconvenience to the public, and shall protect the site while
work is in progress by guards, barriers or signals, shall not unnecessarily
obstruct the use of the streets, and shall back fill all openings in such
manner as to prevent settling or depressions in surface, pavement or sidewalk
of such excavations with same materials. The purpose of these requirements is
to ensure that the area excavated is returned to substantially the same
condition as it was prior to the excavation, and at no cost to the City.
111.05Â  CITY USE OF POLES.

take reasonable action to abate said hazard; provided, however, that the

facilities, the City shall give notice to the Company of the damage and allow

street or alley or any public improvement of, in or about any such street or
alley or reasonably promoting the efficient operation of any such improvement.Â 
If the City orders or requests the Company to relocate its existing facilities
or equipment for the primary benefit of a commercial or private project, or as
the result of the initial request of a commercial or private developer or other
non-public entity, the Company shall receive payment for the cost of such
relocation as a precondition to relocating its existing facilities or
equipment. The City shall consider reasonable alternatives in designing its
public works projects so as not arbitrarily to cause the Company unreasonable
additional expense in exercising its authority under this section. The City
shall also provide a reasonable alternative location for the Company's
facilities. The City shall give the Company reasonable advance written notice

maintenance of its electric facilities. Trimming shall be performed by a
licensed tree care expert in accordance with the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI).
111.13Â  NONEXCLUSIVE FRANCHISE.
The franchise granted by this ordinance shall not be exclusive.Â  The Company
shall not transfer or assign any rights under this franchise to an unaffiliated
third party, except by merger with such third party, or, except when the
transfer is made in response to legislation, regulatory orders or approvals,
unless the City shall approve in writing such transfer or assignment. Approval
of the transfer or assignment shall not be unreasonably withheld.
111.14Â  CONTINUOUS SERVICE.
Service to be rendered by the Company under this franchise shall he continuous
unless prevented from doing so by fire, Acts of God, unavoidable accidents or
casualties, or reasonable interruptions necessary to properly service the
Company's equipment, and in such event service shall be resumed as quickly as
is reasonably possible. In the event that Company's facilities are partially or
wholly destroyed or incapacitated, the Company shall use due diligence to
restore its system to satisfactory service within the shortest practicable
time. The Company shall provide to the City a telephone number whereby the City
will be able to obtain status reports from the Company on a twenty-four (24)
hour basis concerning interruptions of the supply of electricity in any portion

When requested by the City, a developer or customer, the Company shall support
the design and use of underground cables and facilities in new subdivisions;
provided that such underground design does not place undue economic or other
hardship on the developer, customer, or City and the sharing of the
differential costs of underground versus overhead distribution is agreeable to
both the Company or other party seeking service.

to accommodate City's franchise fee and shall only apply when a franchise fee
is being collected pursuant to this section.
4.Â Â Â City agrees that Company's obligations related to the franchise fee are
limited to those obligations set forth in subsections 1, 2 and 7 herein.Â  City
further agrees to bear all costs (including attorney fees), and to defend,
indemnify and hold Company harmless from any and all liability, claims or
causes of action associated with disputes related to the billing and/or

annexation, or changes in the limits of said City, the City Clerk shall provide

such street or alley or reasonably promoting the efficient operation of any
such improvement.Â  If the City orders or requests the Company to relocate its

public disclosure by state or federal law on other grounds and agrees to retain

abutting on the street or alley reasonable access to their property.

of Iowa.

other form of surface drainage, and no foundation drainage or sump pump shall
be connected or discharged into any wastewater collection system.
2.Â Â Â Any new or existing construction in which a sump and pump have been or
will be installed shall be required to install, inside the structure, a rigid

following the opportunity for a hearing before the City Council.
152.04Â  INSPECTIONS.
Property owners shall allow a City employee or a designated representative,
satisfactory to the City, such as a licensed plumber, to inspect the buildings
to confirm and document that there is no sump pump or other prohibited
discharge into the wastewater collection system. The City may periodically re-
inspect any building or premises to determine compliance with the requirements
of this chapter. An inspection performed by other than a City employee will
require the completion and return of an inspection form provided by the City.

documentation regarding compliance with this chapter may lose their plumbing
license privileges in the City for a period of one (1) year, following the
opportunity for a hearing before the City Council.Â  When ownership of any home
or other building is transferred, the building must have a re-inspection

the owner, the City shall impose a surcharge in the amount provided by this
chapter. The time frame for making corrections may be extended upon the
approval of the City Administrator for up to 90 days for cause, beyond the

this chapter during periodic re-inspections shall be subjected to a surcharge

to determine compliance, shall within 30 days of the date that admittance to
the property is refused or denied, immediately become subject to a monthly
surcharge which shall be applied to the sanitary sewer component of their
utility bill.Â  This surcharge shall commence on the 1st day of the month
following the month when either the property owner or contractor/builder refuse
to allow the property under their control to be inspected by the City or to
otherwise validate compliance in accordance with this chapter to the City.Â 
This surcharge shall continue as long as no documentation satisfactory to the
City, to ascertain compliance with this chapter, has been provided to the
Building Official. This surcharge is intended to offset the added costs
associated with having to treat and collect clear water unnecessarily when the
status of a property's connection to the sanitary sewer system cannot be
ascertained.
2.Â Â Â A surcharge of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month is hereby imposed
on every sewer bill to property owners for the following conditions:

152.07Â  NUISANCE.
The City may require a property to connect it's sump pump discharge line to a
City storm sewer or drainage tile, if available, and if, in the determination
of the City it is necessary because the discharge from the sump pump is
creating a nuisance or hazardous situation.

Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall become liable
to the City for any expense, loss or damage occasioned the City by reason of
such violation. The City will also retain any and all civil remedies including,

be recommenced, a new permit or written approval to commence or proceed shall
first be obtained, and the fee therefor shall be one-half of the amount
required for the original permit or approval to commence or proceed with such
work, provided no changes have been made or will be made in the original plans
and specifications for such work, and provided further that such suspension or
abandonment has not exceeded one hundred eighty (180) days.
7.Â Â Â Exceptions.Â  In those cases where, in the considered judgment of the
Building Official, the holder of a permit or written approval to commence or
proceed with work regulated by this chapter is using the provisions of this
subsection to evade or delay compliance with the intent of a lawful notice and/
or order issued under this chapter, the Building Official may revoke such
permit or written approval and re-issue, reducing the time period allowed to
commence work to a minimum of five (5) days and the time period allowed for
suspension of work to a minimum of five (5) days.Â  The fee for such re-issued
permit or written approval shall be equal to that required for a new permit.
8.Â Â Â Suspension or Revocation.Â  The Building Official may, in writing, suspend

repaired, converted, or maintained, or any building, structure, or land is used
in violation of this chapter, the Council, in addition to other remedies, may
institute any appropriate action or proceedings to prevent such unlawful

165.01Â  PURPOSE.
This chapter is adopted for the purpose of promoting public health, safety,
comfort, order and general welfare; to conserve and protect the natural and
manmade environment, as well as the value of property throughout the City; to
encourage the most appropriate use of land; to secure and provide the social
and economic advantages resulting from an orderly, planned use of land
resources, and to facilitate adequate but economical provisions for public
improvements, such as, but not limited to, the provision of transportation,
water, sewage disposal, schools, parks and other public requirements; to lessen
congestion in the streets; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue
concentration of population; all in accordance with and as permitted by the
provisions of Chapter 414 of the State Code of Iowa.
165.02Â  GENERAL EFFECT.
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the use of premises and
structures in the City shall be in accordance with the minimum standards

165.17AÂ  LAKEFRONT MIXED-USE ZONE (LMU).
The LMU Zone is designed to implement the recommendations and re-development
concept strategies of the Clear Lake Lakefront Commercial Districts Special
Development Plan.Â  This plan focuses on commercial, recreational and open
space, and tourism opportunities in selected areas along Clear Lake lakefront.Â 
The zone is intended to promote a combination and variety of permitted or
conditionally permitted uses such as medium and high-density residential,
certain commercial uses, and water-oriented uses, utilizing "form-based"
standards to assure compatible development.Â  These regulations provide a
maximum building envelope and establish requirements for mixing uses on the
street level of multi-story buildings that take advantage of their special
provisions.Â  Because of the limited opportunities appropriate for mixed use
development around Clear Lake, these provisions allow building envelope and
bulk requirements different from those of surrounding properties.Â  District
objectives include retaining or improving views of the shoreline from the lake;
and encouraging and promoting a high-quality design.Â  District provisions are
intended to be consistent with the City's comprehensive plan and subsequent
amendments such as the Clear Lake Lakefront Commercial Districts Special
Development Plan.

requirement.Â  Indoor parking uses to support residential or non-residential
uses shall not be credited toward satisfaction of this requirement.
4.Â Â Â Planning and Zoning Commission Review and City Council Approval.Â  The
following "form-based" standards shall apply to all new buildings and
alterations to existing buildings, with exception of minor alterations that do
not add height to an existing building or increase the footprint of the
building by more than 500 square feet.Â  Each application for development within
an LMU Zone shall be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission with its
recommendation(s) being forwarded to the City Council for final approval, based
on the following criteria:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The scale and architectural quality of the project shall be appropriate
to its location along the lakefront.Â  Buildings may be larger or more massive
than their neighbors, but shall include elements and articulation that provide
lakefront scale and character.Â  These elements include, but are not limited to,
varied faÃ§ade planes, turrets, faÃ§ade details, gables, balconies, and window
treatments.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Building materials should be consistent with materials used
traditionally and currently along the lakefront.Â  FaÃ§ade materials may include
clapboard, cement or metal siding, shingles, brick, stone or cast stone, and
other high-quality materials.Â  Generally, metal and concrete masonry units
should be avoided as major faÃ§ade elements.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The building shall provide an active and varied lake faÃ§ade.Â  Site
planning should provide access and good lake exposure for residents and/or
customers.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Buildings shall provide attractive facades along fronting streets,
providing clear entrances and transparency to the adjacent street.Â  Non-
residential mixed uses shall have a distinct entrance to their principle
frontage streets.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The building should be appropriate to its context and its design should
reflect the unique or unusual qualities of its individual site and surrounding
environment.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Signage shall be consistent in scale with uses in the general area or
the overall theme of the building.Â 
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Principal building colors should consist of subtle, neutral or muted
colors with low reflectance, such as warm earth-toned colors.Â  Bright or
primary colors may be used only as accents occupying a maximum of 15% of the
building faÃ§ade.
In reviewing development proposals, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall
instruct the Building Official to prepare a written statement to be presented
to the City Council that summarizes the findings of the Commission for each of
the above criteria and any specific findings of fact that support its decision.
5.Â Â Â General Provisions.Â  All principal and accessory uses permitted within
this zone are subject to the requirements of the following sections of this
chapter:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Existing single-family and two-family dwellings anywhere in the LMU
Zone shall be considered permitted uses, rather than nonconforming uses.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All dwelling units shall be "owner-occupied".Â  The developer of any
residential condominium project shall submit a copy of the proposed covenants
and/or by-laws and condominium declarations of the proposed development as part
of the review process.Â  These documents shall, at a minimum, adequately provide
for the control and maintenance of all common areas, recreational facilities,

functions.Â  The Greenbelt also functions as one of the areaâs most significant
natural amenities which plays an important role in the ongoing development
within the City.Â  The prevention and mitigation of irreversible damage to this
resource and the preservation and enhancement of its natural, cultural and
historic values is in furtherance of the health, safety and general welfare of
the City of Clear Lake.

visual access to the Greenbelt or the publicâs view from the Greenbelt.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Encourage the development of a 100-foot vegetative buffer between the
creeksâ banks and new development.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Encourage the use of natural vegetation or other appropriate means of
erosion control that are in keeping with the intent of this zone.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Encourage the preservation of overstory vegetation for erosion control
and for aesthetic purposes.
3.Â Â Â Establishment of the Greenbelt Corridor Zone.Â  The OGC Zone, with its
attendant regulations, is hereby established as part of this chapter.Â  The OGC
Zone shall overlay all other zones established within the boundaries as
described in the following subsection.
4.Â Â Â OGC Zone Boundaries.Â  The OGC Zone shall apply to the Greenbelt corridor
which generally follows or is within the 100-year Flood Boundary.Â  The 100-year
Flood Boundary is delineated on the Cityâs official floodplain map (Flood
Insurance Study, August 4, 1987) on file in the office of the City Clerk and
shall be available for inspection and copying.

7.Â Â Â Special Provisions.Â  If an owner/developer of a residentially zoned
parcel, part of which is located in the OGC Zone, agrees to leave the portion
in the OGC Zone undeveloped, the owner/developer shall be allowed to develop
the remainder of the parcel according to OPD-H regulations, as specified in
Section 165.29 without applying for a change in zoning.Â 
165.29Â  PLANNED DEVELOPMENT HOUSING OVERLAY (OPD-H) ZONE.
The OPD-H Zone is established to permit flexibility in the use and design of
structures and land in situations where conventional development may be
inappropriate and where modifications of requirements of the underlying zone
will not be contrary to the intent and purpose of the Zoning Ordinance,
inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan or harmful to the neighborhood in
which they are located.
1.Â Â Â Intent.Â  The intent of the PDH regulations is to:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Provide flexibility in architectural design, placement and clustering
of buildings, use of open space, provision of circulation facilities and
parking, and related site and design considerations.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Encourage the preservation and best use of existing environmentally
sensitive areas and landscape features through development sensitive to the
natural features of the surrounding area.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Promote efficient land use with smaller networks of utilities and
streets.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Encourage and preserve opportunities for energy efficient development.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Promote an attractive and safe living environment which is compatible
with surrounding residential developments.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Provide an alternative method for redeveloping older residential areas
and to encourage infill development.
2.Â Â Â Applicability.Â  Planned development housing shall be permitted in R Zones
as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â For an undeveloped area of land of 2 acres or more.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â For development of areas of land containing less than 2 acres but more
than 1 acre, where, because of existing environmentally sensitive areas, or
natural features, or the land is completely surrounded by development, or the
age of existing development or scenic assets, such development is more
appropriate and more efficient than conventional development.Â  (See Section
165.29(10) for specific standards relating to developments of less than 2
acres.)
3.Â Â Â Preliminary PDH Plan.Â  The owner of an area of land meeting the
requirements of subsection 2 of this section who wishes to develop in
accordance with the provisions of this section shall submit to the Building
Official three (3) copies of a preliminary PDH plan and application for
preliminary approval.Â  The preliminary PDH plan for the use and development of
the area of land shall list all requested variations from requirements of the
particular zone in which the tract of land is located.Â  The preliminary PDH
plan may show a range of dimensions and need not have the specificity of the
final plan.Â  The application shall be accompanied by the following:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A location map affixed to the plan.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A preliminary PDH plan of the proposed development drawn to scale of 1"
= 100', showing:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Contours at 5-foot intervals or less and site topographic features.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Approximate location of all proposed streets and streets abutting
the development.

Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Proposed general arrangement of the buildings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Location and area of proposed open space areas (either to be held
in common or publicly and whether to be used for active recreation purposes or
only as an environmental amenity), parking areas, access drives, walks, and
landscaping and planting areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Sketches to indicate the general design of building types and the
overall character of the development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Legal description of the planned development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â Existing utility or other easements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â Development stages and timing of each, if applicable.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â Approximate location of and natural landscape features and/or
environmentally sensitive areas, if applicable.
4.Â Â Â Preliminary PDH Plan Approval.Â  Approval of a preliminary PDH plan shall
be by ordinance in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 165.49.Â 
Approval of the zoning of the land to an OPD-H Zone shall constitute approval
of the plan.Â  A preliminary PDH plan shall be valid for no more than 24 months,
unless specifically provided otherwise in the OPD-H approval ordinance.Â  If no
building permit has been issued for the development within the 24-month period,
the area of land to which the PDH ordinance applied may be considered by the
City for rezoning.Â  Preliminary or final OPD-H plans approved prior to the date
of adoption of these regulations shall not be subject to this provision.
5.Â Â Â Report of Planning and Zoning Commission.Â  Upon completion of review of
the preliminary PDH plan of the planned development, the Commission shall
recommend either approval or denial of the plan and shall make a written report
of its findings to the City Council to substantiate its recommendations.Â  The
findings shall deal with the following:Â  that the variances in setbacks, lot
area requirements, building heights, building types, sizes of buildings, and
the combination of land uses will be in the public interest, in harmony with
the purposes of this chapter and other building regulations of the City and
will not adversely affect nearby properties and that the parking requirements
of this chapter otherwise prevailing in the zone have not been reduced.
6.Â Â Â Changes in Approved Preliminary PDH Plan.Â  Material changes in an approved
preliminary PDH plan shall be subject to the approval procedures set forth in
subsection 4 of this section.Â  A material change is any change in the use or
character of the development from the use or uses shown on the preliminary PDH
plan and any dimensional change beyond the ranges specified on the preliminary
plan.
7.Â Â Â Final PDH Plan.Â  Applications for approval of the final PDH plan shall
meet all of the requirements of the preliminary PDH plan and meet the
documentation specifications of the subdivision regulations where applicable.Â 
For an area of land less than two (2) acres, the final PDH plan shall also
include the following:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Building elevations and floor plans for all structures.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Details of materials to be used for external construction.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â A landscape plan, including screening and buffering between the
proposed and existing development.
8.Â Â Â Final PDH Plan of Sub-area.Â  After preliminary approval of the entire
planned development is given, a final plan of a segment or sub-area within the
planned development may be approved if:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The plan of the sub-area meets all requirements of a final plan.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The dwelling unit density within the sub-area does not exceed the
dwelling unit density allowable for the least restrictive use for that area
under existing zoning.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The sub-area can function as an independent development unit with
adequate access, services, utilities, open space, etc.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The developer dedicates all public rights-of-way necessary to support
the sub-area.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The sub-area is more than two (2) acres in size.
9.Â Â Â General Requirements.Â  Planned developments shall meet the following
criteria:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Land Uses.Â  Combinations of land uses, including single-family, multi-
family and commercial uses are permitted and variations in building setback and
lot area requirements as called for in this chapter may be approved for planned
developments.Â  (Commercial uses are not permitted in PDH plans on less than 2
acres.)
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Dwelling Unit Density.Â  The overall dwelling unit density (based upon
total land area minus public and private street right-of-way area within the
planned development) may be computed on the basis of that permitted for the
least restrictive use, depending upon the character of the development which
would be allowed under the applicable underlying zoning classifications.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Open Space.Â  Planned developments shall contain open space totaling
twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the total land area minus public and
private street right-of-way area for recreational purposes and to enhance the
general character of the area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â In the event the open space land is to be retained under private
ownership, the developer must submit a legally binding instrument setting forth
the procedures to be followed in maintaining the areas and the means for
financing maintenance costs.Â  Generally, such costs shall be shared by all
owners of property located within the planned development, with unpaid costs
becoming a lien on individual properties.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All proposed dedications of land for public use, including that to
be dedicated for recreational use, shall be approved in writing by the Building
Official prior to approval of the plan by the Council.Â  All land dedications
for public use shall conform to the requirements of City ordinances.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Ownership.Â  At the time of approval of a preliminary PDH plan, the
developer must submit evidence of ownership of the property to be developed or
show evidence of legally binding executed option agreements for purchasing all
of the property.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Dedication of Public Right-of-Way.Â  All proposed dedications of land
for public use, including that to be dedicated for recreational use, shall be
approved in writing by the Building Official prior to approval of the plan by
the Council.Â  All land dedications for public use shall conform to the
requirements of City ordinances.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Streets.Â  Planned developments shall make provision for continuation
and extension of streets and shall be done in accordance with current City
standards.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Schedule of Completion.Â  A developer or sponsor of a planned
development shall be required to submit a signed statement generally describing
the proposed development and setting forth an intended time schedule for the
completion of various phases.
10.Â Â Â Additional Requirements and Standards for PDH on Areas of Land Less Than
Two (2) Acres, But One Acre or More.Â  No PDH plan for an area containing less
than 2 acres shall be approved before the following prerequisite is met and
which does not conform to the following standards:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Prerequisite to Consideration.Â  Prior to submitting a preliminary plan,
the owner/developer shall notify all property owners within 600 feet of the
proposed development, of the proposed project, and shall meet with as many
property owners as possible to discuss the project.Â  The owner/developer shall
submit to the Building Official a list of property owners, obtained from the
Cerro Gordo County Treasurerâs Office, to whom notice was sent.Â  Documentation
of a meeting with these people shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning
Commission.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â General Standards:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The density and design of the PDH shall be compatible in use, size
and type of structure, relative amount of open space, traffic circulation and
general layout with adjoining land uses and shall be integrated into the
neighborhood.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The development shall not overburden existing streets and
utilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The development shall not adversely affect views, light and air,
property values and privacy of neighboring properties any more than would a
conventional development.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Specific Standards:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Land Coverage.Â  Maximum land coverage for all buildings in the
development shall not exceed thirty-five percent (35%) of the total land area
minus street right-of-way area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Open Space.Â  At least twenty-five percent (25%) of the total land
area minus public and private street right-of-way area shall be open space.Â  At
least fifty percent (50%) of the required open space shall be suitably improved
by the owner/developer for its intended purpose, such work to be completed
before any occupancy certificate may be issued for the development.Â  The
remaining fifty percent (50%) of required open space may be left unimproved,
particularly if natural features worthy of preservation exist on the site.Â 
(Open space means land area of the site not covered by buildings, parking or
vehicular maneuvering areas, but including storm water detention basins,
recreational and pedestrian areas and private yards, if any.)
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Dimensions.Â  There shall be no minimum dimensional requirements
except for setbacks similar to those required for adjacent properties.Â  The
more restrictive zone setbacks will take precedent.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Siting and Design.Â  Multi-family structures located adjacent to
existing single-family dwellings must be sited, landscaped and screened by
natural features and plant materials to harmoniously integrate the PDH with the
surrounding neighborhood.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Commercial or institutional uses shall be prohibited.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Other conditions may be required, if found necessary to protect and
promote the best interest of the surrounding property or the neighborhood.Â 
These conditions may include but are not limited to, the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Improvement of traffic circulation for vehicles and pedestrians in
the proposed development and adjoining properties and streets.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Specific landscaping requirements to maintain privacy or reduce
impacts on adjoining properties.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Joint use of private open space or amenities by adjoining property
owners.
11.Â Â Â Final Plan Approval.Â  Final approval of any PDH plan shall be by
administrative review.Â  Approval shall be based on compliance with an approved
preliminary PDH plan and any modifications required by the Commission and
Council at the time the land was zoned to OPD-H.Â  After approval of the final
plan, permits may be issued to carry out the approved plan.Â  Material changes
to an approved PDH plan must be approved by ordinance in accordance with the
procedures set forth in subsection 4 of this Section.Â  Material changes are the
same as those specified in subsection 6 of this section.
12.Â Â Â Building Permits.Â  The final plan, or parts thereof as finally approved,
shall be filed in the Building Officialâs office and building permits may be
issued only for structures conforming to the PDH plan.Â  Minor changes in
building arrangements that do not substantially alter the character of the
development are allowable without further Council action.Â  Any other changes,
including changes in street locations, land use and building arrangements,
shall be considered as a material change to the approved plan, to be approved
as amendments in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection 4 of
this section.Â  In the event commercial uses are approved as a part of a planned
development, no building permit for a commercial use shall be issued until a
minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) of the housing units planned for the area
(or approved sub-area) have been completed or unless twenty-five percent (25%)
of the housing units planned for the area (or approved sub-area) will be built
simultaneously.Â  (Separate building permits shall be obtained by the developers
for the construction of housing and commercial uses where separate buildings
are to be used.)Â  The type of commercial use shall be compatible with the
surrounding residential development.
13.Â Â Â Existing OPD-H Developments (Formerly Referred to as Residential Planned
Unit Development (R-PUD).Â  Any planned developments in existence or with an
approved plan for development at the time of passage of the ordinance codified
in this chapter which are zoned R-PUD (OPD-H) by the adoption of this chapter
shall be considered as having met all of the requirements of this chapter.Â  All
new construction, which is not covered by a plan previously approved by the
City, within any OPD-H Zone after the effective date of the ordinance codified
in this chapter must be in compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
165.30Â  PROVISIONAL USES OR SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS.
The following principal uses are listed as provisional uses or special
exceptions in various zones in this chapter.Â  These uses are required to meet
the regulations indicated, in addition to the regulations of the zone in which
the uses are allowed, only when this section is referred to in the requirements
for each use.Â  In case of any conflict between the regulations of the zone in
which the use is allowed as a provisional use or special exception and the
additional regulations of this section, the most restrictive regulations shall
govern.

2.Â Â Â General Rules Applicable to Off-Street Parking.Â  The following rules shall
govern in the design, location and number of off-street parking and stacking
spaces, aisles and drives.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where a fractional space results, the number of parking and stacking
spaces required is the closest whole number.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Whenever a use existing prior to the effective date of this chapter is
enlarged to the extent of less than fifty percent (50%) in floor area, the
addition or enlargement shall comply with the parking requirements set forth
herein.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Whenever a building existing prior to the effective date of this
chapter is structurally altered by one or more additions, the sum total of
which increases the floor area to the extent of 50% or more, the uses contained
within the original building and all enlargements shall thereafter comply with
the parking requirements set forth herein.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â A use existing prior to the effective date of this chapter, for which
the current required number of parking or stacking spaces is not provided, may
be converted to another use without full compliance with the required number of
parking or stacking spaces, provided that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â If subsection 1 of this section would require a greater number of
parking or stacking spaces for the converted use than were required for the
established use, the increased number of parking or stacking spaces shall be
provided in compliance with subsection 3.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â In addition to the number of spaces required under subparagraph
(1), or if subparagraph (1) is not applicable, as many additional spaces shall
be provided as the lot will accommodate.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â In the case of mixed uses, the parking and stacking spaces required
shall equal the sum of the requirements of the various uses computed
separately.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The storage of merchandise, materials, equipment, refuse containers,
obsolete or junk vehicles, or the major repair of vehicles is prohibited in
required off-street parking and stacking spaces.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy as provided in
Section 165.47, all parking and stacking spaces, drives and aisles shall, as
provided in paragraph 3(A) of this section, be paved with concrete, asphalt or
a similar dust-free surface; except that the Building Official may issue a
temporary Certificate of Occupancy in those instances where the Building
Official finds that the paving cannot reasonably be completed due to adverse
weather conditions or settling of land on the site after demolition or
filling.Â  A temporary Certificate of Occupancy shall be effective only to a
date specific, and, as a condition to issuance of such a temporary certificate,
the property owner shall place in an escrow account, established with the City,
an amount which shall cover 110 percent of the anticipated cost of paving.
3.Â Â Â Construction, Design and Location Requirements.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Construction.Â  All parking and stacking spaces, drives and aisles shall
be constructed of asphalt, concrete or similar permanent dust-free surface.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Design.Â  Except for single-family dwellings (including zero lot line
and townhouse units) and duplexes, parking and stacking spaces, aisles and
drives shall be designated as follows (except as required by the 1991 Americans
With Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and
Facilities):
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Parking areas shall have the minimum dimensions illustrated in
Figure 5 for each of the parking configurations permitted (where the edges of
parking spaces are curved, as on a curved aisle, all angles shall be measured
between the straight edges of the parking spaces and tangents to the curved
edges at their point of intersection).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Up to ten percent (10%) of the required number of parking spaces
may be eight (8) feet in width by fifteen (15) feet in length if the parking
spaces are signed âCompact Vehicles Only.â
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â All parking spaces shall be connected to an aisle which shall have
a minimum width as indicated in FigureÂ 5.Â  Aisles designed for two-way traffic
shall have a minimum width of twenty-six (26) feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The greatest aisle width shown in Figure 5 shall be provided when
combining different parking space configurations on the same aisle.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Parking spaces shall be designed to permit ingress and egress of
the vehicle without moving any other vehicle occupying a parking space.Â  For
single-family dwellings (including zero lot line and townhouse units) and
duplexes, when located pursuant to the requirements of this chapter, one space
may be behind another.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â No parking area shall be designed in such a manner that exiting a
parking area would require backing into a street.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â If the number of parking spaces required or provided for a use or a
combination of uses on a lot is greater than eight (8) spaces, none of those
spaces may be located in such a manner that would require backing into an
alley.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Parking spaces along lot lines and alleys shall be provided with
car stops or curbing so no part of a parked vehicle can extend beyond the lot
line or into the alley (FigureÂ 4).Â  In addition, traffic islands of pervious or
impervious material shall be located so that parking spaces are separated from
drives and alleys in a manner similar to that illustrated in FigureÂ 6.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â All parking spaces, stacking spaces, drives and aisles in parking
areas shall be pitched or curbed and drained to prevent the flow of excess
water from such areas onto streets and alleys which do not have adequate
drainage facilities as determined by the City Engineer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â In all parking areas required by this chapter, parking spaces
shall be visibly delineated on the surface by painted or marked stripes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â If two or more parking areas on a lot are connected by a drive,
the parking areas shall be designed so that an aisle connected to more than
twelve (12) parking spaces is not used as a drive in providing access to
another parking area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (12)Â Â Â A drive providing access to a parking area with more than 18
spaces shall be no less than 18 feet in width if designated for two-way
traffic, or 10 feet in width if designated for one-way traffic.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Location.Â  Parking spaces, aisles and drives shall be located as
follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Off-street parking and stacking spaces, aisles and drives shall be
located on the same lot as the use served except as provided in subsection 4 of
this section (Off-Street Parking Located on a Separate Lot).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â In all R Zones, except for zero lot line dwellings, and in all
other zones abutting an R Zone, drives and aisles shall not be located closer
than three (3) feet to a lot line or an R Zone boundary unless pitched or
curbed and drained to prevent the flow of water onto adjoining property or
unless a drainage course has been established along lot lines for the purpose
of storm water runoff.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A parking area in a C or I Zone shall not be located closer than
five (5) feet to an R Zone boundary; except an existing nonconforming parking
area with a permanent, dust-free surface may be located within five (5) feet of
an R Zone boundary if the parking area is screened from view within the R Zone
by a solid fence of durable construction which complies with the regulations of
Sections 165.43(8) and 165.36.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Except for single-family dwellings (including zero lot line and
townhouse units) and duplexes, no parking space shall be located closer than
five (5) feet to a ground floor doorway or a window of a dwelling unit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Except as provided below, in R Zones and in the C and I Zones
within 50 feet of an R Zone, no parking shall be permitted in the front yard.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â For detached single-family dwellings in the R Zones, one (1) of the
required parking spaces may be provided in the front yard on a regularly
constructed aisle provided that not less than 50% of the front yard area shall
remain in open space free of impervious surface.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â For zero lot line dwellings, duplexes and family care facilities,
two (2) of the required parking spaces may be provided in the front yard on a
regularly constructed aisle provided that not less than 50% of the front yard
area shall remain in open space free of impervious surface.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â In the OBP Zone, only 10% of the required number of parking spaces
may be located in the front yard not closer than 50 feet to a street.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â Where the paved surface of a street is narrower in width, four (4)
of the parking spaces required by Chapter 166 (Subdivisions) may be located in
the front yard on a regularly constructed aisle.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â Side Yard.Â  Except for single- and two-family dwellings or where
two lots share the same parking and stacking spaces, drives and aisles pursuant
to subsection 4, no parking spaces, aisles or drives shall be permitted in that
portion of the required side yard which is contiguous to the principal building
on a lot.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â Rear Yard.Â  Parking and stacking spaces, drives and aisles may be
provided in the rear yard.
4.Â Â Â Off-Street Parking Located on a Separate Lot.Â  Off-street parking and
stacking spaces, aisles and drives may be located on a separate lot from the
use served provided a conditional use is granted by the Board of Adjustment and
that the following conditions are met:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Special Location Plan.Â  A special location plan shall be filed with the
Board by the owners of the entire land area to be included within the special
location plan and shall contain such information deemed necessary to comply
with the requirements herein.Â  A covenant running with the land area shall be
submitted with the special location plan stating that individual lots shall not
be sold separately.Â  In addition, evidence of property ownership shall be
required.

conditional use be granted to modify the screening requirements for a lot
abutting or across the street from a lot in an RS Zone.

8.Â Â Â Screening.Â  Where a lot occupied by a commercial or industrial use abuts
or is across a street, highway, alley or railroad right-of-way from an R or OBP
Zone, a school or a recreational area, including a park, playground, Outlet
Creek, Willow Creek or Clear Lake, screening shall be preserved, planted or
constructed and maintained by the owner of the commercial or industrial use in
accordance with the provisions set forth below.Â  In the instance where a lot
occupied by a manufactured housing use abuts or is across the street from an
RR-1 or RS-5 Zone, screening, in accordance with the provisions set forth
below, shall also be provided by the owner of the manufactured housing use.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Location:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Except for a use in the OBP Zone, screening shall be provided along
lot lines or street right-of-way in a manner sufficient to effectively obscure
the commercial or industrial use from view at ground level within the lot lines
of a residential or OBP Zone, or school, abutting or located across the street
from said commercial or industrial use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â In an OBP Zone where parking is located within 60 feet of an R, OBP
or ID Zone boundary, screening shall be provided in a location and manner
sufficient to effectively obscure all off-street parking and loading, storage
or other such areas of activity from view within the lot lines of the
residential zone or school.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â In an RM Zone, screening shall be provided along lot lines or
street right-of-way in a manner sufficient to effectively obscure the
manufactured housing use from view within the lot lines of residential
development in an RR-1 or RS-5 Zone.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â In all instances where street right-of-way, which acts to separate
the lots on which said uses are located, is one hundred (100) feet or wider,
screening shall not be required.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Screening Materials:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â An evergreen planting screen at least three (3) feet high when
planted and spaced four (4) feet on center, may be used.Â  Other plant varieties
may be incorporated into the evergreen planting screen if approved by and
spaced according to the Building Official.Â  The planting bed shall have a
minimum dimension of five (5) feet, be free of any impervious surface and be
separated from streets, drives and parking areas by an unmountable curb or
barrier in such a manner that sand and saltwater runoff will not damage the
screening.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Where a planting screen cannot be expected to thrive because of
intense shade, soil and other site conditions, a solid fence of durable
construction, an earthen berm covered with grass or low shrubs and/or other
acceptable materials which provide maximum visual obscurity to a height of six
(6) feet at maturity may be used, if approved by the Building Official.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Time of Installation:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â If a lot proposed for a commercial or industrial use is located
adjacent to or opposite an existing residential use or subdivision in an R
Zone, or a school, screening as required herein shall be installed prior to
occupancy or commencement of a use.Â  The Building Official may grant a delay to
the seasonal calendar dates of JuneÂ 1 or NovemberÂ 1, whichever comes first.Â 
Similarly, if a lot or space intended for the placement of a manufactured
housing use is located adjacent to, or across the street from an existing
residential development in an RR-1 or RS-5 Zone, the owner of the manufactured
housing use shall provide screening as described herein.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If (1) above is not the case, screening need not be provided until
within six (6) months after a building permit is issued for a residential use
or a school in an R Zone, a final plat of residential subdivision is approved,
or a recreational area is available for use on adjacent or opposite land.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Exceptions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Where a proposed or existing commercial or industrial use is or
will be located adjacent to or opposite a City recreational area, screening may
be waived upon the granting of a conditional use from the Board of Adjustment
for the following reasons:
(a)Â Â Â If adequate existing or proposed landscaping within the recreational area
is or will be provided.
(b)Â Â Â If the nature of a use and the building occupied by the use are not
objectionable to the purpose of the recreational area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Screening may be waived by the Building Official where the view is
or will be blocked by a change in grade or by the natural or manmade features
as determined by the Building Official.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Maintenance.Â  The owner shall keep all screening properly maintained,
free of trash and litter, and all plant materials pruned in such a manner as to
provide effective visual obscurity from the ground to a height of at least six
(6) feet.
165.44Â  NONCONFORMITIES.
It is the intent of this section to:Â  (i) recognize those developments and
property uses that are already in existence prior to the effective date of this
chapter but which may not conform to all of the provisions of this chapter
regarding permitted uses; and (ii) regulate nonconforming uses and structures
because they have been found to be incompatible with permitted uses and
structures in the zone involved.Â  It is not the intent of this section to
create undue hardship or to unduly restrict property uses that are in existence
and not creating any appreciable problems.Â  Single-family uses shall not
generally be treated as nonconforming uses.Â  Nonconforming buildings shall be
regulated to prevent an increase in the degree of nonconformity.Â  The lawful
use of any building or land existing on the effective date of this chapter may
continue, although such use of land does not conform with the provisions of
this chapter.
1.Â Â Â Structural Alterations.Â  Structural alterations may be made to
nonconforming buildings to meet the minimum requirements of other City codes.
2.Â Â Â Unlawful Use Not Authorized.Â  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted
as authorization for the continuance of the use of a structure or land
established unlawfully in violation of the zoning regulations in effect prior
to the enactment of this chapter.
3.Â Â Â Existing Single-Family Dwellings Treated as Conforming.Â  Notwithstanding
any other provision of this chapter, a single-family use, a single-family
dwelling and accessory structures or a lot on which a single-family dwelling is
located that was conforming prior to the effective date of this chapter shall
generally be treated as conforming for as long as the dwelling is used for a
single-family use.Â  Such uses shall be referred to as âexisting nonconforming
single-family.âÂ  Accordingly, the following rights shall be granted under this
chapter:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Structures for an existing nonconforming single-family use may be
restored for a single-family use if destroyed or damaged by fire, explosion,
act of God or by a public enemy; reconstructed; expanded; repaired; and
structurally altered, provided all other requirements of this chapter are met.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Existing nonconforming single-family dwellings or existing
nonconforming accessory structures to a single-family use may be restored to
the same degree of nonconformity or less if destroyed or damaged by fire,
explosion, act of God or by a public enemy; repaired; and structurally altered,
provided such construction does not increase or extend the degree of
nonconformity.Â  Nonconforming structures shall not be reconstructed except in
compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â An existing nonconforming single-family use and an existing
nonconforming single-family dwelling and accessory structures on an existing
nonconforming lot shall be granted the same rights as above and any other
rights as if the lot were conforming.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â An existing nonconforming single-family use and an existing
nonconforming single-family dwelling and accessory structures shall also be
granted the same rights as for other nonconforming uses and structures.
4.Â Â Â Nonconforming Uses.Â  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter,
nonconforming uses and structures for nonconforming uses shall be regulated as
follows:

nonconforming use be constructed, reconstructed, structurally altered or
relocated on the lot.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A nonconforming use may be converted only to a conforming use.Â  Once a
use is converted to a conforming use, it shall not be converted back to a
nonconforming use.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Any structure for a nonconforming use, which has been destroyed or
damaged by fire, explosion, act of God or by a public enemy to the extent of
less than sixty-five percent (65%) of the structureâs assessed value may be
restored for the same nonconforming use as existed before such damage.Â 
However, the nonconforming use shall not be enlarged to more than existed
before such damage.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â A lot or portion of a lot, on which is located a structure for
nonconforming use that has been destroyed or damaged by fire, explosion, act of
God or by a public enemy to the extent of 65% or more of the structureâs
assessed value, shall revert to a conforming use.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â A lot or portion of a lot devoted to a nonconforming use, which is
discontinued for a period of one (1) year, shall revert to a conforming use.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â A nonconforming use shall be permitted to have the same amount and type
of signage as would be allowed for such use in the most restrictive zone in
which such nonconforming use is allowed.
5.Â Â Â Nonconforming Structures.Â  Nonconforming structures shall be regulated as
follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any nonconforming structure, which has been destroyed or damaged by
fire, explosion, act of God, or by a public enemy to the extent of less than
65% of the structureâs assessed value, may be restored to the same degree of
nonconformity or less.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Except for buildings in an Historic District, a nonconforming
structure, which has been destroyed or damaged by fire, explosion, act of God
or by public enemy to the extent of 65% or more of the structureâs assessed
value, shall not be restored except in compliance with the provisions of this
chapter.Â  A nonconforming building in an Historic District may be placed upon
its original foundation or the site of the original foundation regardless of
the extent of damage provided that it is reconstructed as near as possible to
the original exterior design.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Any nonconforming structure containing a conforming use may be
converted to another conforming use, provided there shall not result an
increase in the degree of nonconformity of the structure.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â A nonconforming structure may be structurally altered, provided it is
structurally altered in a way which will not increase or extend its
nonconformity or in a way which will reduce its nonconformity.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Any nonconforming structure which is relocated on the same lot shall
thereafter conform to the provisions of this chapter.
6.Â Â Â Nonconforming Lots.Â  Development of nonconforming lots shall be regulated
as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any use or structure for a use permitted in the zone in which the lot

use, either one of which requires more lot area than presently exits, shall be
permitted.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All existing conforming or nonconforming uses and structures shall be
treated as if such uses and structures were established on a conforming lot.Â 
However, no use or structure for a use, either one of which requires more lot
area than presently exists and the structure of which has been destroyed or
damaged by fire, explosion, act of God or by a public enemy to the extent of
65% or more of the structureâs assessed value shall be restored except in
compliance with the provisions of this chapter.

1.Â Â Â No building or construction may be undertaken in the City until a building
permit has been issued by the Building Official for any building, construction,
erection, reconstruction, conversion, alteration, enlargement, extension,
raising or moving of any building or structures or any portion thereof.Â  The
construction or erection of items such as streets and roadways, public parks,
sidewalks, driveways, fences and ornamental yard features and one accessory
building (maximum 10 feet by 12 feet) shall be exempt from the permit
requirements of this section, but shall comply with any applicable regulations
found elsewhere in this Code.
2.Â Â Â No change in the use or occupancy of land, nor any change of use or
occupancy in an existing building, other than for single-family dwelling
purposes, shall be made, nor shall any new building be occupied until a
certificate of occupancy and the proper permits have been issued by the
Building Official.Â  If a building permit has not been issued prior to the
adoption of this chapter, every certificate of occupancy shall state that the
new occupancy complies with all provisions of this chapter.Â  No permit for
excavation for, or the erection or alteration of, any building shall be issued
before the application has been made for a certificate of occupancy and
compliance, and no building or premises shall be occupied until such
certificate and permit is issued.Â  A careful record of all certificates, plans
and permits shall be kept on file in the office of the Building Official.
3.Â Â Â Every application for a zoning permit shall be in writing and delivered to
the Building Official and shall be accompanied by a detailed set of plans, in
duplicate, showing the size of the proposed building or structure, its location
on the lot, the materials of which it is to be constructed and the details and
type of construction to be used.Â  On the issuance of a permit, one set of the
plans shall be retained by the Building Official as a permanent record and one
set shall be returned to the applicant.Â  The Building Official may, at his/her
own discretion, permit the substitution of a written statement covering the
essential information required in place of the plans.
4.Â Â Â Application Forms.Â  Blank forms shall be provided by the Building Official
for the use of those applying for permits as provided for in this chapter.Â  Any

purpose and furnished by the City.
5.Â Â Â The fees to be charged for permits and certificates are available from the
Building Official.
6.Â Â Â A certificate of occupancy may be obtained for nonconforming uses.Â 
Application for certificate of occupancy for nonconforming uses shall be
accompanied by affidavits of proof that such nonconforming use was not
established in violation of the zoning ordinance before the adoption of this
chapter.
7.Â Â Â The Building Official may issue a temporary Certificate of Occupancy when
a delay in the planting of trees is warranted, as provided in Section 165.41(3)
or a delay in paving of parking and stacking spaces, drives or aisles is
warranted, as provided in Section 165.33(2)(G).
165.48Â  RULES OF CONSTRUCTION FOR BOUNDARIES OF ZONES.
The boundaries of various zones shall be as shown on the Zoning Map
accompanying and made a part of this chapter, except as otherwise indicated in
the following rules:
1.Â Â Â Where the boundaries of the zones are along streets and alleys, they shall
be construed to be along the centerlines of such streets and alleys.
2.Â Â Â Where the boundaries of the zone are not otherwise indicated and where the
property has been or may hereafter be divided into blocks and lots, the
boundaries of the zone shall be construed to be the lot lines and where the
zones designated on the zoning map accompanying and made a part of this chapter
are bounded approximately by lot lines, the lot lines shall be construed to be
the boundaries of the zones unless the boundaries are otherwise indicated on
the Zoning Map.
3.Â Â Â In separate tracts not subdivided and in unsubdivided property, the zoning
boundary lines on the map accompanying and made a part of this chapter shall be
determined by use of the scale appearing on the Zoning Map.
In interpreting and applying the provisions of this chapter, such provisions
shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public
safety, health, convenience, comfort, morals, prosperity and general welfare.Â 
It is not intended by this chapter to interfere with or abrogate or annul any
easements, covenants or other agreements between parties, except that if this
chapter imposes a greater restriction this chapter shall control.
165.49Â  AMENDMENTS.
1.Â Â Â The City Council may, on its own motion or on petition, amend, supplement,
change, modify or repeal by ordinance the boundaries of zones, or regulations,
or restrictions herein established.Â  Any proposed amendment, supplement,
change, modification or repeal shall first be submitted to the Planning and
Zoning Commission for its recommendations and report.Â  If the Commission makes
no report within sixty (60) days, it shall be considered to have made a report
approving the proposed amendment, supplement, modification or change.Â  After
the recommendation and report of the Commission have been filed, the Council,
before enacting any proposed amendment, supplement, change, modification or
repeal, shall hold a public hearing in relation thereto, giving notice of the
time and place of the hearing, which notice shall be published in a newspaper
having a general circulation in the City of Clear Lake at least seven (7) but
not more than twenty (20) days before the public hearing (Iowa Code, Chapter
414.4).Â  In no case shall the public hearing be held earlier than the next
regularly scheduled Council meeting following the published notice.Â  The
Council may set such public hearing either before or after it submits the
proposed amendment, supplement, change, modification or repeal to the
Commission for its recommendation or during the period while the Commission is
considering such matter.Â  In addition to the published notice of a public
hearing, the Council shall also mail a copy of the notice by ordinary mail to
all owners of property adjoining or adjacent to property that is proposed to
have a change in zoning, said notice to be mailed to such owners at their last
known mailing address at least seven (7) but not more than twenty (20) days
before the public hearing.Â  Said notice shall be considered mailed when it is
deposited in the post office with first class postage attached.Â  âAdjacent
propertyâ for the purposes of this requirement is any property lying directly
across the street from the property where a change in zoning is proposed.
2.Â Â Â Any owner or owners of property may present a petition duly signed and
verified, requesting an amendment, supplement or change in the regulations
prescribed for a zone or part thereof.Â  Such petition shall be signed by the
owners of at least fifty percent (50%) of the area included in such proposed
change and by the owners of 50% of the property within 200 feet therefrom and
said petition shall be filed with the Planning and Zoning Commission.Â  A list
of all owners of record of property located within 200 feet of the zoning
change boundary shall be attached to the petition.Â  The Planning and Zoning
Commission shall make a report to the Council within 60 days from the date of
receipt of such petition.
3.Â Â Â If a protest against such proposal, amendment, supplement, change,
modification or repeal is proposed, it shall be presented in writing to the
Planning and Zoning Commission, duly signed and acknowledged by one of the
following:Â  (i) the owners of twenty percent (20%) or more of the area of the
lots included in the proposed change or repeal; (ii) the owners of 20% or more
of the property which is located immediately adjacent in the rear thereof,
extending the depth of one lot or not to exceed 200 feet; (iii) by the owners
of 20% or more of the property which is located directly opposite thereto,
extending the depth of one lot or not to exceed 200 feet from the street
frontage of such opposite lots, such amendment, supplement, change,
modification or repeal shall require the favorable vote of three-fourths (3/4)
of the members of the Council for passage.
4.Â Â Â Before any action shall be taken as provided in this section, the party or
parties proposing or recommending a change in the zone regulations or zone
boundaries shall deposit with the City Clerk a filing fee in the amount of
$200.00 for petition for rezoning.
5.Â Â Â No building permit for the erection of any building or structure or
license or permit for the conduct of any use shall be issued for a period of
sixty (60) days after the City Council has set a public hearing on the question
of amending the zoning ordinance and map so as to rezone an area, if the
building or use contemplated by the request permit would not be permitted in
that area under the proposed zoning classification.Â  Provided, if final action
by the City Council is not taken on the question within 60 days of the time the
matter is set for public hearing, the permit or license shall be issued.Â  If,
within the 60-day period, the City Council shall enact an ordinance amending
the Zoning Ordinance, the provisions of said Zoning Ordinance as amended shall
thereafter be in effect.Â  If, within the 60-day period, the City Council shall
vote on said question and it shall not receive a sufficient number of votes for
passage, the suspension period shall be terminated and permits shall be issued
upon current zoning regulations.
6.Â Â Â If a permit for a building or structure has been issued for a particular
area but no substantial part of the construction has been commenced at the
time, if the City Council shall set a public hearing on the question of
amending the Zoning Ordinance and map so as to rezone the area of the permit
which rezoning would prohibit the building or use contemplated by the permit,
the permit shall stand suspended and all construction and other action shall be
suspended for a period of 60 days after the setting of the public hearing.Â 
Provided, however, that if final action by the City Council is not taken on the
question within 60 days, construction may be commenced.Â  If, within the 60-day
period, the City Council shall enact an ordinance amending the Zoning
Ordinance, the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance as amended shall be in effect
and if said provisions prohibit the building, structure or use contemplated by
the suspended permit, said permit shall stand automatically revoked and
terminated.Â  If the City Council shall vote on said question and it shall not
receive a sufficient number of votes for passage, the suspension period shall
be terminated and construction may be commenced under the permit.Â  The
suspension of work under the provision of this chapter may not be invoked and
is not applicable if previously said permit has been suspended under the
provisions of this chapter.
7.Â Â Â No property or area within the City shall be subject to the suspension
provisions of this chapter unless twelve (12) months shall have expired after a
previous suspension period, said 12-month period to commence with the final day
of the 60-day suspension period provided for in this chapter.
8.Â Â Â The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend to the City Council
amendments, supplements, changes or modifications to this chapter or to the
boundaries of zones or to the zoning of particular tracts.Â  If the Commission
initiates a recommendation to the Council, said recommendation need not be
submitted to the Commission for its report but may be set for public hearing
forthwith.
165.50Â  VIOLATIONS.
The owner or manager of a building or premises in or upon which a violation of
any provision of this chapter has been committed or exists, or the lessee or
tenant of an entire building or entire premises in or upon which violation has
been committed or exists, or the agent, architect, building contractor or any
other person who commits, takes part or assists in any violation or who
maintains any building or premises in or upon which such violation exists, or
who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with or who
resists the enforcement of any of the provisions of this chapter, shall be
subject, upon conviction, to the penalty for violation of this Code of
Ordinances.Â  Each day that a violation is permitted to exist after proper
notice shall constitute a separate offense.Â  In case of a violation of any
provision of this chapter, the proper authorities of the City, in addition to
other remedies, may institute any appropriate action or proceedings to prevent
the illegal act.Â  In case any building or structure is erected, constructed,
reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted or maintained, or any buildings,
structure or land is used in violation of this chapter, the appropriate
authorities of the City, in addition to other remedies, may institute
injunction, mandamus or other appropriate action or proceedings to prevent such
unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion,
maintenance or use, or to correct or abate such violations, or to prevent the
occupancy of said building, structure or land.
165.51Â  ANNEXATION.
1.Â Â Â Voluntary Annexation.Â  All applications for voluntary annexation of land
to the City shall, in addition to the necessary requirements for annexation,
designate the zoning classification which the applicant wishes for his/her
property.Â  Upon receipt thereof, the application shall be referred to the
Planning and Zoning Commission for recommendations on both the annexation and
the requested zoning.Â  The Planning and Zoning Commission shall have the same
time periods for its consideration as in any rezoning matter.Â  The Commission
may recommend approval of the requested zoning or the denial thereof.Â  In the
event the Commission recommends denial, it shall make an additional
recommendation as to what zoning classification it recommends.Â  A copy of its
report shall be forwarded to the applicant and shall be on the agenda for the
next meeting of the City Council.Â  The Council shall set the zoning matter for
public hearing, prescribing the same notice requirements as for a rezoning
application and shall specify the zoning classification recommended by the
Commission.Â  If the Council approves the zoning classification recommended by
the Commission, it shall be set by ordinance.Â  A zoning classification other
than that recommended by the Commission shall not become effective except by
the favorable vote of three-fourths (3/4) of the members of the Council; and an
application for voluntary annexation not recommended by the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall not become effective unless approved by a favorable vote of 3/
4 of the members of the Council.Â  The resolution providing for annexation shall
be acted upon by the City Council at the time the Council takes action on the
zoning classification.Â  In the event an applicant does not designate a zoning
classification in the application for voluntary annexation, no public hearing
shall be required and the property may be annexed and shall be classified in
the ID zone and shall be subject to all provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
2.Â Â Â Involuntary Annexation.Â  Whenever, after public hearing thereon, the
Council determines that involuntary annexation proceedings should be undertaken
against the lands to be annexed, the matter shall be referred to the Planning
and Zoning Commission for its recommendation as to the zoning of said lands.Â 
Upon receipt of said recommendations, the City Council shall set the zoning
classification for a public hearing, prescribing the same notice requirements
as for rezoning application and specifying the zoning classifications
recommended by the Commission.Â  If the Council approves the zoning
classifications recommended by the Commission, it shall adopt an ordinance
setting forth the various zoning classifications for said lands.Â  The Council
may approve a higher or more restrictive classification for all or any part of
the lands to be annexed than recommended by the Planning and Zoning
Commission.Â  However, prior to approval of any lower or less restrictive
classification, the Council must send the matter back to the Commission for its
recommendation on the lower classification.Â  In the event the matter is
returned to the Commission subsequent to the public hearing, a new public
hearing shall be held thereon after the Commission forwards its report and
recommendation to the Council.Â  If the Commission recommends against the lower
classification, it shall not become effective except by a favorable vote of
three-fourths (3/4) of the members of the Council.
165.52Â  BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
1.Â Â Â Creation and Membership.Â  A Board of Adjustment, to be hereinafter
referred to as the Board, is established.Â  The Board shall consist of five (5)
members appointed by the Mayor, subject to the approval of the City Council.Â 
Terms shall be staggered so that the term of one member becomes vacant each
year, and terms shall be for five (5) years.Â  Vacancies shall be filled for the
unexpired terms of any member whose term becomes vacant.Â  Members shall be
removable for cause by the appointing authority upon written charges and after
public hearing.Â  All members of the Board shall serve without compensation.Â 
The Board, subject to the approval of the City Council, may employ such
clerical and technical assistance as may be needed to carry on its work.
2.Â Â Â Chairperson and Meetings.

this chapter or the Iowa statutes, to enable it to perform its functions and
duties.

year.Â  Such Chairperson, or in his/her absence the acting Chairperson, may
administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses.Â  Meetings of the Board
shall be held at the call of the Chairperson and at such other times as the
Board may determine.Â  All meetings of the Board shall be open to the public.Â 
The notice of the time and place of meetings shall be published in a newspaper
of general circulation not more than twenty (20) or less than seven (7) days
prior to the hearing.Â  It shall contain the street address or location of the
property and a brief description of the nature of the appeal.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The City Clerk, or such other City employee as the Board may designate,
shall serve as the Secretary of the Board.Â  In the absence of the Secretary,
the Chairperson of the Board may appoint one of the members of the Board to act
as Secretary Pro Tem for the meeting.Â  The Board shall have the power to call
on any City department for assistance in the performance of its duties, and it
shall be the duty of such department to render such assistance as may
reasonably be required.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of
each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating
such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official
actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the Board.
3.Â Â Â Appeals.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any
officer, department, board or bureau of the City affected by any decision of
the administrative officer.Â  Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable
time, as provided by the rules of the Board, by filing, with the officer from
whom the appeal is taken and with the Board a notice of appeal specifying the
grounds thereof.Â  The administrative officer shall forthwith transmit to the
Board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed
from was taken.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Each appeal shall be accompanied by a fee of $50.00 to be paid by the
appellant to the City Clerk.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal,
give public notice thereof and decide the same within a reasonable time.Â  Upon
the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
from, unless the administrative officer certifies to the Board, after the
notice of appeal shall have been filed with him/her, that by reason of facts
stated in the certificate a stay would, in his/her opinion cause imminent peril
to life or property.Â  In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise
than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board or by a court of
record on application or notice to the administrative officer and on due cause
shown.
4.Â Â Â Jurisdiction.Â  The Board shall have the following powers:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any
order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Building Official in
the enforcement of this chapter.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â To hear and decide conditional use to the terms of this chapter upon
which the Board is required to pass under this chapter.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Where the street or lot layout on the ground actually varies from the
street and lot lines as shown in the zoning map, the Board shall interpret the
map and the provisions of this chapter in such a way as to carry out the intent
and purposes of this chapter for the particular district or section in
question.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â To permit the reconstruction, within one year, and use as before of a
nonconforming building destroyed or damaged to more than 65% of its value by
explosion, fire, act of God or public enemy or other calamity, where the Board
finds that the public needs require a continuance of the nonconforming use and
that such continuance would not primarily permit a continuation of a monopoly.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â To permit the erection and use of a building or the use of premises in
any location for a public service corporation for public utility purposes which
is determined reasonably necessary for the public convenience or welfare.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variances from the
terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest, where,
owing to conditional use, a literal enforcement of the provisions herein would
result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of this chapter shall be
observed and substantial justice done.Â  The Board, in authorizing any variance,
may require any appropriate conditions and stipulation as they deem necessary
and such conditions and stipulations attached to the approval shall be complied
with, and a violation of those stipulations shall be considered the same as any
violation of the other provisions of this chapter.Â  In granting any variance,
the Board shall give due consideration to the following requirements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The variance and any attached conditions would meet the general
purpose of this chapter of promoting public health, safety, comfort, order and
the general welfare of the community.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The variance and any attached conditions would be in keeping with
the general character of the surrounding area, the purpose as stated for the
zoning district, and the land-use plan of the City.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The variance and any attached conditions would not result in any
appreciable depreciation of adjacent property values or detract from the
enjoyment and use of those adjacent properties.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â To determine, in cases of uncertainty, the classification of any use.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â To permit the erection and use of any accessory building on a lot
before the erection of a principal building on such lot as provided herein,
provided such use is temporary and for a period of time not to exceed one year.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â To permit the extension of an existing building or use into a more
restricted district immediately adjacent, under such conditions as will
safeguard the character of the more restricted district, provided that such
extension shall not be permitted more than fifty (50) feet beyond the boundary
line of the district in which such building or use is authorized.
5.Â Â Â Conditional Use Permits.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The Board of Adjustment shall hold a hearing and consider any
application for a conditional use permit.Â  The Board may approve conditional
use permits for any use that is in keeping with and appropriate to the uses
authorized in that zone.Â  The Board shall give due consideration to the
following requirements in the approval or denial of any conditional use permit
application.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The conditional use approval would meet the general purpose of this
chapter of promoting public health, safety, comfort, order and the general
welfare of the community.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The conditional use approval would be in keeping with the general
character of the surrounding area, the purpose as stated for that zone and the
Comprehensive Plan of the City.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The conditional use approval would not result in any appreciable
depreciation of adjacent property values or detract from the enjoyment and use
of those adjacent properties.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The conditional use approval would not create any amount or type of
traffic that may be detrimental to others.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The conditional use approval would not create objectionable noise,
dust, smoke or odor for nearby properties.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â The conditional use approval would provide adequate parking area so
as not to create congestion of public streets and roadways.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â To obtain a conditional use permit for a bed and breakfast home,
the applicant must satisfy the criteria in Section 165.30.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The Board may require any appropriate conditions and stipulations as
they deem necessary to assure that the preceding requirements will be fully
complied with.Â  Such conditions and stipulations attached to the approval shall
be complied with and a violation of those conditions shall be considered the
same as any violation of the other provisions of this chapter.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Before receiving the conditional use permit, the applicant shall pay to
the City the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00), which shall help pay the expense of
issuing same and the cost of recording a copy of the permit in the office of

appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination
as ought to be made and to that end shall have all powers of the Building
Official from whom the appeal is taken.

Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement,
decision or determination of the Building Official to decide in favor of the
applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this chapter or
to affect any variation in this chapter.Â  It is not the intention to grant the
Board the power or authority to alter or change the Zoning Ordinance or Zoning
Map.Â  Such power and authority rests solely with the City Council.
8.Â Â Â Appeal From Decision of Board.Â  Any person or persons, jointly or

It is the purpose of this section to protect and preserve the rights,
privileges and property of the City and its residents and to preserve and
improve the peace, safety, health, welfare and comfort and convenience of its
residents by minimizing flood losses with provisions designed to:Â  (i) reserve
sufficient flood plain area for the conveyance of flood flows so that flood
heights and velocities will not be increased substantially; (ii) restrict or
prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of
flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; (iii)
require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public utilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement; (iv) protect individuals from buying
lands which may not be suited for intended purposes because of flood hazard;
and (v) assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.

official from whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason
for the appeal.Â  The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to
the Board of Adjustment all the documents constituting the record upon which
the action appealed from was taken.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Variances.Â  The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in
specific cases such variances from the terms of this section that will not be
contrary to the public interest, where owing to special conditions a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this section will result in unnecessary
hardship.Â  Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood elevation would result.Â 
Consideration of the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based
upon the assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for
similarly situated lands.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this section, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and
(ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Hearings and Decisions of the Board of Adjustment.

the hearing and give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to parties in
interest.Â  At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or
attorney and present written or oral evidence.Â  The Board may require the
appellant or applicant to provide such information as is reasonably deemed
necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or evaluation of a
professional engineer or other expert person or agency, including the
Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Decisions.Â  The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal,
conditional use or variance within a reasonable time.Â  In passing upon an
appeal, the Board may, so long as such action is in conformity with the
provisions of this section, reverse or affirm wholly or in part, or modify the
order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make
its decision, in writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons
for its decision.Â  In granting a conditional use or variance, the Board shall
consider such factors as contained in this section and all other relevant
sections of this section and may prescribe such conditions as contained in
subsection 20.
18.Â Â Â Factors Upon Which the Decision to Grant Variances Is Based.Â  In passing
upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all relevant factors
specified in other sections of this section and:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or downstream
to the injury of others.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The importance of the service provided by the proposed facility to the
City.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The requirements of the facility for a flood plain location.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â The availability of alternate locations not subject to flooding for the
proposed use.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
flood plain management program for the area.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood water expected at the site.
Â Â Â L.Â Â Â The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and bridges.
Â Â Â M.Â Â Â Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this section.
19.Â Â Â Conditions Attached to Variances.Â  Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the

and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the Department of
Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative to achieving
the purpose of this section.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Floodproofing measures designed to be consistent with the flood
protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, durations, rate
of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated with
the regulatory flood.Â  The Board of Adjustment shall require that the applicant
submit a plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that
the floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
20.Â Â Â Appeals to the Court.Â  Any person or persons, jointly or severally,
aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Adjustment may present to a court of
record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal,
in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of illegality.Â  Such petition shall
be presented to the court within thirty days after the filing of the decision

165.54Â  TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND WIRELESS EQUIPMENT.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 prohibits the City from establishing
policies that discriminate against one or a group of telecommunication
providers in favor of another group of providers or potential group of
providers. The following criteria will be applied consistently to all
telecommunication providers that request a permit.
1.Â Â Â Satellite dish telecommunications equipment shall be permitted in any
Residential, Commercial or Industrial district.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Satellite dishes shall be screened from adjoining properties by the use
of landscape plantings and/or screen fences or walls.Â  The City is aware of the
operating needs of these types of structures and acknowledges that it may be
impossible to totally screen a satellite dish or tower, however, every effort
must be made by the dish owner to minimize visual impact of the dish on
surrounding properties.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Satellite dishes larger than thirty-six (36) inches in diameter shall
be permitted in rear yards only and are permitted a maximum height of twelve
(12) feet.Â  Such dishes must be setback at least five (5) feet from all rear
and side property lines.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Communications towers, including television antennas and amateur radio
antennas, not used for commercial purposes, may be utilized in residential
districts, provided they do not exceed ten (10) feet above the height limit
determined for principal structures in the applicable district and are at least
one-half (1/2) the total height of the tower from any lot lines.Â  Total height
shall be measured as the distance from the average grade at the base of the
supporting structure to the top of the highest point of the tower, including
beacons and antennae.
2.Â Â Â Communication towers shall be permitted in any CI-1, I-1, and I-2 zoning
districts.Â  A site plan, consistent with the requirements as outlined in the
City of Clear Lake Code of Ordinances, Chapter 167, shall be required for all
new communication tower and equipment facilities, expansion of existing
facilities, or major modifications of existing facilities.
3.Â Â Â In addition to site plan requirements as set forth herein, the following
information must be provided for review of a telecommunication development
request:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Map showing the location of the applicant's proposed facility and any
existing facilities within three (3) miles of the proposed site location.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Report from a structural engineer showing the tower antenna capacity by
type and number, and a certification that the tower is designed to withstand
winds in accordance with ANS/EIA/TIA 222, latest revision, standards.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Evidence that a valid FCC license for the proposed activity has been
issued.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â A written agreement signed by the communication facility owner and
property owner to remove the tower, foundation, and any other accessory
equipment within sixty (60) days after abandonment.Â  As used herein, the term
"abandonment" shall mean a communication tower that is not used for its
intended and approved purpose for more than one hundred eighty (180) days.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Establish that the use of and frequencies emitted from the tower and
equipment will not interfere with the transmissions of law enforcement, fire,
emergency response, public works, or other service agencies.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Additional information, as required, to determine that all applicable
zoning and siting regulations are met.
4.Â Â Â Communication towers and equipment shall meet the following design
standards:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Communication towers shall be set back from all property lines and all
other principal structures a distance of not less than one-half of the tower
height, unless a tower is adjacent to a residential district or City park, in
which case the tower shall be set back a distance of not less than the full
tower height.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Communication towers shall have a maximum height of sixty (60) feet in
any permitted zoning district.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Communication towers shall be painted a non-contrasting gray or similar
color, minimizing its visibility, unless otherwise required by the Federal
Communications Commission or the Federal Aviation Administration.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Lights and signage shall not be permitted on any tower unless
specifically required and permitted by the Federal Communications Commission,
Federal Aviation Authority, and the City.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Security fencing eight (8) feet in height shall surround the

Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Communication tower equipment enclosures and accessory structures shall
be designed with architectural compatibility with the surrounding built
environment.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Communication facilities mounted to a building wall shall be painted to
blend with the color and materials of the surface to which it is attached.Â  All
wiring and accessory equipment shall be concealed from view.Â  Communication
facilities located above the roof of the structure shall be appropriately
screened from view through the use of panels, walls, fences, or other screening
techniques approved by the City.
5.Â Â Â In order to minimize the overall numbers of towers within the City,
providers can be required to co-locate and enter into co-location agreements.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All new communication towers, and any pre-existing communication
towers, owned by a licensed carrier, upon which this section permits co-
location of additional communication facilities, shall be made available for
use by the owner or initial user thereof, together with as many other licensed
carriers as can be technically co-located thereon.Â  However, nothing in this
section shall prevent such licensed carriers from charging a reasonable fee for
the co-location of additional communication facilities upon said tower which
does not exceed the fair-market value for the space occupied.Â 
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All licensed carriers shall cooperate with each other in co-locating
additional communication facilities upon such towers.Â  All licensed carriers
shall exercise in good faith in co-locating with other licensed carriers and in
the sharing of towers, including technical information to evaluate the
feasibility of co-location.Â  This covenant of good faith and fair dealing shall
be a condition of any permit issued pursuant to this section for a new
communication tower.Â 
6.Â Â Â Communication towers and equipment shall meet or exceed the current
standards and regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration, and any other
agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate communication
towers and equipment.
7.Â Â Â The Community Building Official is authorized to submit a
telecommunication development application to an independent technical expert to
review any technical materials submitted including, but not limited to, those
required under this section.Â  The applicant shall pay all reasonable cost of
said review, including any administrative costs incurred by the City.Â  Any
proprietary information disclosed to the City or the technical expert hired
shall remain confidential and shall not be disclosed to any third party.

of-way and not included within the dimensions or areas of such lots or
parcels.Â  Rights-of-way intended for streets, crosswalks, water mains, sanitary

State of Iowa, the Council shall review, approve and disapprove plats for
subdivision of land within the corporate limits of the City or, pursuant to
Section 354.9 of the Code of Iowa, unincorporated areas within two miles of the
corporate limits of the City.Â  The purpose of this chapter is to provide
minimum standards for the design, development and improvement of all new
subdivisions and resubdivisions of land.Â  These regulations are adopted for the
following purposes:
1.Â Â Â To protect and provide for the public health, safety and general welfare
of the City.
2.Â Â Â To guide the future growth and development of the City, in accordance with
its plans and policies.
3.Â Â Â To provide adequate light, air and privacy to secure safety from fire,
flood and other damage, and to prevent overcrowding of the land and undue
congestion of population.

parts of the City and to encourage the orderly and beneficial development of
all parts of the City.
5.Â Â Â To protect and conserve the value of the land throughout the City and the
value of buildings and improvements upon the land, and to minimize the
conflicts among the uses of land and buildings.
6.Â Â Â To guide public and private policy and action in order to provide adequate
and efficient transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, playgrounds,
recreation and other public requirements and facilities.
7.Â Â Â To provide the most beneficial relationship between the uses of land and
buildings and the circulation of traffic throughout the City, having particular
regard to the avoidance of congestion in the streets and highways, and the
pedestrian traffic movements appropriate to the various uses of land and
buildings, and to provide for the proper location and width of streets and
building lines.
8.Â Â Â To establish reasonable standards of design and procedures for
subdivisions and resubdivisions, in order to further the orderly layout and use
of land; and to insure proper legal descriptions and monumenting of subdivided
land.
9.Â Â Â To insure that public facilities are available and will have a sufficient
capacity to serve the proposed subdivision.
10.Â Â Â To prevent the pollution of air, streams, and ponds; to assure the
adequacy of drainage facilities; to safeguard the water table; and to encourage
the wise use and management of natural resources throughout the City in order
to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the community and the value
of the land.
11.Â Â Â To preserve and protect environmentally sensitive areas and the natural
beauty and topography of the City and to insure appropriate development with
regard to these natural features.
12.Â Â Â To provide for open spaces through the most efficient design and layout
of the land, including the use of average density in providing for minimum
width and area of lots, while preserving the density of land as established in
the Zoning Ordinance of the City (Chapter 165 of this Code of Ordinances).
166.03Â  APPLICATION.
Every owner of any tract or parcel of land who has subdivided or shall
hereafter subdivide or plat said tract or parcel into three (3) or more parts
for the purpose of laying out an addition, subdivision, building lot or lots,
acreage, or suburban lots within the City or within the two-mile extra-
territorial review area shall cause plats of such area to be made in the form
and containing the information as hereinafter set forth before selling any lots
therein contained or placing the plat on record.
166.04Â  JURISDICTION.
1.Â Â Â This chapter applies to all subdivisions of land, as defined herein,
located within the corporate limits of the City, or within the two-mile extra-
territorial review area, pursuant to Section 354.9 of the Code of Iowa.
2.Â Â Â No land shall be subdivided within the corporate limits or the two-mile
extra-territorial area of the City until the following conditions are
satisfied:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The subdivider or his/her agent shall submit a preliminary plat of the
parcel to the Cityâs Building Official and the Planning and Zoning Commission.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The subdivider shall obtain a recommendation to approve, modify or
disapprove the preliminary plat by the Commission and approval of the
preliminary plat by the Council.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The same process as outlined in A and B above is completed for the
final plat of said parcel.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The approved final plat is filed with the County Recorder and County
Auditor.
3.Â Â Â No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any
parcel or plat of land which was created by subdivision after the effective
date of, and not in conformity with, the provisions of these subdivision
regulations, and no excavation of land or construction of any public or private
improvements shall take place or be commenced except in conformity with these
regulations.
166.05Â  INTERPRETATION, CONFLICT AND SEPARABILITY.
1.Â Â Â Interpretation and Application.Â  In their interpretation and application,
the provisions of these regulations shall be held to be the minimum
requirements for the promotion of public health, safety and general welfare.
2.Â Â Â Conflict with Public Provisions.Â  These regulations are not intended to
interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulations,
statute, or other provision of law.Â  Where any provision of these regulations
imposes a restriction different from those imposed by any other provision of
these regulations or any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other
provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher
standards shall control.
3.Â Â Â Conflict with Private Provisions.Â  These regulations are not intended to
abrogate any easement, covenant or any other private agreement or restriction,
provided that where the provisions of these regulations are made more
restrictive or impose higher standards or regulations than such easement,
covenant or other private agreement or restriction, the requirements of these
regulations shall govern.Â  Where the provisions of the easement, covenant or
private agreement or restriction impose duties and obligations more
restrictive, or higher standards than the requirements of these regulations, or
the determinations of the City in approving a subdivision or in enforcing these
regulations, and such private provisions are not inconsistent with these
regulations or determinations thereunder, then such private provisions shall be
operative and supplemental to these regulations and determinations made
thereunder.
4.Â Â Â Separability.Â  If any part or provision of these regulations or
application thereof to any person or circumstances is adjudged invalid by any
court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall be confined in its
operation to the part, provisions or application directly involved in all
controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered and shall not
affect or impair the validity of the remainder of these regulations or the
application thereof to other persons or circumstances.Â  The Council hereby
declares that it would have enacted the remainder of these regulations even
without any such part, provision or application.
166.06Â  RECORDING OF PLAT.
No subdivision plat, resubdivision plat, or street dedication within the City,
or within the two-mile extra-territorial review area of the corporate limits of
the City, shall be filed for record with the County Recorder or recorded by the
County Recorder until a final plat of such subdivision, resubdivision or street
dedication has been reviewed and approved in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter.Â  Upon the approval of the final plat by the City Council, it
shall be the duty of the subdivider to immediately file such plat with the
County Auditor and County Recorder, as required by law.Â  Such approval shall be
revocable after ninety (90) days, and after due notice to the subdivider,
unless such plat has been recorded and evidence thereof filed with the City
Clerk within such ninety (90) days.
166.07Â  FEES ESTABLISHED.
The City Council shall, from time to time, establish by resolution fees for the
review of plats.Â  No plat for any subdivision or resubdivision shall be
considered filed with the City Clerk unless and until said plat is accompanied
by the approved fee as established by resolution of the City Council and as
required by this chapter.
166.08Â  ENFORCEMENT, VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
It shall be the duty of the Building Official to enforce the provisions of this
chapter and to bring to the attention of the City Council any violations or
lack of compliance herewith.Â  Any person who disposes of or offers for sale any
lot or lots within the area of jurisdiction of this chapter, until the final
plat thereof has been approved by the Council and recorded as required by law,
shall be in violation of this chapter.Â  Violation of the provisions of this
chapter shall be deemed a misdemeanor, punishable as provided by law and with
each day such violation continues constituting a separate offense.Â  The
Building Official shall have recourse to such remedies in law and equity as may
be necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of these regulations.Â 
Nothing contained herein shall in any way limit the Cityâs right to any other
remedies available to the City for the enforcement of this chapter.
166.09Â  EXCEPTIONS.
1.Â Â Â Modifications of Requirements.Â  Upon recommendation of the Planning and
Zoning Commission, or if it deems such action to be appropriate, the City
Council may vary, modify or waive the requirements of Sections 166.16 through
166.24 (Specifications and Design Improvement Standards) of this chapter under
the following circumstances:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where, in the case of a particular proposed subdivision or plat
thereof, it can be shown that strict compliance with the requirements of
Section 166.16 through 166.24 of this chapter would result in extraordinary
hardship to the subdivider because of unusual topography, excessive costs, or
other such non-self-inflicted conditions, or that these conditions would result
in inhibiting the achievement of the objectives of these regulations, or
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where it can be shown that strict compliance with Sections 166.16
through 166.24 would result in poor subdivision design or could result in the
substantial degradation of natural features,
Any action to vary, modify or waive a requirement must assure that the public
interest is secured and that such variance, modification or waiver will not
have the effect of nullifying the intent or purposes of this chapter.
2.Â Â Â Reduction of Pavement Width Requirements.Â  In the case of subdivisions,
which include cul-de-sacs or âloopâ streets [no greater than five hundred (500)
feet in length], the required pavement width for such streets may be reduced if
provision is made for storage of at least four (4) automobiles on each lot as
provided in SectionÂ 165.33 of the Zoning Ordinance.Â  These additional parking
spaces may be located in the front yard.Â  A driveway may be used to fulfill the
additional parking requirements only if it is double width and served by a
double width curb entrance.Â  These parking spaces shall be shown on the
building plans for each lot in the subdivision and shall be necessary for the
approval of a building permit.Â  Such parking spaces shall be constructed at the
time of the house construction.Â  In lieu of the provision of the four (4)
parking spaces mentioned above on each individual lot, a âcommunityâ or
neighborhood parking lot may be provided to serve a group of residences.Â  The
same number of parking spaces shall be provided in such lots as would have been
required of the residences so served.Â  Such parking shall be located no more
than three hundred (300) feet from any residences served.Â  Where such parking
lots are used, adequate provisions for their maintenance and preservation as
parking lots must be provided.Â  Where such exception to pavement width is
desired, the method of providing the above required off-street storage of
automobiles shall be indicated on the preliminary and final subdivision plat
plans and shall be a requirement for final plat approval.Â  These off-street
parking areas, either on each individual parcel or community parking lots,
shall be designed so that they are functional and compatible with the overall
development of the area.Â  They shall be surfaced in accordance with standards
of the City Engineerâs office.Â  Upon approval of the final plat where pavement
width is desired, parking on both sides of such streets shall be prohibited and
appropriate signs designating same shall be posted by the City.
3.Â Â Â Unusual Plats.Â  This chapter shall not preclude the approval of âclusterâ
type subdivisions (OPDH) or subdivision designs of an unusual type, if, in the
opinion of the Commission, the general and aesthetic merit, the preservation of
natural or topographic features and the prospective enhancement of the
community would warrant the waiving of technical requirements as set forth in
Section 166.16 through 166.24 of this chapter.
4.Â Â Â Council Action.Â  In all cases of a variance, modification or a waiver of
the general requirements, it will be necessary to have the Council approve the
same and note this fact in the resolution approving the plat and subdivision.Â 
The Council may also modify, vary or waive the general requirements on its
motion for good reason shown, even if the Commission refused to do so.
166.10Â  CITYâS RIGHT TO INSTALL IMPROVEMENTS.
In the event the subdivider or the assigns or successors in interest of the
subdivider should sell or convey lots in a subdivision without having had
constructed or installed the pavement, water mains and sanitary sewers; or if
the subdivider, such assigns or successors in interest or the owners of the
lots in such subdivision should fail to construct sidewalks, the City shall
have the right to install and construct improvements and the costs of such
improvements shall be a lien and charge against all the lots adjacent to or in
front of which improvements are made and any lots which may be assessed for
improvements under the provisions of ChapterÂ 384 of the Code of Iowa.Â  The cost
of such improvements need not meet the requirements of notice, benefit or value
as provided by State law for assessing such improvements.Â  It is further
provided that this requirement to so construct such improvements is and shall
remain a lien until properly released.Â  When required improvements have been
installed to the satisfaction of the City, it will immediately file in the
office of the County Recorder a good and sufficient release to various lots in
such subdivisions so that this section will not constitute a cloud upon the
title of the lots in the subdivision.
166.11Â  RESUBDIVISION OF LAND.
1.Â Â Â Procedure for Resubdivision.Â  For any change in a map of an approved or
recorded subdivision plat, if such change affects any street layout shown on
such map, or area reserved thereon for public use, or any lot line, or if it
affects any map or plan legally reached prior to the adoption of any
regulations controlling subdivisions, such parcel shall be reviewed by the
Planning and Zoning Commission and approved by the City Council by following
the same procedure, rules and regulations as for a subdivision.
2.Â Â Â Procedure for Subdivisions Where Future Resubdivision is Indicated.Â 
Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or
more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are indications that
such lots will eventually be resubdivided into small building sites, the
Commission and Council may require that such parcel of land allow for the
future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets.Â  In
addition, a development plan for the entire subdivision plat may be required
and approved by the Council by following the same procedure, rules and
regulations as for a subdivision.Â  Easements and/or rights-of-way providing for
the future opening and extension of such streets may be made a requirement of
the plat.
166.12Â  BUILDING PERMIT TO BE DENIED.
No building permit shall be issued for construction on any lot, parcel or tract
within the Cityâs corporate limits where a subdivision is required by this
chapter unless and until a final plat of such subdivision has been approved and
recorded in accordance with this chapter and until the improvements required by
this chapter have been accepted by the City.
166.13Â  GENERAL PROCEDURE.
1.Â Â Â Classification of Subdivisions.Â  Whenever any subdivision of land into
three (3) or more parts for the purpose of laying out an addition, subdivision,
building lot or lots, acreage, or suburban lots within the planning

of the land being platted.Â  The opinion shall state the names of the
proprietors and holders of mortgages, liens or other encumbrances on the land
being platted and shall note the encumbrances, along with any bonds securing
the encumbrances.Â  Utility easements shall not be construed to be encumbrances
for the purpose of this section.

with the exception of sidewalks and/or bikeways and that the owner has executed
an agreement as a covenant running with the land that the sidewalks and/or
bikeways shall be installed within one (1) year of the date of final approval
of the subdivision and in the event said installation has not been done that
the owner waives all statutory requirements of notice of time and place and
hearing and waives statutory protections and limitations as to cost and

Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A performance bond with the City is secured which will insure to
the City that the improvements will be completed by the subdivider or property
owner within one (1) year after official acceptance of the final plat.Â  The
form and type of bond shall be approved by the City Attorney and the amount of
the bond shall not be less than the amount of the estimated cost of the
improvements plus ten percent (10%), and the amount of the estimate must be
approved by the City Administrator.Â  If the improvements are not completed
within the specified time, the Council may use the bond or any necessary
portion thereof to complete the same, or, if option (2) or option (3) is

unless one of the foregoing alternatives has been approved and no subdivision
shall be approved in which the developer proposes to request that the City
construct such improvement, pursuant to a special assessment program, except
for streets abutting the subdivision which may be done by assessment method.Â 
However, this exception does not apply to any not-for-profit corporation or
association which subdivides a tract of land for the purpose of encouraging
economic development of the tract.Â  In such instances, upon the petition of
developer and upon approval of the developerâs plans for development of said
tract by the Council, any improvements required by this chapter may be

shall conform to the following standards which are designed to result in a
well-planned community without adding unnecessarily to development costs:
1.Â Â Â Improvements Required.Â  The subdivider shall, at the subdividerâs expense,
install and construct all improvements required by this chapter.Â  All required
improvements shall be installed and constructed in accordance with the design
standards established for such improvements by the City and as shown on the
approved preliminary plat.
2.Â Â Â Standards Prescribed.Â  The standards set forth in this chapter shall be
considered the standards necessary to protect the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and can only be deviated from by authorized variance.
3.Â Â Â Inspection.Â  All improvements shall be inspected by the City Engineer to
ensure compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
4.Â Â Â Lands Subject to Flooding.Â  No subdivision containing land located in a
designated or undesignated floodway or flood hazard area shall be approved by
the City without the approval of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.Â  No
lot shall be located so as to include land located within a designated or
undesignated floodway or flood hazard area unless the lot is of such size and
shape that it will contain a buildable area not within the designated or
undesignated floodway or flood hazard area suitable for development as allowed
by the Zoning Ordinance for the zone in which the lot is located.Â  Land located
within a designated or undesignated flood hazard area or floodway may be
included within a plat as follows, subject to the approval of the City.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Included within individual lots in the subdivision, subject to the
limitations of this section.

extent of the lots and uses proposed shall conform to the Comprehensive Plan of
the City, provided such plan has been adopted by the Council and shall conform
to such other plans, including but not limited to a Transportation Master Plan,
a Sanitary Sewer System Plan, and an Open Space and Recreation Master Plan,
provided such plans have been adopted by the City.
6.Â Â Â Construction Standards for Improvements.Â  In addition to the standards set
forth in this chapter, the City Engineer shall, from time to time, prepare, and
the Council shall, from time to time, adopt by resolution, technical standards
for public improvements.Â  Such technical standards for public improvements
shall contain the minimum acceptable specifications for the construction of
public improvements.Â  Such technical standards may vary for classes of
improvements, giving due regard to the classification of streets or other
improvements, and the extent and character of the area served by the
improvements.Â  Upon adoption by the Council by resolution, such technical
standards for public improvements shall have such force and effect as if they
were fully set forth herein.
166.17Â  SITE DESIGN STANDARDS.
1.Â Â Â Site Analysis.Â  An analysis shall be made of characteristics of the
development site such as site context; geology and soil; topography; climate;
ecology; existing vegetation, structures, roadways and streets; visual
features; and past and present use of the site.
2.Â Â Â Subdivision and Site Design.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Design of the development shall take into consideration all existing
local and regional plans for the surrounding community.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Development of the site shall be based on the site analysis.Â  To the
maximum extent practicable, development shall be located to preserve the
natural features of the site, to avoid areas of environmental sensitivity, and
to minimize negative impacts and alteration of natural features.

space to the extent consistent with the reasonable utilization of land, and in
accordance with applicable State or local regulations:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Unique and/or environmentally sensitive areas, including wetlands
as defined in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended, and delineated on
National Wetland Inventory maps prepared by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
field verified by on-site inspection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Significant trees or stands of trees, defined as the largest known
individual trees of each species in the State, large trees approaching the
diameter of the known largest tree, or species or clumps of trees that are rare
to the area or of particular horticultural or landscape value.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Lands in the flood plain, as defined in Chapter 165 (Zoning
Ordinance).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Steep slopes in excess of 20% as measured over a 10-foot interval

impervious cover; to prevent flooding; to provide adequate access to lots and
sites; and to mitigate adverse effects of shadow, noise, odor, traffic,
drainage and utilities on neighboring properties.
3.Â Â Â Residential Development Design.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â In conventional developments, the Commission may vary lot areas and
dimensions, yards and setbacks for the purpose of encouraging and promoting
flexibility, economy and environmental soundness in layout and design, provided
that the average lot areas and dimensions, yards and setbacks within the
subdivision conform to the minimum requirements of Chapter 165 (Zoning
Ordinance) and provided that such standards shall be appropriate to the type of
development permitted.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Every lot shall have sufficient access to it for emergency vehicles as
well as for those needing access to the property in its intended use.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The placement of units in residential developments shall take into
consideration topography, privacy, building height, orientation, drainage and
aesthetics.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Buildings shall be spaced so that adequate privacy is provided for
units.
4.Â Â Â Commercial and Industrial Development Design.Â  Commercial and industrial
developments shall be designed according to the same principles governing the
design of residential developments; namely, buildings shall be located
according to topography, with environmentally sensitive areas avoided to the
maximum extent practicable; factors such as drainage, noise, odor and
surrounding land uses considered in siting buildings; sufficient access shall
be provided; and adverse impacts buffered.
5.Â Â Â Circulation System Design.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The road system shall be designed to permit the safe, efficient and
orderly movement of traffic; to meet, but not exceed, the needs of the present
and future population served; to have a simple and logical pattern; to respect
natural features and topography; and to present an attractive streetscape.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In residential subdivisions, the road system shall be designed to serve
the needs of the neighborhood and to discourage use by through traffic.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The pedestrian system shall be located as required for safety.Â  In
conventional developments, walks shall be placed parallel to the street, with
exceptions permitted to preserve natural features or to provide visual
interest.Â  In planned developments, walks may be placed away from the road
system, but they may also be required parallel to the street for safety
reasons.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Bikeways shall be required only if specifically indicated in the Open
Space and Recreation Master Plan.
6.Â Â Â Landscape Design.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Reasonable landscaping shall be provided at site entrances, in public
areas and adjacent to buildings.Â  The type and amount of landscaping required
shall be allowed to vary with type of development.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Plantings or other landscaping materials that best serve the intended
function shall be selected.Â  Landscaping materials shall be appropriate for the
local environment, soil conditions and availability of water. The impact of the
proposed landscaping plan at various time intervals shall also be considered.
166.18Â  OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION.
1.Â Â Â Purpose.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All subdivisions shall be required to provide a minimum amount of open
space.Â  Developed open space shall be designed to provide active recreational
facilities to serve the residents of the development.Â  Undeveloped open space
shall be designed to preserve important site amenities and environmentally
sensitive areas.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All residential subdivisions shall be so designed as to meet the
neighborhood park and open space needs of its residents as specified in the
Open Space and Recreation Master Plan.Â  Such needs may be met by dedication and
acceptance of public park land and/or by reservation by covenant of private
open space, provided there exist sufficient covenants, running with the land,
to insure adequate maintenance by the property owners benefiting from such open
space.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â When a tract being subdivided includes lands proposed to be a park site
in the Comprehensive Plan or other official plan of the City, the subdivider
shall indicate such areas on the plat.Â  Proposed park sites shall be reserved
for eighteen (18) months, giving the City or other authorized public agency the
option to purchase the land at the appraised raw land value prior to the
subdivision as established by a certified land appraiser.Â  The purchase price
shall also include one-half (1/2) of the cost for grading and paving, including
curbs, of the portion of any streets that are contiguous to the site and any
taxes and interest incurred by the subdivider between the date of reservation
and date of purchase by the public agency.Â  Should the park site not be
purchased within eighteen (18) months, the subdivider may then amend the final
plat.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Efforts shall be made to conserve natural resources and advantageously
utilize all natural features and vegetation on the property to minimize soil
erosion.Â  Consideration will be given to eliminate any form of underground or
surface water pollution.
2.Â Â Â Minimum Requirements.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Amount of Open Space Required.Â  Twenty-five percent (25%) of the tract
proposed for development shall be set aside for developed and undeveloped open
space, adjusted, as appropriate, for conditions such as population density,
existing municipal facilities, topography, socioeconomic characteristics of the
prospective population, and other appropriate site and development-specific
factors.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Size of Open Space Parcels.Â  The area of each parcel of open space
designed for active recreational purposes shall be of such size to be
functionally usable.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Location of Open Space Parcels.Â  Open space parcels shall be convenient
to the dwelling units they are intended to serve.Â  However, because of noise
generation, they shall be sited with sensitivity to surrounding development.
3.Â Â Â Improvement of Open Space Parcels.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Developed Open Space.Â  The Commission may require the installation of
recreational facilities, taking into consideration:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The character of the open space land.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The estimated age and the recreation needs of persons likely to
reside in the development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Proximity, nature and excess capacity of existing municipal
recreation facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The cost of the recreational facilities.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Undeveloped Open Space.Â  As a general principle, undeveloped open space
should be left in its natural state.Â  A developer may make certain
improvements, such as the creation of trails for walking or jogging, or the
provision of picnic areas, bikeways, etc.Â  In addition, the Commission may
require a developer to make other improvements, such as removing dead or
diseased trees, thinning trees or other vegetation to encourage more desirable
growth and grading and seeding.
4.Â Â Â Exemptions to the Standards.Â  The Commission may permit minor deviations
from open space standards when it can be determined that:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The objectives underlying these standards can be met without strict
adherence to them.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Because of peculiarities in the tract of land or the facilities
proposed, it would be unreasonable to require strict adherence to these
standards.
5.Â Â Â Deed Restrictions.Â  Any lands dedicated for open space purposes shall
contain appropriate covenants and deed restrictions approved by the City
Attorney ensuring that:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The open space area will not be further subdivided in the future.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The use of the open space will continue in perpetuity for the purpose
specified.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Appropriate provisions will be made for the maintenance of the open
space.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Common, undeveloped open space shall not be turned into a commercial
enterprise admitting the general public at a fee.
6.Â Â Â Open Space Ownership.Â  The type of ownership of land dedicated for open
space purposes shall be selected by the owner, developer or subdivider, subject
to the approval of the Commission.Â  Types of ownership may include, but are not
necessarily limited to, the following:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The City, subject to acceptance by the City Council.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Other public jurisdictions or agencies, subject to their acceptance.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Quasi-public organizations, subject to their acceptance.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Homeowner, condominium or cooperative associations or organizations.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Shared, undivided interest by all property owners in the subdivision.
7.Â Â Â Homeowners Association.Â  If the open space is owned and maintained by a
homeowner or condominium association, the developer shall file a declaration of
covenants and restrictions that will govern the association, to be submitted
with the application for the preliminary plat approval.Â  The provisions shall
include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The homeowners association must be established before the homes are
sold.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Membership must be mandatory for each homebuyer and any successive
buyer.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The open space restrictions must be permanent, not just for a period of
years.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The association must be responsible for liability insurance, local
taxes, and the maintenance of recreational and other facilities.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Homeowners must pay their pro rata share of the cost, and the
assessment levied by the association can become a lien on the property if
allowed in the master deed establishing the homeowners association.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The association must be able to adjust the assessment to meet changed
needs.
8.Â Â Â Maintenance of Open Space Areas.Â  The person or entity identified in
subsection 6 of this section as having the right of ownership or control over
the open space shall be responsible for its continuing upkeep and proper
maintenance.
166.19Â  LANDSCAPING STANDARDS.
Pursuant to Section 165.41 Tree Regulations, landscaping shall be provided.Â  It
shall be conceived in a total pattern throughout the site, integrating the
various elements of site design, preserving and enhancing the particular
identity of the site and creating a pleasing site character.
1.Â Â Â Topsoil Preservation.Â  Topsoil moved during the course of construction
shall be redistributed on all regraded surfaces so as to provide at least four
(4) inches of even cover to all disturbed areas of the development and shall be
stabilized by seeding or planting.
2.Â Â Â Removal of Debris.Â  All stumps and other tree parts, litter, brush, weeds,
excess or scrap building materials or other debris shall be removed from the
site and disposed of in accordance with the law.Â  No tree stumps, or portions
of tree trunks or limbs shall be buried anywhere in the development.Â  All dead
or dying trees, standing or fallen, shall be removed from the site.
3.Â Â Â Protection of Existing Plantings.Â  Maximum effort shall be made to save
significant plant specimens.Â  No material or temporary soil deposits shall be
placed within four (4) feet of shrubs or ten (10) feet of trees (unless
otherwise noted) designated on the landscape plan to be retained.Â  Protective
barriers shall be installed around each plant and/or group of plants that are
to remain on the site.Â  Barriers shall not be supported by the plants they are
protecting, but shall be self-supporting.Â  They shall be a minimum of four (4)
feet high and constructed of a durable material that will last until
construction is completed.Â  Snow fences and silt fences are examples of
acceptable barriers.
4.Â Â Â Slope Plantings.Â  Landscaping of all cuts and fills and/or terraces shall
be sufficient to prevent erosion, and all roadway slopes steeper than one (1)
foot vertically to three (3) feet horizontally shall be planted with ground
cover appropriate for the purpose and for soil conditions, water availability
and environment.
166.20Â  STREETS.
1.Â Â Â General.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The arrangement of streets shall conform to the circulation plan of the
Transportation Master Plan.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â For streets not shown on the Master Plan, the arrangement shall provide
for the appropriate extension of existing streets.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Local streets shall be arranged so as to discourage through traffic and
provide for maximum privacy.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The owner, developer or subdivider shall make provisions for
continuation and extension of streets and shall be done in accordance with
current City standards.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â All proposed dedications of right-of-way for streets shall be approved
in writing by the Building Official and shall conform to the requirements of
City ordinances.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The subdivider of land being subdivided shall provide the grading of
the entire street right-of-way, alley, or public place and provide appropriate
paving, including curb and gutter on all streets.Â  All streets or alleys shall
be of such width and shall be so constructed as to meet the standards of the
City, unless otherwise specified.Â  Under some circumstances, the City may
require, as a condition for approval of the final plat, dedication and
improvement of a street having a width greater or less than necessary to meet
the needs of the platted area, but necessary to complete the City street system
as it relates to both the area being platted and other areas.Â  In the event of
a greater street width, the City will pay the subdivider the difference in cost
of improving the wider street and the street width reasonable to meet the
foreseeable needs of the subdivision taken alone.Â  The streets shall, upon
final approval and acceptance by the City, become the property of the City.
2.Â Â Â Street Hierarchy.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Streets shall be classified in a street hierarchy system with design
standard relating to function, as specified by the Federal Highway
Administration Functional Classification and administered by the Iowa
Department of Transportation.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The subdivider shall demonstrate to the Commissionâs satisfaction that
the distribution of traffic to the proposed street system will not exceed the
ADT thresholds for that street type.
3.Â Â Â Street Standards.Â  The following standards shall apply to all streets to
be located within the subdivision:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Streets shall provide for the continuation of major thoroughfares from
adjoining platted areas and the extension of major thoroughfares into adjoining
unplatted areas.Â  Where a plat encompasses the location for a major
thoroughfare proposed in the Comprehensive Plan or the Transportation Master
Plan, the plat shall provide for such street.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Street grades shall align to existing streets and all grades for
streets shall be as approved by the City.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Major thoroughfares shall be located so as to not require direct access
from the major thoroughfares to abutting lots.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Street right-of-way widths and pavement width shall be as specified in
the Comprehensive Plan, the Transportation Master Plan or technical standards
for public improvements.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Half-streets are prohibited, except where an existing platted half-
street abuts the subdivision.Â  A platted half-street to complete the street
shall then be required.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Minor streets should be designed to discourage through traffic while
safely connecting to major thoroughfares.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty-
five (125) feet are prohibited.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Streets shall intersect as nearly at right angles as possible, and no
street shall intersect any other street at less than sixty (60) degrees.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â At intersections of major streets and otherwise as necessary, lot
corners abutting the intersection shall be rounded with a radius sufficient to
provide necessary space within the right-of-way for sidewalks, traffic control
devices and other necessary improvements without encroachment onto the corner
lots.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Dead-end streets are prohibited, except where a street is planned to
continue past the subdividerâs property, a temporary dead end may be allowed.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Streets which connect with other streets or loop streets are preferred
over cul-de-sacs for reasons pertaining to maintenance, fire protection and
vehicular circulation.Â  Cul-de-sacs, although permitted, shall be allowed on a
limited basis and only when the developer can show that connecting streets or
loop streets will prevent the property from being fully developed.
Â Â Â L.Â Â Â Dead-end alleys shall be provided with a turn-around with a minimum
right-of-way diameter of one hundred twenty-five (125) feet.
Â Â Â M.Â Â Â When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal lots or parcels,
such lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to permit the logical location and
opening of future streets and appropriate resubdivision with provision for
adequate utility connection for such resubdivision.Â  Easements for the future
openings and extensions for such streets or utilities may, at the discretion of
the Council, be made a requirement of the plat.
Â Â Â N.Â Â Â Streets which are, or will become, extensions of existing streets shall
be given the same name as the existing streets.Â  New street names shall not be
the same or sound similar to existing street names.Â  All street names shall be
at the approval of the Council.
Â Â Â O.Â Â Â The Council may approve a private street provided adequate covenants or
other legal documents ensure that the City will not have or need to assume any
maintenance or other responsibility for such street.
4.Â Â Â Curbs and Gutters.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Curb requirements shall vary according to street hierarchy and
intensity of development in accordance with City standards.Â  Curbing may also
be required:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â For storm water management.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â To stabilize pavement edge at intersections, corners and/or tight
radius curves.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â To delineate parking areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Ten (10) feet on each side of drainage inlets.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where curbing is not required, some sort of edge definition and
stabilization shall be furnished for safety reasons and to prevent pavement
unraveling.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Where curbing is required, this requirement may be waived and shoulders
and/or drainage swales used when it can be shown that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Shoulders are required by State regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Soil or topography make the use of shoulders and/or drainage swales
preferable.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â It is in the best interest of the community to preserve its rural
character by using shoulders and/or drainage swales instead of curbs.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â At medium development intensity, the curbing requirement may be waived
where front setbacks exceed forty (40) feet and it can be demonstrated that
sufficient on-site parking exists.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Flexibility regarding curb type shall be permitted as long as the curb
type accommodates the system of drainage proposed.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Curb ramps shall be provided for all sidewalks and bikeways in
accordance with requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA)
Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities.
5.Â Â Â Shoulders.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Shoulders and/or drainage swales shall be required instead of curbs
when:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Shoulders are required by State standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Soil or topography make the use of shoulders and/or drainage swales
preferable.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â It is in the best interest of the community to serve its rural
character by using shoulders and/or drainage swales instead of curbs.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Shoulder requirements shall vary according to street classification and
intensity of development in accordance with City standards.
6.Â Â Â Sidewalks.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Sidewalks shall be required depending on road classification and
intensity of development.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where sidewalks are optional, the subdivider may be required, if close
to pedestrian generators, to continue a walk on an existing street, and/or to
link areas depending on probable future development.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â In conventional developments, sidewalks shall be placed in the right-
of-way, parallel to the street, unless an exception has been permitted to
preserve topographical or natural features or to provide visual interest, or
unless the applicant shows that an alternative pedestrian system provides safe
and convenient circulation.Â  In commercial and in high-density residential
areas, sidewalks may abut the curb.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â In planned developments, sidewalks may be located away from the road
system to link dwelling units with other dwelling units, the street and on-site
activity centers such as parking areas and recreation and/or open space areas.Â 
They may also be required parallel to the street for safety and other reasons.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Pedestrian-way easements shall be a minimum width of ten (10) feet and
may be required by the Commission through the center of blocks greater than 700
feet long to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping or
other community facilities.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Sidewalks shall measure four (4) feet in width; wider widths may be
necessary near pedestrian generators and employment centers.Â  Where sidewalks
abut the curb and cars overhang the sidewalk, width shall be five (5) feet.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Sidewalks shall be constructed according to City standards.
7.Â Â Â Bikeways.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Separate bicycle paths shall be required only if such paths have been
specified as part of the Cityâs adopted Open Space and Recreation Master Plan.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Bikeways shall be constructed according to the Iowa DOT publication
titled The Iowa Statewide Recreational Trails Plan.
8.Â Â Â Utility and Shade Tree Areas.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Utilities and shade trees shall generally be located within the right-
of-way on both sides of and parallel to the street.Â  Shade trees may also be
placed outside the public right-of-way as per Section 165.41 of the Zoning
Ordinance.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Utility and shade tree areas shall be planted with grass or ground
cover, or treated with other suitable cover material.
9.Â Â Â Right-of-Way.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The right-of-way shall be measured from lot line to lot line and shall
be sufficiently wide to contain the traveled way, curbs, shoulders, sidewalks,
graded areas, utilities and shade trees (if they are placed within the right-
of-way), and bikeways.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The right-of-way width of a new street that is a continuation of an
existing street shall in no case be continued at a width less than that of the
existing street.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The right-of-way shall reflect future roadway/street development within
the subdivision.
10.Â Â Â Underground Wiring.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All electric, telephone, television and other communication lines, both
main and service connections, servicing new developments shall be provided by
underground wiring within easements or dedicated public rights-of-way,
installed in accordance with the prevailing standards and practices of the
utility or other companies providing such services.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Lots that abut existing easements or public rights-of-way where
overhead electric or telephone distribution supply lines and service
connections have previously been installed may be supplied with electric and
telephone service from those overhead lines, but the service connections from
the utilitiesâ overhead lines shall be installed underground.Â  In the case of
existing overhead utilities, should a road widening, or an extension of
service, or other such condition occur as a result of the subdivision and
necessitate the replacement or relocation of such utilities, such replacement
or relocation shall be underground.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Where overhead lines are permitted as the exception, the placement and
alignment of poles shall be designed to lessen the visual impact of overhead
lines.Â  Alignments and pole locations shall be carefully routed to avoid
locations along horizons; clearing swaths through treed areas shall be avoided
by selective cutting and a staggered alignment and trees shall be planted in
open areas and at key locations to minimize the view of the poles.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Year-round screening of any utility apparatus appearing above the
surface of the ground, other than utility poles, shall be required.
11.Â Â Â Signs.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Design and placement of traffic signs shall follow Iowa Department of
Transportation (DOT) regulations.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â At least two street name signs shall be placed at each four-way street
intersection, and one at each âTâ intersection.Â  Signs shall be installed as
per City standards and free of visual obstruction.Â  The design of street name
signs shall be consistent of a style appropriate to the community and of a
uniform size and color.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Site information signs in planned developments shall follow a design
theme that is related and complementary to other elements of the overall site
design.
12.Â Â Â Block and Lot Standards.Â  The following standards shall apply to the
layout of blocks and lots in all subdivisions and, to the extent possible, in
all resubdivisions:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No residential block shall be longer than thirteen hundred (1,300) feet
measured from street line to street line.Â  The width of blocks should be
arranged so as to allow two tiers of lots, with utility and pedestrian
easements.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In blocks over seven hundred (700) feet in length, the Council may
require a public way or an easement at least ten (10) feet in width, at or near
the center of the block, for use by pedestrians and/or bicyclists.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The size and shape of blocks or lots intended for commercial or
industrial use shall be adequate to provide the use intended and to meet the
parking, loading and other requirements for such uses contained in the Zoning
Ordinance.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will provide
satisfactory building sites, properly related to topography and surrounding
land uses.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The size and shape of all lots shall comply with all requirements of
the Zoning Ordinance for the zone in which the lot is located.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â All lots shall abut a public street or an approved private street with
a minimum frontage of sixty (60) feet measured as a straight line between the
two front lot corners, except frontage on a radius may have a minimum frontage
of not less than thirty-five (35) feet.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Unless unavoidable, lots shall not front or have direct access to major
thoroughfares.Â  Where unavoidable, lots shall be so arranged as to minimize the
number of access points.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â All lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or
radial to curved street lines, except where, in the judgment of the Council, a
variation to this provision will provide a better street and lot layout.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Corner lots shall have sufficient extra width to permit the required
front yard setback as specified in the Zoning Ordinance, oriented to either
street.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Double frontage lots shall only be permitted where abutting a major
street and a minor street, and such lots shall front only on the minor street.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Any lot to be served by a private sanitary sewage system shall have
sufficient area to allow for a satisfactory drain field.Â  No subdivision to be
served by septic systems shall be approved by the Council until percolation
tests have been performed and the results of said tests have been provided to
and reported on by the City Engineer.Â  Furthermore, no subdivision served by a
private sanitary sewage system within the Cityâs jurisdiction shall be approved
by the Council unless adequate covenants and/or other legal documents ensure
that the City will not have or need to assume any maintenance or other
responsibility for such system.Â  The system shall also comply with all City,
County and State standards and specifications.
166.21Â  OFF-STREET PARKING.
1.Â Â Â Number of Spaces.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â An adequate number of off-street parking spaces shall be required in
all developments to accommodate residents and visitors.Â  See Section 165.33 of
the Zoning Ordinance.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â For residential developments, off-street parking shall be provided as
set forth in Section 165.33 of the Zoning Ordinance.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â For nonresidential developments, off-street parking standards shall be
provided as set forth in Section 165.33 of the Zoning Ordinance.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Alternative off-street parking standards shall be accepted if the
subdivider, developer or owner demonstrates that such standards better reflect
local conditions.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â For mixed-use developments, a shared parking approach to the provision
of off-street parking shall be permitted.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Where the total number of off-street parking spaces required is not
immediately required for a particular use, a staged development plan may be
permitted requiring that only a portion of the parking area, but not less than
sixty-five percent (65%) of the required spaces, be completed initially,
subject to the following regulations:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The site plan shall clearly indicate both that portion of the
parking area to be paved initially and the total parking needed to provide the
number of spaces required.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The site plan shall provide for adequate drainage of both the
partial and total parking areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The portion of the parking area not to be paved initially shall be
landscaped with a ground cover to prevent erosion.Â  The ground cover shall be
appropriate for soil conditions, water availability and the environment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The subdivider shall post a performance bond reflecting the cost of
installing the additional parking facilities necessary to provide the total
number of parking spaces required.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â In lieu of a permanent certificate of occupancy, a temporary
certificate of occupancy shall be issued for a period of two (2) years.Â  Prior
to the expiration of the two-year period, the subdivider may either install the
additional parking shown on the site plan and apply for issuance of a permanent
certificate of occupancy or apply to the Commission after the use has been in
operation a minimum of eighteen (18) months for a determination as to whether
or not the initial parking area provided is adequate.Â  If the Commission
determines that the parking facility is adequate as originally constructed, the
performance guarantees shall be released and a permanent certificate of
occupancy issued.Â  If, however, the Commission determines that the partial off-
street parking area is not adequate, the subdivider shall be required to
install the additional parking facilities in accordance with the terms of the
performance bond prior to issuance of a permanent certificate of occupancy.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Any change of use on a site for which the Commission may have
approved a partial paving of off-street parking areas to a use which requires
more parking spaces than are provided on the site shall require submission of a
new site plan.
2.Â Â Â Size of Spaces.Â  See Section 165.33 of the Zoning Ordinance.
3.Â Â Â Parking Areas.Â  See Section 165.33 of the Zoning Ordinance.
166.22Â  WATER SUPPLY.
1.Â Â Â General.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All installations shall be properly connected to an approved and
functioning City water supply system.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Depending on the number of housing units, residential subdivisions
shall be connected to an existing public water supply system if public service
is available.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If a public water supply system is to be provided to the area within a
six-year period as indicated in a municipal water master plan, official map or
other official document, the City may require installation of a capped system,
or dry lines (mains only) within the road right-of-way; or the City may require
a payment in lieu of the improvement.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â All proposals for new public community water supplies or extensions to
existing public water systems or the installation of dry lines or use of wells
and other water sources shall be approved by the City Engineer and meet City
standards and State specifications.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Under some circumstances, the City may require as a condition for
approval of the plat installation of a water supply system that is larger than
necessary to meet the needs of the platted area but necessary to complete the
City water supply system as it relates to both the area being platted and other
areas.Â  In such event, the City will determine the over-sizing needs and size
of pipe and pay the subdivider the difference in cost of pipe and installation
between the larger water line and the diameter of water line reasonable to meet
the foreseeable needs of the area.
2.Â Â Â Capacity.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The water supply system shall be adequate to handle the necessary flow
based on complete development.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The demand rates for all uses shall be considered in computing the
total system demand.Â  Where fire protection is provided, the system shall be
capable of providing the required fire demand plus the required domestic
demand.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The water system shall be designed to carry peak-hour flows and be
capable of delivering the peak hourly demands.
3.Â Â Â System Design and Placement.Â  System design and placement shall comply
with all City specifications and ordinances.
4.Â Â Â Alternative Private Systems for Water.Â  Where connection to the City water
system cannot reasonably be made, the City may approve alternate private
facilities for the distribution of water or the collection and disposal of
sanitary wastes.Â  Such alternate private systems shall be designed to fully
protect the public health, safety and welfare and shall meet all requirements
of State, County or other applicable health regulations.Â  Prior to granting
approval of such alternate private systems, the City shall require that the
owner and subdivider provide to the City a waiver of assessment protest or such
other legally binding documents necessary to protect the City from the expense
of the subsequent installation of water facilities.
166.23Â  SANITARY SEWERS.
1.Â Â Â General.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The subdivider of the land being platted shall make adequate provision
for the disposal of sanitary sewage from the platted area with due regard being
given to present or reasonably foreseeable needs.Â  There shall be constructed,
at the subdividerâs expense, a sanitary sewer system including all necessary
pumping stations, pumping equipment, manholes and all other necessary or
desirable appurtenances to provide for the discharge of sanitary sewage from
all lots or parcels of land within the platted area to a connection with the
Cityâs sanitary sewers.Â  The sanitary sewer system shall be constructed in
accordance with the plans and specifications of the City.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Under some circumstances, the City may require as a condition for
approval of the plat installation of a sanitary sewer that is larger than
necessary to meet the needs of the platted area but necessary to complete the
City sanitary sewer system as it relates to both the area being platted and
other areas.Â  In such event, the City will determine the over-sizing needs and
size of pipe and pay the subdivider the difference in cost of pipe and
installation between the larger sewer and the diameter of sewer reasonable to
meet the foreseeable needs of the area.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â All installations shall be properly connected to an approved and
functioning sanitary sewer system prior to the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Depending on the number of housing units, residential subdivisions
shall be connected to an existing public sanitary sewer system if public
service is available.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â If a public system is not in place or cannot be extended, the developer
must provide subsurface disposal systems where appropriate, given site density,
soil, slope and other conditions and subject to applicable State, City and
County regulations.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â If a public sanitary sewer system will be provided to the area within a
six-year period as indicated in a municipal sewer master plan, official map or
other official document, the City may require installation of a capped system
or âdry linesâ (mains only), within the road right-of-way; or the City may
require a payment in lieu of the improvement.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â All proposals for new public sanitary sewer systems, or extensions to
existing public sewer systems or the installation of âdry linesâ or the use of
subsurface disposal systems, shall be approved by the City, State or other
officially designated unit of government and meet all City standards and State
specifications.
2.Â Â Â System Design and Placement.Â  The sanitary sewer system shall be adequate
to handle the necessary flow based on complete development.Â  System design and
placement shall comply with City, State and County specifications.
166.24Â  STORM WATER MANAGEMENT.
1.Â Â Â The subdivider of land being platted shall install and construct a storm
water management system adequate to serve the area, including anticipated
extension of use to serve additional areas.Â  The storm water system shall be
constructed in accordance with the standard plans and specifications of the
City.
2.Â Â Â Under some circumstances, the City may require as a condition for approval
of the plat installation of a storm water system that is larger than necessary
to meet the needs of the platted area but necessary to complete the City storm
water system as it relates to both the area being platted and other areas.Â  In
such event, the City will pay the subdivider the difference in cost of pipe and
installation between the larger system and the system proposed to meet the
foreseeable needs of the area.
3.Â Â Â Design of the storm water management system shall be consistent with
general and specific concerns, values and standards of the City and applicable
County, regional and State storm drainage control programs.Â  Design shall be
based on environmentally sound site planning and engineering techniques.
4.Â Â Â The best available technology shall be used to minimize off-site storm
water runoff, increase on-site infiltration, encourage natural filtration
functions, simulate natural drainage systems and minimize off-site discharge of
pollutants to ground and surface water.Â  Best available technology may include
measures such as retention basins, recharge trenches, porous paving and piping,
contour terraces and swales.
166.25Â  PERFORMANCE AND MAINTENANCE MECHANISMS.
Performance and maintenance guarantees shall be provided by a variety of means
including, but not limited to, the following:
1.Â Â Â Security Bond.Â  The applicant may obtain a security bond from a surety
bonding company authorized to do business in the State.

Â 
167.01Â  PURPOSE.
The Site Plan Review procedure provides for special review in addition to plan
review required by other regulations and/or sections of this Code of projects
that have potentially significant effects on traffic circulation or a
significant effect on land uses in adjacent neighborhoods.Â  The procedure
provides for review and evaluation of site development features and possible
mitigation of unfavorable effects on surrounding property.Â  It is the intent
and purpose of this chapter to establish a procedure which will enable the City
to plan for and review certain proposed improvements of property within
specified zoning districts of the City in order to accomplish the following:
1.Â Â Â Promote and permit flexibility that will encourage a more creative and
imaginative approach in development and result in a more efficient, aesthetic,
desirable and economic use of land;
2.Â Â Â Provide minimal effect upon adjacent properties and existing development
(to this end, the Planning and Zoning Commission may make appropriate
requirements);
3.Â Â Â Promote development that can be conveniently, efficiently and economically
served by existing municipal utilities and services or by their logical
extension;
4.Â Â Â Provide for the enhancement of the natural setting through careful and
sensitive placement of manmade facilities and plant materials;
5.Â Â Â Encourage adequate provision for surface and subsurface drainage in order
to assure that future development of other areas of the City will be available;
6.Â Â Â Provide suitable screening of parking, truck loading, refuse disposal,
outdoor storage areas and noise from adjacent and nearby property.
167.02Â  INITIAL REVIEW PROCEDURE.
1.Â Â Â A site plan review is required whenever a person or other group wishes to
develop any tract or parcel of land within all zoning districts, except for any
detached single-family residence and two-family residences including any
accessory structure thereto; new construction of nonresidential accessory
buildings less than 1,000 square feet in gross floor area; and additions to
existing nonresidential buildings when the addition is less than ten percent
(10%) of the existing buildingâs gross floor area or the addition does not
exceed one thousand (1,000) square feet, whichever is more restrictive.Â  Said
person shall cause to be prepared a site plan of such development and shall
submit nine (9) copies of said site plan to the Building Official for review.Â 
An additional seven (7) copies will be submitted at the time of review by the
Council.Â  The provisions of this section shall be applicable to the
redevelopment, enlargement or extension of any commercial or industrial uses
and structures existing as of January 1, 2003.Â  The site plan shall contain
such information and data as outlined herein.
2.Â Â Â A copy of the site plan shall be referred to the Building Official, or
such other person as shall be designated from time to time by the Council, who
shall review said site plan as to its compliance with the ordinances of the
City, its effect upon public utilities and the public street system.
3.Â Â Â Whenever any person proposes to develop any tract or parcel of land or
modify any existing development which requires a site plan submittal, a pre-
application conference is required.Â  The conference shall include the applicant
or representative, the City Building Official, and the Public Works Director.Â 
The purpose of the conference shall be to acquaint the City Staff with proposed
development and to acquaint the applicant or representative with the procedures
and with any special problems that might relate to the development.Â  The
applicant shall furnish a legal description of the property to be developed at
the time of the pre-application conference.
4.Â Â Â The Building Official shall forward a copy of the site plan to each member
of the Planning and Zoning Commission.Â  The Commission shall, after receiving
the Building Officialâs report, review the site plan for conformity with the
regulations and design standards contained herein, and may confer with the
developer on changes deemed advisable in such site plan.
5.Â Â Â The Commission shall consider the site plan within thirty (30) days of the
date of submission of the site plan.
6.Â Â Â The Commission may, in its discretion, hold a public hearing on the site
plan of the proposed development and prescribe the notice thereof and to whom
such notice shall be given.
7.Â Â Â The Commission shall, upon receipt of the recommendation of the Building
Official, either approve or deny the site plan.
8.Â Â Â No building permit for any structure, for which a site plan is required,
shall be issued until the site plan has been approved as provided.
9.Â Â Â Upon final action by the Commission on any site plan, a copy of said site
plan with the action of the Commission noted thereon and signed by the
Chairperson shall be filed with the City Clerk.
10.Â Â Â If the Building Official finds that any construction or proposed
construction or occupancy of a development on a tract of land for which a site
plan has been approved will not comply with the site plan as approved, or if
the Building Official finds that the construction and development of the tract
is not being carried out in accordance with the development schedule filed with
the site plan, the Building Official shall suspend all building permits for the
development and order all construction stopped until such time as the owner of
the project, or any successors in interest, shall have provided the Building
Official with proof satisfactory to said Building Official that the site plan
will be complied with.Â  Any person aggrieved by any decision or action of the
Building Official under this subsection may appeal such action or decision to
the Board of Adjustment.
11.Â Â Â If the owner or developer of a tract of land for which a site plan has
been approved determines that an extension of time is necessary or that a
modification of the site plan would provide for a more appropriate or more
practicable development of the site, the owner or developer may apply for an
amendment of the site plan.Â  The Commission may grant an extension of time or a
modification of a previously approved site plan if it determines that such
modification of the site plan would provide for a more appropriate development
of the site.
167.03Â  DESIGN STANDARDS.
1.Â Â Â The standards of design are intended as minimum requirements so that the
general arrangement and layout of the development requiring the site plan may
be adjusted to a wide variety of circumstances.
2.Â Â Â All proposed developments for which site plans are required shall conform
to the Comprehensive Plan of the City and the provisions of the Zoning
Regulations, the Subdivision Regulations, if applicable; and all other
applicable City ordinances and statutes and regulations of the State.
3.Â Â Â The proposed development shall have such entrances and exits upon public
streets as are necessary for safety and the general welfare of the public.Â  The
development shall have such interior drives as are necessary for free movement
of emergency vehicles and shall have such pedestrian walkways as are necessary
for safety and general welfare of the public.Â  The proposed development shall
have such entrances and exits upon adjacent streets and such internal traffic
circulation pattern which will not unduly increase congestion on adjacent or
surrounding public streets or create undue hazards to traffic safety.
4.Â Â Â The proposed development shall be designed with a proper regard to
topography, surface drainage, natural drains and streams, wooded areas, and
other natural features.Â  The design of the proposed improvements shall make
adequate provisions for surface and subsurface drainage, so as not to increase
the danger of erosion, flooding, landslide or other endangerment of adjoining
or surrounding property.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The plan must provide for adequate routing of downspout discharge, sump
pump and footing drain discharge and parking lot runoff.Â  Storm water may not
be directed out driveways into the City right-of-way, except where permitted by
City.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Storm water shall be collected and piped to a storm sewer where a storm
sewer is available within three hundred (300) feet from the property line.Â  The
storm sewer systemâs pipes and intakes shall be capable of conveying runoff
from a five-year recurrence interval storm from the site and tributary upstream
areas.Â  Storm water runoff calculations shall be made utilizing the Soil
Conservation Service methods as presented in Technical Release No. 55, Urban
Hydrology for Small Watersheds, Soil Conservation Service, U.S. Department of
Agriculture.Â  The Building Official may waive this requirement, provided the
area to be developed is less than ten thousand (10,000) square feet.Â  The
calculations shall be certified by an engineer, architect or landscape
architect registered in the State of Iowa and familiar with such calculations.
5.Â Â Â The proposed development shall be designed with adequate water mains,
provisions for sanitary sewage facilities, storm sewers (storm sewers to be
designed for 5-year storm calculations) and drains and flood control, in
accordance with the ordinances and regulations of the City and statutes and
regulations of the State and good engineering practice to protect the public
health and welfare and not overload any existing public utilities.Â  Storm water
drainage shall emphasize on-site storm water management or retention.Â  Storm
water detention is required for all sites larger than one acre in size, unless
it is determined by the Building Department to be unnecessary or impractical.Â 
The maximum allowable discharge rate from the storm water detention facility
will be limited to that from a five-year return frequency storm after
development of the site or to the proportionate capacity of existing downstream
sewers and drainage ways during a five-year storm which was utilized by the
runoff from the site prior to the development, whichever discharge rate is
less.Â  Storm water runoff and storm water detention facilities shall be
determined using the method prescribed in paragraph B of subsection 4 of this
section.Â  The discharge rate shall be controlled at the detention facilities
outlets and not in the storm sewer size serving the site.
6.Â Â Â The proposed development shall be designed and the buildings and
improvements located in such a manner as not to unduly diminish or impair the
use and enjoyment of adjoining or surrounding property and to such end shall
have such buffers, screen fences and landscaping as may be proper and shall
minimize the adverse effects on such adjoining property from automobile
headlights, illuminations of required perimeter yards, refuse containers, and
impairment of light and air.Â  For the purpose of this section, the term âuse
and enjoyment of adjoining propertyâ means the use and enjoyment presently
being made of such adjoining property, unless such property is vacant.Â  If
vacant, the term âuse and enjoyment of adjoining propertyâ means those uses
permitted under the zoning district in which such adjoining property is
located.
7.Â Â Â The proposed development shall not unduly increase the public danger of
fire or diminish the public safety, and shall be designed to adequately
safeguard the health, safety and general welfare of the public and of persons
residing and working in the development and in the adjoining or surrounding
property.
8.Â Â Â The proposed development and all structures therein shall be designed in
such a manner as to create a quality environment and shall be architecturally
and aesthetically harmonious and attractive.
167.04Â  SITE PLAN REQUIREMENTS.
1.Â Â Â Site plans shall be drawn on sheets no larger than 24 inches by 36
inches.Â  Where the size of the site precludes all required information from
being shown on a sheet, the Building Official may permit a larger sheet size or
an increase in scale.Â  A reduced copy of the site plan on a sheet 11 inches by
14 inches shall also be submitted.
2.Â Â Â All site plans shall be drawn at a scale not less than 1" = 50'.Â  Four (4)

168.03Â  AIRPORT ZONES.
In order to carry out the provisions of this section there are hereby created
and established certain zones which are described herein and depicted on the
Mason City Airport Zoning Map, which is hereby made a part of this chapter.Â 
Any structure or tree located in more than one zone is considered to be only in
the zone with the more restrictive height and use limitation.Â  The various
zones hereby established and defined are as follows.
1.Â Â Â Approach Overlay Zone - (AO) Defined.Â  The airspace above a sloping plane
extending outward from each end of each runway, rising uniformly at a fixed
ratio, and of fixed size, through which aircraft commonly operate when arriving
at, and departing from, the airport.Â  AO zones vary in size and slope based
upon the present or future use that can be expected for each airport runway.Â 
The AO Zones at the airport are as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Runway 36 (AO36).Â  Beginning 200 feet beyond the paved portion at the
end of the runway and centered on the extended centerline of the runway, the
inner edge of the zone is 1,000 feet wide, expanding uniformly to an outer edge
width of 16,000 feet. The altitude of the inner edge is the same as the
altitude of the runway threshold at the centerline. For each 50 feet of
horizontal distance the floor of the zone rises from the inner edge one foot
(50:1) for a distance of 10,000 feet, and for an additional 40,000 feet, for
each 40 feet of horizontal distance, rising at a rate of one foot (40:1.)
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Runway 18 (AO18).Â  Beginning 200 feet beyond the paved portion at the
end of the runway and centered on the extended centerline of the runway, the
inner edge of the zone is 1,000 feet wide, expanding uniformly to an outer edge
width of 16,000 feet. The altitude of the inner edge is the same as the
altitude of the runway threshold at the centerline. For each 50 feet of
horizontal distance the floor of the zone rises from the inner edge one foot
(50:1) for a distance of 10,000 feet, and for an additional 40,000 feet, for
each 40 feet of horizontal distance, rising at a rate of one foot (40:1.)
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Runway 30 (AO30).Â  Beginning 200 feet beyond the paved portion at each
end of the runway and centered on the extended centerline of the runway, the
inner edge of each zone is 500 feet wide, expanding uniformly to an outer edge
width of 3,500 feet. The altitude of the inner edge is the same as the altitude
of the runway threshold at the centerline. The floor of the zone rises from the
inner edge one foot for each 34 feet of horizontal distance (34:1), for a
distance of 10,000 feet.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Runway 12 (AO12).Â  Beginning 200 feet beyond the paved portion at each
end of the runway and centered on the extended centerline of the runway, the
inner edge of each zone is 500 feet wide, expanding uniformly to an outer edge
width of 3,500 feet. The altitude of the inner edge is the same as the altitude
of the runway threshold at the centerline. The floor of the zone rises from the
inner edge one foot for each 34 feet of horizontal distance (34:1), for a
distance of 10,000 feet.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Height Limitations.Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided herein, no person shall construct or
alter any structure, nor plant or grow any tree, so as to penetrate any
Approach Overlay Zone created herein.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â No person shall establish or maintain any private roadway in any
location that would result in penetration of any AO zone by any portion of any
vehicle that shall be permitted to operate upon such roadway.
2.Â Â Â Controlled Activity Zone - (CA) Defined.Â  An area of fixed size,
underlying the innermost portion (closest to the runway end) of the AO zone for
that runway, descending from the floor of the AO zone to the ground. The width
and length of CA zones may vary, and may be different on each runway end. The
CA zones for the airport are as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Runway 36 (CA36).Â  Underlying the innermost 2,500 feet of the AO zone
at the south end of the runway, the width of the CA zone is 1,000 feet at the
inner edge and expands uniformly to a width of 1,750 feet.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Runway 18 (CA18).Â  Underlying the innermost 2,500 feet of the AO zone
at the south end of the runway, the width of the CA zone is 1,000 feet at the
inner edge and expands uniformly to a width of 1,750 feet.

AO zone at each end of the runway, the width of each CA zone is 1,000 feet at
the inner edge, expanding uniformly to a width of 1,510 feet.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Use Limitation.Â  No person shall establish or maintain any non-
compatible use in any Controlled Activity Zone.
3.Â Â Â Horizontal Overlay Zone - (HO) Defined. The airspace above a horizontal
plane, the perimeter of which is established by swinging arcs of 10,000 foot
radii from the center of the inner edge of the AO zones of runways 36, 18, and
30, and an arc of 5,000 foot radius from the center of the inner edge of the AO
zone of runway 12, and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those
arcs.Â  The floor of the HO zone is 150 feet above the airport elevation, or
1363 feet above mean sea level.Â  Except as otherwise provided herein, no person
shall construct or alter any structure, or plant or grow any tree, so as to
penetrate the Horizontal Overlay Zone created herein.
4.Â Â Â Transitional Overlay Zone - (TO) Defined.Â  The airspace above a sloping
plane rising from the sides of each runway and from the sides of each AO zone
at the rate of 1 foot of elevation for each 7 feet horizontally (7:1). The TO
zones for the airport are as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Runway 36 (TO36).Â  Along each side of the runway, beginning at a point
500 feet from the center line of the runway and at right angles to the runway
center line, and from each side of the AO zone at the south end of the runway,
at right angles to the extended runway center line. The TO zone is interrupted
at the point where it intersects the HO zone, and resumes at the outer edge of
the CO zone (see subsection 5 below) and continues outward for a distance of
5,000 feet from the edge of the AO zone.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Runway 18 (TO18).Â  Along each side of the runway, beginning at a point

point 500 feet from the center line of the runway and at right angles to the
runway center line, and from each side of the AO zone at each end of the runway
at right angles to the extended runway center line.Â  The TO zone ends at the
point where it intersects the HO zone.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Height Limitations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided herein, no person shall construct or
alter any structure, or plant or grow any tree, so as to penetrate any
Transitional Overlay Zone created herein.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â No person shall establish or maintain any private roadway in any
location that would result in penetration of any Transitional Overlay Zone by
any portion of any vehicle that shall be permitted to operate upon such
roadway.
5.Â Â Â Conical Overlay Zone - (CO) Defined.Â  The airspace above a sloped
horizontal plane beginning at the periphery of the HO zone and rising one foot
in height for each 20 feet horizontally (20:1) for a horizontal distance of
4,000 feet.Â  Except as otherwise provided herein, no person shall construct or
alter any structure, or plant or grow any tree, so as to penetrate the Conical
Overlay Zone created herein.
168.04Â  GENERAL ZONING REGULATIONS.
1.Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided herein, no person shall construct or alter
any structure in any zone created herein without having first obtained a
building permit from the Building Official or a Zoning Permit from the Zoning
Administrator.Â  No person shall be issued a permit for any construction or
alteration without a determination or finding from the FAA. (See Section 168.06
(2).Â  Such finding or determination shall not find or determine that the
proposed construction or alteration:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Would create a hazard.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Would establish a non-compatible use.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Would endanger the general safety, health and welfare of persons in the
vicinity of the airport, or occupants of aircraft in flight.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Would result in the raising of the minimum instrument flight altitude
of any Federal Airway, approved off-airway route, or instrument approach
procedure to the airport.
2.Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided herein, no person shall occupy any structure
in any zone created herein without having first obtained an occupancy permit
from the Building Official or Zoning Administrator. No person shall be issued
an occupancy permit for any non-compatible use.
3.Â Â Â No person shall establish or maintain any private roadway in any location
that would result in penetration of any zone created herein by any portion of
any vehicle that shall be permitted to operate upon such roadway.
4.Â Â Â Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no person shall, in
any zone created by this chapter, or upon any land or water underlying such
zones:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Establish any putrescible waste landfill or open air composting

1 has been submitted in accordance with subsection 2 of this section, and that
thirty (30) days or more have elapsed since said submission.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The FAA has not issued a determination in response to the applicable
FAA form 7460-1.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The applicant agrees that should the subsequent FAA determination, when
issued, find that the proposed construction or alteration constitutes a hazard,
or otherwise fails to comply with Section 168.04 of this chapter, that the
construction or alteration shall be revised and/or reconstructed so as to
alleviate the condition which the determination has found to be adverse.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The applicant further agrees that required revision and/or
reconstruction shall be completed within 120 days of the issuance of the FAA
determination.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The applicant further agrees that failure to revise or reconstruct
as provided herein constitutes a nuisance, and is subject to abatement in
accordance with applicable law.
168.07Â  NON-CONFORMITIES.
1.Â Â Â The regulations prescribed herein are not retroactive and shall not be
construed to require the removal of any tree, or the reconstruction or
alteration, or the discontinuation of any use of any structure made non-
conforming by the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter.
2.Â Â Â Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction or
alteration, or the intended use of any structure, the construction or
alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of the ordinance
codified in this chapter, and which is completed within one year thereafter.
3.Â Â Â No pre-existing non-conforming structure, use, or tree shall be rebuilt,
altered, allowed to grow higher, or be replanted, so as to constitute a greater
airport hazard than it was at the time that these regulations were adopted.
4.Â Â Â Whenever the Building Official or Zoning Administrator determines that a
non-conforming structure has been abandoned, or more than 50% torn down,
physically deteriorated, damaged, or decayed, no building permit or occupancy
permit shall be issued that would allow such structure to exceed the applicable
height and use provisions of this chapter.Â  Any tree so damaged or destroyed
shall be subject to the provisions of Section 168.04 (C) of this chapter.
5.Â Â Â Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this section the owner of any
pre-existing non-conforming structure or tree shall be required to permit the
installation, operation, or maintenance thereon of any markers and/or lights as
shall be deemed necessary by the City or County to indicate to the operators of

It is recommended that a simple numerical sequence be used in assigning
ordinance numbers to ordinances as they are passed.Â  For example, if the
ordinance adopting the Code of Ordinances was No. 163, we would suggest that
the first ordinance passed changing, adding to or deleting from the Code be
assigned the number 164; the next ordinance be assigned the number 165, and so
on.Â  We advise against using the Code of Ordinances numbering system for the
numbering of ordinances.
RETENTION OF AMENDING ORDINANCES
Please note that two books should be maintained:Â  (1) the Code of Ordinances,
and (2) an ordinance book.Â  We will assist in the maintenance of the Code of
Ordinances book, per the Supplement Agreement, by revising and returning
appropriate pages for the Code of Ordinances book as required to accommodate
ordinances amending the Code.Â  The City Clerk is responsible for maintaining
the ordinance book and must be sure that an original copy of each ordinance
adopted, bearing the signatures of the Mayor and Clerk, is inserted in the
ordinance book and preserved in a safe place.
SUPPLEMENT RECORD
A record of all supplements prepared for the Code of Ordinances is provided in
the front of the Code.Â  This record will indicate the number and date of the
ordinances adopting the original Code and of each subsequently adopted
ordinance which has been incorporated in the Code.Â  For each supplemented
ordinance, the Supplement Record will list the ordinance number, date, topic,
and chapter number of the Code affected by the amending ordinance.Â  A periodic
review of the Supplement Record and ordinances passed will assure that all
ordinances amending the Code have been incorporated therein.
DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPLEMENTS
Supplements containing revised pages for insertion in each Code will be sent to
the Clerk.Â  It is the responsibility of the Clerk to see that each person
having a Code of Ordinances receives each supplement so that each Code may be
properly updated to reflect action of the Council in amending the Code.
AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
The Code of Ordinances contains most of the laws of the City as of the date of
its adoption and is continually subject to amendment to reflect changing
policies of the Council, mandates of the State, or decisions of the Courts.Â 
Amendments to the Code of Ordinances can only be accomplished by the adoption
of an ordinance.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 380.2)

Code of Ordinances:
