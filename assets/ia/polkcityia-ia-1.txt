5.12 REMOVAL OF ELECTED OFFICERS.
   1.   Grounds. Any City officer elected by the people may be removed from
office after hearing as hereinafter provided by a two-thirds vote of the entire
Council for any of the following reasons:
      A.   Grossly neglecting or refusing to serve by failure to attend all
official meetings for a period of three months or more (excusable illness or
emergencies excepted) or to sign papers, carry out duties clearly incumbent
upon the officer to do, or otherwise exhibit failure to serve.
      B.   Unable to attend any official meetings or carry out duties due to
physical or mental infirmities that appear, upon careful inquiry, to be of such
severe or chronic character as to preclude rendering necessary services
expected of the office for six months.
      C.   By such mental or physical incapacity that the officer is unable to
properly exercise the officer’s official duties even when present or on the
job.
      D.   Committing such acts as would be grounds for an equitable action for
removal in the district court.
   2.   Council Hearing. The Council, upon adopting a motion setting a public
hearing, shall cause notice to be given by certified mail to the officer for
which removal is sought. Such notice shall be mailed not less than 10 or more
than 20 days before said hearing. In the case of severe physical or mental
disability, said notice may be given to said person’s attorney, or to a person
holding the power of attorney, or to the next of kin if there is no known
attorney, if notice to the person would not be of practical effect. Refusal by
the person to accept notice, inability to deliver notice because of frequent
absence from the person’s usual place of abode for extended periods, or other
cause of failure to complete notice may be noted at hearing, but shall not bar
the proceedings if notice has been diligently tried (and the efforts recited in
the record).
   3.   Presentation of Case for Removal. The Council shall constitute the
hearing body for other than Council members, but where a Council member is
sought to be removed, the remaining members of the Council shall constitute the
hearing body. The Council, at the time of making motion to hold a hearing for
considering the removal of an elected officer, shall designate the president of
the hearing, who shall be the Mayor in all cases except that if the Mayor is
the one sought to be removed, it shall be the Mayor Pro Tem. The Council shall
name one of its members to present the cause for removal, and municipal
officers possessing pertinent facts shall provide such data upon request,
including attendance record and testimony in writing, and the above data shall
be presented as written affidavits. If medical or other professional
evaluations are needed, depositions may be taken and presented unless personal
testimony of such authorities is deemed necessary to understand the
circumstances more fully.
   4.   Declaration of Vacancy. If it appears from the facts established at the
hearing that grounds for removal exist, the Council may order removal of the
person from office and declare the office vacant, but only upon a two-thirds
vote of the entire Council. Said removal shall take effect the date after said
vote and order. Where removal is consummated, the vacancy shall be filled
promptly in the manner prescribed by law for filling vacancies in positions
filled by election by the people. The record of the hearing shall be entered in
the proceedings of the Council and the written charges, data, and affidavits be
safely filed with the municipal records.

innocence of an owner, or of anyone in control of the object, as to a direct

controlled substance in violation of the Uniform Controlled Substance Act,

propagate, cultivate, grow, harvest, manufacture, compound, convert, produce,
process, prepare, test, analyze, pack, repack, store, contain, conceal, inject,
ingest, inhale, or otherwise introduce into the human body a controlled

   A special bow hunt is hereby established and shall be administered by the
City in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The dates and

season under the City’s special bow hunt program.
48.06 FEEDING DEER PROHIBITED.
   1.   Feeding Prohibited. Residents are prohibited from overtly and
intentionally feeding deer for the following reasons:
      A.   There is an increased risk of spreading disease among the herd when
deer are concentrated in one place through purposeful feeding, by promoting
contact between a sick animal and healthy animals;
      B.   An increased chance of exposing self, family, or pets to ticks that
carry Lyme Disease (Borrelia burgdorferi), and to other diseases that may be
carried by deer or insects transported by deer; and

mineral, plant, salt, vegetable, or other material to be placed outdoors on any

to remove any materials placed on the owner’s property in violation of this
chapter. Failure to remove the materials within 24 hours after notice from the
City shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
      C.   Each property owner or occupant of the property shall have the duty
to remove any device placed on the owner’s property to which deer are attracted
or from which deer actually feed. Alternatively, a property owner or occupant
may modify the device or make other changes to the property that prevent deer
from having access to or feeding from the device. Failure to remove the device
or to make modifications within 24 hours after notice from the City shall
constitute a violation of this chapter.
   3.   Rebuttable Presumption. There is a rebuttable presumption that the
placement of fruit, grain, mineral, plant, salt, vegetable, or other materials
in a drop feeder, deer feeder kit, automatic feeder, or similar device
regardless of the height of the fruit, grain, mineral, plant, salt, vegetable,
or other material is for the purpose of feeding deer.
   4.   Exceptions.
      A.   Naturally Growing Materials. This chapter does not apply to
naturally growing materials, including, but not limited to, fruit, grain, nuts,
seeds, and vegetables.
      B.   Planted Materials. This chapter does not apply to planted materials
growing in gardens, as standing crops or in a wildlife food plot.
      C.   Stored Crops. This chapter does not apply to stored crops, provided
that the stored crop is not intentionally made available to deer.
      D.   Incidental Spills. This chapter does not apply to spills of seed
materials intended for planting or to crop materials that have been harvested
if the spills are incidental to normal agricultural operations and those
materials are not intentionally made available to deer.
48.07 PENALTY.
   Failure to comply with City or State regulations may subject a hunter or
landowner to revocation of permission to participate in the special bow hunt,
and to be subject to other penalties prescribed by the Code of Iowa and by this
Code of Ordinances, including, but not limited to, fines and penalties as set

that prescribed within this chapter and has so preempted the regulation of

identities and addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders,
notice by one publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area
where the vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of
notice under Subsection 2 of this section. The published notice may contain
multiple listings of abandoned vehicles but shall be published within the same
time requirements and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed
notice in Subsection 2 of this section.

notification procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more
wheels or other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable.
The police authority shall give the applicant a certificate of authority. The
applicant shall then apply to the County Treasurer for a junking certificate
and shall surrender the certificate of authority in lieu of the certificate of
title.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.90[2e])
80.08 PROCEEDS FROM SALES.

on all sides of the pipe. The cast iron pipe or encased clay pipe shall rest on
firm, solid material at either end.
   13.   Preparation of Basement or Crawl Space. No connection for any
residence, business or other structure with any sanitary sewer shall be made
unless the basement floor is poured, or in the case of a building with a slab
or crawl space, unless the ground floor is installed with the area adjacent to
the foundation of such building cleared of debris and backfilled. The backfill
shall be well compacted and graded so that the drainage is away from the
foundation. Prior to the time the basement floor is poured, or the first floor
is installed in buildings without basements, the sewer shall be plugged and the
plug shall be sealed by the Public Works Director. Any accumulation of water in
any excavation or basement during construction and prior to connection to the
sanitary sewer shall be removed by means other than draining into the sanitary
sewer.

97.07 CONTROL MANHOLES.
   When required by the Public Works Director, the owner of any property
serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a
suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and
measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the Public Works Director. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the
owner’s expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and
accessible at all times.
97.08 TESTING OF WASTES.
   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from
periodic grab samples.)

   2.   Sewer Capacity. The trunk line sewer constructed in the East Sanitary
Sewer District is designed to accommodate a future average density of seven
dwelling units per acre. The maximum density permitted for any specific parcel
of land shall be determined by multiplying the total acres owned by the
applicant within the parcel by the number seven. When determined, this number
shall constitute the maximum number of dwelling units which shall be permitted
within such parcel. No connection permits shall be issued to serve a density in
excess of that which is permitted under the provisions of this section.
   3.   Determination of Parcel Size. Any person making application for a sewer
connection permit within the East Sanitary Sewer District shall provide the
City with the following information:
      A.   The legal description of the entire parcel owned by the applicant,
hereafter referred to as the “original parcel;”
      B.   The name of the titleholder;
      C.   The number of acres in said parcel;
      D.   The dimensions of said parcel; and
      E.   The number of existing dwelling units within such parcel.
   1.   Upon receipt of such application, the Engineer shall determine the
maximum number of dwelling units permissible within such original parcel, under
the provisions of Subsection 2 of this section. Upon receipt of each subsequent
application, the Engineer shall reduce the number of allowable connections by
the number of connections previously permitted in such original parcel.
   4.   Integrity of Parcel Size. The size and average density per parcel of
land as provided in Subsection 2 shall be fixed as of the date of the original
application for a sewer permit. A copy of the original parcel description; size
and dimension of such parcel, and the number of connections previously
permitted shall be kept on file in the office of the City Clerk and Engineer
and shall be made available for public inspection during regular business
hours. No conveyance or assignment of any part of the original parcel shall
serve to alter or increase the maximum number of connections which may be
permitted within such original parcel. Provided, in the event such parcel is
subdivided, the titleholder may, through agreement with the purchaser, reserve
to himself or herself a greater or lesser density by restricting or increasing
the allowable density of the property to be conveyed. No such agreement shall
increase the average number of units allowed under Subsection 2 for such
original parcel. Any such agreement must be in writing and recorded as a
covenant running with the land. A copy of any such agreement, showing its
recordation, shall be filed with the Clerk and Engineer and shall be kept on
file in their respective offices. In the absence of such an agreement, the
allowable sewer connections remaining for such original parcel shall be
allocated to any owner of any part of such parcel who shall first request the
same.

(Subsection 6 – Ord. 2025-200 – Jul. 25 Supp.)
100.04 SANITARY SEWER CONNECTION FEES BY DISTRICT.
   1.   It is the intent of the City to utilize connection fees to recover 100%
of the original cost of constructing sanitary sewer utilities to serve the
benefitted properties in the sewer districts set forth in Section
100.03.
   2.   Connection shall be made to any Polk City municipal sanitary sewer
located within any of the sewer districts described in Section 103
Establishment of Sewer District only in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.
   3.   The initial schedule of connection fees for each benefited district
shall be based on the following:
      A.   Southeast Sanitary Sewer District - $1,905.00 per acre (gross)
      B.   North Sanitary Sewer District - $985.00 per acre (gross)
      C.   Northeast Sanitary Sewer District - $2,715.00 per acre (gross)
      D.   Big Creek Sanitary Sewer District - $1,185.00 per acre (gross)
   4.   The connection fees defined in Subsection 3 above shall be a graduated
connection fee, with annual interest adjustment beginning January 1, 2026, such
that property owners who connect in later years pay interest on the connection
fee for their property. The rate of interest applicable to the connection fee
established in this district shall be the rate not exceeding the rate of
interest applicable to special assessments pursuant to the Code of Iowa in
effect on the date this connection fee is established. Interest rates and an
updated connection fee schedule may be adopted annually by resolution of City
Council for each sanitary sewer district. In the event a new connection fee
schedule is not adopted, amounts shall increase by 3% annually.
   5.   The sewer connection fee shall be in an amount as determined by the
City Engineer that is equal to the maximum gross acre area of contiguous
property, or fraction thereof, in the benefitted district under common
ownership which can be lawfully served through such proposed connection,
multiplied by the per acre connection fee for the benefitted district,
including the interest adjustment in effect at the time the fee is paid.
   6.   For purposes of calculating the fee, the gross area shall be deemed to
include lots being dedicated to the City for streets, trails, parks, or other
public purpose; buildable lots; and unbuildable outlots to be used for
stormwater management facilities, floodplains, or other private and/or common
purposes benefitting all or a portion of the subdivision.
      A.   If a developer proposes to phase the development of their
subdivision, outlots set aside for future phases of development shall be
designated on the final plat as unbuildable and the final plat shall state that
no Building Permits shall be issued until said outlot is replatted in
accordance with the Subdivision Ordinance. Connection fees for such outlots may
be deferred until such property is further developed.
   7.   In the case of new subdivisions, connection fees shall be paid in full
at the time of final plat approval. In the case of existing parcels being
developed or redeveloped without plating, connection fees shall be paid in full
at the time of site plan or Building Permit approval, whichever occurs first.
In the case of existing structures not being developed or redeveloped,
connection fees shall be paid in full prior to connection to the public
sanitary sewer.
   8.   In cases where any parcel to be serviced by the proposed connection is
not located within the corporate limits at the time of proposing connection,
the property owner shall file with the City an Application for Voluntary
Annexation. Said application shall be signed by applicable property owner(s)
and on the form as provided by the City and subsequently acted upon and
approved by the City Council and, if required, City Development Board prior to
connection being made.
   9.   The owner of any parcel making a connection to any public sanitary
sewer shall be solely responsible for the cost of making such connection. Such
connection shall be designed and installed in complete accordance with all
applicable City ordinances, rules and regulations. The sewer connection fees
established by this section are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other
fees for connection required by other provisions of this Code of Ordinances.
   10.   Sanitary sewer hookup fees which were established by a development
agreement approved by City Council prior to enactment of this ordinance shall
be governed by the development agreement rather than this ordinance.
   11.   In the event a connection is made to the sanitary sewer utility
serving an established sewer district without a permit or without payment of
the connection fees set forth in this section, the City may disconnect such
service until such time as the property owner has received a permit for the
connection and paid the required connection fee. The City may pursue any other
remedy allowed by law.

101.03 GENERAL ADOPTION.
   The provisions of this chapter are enacted to aid in the enforcement of the
pretreatment regulations set forth in this chapter and may be placed in a
separate portion of the code of any WRA participating community which adopts
these provisions. Each WRA participating community by enacting this chapter
designates the WRA and its operating contractor as the enforcement agency under
this chapter. Employees, agents and officers of the WRA and of its operating
contractor, while acting to enforce this chapter for the WRA, are empowered to
make such inspections, issue such orders or permits and take such actions
within the boundaries of the City as are authorized by this chapter. The WRA or
its operating contractor is also authorized to impose and collect all fees or
penalties authorized by this chapter, and are authorized to directly bill and
collect from contributors penalties, fees, charges and surcharges from all
users within the City. A user’s failure to pay any fee, charge, penalty, or
surcharge is a municipal infraction and shall also be grounds to discontinue
sewer service to the user, all as hereafter more particularly provided. The
enforcement of this chapter in the City is not dependent upon passage of this
chapter or a similar ordinance by other WRA participating communities.
101.04 INTENT AND CONSTRUCTION.
   This chapter seeks to implement provisions of the Act, the general
pretreatment regulations found at 40 CFR, Part 403, and the Iowa Administrative
Code Chapter 567, Sections 62.4 and 62.8. This chapter is to be construed and
applied in accordance with the Clean Water Act amendments, the general
pretreatment regulations, the Iowa Administrative Code, and the purpose and
policy provision set forth in Section 101.05 of this division.
101.05 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   This chapter regulates the use of sanitary sewers; private wastewater
disposal; the installation and connection of building sewers; and the discharge
of wastewater or waste into the POTW.
   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for discharges into the POTW,
and the deposit of wastewater and waste hauled to the WRF or to other locations
approved by the WRA director for disposal and treatment. The objectives of this
chapter are to:
   1.   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that may
interfere with the operation of the system or interfere with sludge management
and disposal.
   2.   Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that may pass
through the system inadequately treated and ultimately into receiving water,
the atmosphere, or otherwise be incompatible with the system.
   3.   Protect workers’ safety and health and protect against damage to the
POTW.
   4.   Provide for equitable distribution of treatment and industrial
pretreatment costs resulting from pollutants introduced into the POTW.
101.06 JURISDICTION.
   The sections of this chapter are applicable in their entirety to all users
who contribute wastewater, directly or indirectly, into the POTW without regard
to whether the physical facilities of such users are situated within or outside
the limits of the City.
101.07 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of this chapter or the application thereof to any
particular person or particular circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity
shall not affect other provisions or application of this chapter which can be
given effect without the invalid provision or application. To this end the
provisions of this chapter are severable.
101.08 INTERPRETATION.
   This chapter shall be construed and interpreted to conform with 40 CFR I,
and it is the intent of this chapter that it comply with the federal
regulations.
DIVISION 2: WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND PRETREATMENT
101.09 USER REQUIREMENTS.
   1.   The following requirements shall apply to all users of the POTW:
      A.   All users shall promptly notify the WRA director in advance of any
substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge.
      B.   New or increased contributions of pollutants or changes in the
nature of pollutant discharged to the POTW shall require prior approval by the
WRA Director.
      C.   Industrial users shall notify the WRA director, the Environmental
Protection Agency Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State
hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR 261. The notification shall comply with the requirements set forth in 40
CFR 403.12(p).
      D.   Discharge of any pollutants without the notice and approval required
by this section is prohibited. Upon the receipt of notice required by this
section, the WRA director shall within 180 days or less approve the discharge
if he or she finds the proposed discharge meets applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements and would not cause the WRA to violate its National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit. The WRA director shall deny
permission for the discharge if he or she finds applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements are not met or the discharge would cause a violation
of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit for the WRF.
   In lieu of denial of permission for discharge, the WRA director may allow
such discharge or contribution upon conditions which would not violate
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements and would not cause a
violation of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit for the
WRF.
      E.   Food Service Establishments shall be regulated first under Division
5 of this chapter but may be required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit
and be subject to the requirements of Divisions 1 through 4 of this chapter if
the WRA Director determines that additional pretreatment is required in order
to comply with fat, oil, and grease discharge limits.
   2.   Any part of this section notwithstanding, upon receipt of the notice
required by this section, the WRA director may require, in addition to the
requirements of this section, that an industrial user obtain a permit under
this chapter.
   3.   Users who are determined to be industrial users as herein defined and
who refuse to apply for or obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall be
subject to termination of sewer services as provided in Section
101.44 hereof.
101.10 DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.

101.12 NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   Users subject to National Categorical Pretreatment Standards (NCPS) as
contained in 40 CFR I, subchapter N, part 405-471 shall comply with the
standards and applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR 403.12. New
sources of categorical discharge shall meet National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards in the shortest feasible time, but in no case longer than 90 days
from the commencement of discharge. Failure to comply shall be a violation of
this chapter and subject the user to enforcement action. The WRA is required to
notify all known affected categorical users of the applicable reporting
requirements under 40 CFR 403.12. Failure of the WRA to notify a user shall not
relieve the user of the duty, if any, to comply with National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards.
101.13 STATE REQUIREMENTS.
   State of Iowa requirements and limitations on discharges pursuant to this
chapter shall apply when they are more stringent than U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency or WRA requirements and limitations unless allowed by the
Iowa Department of Natural Resources.
101.14 CITY’S RIGHT OF REVISION.
   The City, acting at the direction of the WRA, reserves the right to
establish more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW
than those contained in this chapter if deemed necessary to comply with the
purpose and policy objectives presented in Section 101.05 of this chapter.
101.15 PRETREATMENT.
   1.   A user discharging or with potential to discharge any waste into the
POTW as set forth in Section
101.10,
101.11 or
101.12 of this division shall be required by the WRA director to construct,
install and operate, at the user’s sole expense, such pretreatment facilities
as may be required in order to:
      A.   Reduce the objectionable characteristics or constituents of
wastewater to within the maximum limits provided for in Sections
101.10,
101.11,
101.12, and
101.13 of this chapter.
      B.   Control the quantities and rates of discharge of such wastewater.
      C.   Reduce the pollutants to such concentration and flows as may be
contained in the user’s wastewater discharge permit.
      D.   Prevent the discharge of liquid waste containing FOG, sand in
excessive amounts, any flammable waste, or other harmful pollutants. All traps
or similar devices shall be of a type and capacity needed to perform
effectively and shall be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. All traps or devices shall be provided and maintained in efficient
operating condition at all times. Materials removed from traps shall be
considered unacceptable for disposal at the WRF unless specifically approved by
the WRA director.
   2.   All plans, specifications, technical operating data and other
information pertinent to the proposed operation and maintenance of pretreatment
facilities shall be reviewed and approved by the WRA director prior to
construction. Design and installation of such facilities shall be subject to
the requirements of all applicable codes, chapters and laws, including local
zoning regulations. The review and approval of such plans and operating
procedures shall, in no way, relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the
WRA director under this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment
facilities or method of operations shall be reported to and be acceptable to
the WRA director prior to the user’s initiations of the changes.
   3.   Users shall continuously maintain all pretreatment facilities required
by this chapter in satisfactory and effective operating condition at the sole
expense of such user.
   4.   No section contained in this chapter shall be construed to prevent or
prohibit a separate or special agreement between the WRA and any user whereby
wastewater containing waste of unusual strength, character or composition may
be accepted for treatment, subject to additional payment by such user;
provided, however, that such agreement shall have the prior approval of the WRA
Board, shall not conflict with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requirements, and shall be consistent with
Sections
101.11,
101.12, and
101.13 of this chapter, and Subsection 6 of this section.
   5.   The WRA director may reject any waste that, in the opinion of the
director, may cause interference or pass through.
   6.   Users shall obtain the specific approval of the WRA director prior to
discharging any waste resulting from a pretreatment facility to the POTW.
   The WRA director may develop a documentation system to track the
transportation and final disposition of any pretreatment waste. Pretreatment
waste regulated by this subsection shall include waste generated as a result of
pretreatment processes used to comply with National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System permits, air pollution permits, wastewater discharge
permits, soil/groundwater reclamation processes, and pollutants resulting from
a spill of any liquid or solid material or the cleanup of any such spill.
Pretreatment waste is prohibited from disposal to the water of the State except
as specifically permitted by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.
101.16 DILUTION PROHIBITED.
   Users shall not increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt to
dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
pretreatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards, or with any other pollutant-
specific limitation developed by the WRA or its Operating Contractor.
101.17 SPILL CONTAINMENT.
   1.   Users having the ability to cause interference or pass through or to
discharge a slug shall provide protection from accidental discharge to the POTW
of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this chapter.
Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be
constructed, installed, operated and maintained at the user’s sole cost and
expense.
   2.   Users meeting the criteria in Subsection 1 of this section shall
develop a spill containment plan. The plan shall require the approval of the
WRA director and shall contain the following:
      A.   A description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges.
      B.   A description of stored chemicals.
      C.   Procedures for immediately notifying the WRA of slug discharges,
including any that would violate the discharge prohibitions in Section
101.10 of this division. Notification procedures shall comply with Subsections
3 and 4 of this section.
      D.   A description of procedures and structures necessary to prevent
adverse impacts upon the POTW from accidental spills including inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
      E.   A schedule for the completion or implementation of necessary
procedures and structures. Complete implementation and installation of any
procedures or structures shall be according to the shortest possible schedule,
but in no case longer than one year. Review and approval of such plans and
operating procedures shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to
modify and operate its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this
chapter.
   3.   Users shall immediately telephone and notify the WRA of any accidental
or deliberate discharge of pollutants which violates Section
101.10 of this division or which is a slug load. Any discharge into the POTW of
a substance which is a listed or characteristic waste under Section 3001 of
RCRA must be immediately reported to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
Regional Director, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, and the WRA.
   Notifications required in this subsection shall include the name of caller,
location and time of discharge, pollutant concentration, volume and the
corrective actions taken.
   4.   Users shall submit a written report to the WRA director within five
days following such an accidental or deliberate discharge describing the cause
of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar
future occurrences. Users shall submit follow-up reports as may be required by
the WRA director. Such report shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss,
damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property, nor shall such
report relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which
may be imposed by this chapter or otherwise. Failure to report accidental or
deliberate discharges may, in addition to any other remedies available to the
City, result in the revocation of the discharger’s wastewater discharge permit.
   5.   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with all applicable regulations upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its pretreatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of pretreatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
to the user’s pretreatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
   6.   Users required to have a spill containment plan must permanently post a
notice in English and the language of common use on the user’s bulletin board
or other prominent place advising employees whom to call if a prohibited
discharge occurs. Users shall ensure that all employees who are in a position
to cause, discover, or observe such an accidental discharge are advised of the
emergency notification procedures.
101.18 TREATMENT UPSETS.
   Users shall inform the WRA director within one hour of becoming aware of an
upset in operations that places it in a temporary state of noncompliance with
the pollutant limits in this chapter. Users shall provide a follow-up written
report to the WRA director within five days. The report must demonstrate that
the pretreatment facility was being operated in a prudent and appropriate
manner and shall contain:
   1.   A description of the upset, its cause, and impact on the user’s
compliance status.
   2.   The duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance, and, if the noncompliance is continuing, the time by which
compliance is reasonably expected to be restored.
   3.   All steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence
of such an upset.
101.19 TREATMENT BYPASS.
   Under this chapter, bypass is prohibited unless it is unavoidable to prevent
loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage or no feasible
alternatives exist such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention
of untreated waste, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime.
The user may allow a bypass to occur which does not cause a violation of
pretreatment standards, but only if it is for essential maintenance to ensure
efficient operation. Notification of bypass shall be submitted in accordance
with the following:
   1.   Anticipated bypass. If the user knows in advance of the need for a
bypass, it shall submit prior written notice, at least 10 days before the date
of the bypass, to the WRA director.
   2.   Unanticipated bypass. The user shall immediately notify the WRA
director and submit a written report to the WRA within five days. This report
shall specify the following:
      A.   A description of the bypass, its cause, and the duration.
      B.   Whether the bypass has been corrected.
      C.   The steps being taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and
prevent a reoccurrence of the bypass.
   Proper notification shall not relieve the user of liability for treatment
costs and fees or other remedies as provided for in Section 101.15 of this
division.

per day of process wastewater.
101.22 PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.
   1.   All new industrial users shall notify the WRA director of the nature
and characteristics of their proposed discharge 180 days prior to commencing
discharge. A notification form prescribed by the WRA shall be used for this
purpose.
   2.   Significant users shall discharge wastewater, either directly or
indirectly, into the POTW only after obtaining a wastewater discharge permit
from the WRA director. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve
a user of the obligation to obtain other permits required by federal, State, or
local law.
   3.   Other users, including waste haulers, shall obtain permits as required
by the WRA director.
101.23 PERMIT APPLICATIONS; BASELINE MONITORING REPORTS; COMPLIANCE SCHEDULES.

      F.   The categorial user shall identify the pretreatment standards
applicable to each regulated process and shall submit the results of sampling
and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required)
of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable
pretreatment standards from each regulated process.
      G.   The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample
immediately downstream of any pretreatment facility or immediately downstream
of each regulated process if no pretreatment exists and prior to mixing with
other waste to compile that data necessary to comply with this requirement. If
non-regulated wastewater is mixed with regulated wastewater prior to
pretreatment, the user must measure the flows and concentrations necessary to
allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to
evaluate compliance with pretreatment standards. Where an alternate
concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6
(e), this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the
WRA Director. Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with 40
CFR 136 or other verified method approved by the WRA Director.
      H.   The time, date, and place of sampling, methods of analysis, and
certification that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work
cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW.
      I.   Historical data may be allowed by the WRA Director so long as the
data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial
pretreatment measures.
      J.   Certification by an authorized representative of the user as
referenced in Section 101.33 and certified to by a qualified professional
indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis
and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance or additional
pretreatment is required for the user to meet pretreatment standards and
requirements.
      K.   If additional pretreatment or O&M will be required to meet
pretreatment standards, requirements, discharge limits as set forth in Sections
101.10,
101.11 and
101.12 of this article, or any other limit set by the WRA Director, the user
shall supply a compliance schedule indicating the shortest time schedule
necessary to accomplish installation or adoption of such additional
pretreatment or O&M.
   The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance
date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. The following
conditions apply to this schedule:
         (1)   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards. Such schedule shall include, where
applicable, but shall not be limited to dates for the hiring of an engineer,
completing preliminary plans, executing contracts for major components,
commencing construction, beginning operation, and conducting routine
operations.
         (2)   No increment referred to in Subsection 2(K)(1) of this section
shall exceed nine months, nor shall the total compliance period exceed 18
months.
         (3)   No later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and
the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the
WRA Director, including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the

the user to return to the established schedule. In no event shall more than
nine months elapse between such progress reports to the WRA Director.
      L.   A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total
phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other
pollutants required, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-
proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The WRA Director may
waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any user who demonstrates that
flow-proportional sampling is not feasible. In such cases, samples may be
obtained through time-proportional techniques or through a minimum of four grab
samples where the user demonstrates that such sampling will provide a
representative sample of the effluent being discharged.
   3.   New significant users not subject to categorical standards shall submit
analysis of wastewater representative of the effluent discharged to the POTW as
required in Subsections 2(G-I) of this section for all parameters deemed
necessary by the WRA Director.
   4.   New or existing industrial users not subject to categorical
pretreatment standards who fail to meet local, State, or federal pretreatment
standards or other permit requirements on a consistent basis shall be subject
to compliance schedules for additional pretreatment or O&M as outlined in
Subsection 2(K) of this section.
   5.   All applications and reports must contain the certification statement
and be signed in accordance with Section 101.33.
(Section 101.23 – Ord. 2022-2100 – Feb. 23 Supp.)

   The WRA director may deny a wastewater discharge permit to any user whose
discharge of material to the POTW, whether shown upon application, including
test results submitted by the applicant, or determined after inspection or
testing conducted by the WRA or its operating contractor, is not in conformity
with this chapter or whose application is incomplete or does not comply with
the requirements of Section 118-393 of the Waste Water Reclamation Authority/
City of Des Moines Municipal Code.
101.31 PERMIT VIOLATIONS.
   Any violation of the terms, conditions, or limits of a user’s wastewater
discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and shall subject
the user to all enforcement procedures outlined in this chapter.
101.32 PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS.
   Under this division, periodic compliance reports are required as follows:
   1.   Significant users shall submit to the WRA director, during the months
of January and July, a report indicating the nature, concentration, and flow of
pollutants in the effluent which are limited by permit or pretreatment
standards for the preceding six-month period. This report shall include a
record of the monthly average flows and the daily flow for each analysis date
during the reporting period. At the discretion of the WRA director and in
consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget
cycles, etc., the WRA director may agree to alter the months during which the
reports are to be submitted. More frequent reports may be required by the WRA
director.
   2.   The WRA director may impose mass limitations on users. In such cases,
the report required by Subsection 1 of this section shall indicate the mass of
pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. All
analyses shall be performed using Environmental Protection Agency approved
methods using sampling techniques approved by the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources.
   3.   Users shall meet the certification and signatory requirements in
Section
101.33 of this division for each report submitted under this section. Where the
WRA itself collects all the information required for the report, including flow
data, the industrial user will not be required to submit a periodic compliance
report.
   4.   A user must notify the WRA director of all violations identified as a
result of self-monitoring to the POTW by telephone, during normal business
hours, within 24 hours of the time the user becomes aware of such violation.
The user must also submit the results of repeat analyses to the WRA within 30
days after becoming aware of the violation, together with a complete report on
all steps taken to resolve the violation. The user need not repeat the analyses
if:
      A.   The WRA performs sampling of the industrial user at a frequency of
at least once per month; or
      B.   The WRA performs sampling of the user between the time when the user
performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results
of this sampling.
   5.   A user who monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the
WRA or who self-monitors in addition to WRA monitoring, using Environmental
Protection Agency methods or standard methods, shall report the monitoring
results to the WRA director in accordance with Subsections 1, 3, and 4 of this
section.
101.33 CERTIFICATION AND SIGNATORY REQUIREMENTS.
   All applications or reports submitted by a user pursuant to this division
shall contain the following certification statement:
“I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were
prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed
to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system,
or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations.”
   All applications and reports shall be signed by an authorized representative
of the user as defined in Section
101.01 of this chapter. A user shall maintain a current and accurate
authorization on file with the WRA director.
101.34 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   1.   When required by the WRA director pursuant to this division, each
permitted user shall at its expense provide and operate monitoring facilities
to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer or
internal drainage systems. The WRA director may require the placement of such
monitoring facilities at the end of each process where pollutants are used,
produced, or treated. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on
the user’s premises and located so that it will not be obstructed by
landscaping or parked vehicles.
   2.   When required by the wastewater discharge permit and within 90 days of
written notification, a user shall install a sampling chamber for each separate
discharge of the building sewer in accordance with plans and specification
approved by the WRA director. A user shall provide ample room in or near such
sampling chamber to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for
analysis. Each user shall at its expense maintain all sampling and measuring
equipment in a safe and proper operating condition at all times, which
equipment shall be safely, easily and independently accessible to authorized
representatives of the WRA.
   Users shall certify all flow measuring devices to be in proper working
condition at a frequency specified in the permit or in writing by the WRA
director, using a qualified technician acceptable to the WRA director. Sampling
shall be in accordance with the following:
      A.   Each sampling chamber shall contain a flume unless another device is
approved by the WRA director, with a recording and totalizing device for
measurement of the liquid quantity.
      B.   At the discretion of the WRA director, metered water supply to a
user may be used as the volume quantity where it is substantiated that the
metered water supply and waste quantities are approximately the same, or where
a measurable adjustment agreed to by the director is made in the metered water
supply to determine the liquid waste quantity. Separate meters may be used to
subtract water which is not discharged to the POTW or is discharged to a sewer
other than the sampled location.
      C.   Samples shall be taken at a frequency and volume determined by the
WRA director and shall be properly refrigerated and preserved in accordance
with Environmental Protection Agency approved methods. The sample shall be
composited in proportion to the flow for a representative 24-hour sample. A
time proportioned 24-hour sample may be used if flow proportioned sampling is
determined by the WRA director to be impractical. Grab samples shall be used
where appropriate.
   3.   A user must inform the WRA director prior to breaking a sampler seal,
used by the WRA to detect sample tampering, unless necessary to prevent loss of
life, personal injury, or severe property damage. A user shall not place
additional seals or locks upon a sampler which may be used by the WRA without
first obtaining approval from the WRA director.
101.35 INSPECTION, SAMPLING, AND RECORD KEEPING AUTHORITY.
   Under this division, users shall be deemed to have given the following
authorities to the WRA and its operating contractor:
   1.   Users shall permit authorized representatives or agents of the WRA to
enter upon all properties and all parts of the premises, or upon properties of
users with wastewater discharge permits, for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, records examination, records copying, or the performance of any of
their duties. This shall include the right to set up, on the user’s property,
such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance
monitoring, or metering operations as may be required in pursuance of the
implementation and enforcement of this chapter.
   2.   Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper
identification and clearance before entry into the premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements in the security measures so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, WRA or operating contractor personnel will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities.
   3.   All users subject to any of the reporting requirements of this chapter
shall maintain copies of reports and records of all information as required in
40 CFR 403.12(o) resulting from any monitoring activities required by this
chapter for a minimum of three years and shall make such records available for
inspection and copying by the WRA and its operating contractor. This period of
retention shall be extended until the completion of any unresolved negotiation,
hearing, or litigation involving a purported violation.
101.36 CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENTS, DATA, AND INFORMATION.
   Except as provided in this section, documents, data and information obtained
from user reports, questionnaires, permit applications and inspections pursuant
to this division shall be made available to the public or other governmental
agencies without restriction. If the user specifically requests and is able to
demonstrate that the release of such information would divulge information
concerning processes or methods of production entitled to protection under law
as trade secrets of the user or would give advantage to competitors and serve
no public purpose, the WRA director may determine that such information should
be kept confidential and not made available for public examination, but such
information shall be available to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or
the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.
   1.   Decisions by the WRA director to deny confidential status for
information may be appealed using the procedures in Section 118-407 of the
Wastewater Reclamation Authority/City of Des Moines Municipal Code. In
determining whether information is confidential, the provisions of Chapter 22
of the Code of Iowa shall prevail.
   2.   Effluent data and enforcement actions by the WRA or its operating
contractor will not be considered confidential records or information.
101.37 APPEAL OF DENIAL OF CONFIDENTIAL STATUS.
   1.   Any person aggrieved by the WRA director’s decision to release
information or data obtained as provided in Subsection 118-406(a) of Wastewater
Reclamation Authority/City of Des Moines Municipal Code and who can demonstrate
a direct and substantial interest in the information or data sought to be kept
confidential may appeal the WRA director’s decision. A request for appeal shall
be filed in writing with the WRA director not less than five days after the WRA
director’s decision to deny confidential status to such information or data.
The appeal request shall include a statement of the basis upon which the
request for confidential status is made, as well as the appealing party’s
interest in the information or data sought to be kept confidential. The WRA
director may request additional information from the appealing party.
   2.   Based upon the information provided by the appealing party, the WRA
director shall make a determination with respect to the confidentiality of the
information or data at issue. The WRA director shall notify the parties, in
writing, of the WRA director’s decision within seven days after receipt of the
appeal.
   3.   If still aggrieved by the WRA director’s determination on appeal, a
party may file an action in Polk County District Court, seeking a declaratory
ruling with respect to the confidentiality of such documents, data and
information, or seeking an injunction to prevent the disclosure of same.
   4.   During the pendency of an appeal to the WRA director, the documents,
data or information at issue shall be kept confidential. However, if during the
pendency of such appeal, a request for examination or copying of such
documents, data or information is made of the WRA or its operating contractor
pursuant to Chapter 22 of the Code of Iowa, the WRA or its operating contractor
will notify the appealing party of such request for disclosure and will keep
confidential the requested documents, data or information, pending action by
the appealing party to defend its confidentiality request. In that
notification, the appealing party requesting confidentiality will be given not
more than five calendar days within which to file suit in Polk County District
Court seeking the entry of a declaratory order and/or injunction to protect and
keep confidential such documents, data or information. If the appealing party
fails to initiate suit within the time requested, the WRA director shall
release the documents, data or information at issue for public examination.
   5.   If during the pendency of such appeal, a lawsuit is initiated pursuant
to Chapter 22 of the Code of Iowa, requesting the release of such documents,
data or information, the appealing party shall take action to defend its
confidentiality request in said lawsuit. If the appealing party fails to defend
its confidentiality request in said suit, the WRA director shall release the
documents, data, or information at issue for public examination.
DIVISION 4: ENFORCEMENT OF INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER REGULATIONS
101.38 PUBLIC NOTIFICATION OF SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   The WRA will annually publish, in the largest daily newspaper published in
the WRA community, a list of users who at any time during the previous 12
months were in significant noncompliance as defined in Section
101.39 of this division.
101.39 SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   Any violation of pretreatment requirements under this chapter (i.e.,
including but not limited to those relating to limits, sampling, analysis,
reporting, meeting compliance schedules, and regulatory deadlines) is an
instance of noncompliance for which the user is liable for enforcement,
including penalties and injunctive relief. Instances of significant
noncompliance are user violations which meet one or more of the following
criteria:
   1.   Violations of wastewater discharge limits as follows:
      A.   Chronic Violations. 66 percent or more of the measurements exceed
the same daily maximum limit or the same average limit in a six-month period
(any magnitude of exceedance).
      B.   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) Violations. 33 percent or more of
the measurements exceed the same daily maximum limit or the same average limit
by more than the TRC in a six-month period (e.g., limit x TRC = the point at
which a violation becomes a TRC violation). There are two groups of TRCs as
follow:
 
Group I for conventional pollutants (BOD, TSS, FOG) TRC = 1.4
Group II for all other pollutants                   TRC = 1.2
 
      C.   Any other violation of a wastewater discharge permit limit (average
or daily maximum) that the WRA director believes has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference, including slug loads, or pass
through or which endangers the health of City, WRA, or operating contractor

proper maintenance and cleaning of grease interceptors and traps, disposal
procedures and record keeping. Such certification shall be for a period of five
years and shall be in effect for the person receiving such training. Grease
haulers certified by the WRA shall be subject to a grease interceptor cleanout
inspection by WRA personnel, not less than once every two years, for purposes
of the hauler demonstrating its compliance with requirements in this section.
Such inspections shall be scheduled at a time which coincides with normal
working hours for WRA personnel, shall involve all individuals employed by the
same company who have been issued a grease hauler certification by the WRA, and
shall be conducted at an FSE within the WRA service area. Failure to follow
WRA’s cleanout procedures or other requirements of this section may result in
fines, additional scheduled cleanout inspections, and loss of grease hauler
certification status, individually or company-wide, with the WRA.

   When any portion of the sump pump discharge line which is the responsibility
of the property owner becomes defective or creates a nuisance, and the property
abuts on any street, alley, or right-of-way in which there is located a City
storm sewer or subdrain, the property owner shall be required to install, at
such owner’s expense, a suitable sump pump discharge line connecting such line
directly with the proper storm sewer or subdrain system, and to maintain the
same all in accordance with this chapter, such compliance to be completed

parties that the City, its elected and appointed officials, employees,
volunteers, or others working on behalf of the City shall not be liable or in
any way responsible for injury, damage, liability, loss, or expense resulting
to the Grantee, its officers, employees, subcontractors, and others affiliated
with the Grantee due to accidents, mishaps, misconduct, negligence, or injuries
either to person or property caused by the work and/or services performed by
the Grantee under the franchise, except to the extent caused by the City’s acts
or negligence. The Grantee expressly agrees to pay the City for all damages
caused to the City’s premises resulting from the activities of the Grantee, its
officers, employees, subcontractors, and others affiliated with the Grantee.
      A.   The indemnification obligations of Grantee are not limited in any
way by the amount or type of damages or compensation payable by or for Grantee
under Worker’s Compensation, disability, or other employee benefit acts,
acceptance of insurance certificates required under the franchise, or the
terms, applicability, or limitations of any insurance held by Grantee.
      B.   Grantor does not, and shall not, waive any rights against Grantee
which it may have by reasons of the indemnification provided for in this
chapter, because of the acceptance by City, or the deposit with City by
Grantee, of any of the insurance policies described in this chapter.
      C.   The requirements of indemnification shall not be a waiver of any
right that the City would have to assert defenses on its own behalf under State
or federal law.
      D.   The Grantee’s indemnification obligations under this chapter shall
survive the expiration, cancellation, or termination of the Franchise
Agreement.
      E.   To the extent permitted by law, the Grantee hereby releases the
City, its elected and appointed officials, employees, volunteers, and others
working on behalf of the City, from any and all liability or responsibility to
the Grantee or anyone claiming through or under the Grantee, for any loss or
damage to property caused by fire or other casualty, except to the extent such
fire or other casualty shall have been caused by the fault or negligence of the
City, its elected and appointed officials, employees, volunteers, or others
working on behalf of the City. This provision shall be applicable and in full
force and effect only with respect to loss or damages occurring during the time
of the Grantee’s occupancy or use.
   11.   Electric Revenue Tax. If, during the term of the franchise, there
shall be enacted by the Iowa General Assembly a valid taxing statute
authorizing the City to collect a tax on the electric revenue received by
Grantee from its customers in the City, then if such tax is levied by the City,
said Grantee will include, subject to the approval of the Iowa Utilities Board,
such tax as a separate item on bills to its customers within the City, and
remit the sums collected to the City under the terms and provisions of such
enacted statute.
   12.   Termination of Franchise.
      A.   Grounds for Revocation. In addition to any other lawful remedies the
City may have, it reserves the right to revoke the franchise and rescind all
rights and privileges associated therewith in the event of a material breach of
the franchise. A material breach or cause for revocation, by way of example,
would include:
         (1)   If Grantee should default in the performance of any of its
material obligations under the franchise and fails to cure the default within
60 days after receipt of written notice of the default from the City or such
longer time as specified by the City.
         (2)   If the Grantee should fail to provide or maintain in full force
and effect the insurance and indemnification coverage as required in this
chapter.
         (3)   If a petition is filed by or against Grantee under the
Bankruptcy Act, as amended, or any other insolvency or creditors’ rights law,
State or federal, and the Grantee shall fail to have it dismissed.
         (4)   If a receiver, trustee or liquidator of the Grantee is applied
for or appointed for all or part of the Grantee’s assets.
         (5)   If the Grantee makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors.
         (6)   To the extent an order or ruling has effect on the franchise, if
the Grantee violates any order or ruling of the City, or any State or federal
regulatory body having jurisdiction over the Grantee, unless the Grantee is
lawfully contesting the legality or applicability of such order or ruling and
has received a stay from the appropriate forum.
         (7)   If the Grantee practices any fraud or deceit upon the
subscribers, the City, or the general public.
         (8)   If Grantee misrepresented a material fact in the application for
or negotiation of the franchise or in any other appearance before or document
submitted to the City Council or to subscribers.
         (9)   If Grantee violates any material rule, order, regulation or
determination of the City Council made pursuant to its police powers or any
material provision of this chapter.
      B.   Procedure Prior to Revocation. The City shall give at least 60 days’
written notice to the Grantee citing the reasons alleged to constitute cause
for revocation, if the reason is of a nature that can be cured, set a
reasonable time in which the Grantee must remedy the cause. If, during the 60-
day period (or such longer period as the City may set), the cause shall be
cured to the satisfaction of the City, the City may declare the notice to be
null and void. If the Grantee fails to remedy the cause within the time
specified or if the breach is of a nature that cannot be remedied, the City
Council may, after public hearing and making a written finding of a material
violation, revoke the franchise. In any event, before the franchise may be
terminated, the Grantee shall be provided with an opportunity to be heard
before the City Council.
      C.   Effect of Pending Litigation. Unless a stay is issued by a court of
appropriate jurisdiction, pending litigation or any appeal to any regulatory
body or court having jurisdiction over the Grantee shall not excuse the Grantee
from the performance of its obligations under this chapter or other applicable
laws. Failure of the Grantee to perform material obligations because of pending
litigation or petition may result in forfeiture or revocation pursuant to the
provisions of this section.
      D.   Restoration of Public and Private Property. In removing its plants,
structures and equipment, the Grantee shall refill at its own expense, any
excavation made by it and shall leave all public ways and places and private
property in as good condition as existed prior to Grantee’s removal of its
equipment and appliances. The City shall inspect and approve the condition of
the public ways and public places. Liability insurance and the indemnity
provided in this chapter shall continue in full force and effect during the
period of removal.
      E.   Restoration by City; Reimbursement of Costs. If the Grantee fails to
complete any work required by or any work required by other law or ordinance
within the time established and to the satisfaction of the City, the City may
cause such work to be done and the Grantee shall reimburse the City the costs
thereof within 30 days after receipt of any itemized list of such costs.
      F.   Lesser Sanctions. Nothing shall prohibit the City from imposing
lesser sanctions or censures than revocation.
112.03 ASSIGNMENT OF FRANCHISE.
   Grantee shall not voluntarily or involuntarily, by operation of law or
otherwise, sell, assign, transfer, lease, sublet or otherwise dispose of, in
whole or in part, the franchise and/or electric system or any of the rights or
privileges granted by the franchise, to any entity not controlled by Grantee
without the prior written consent of the City, and then only upon such terms
and conditions as may be lawfully prescribed by the City, which consent shall
not be unreasonably denied or delayed provided that any transferee shall agree
to accept all of Grantee’s obligations under this chapter. Any attempt to sell,
assign, transfer, lease, sublet or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the
franchise and/or electric system or Grantee’s rights therein without the prior
written consent of the City shall be null and void and shall be grounds for
termination of the franchise.

in the corporate boundaries of the City, and the Company shall apply the
franchise fee to its customers who are affected by the annexation or change in
the corporate boundaries of the City, commencing no more than 90 days after

to administrative proceedings under the laws of the State of Iowa and by the

operator specifying the violation or violations. The cable operator shall
respond in writing to such notice within 10 days following receipt of the same.

explanation as the cable operator desires. The cable operator may also request
a hearing before the Council at which time it shall have an opportunity to be
heard and to present evidence concerning the alleged violation. Such request
shall be included in the response. A failure by the cable operator to respond
within the time specified shall be deemed an admission of the violation and the

request shall be made within the initial time for response as provided above.
If such request is granted the City shall so notify the cable operator in
writing and the cable operator shall makes its response within the time
requested. If the request is denied, the City shall so notify the cable
operator in writing, in which case the cable operator shall respond within 10

response and any hearing thereon, the Council shall take whatever action it
deems appropriate under the circumstances, including, but not limited to,
imposition of the penalties provided for in this chapter.

the provisions of this chapter, the City may order the cable operator to reduce
the rate for basic cable tier service by 10 percent until such time as the City
is satisfied that the cable operator is in full compliance with the provisions
of this chapter. In the case of the violations which are corrected prior to
determination by the City that a violation did occur, the City may order the
cable operator to reduce such rates for a period of time equal to the period of
time during which the violation existed. Additionally, and not in substitution
of the foregoing, any violation of the provisions of this chapter is a
municipal infraction subject to imposition of the penalties prescribed therefor
in this Code of Ordinances.
117.06 ENFORCEMENT.

equity and shall have, in addition to and not in substitution of the remedies

151.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms are defined:
   1.   “DBH” or “caliper” means the diameter of a tree at breast height (four
feet, six inches).
   2.   “Park trees” means trees, shrubs, bushes, and all other woody
vegetation located in public parks having individual names, and all areas owned
by the City or to which the public has free access as a park, including trees,
shrubs, bushes, and all other woody vegetation located in parkway easements
along public streets designated as parkways.
   3.   “Parking” means that part of the street right-of-way in the City not
covered by sidewalk and lying between the lot line and the curb line; or, on
unpaved streets, that part of the street right-of-way lying between the lot
line and that portion of the street usually traveled by vehicular traffic.
   4.   “Private trees” means trees, shrubs, bushes, and all other woody
vegetation located on private property to which the City has no responsibility.
   5.   “Public right-of-way” means any publicly-owned property or easement
area intended to provide for a public street, sidewalk or other public
property, and includes, but is not limited to, the parking area between the
curb of any public street and the adjacent public sidewalk.
   6.   “Street tree” means any tree, shrub, bush, or other woody vegetation
has been approved by the City Council for a specific location in the public
right-of-way parking and/or parkway easement.
   7.   “Topping” means the severe cutting back of limbs to stubs within the
tree’s crown to such a degree so as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure
the tree. Trees severely damaged by storms, diseases or other causes, or
certain trees under utility wires or other obstructions where other pruning
practices are impractical may be exempted from this chapter at the
determination of the City.
151.02 PLANTING PROHIBITED.
   No trees, shrubs, bushes, or woody vegetation shall be planted in any public
right-of-way, including parking or within island medians of divided streets,
located within the City except in compliance with the provisions of this
chapter.
151.03 PUBLIC TREE CARE.
   Except as limited by Section
151.02 of this chapter, the City has the right to plant, prune, maintain and
remove trees, plants, and shrubs within the lines of all streets, avenues,
stands and public grounds, as may be necessary to ensure public safety or to
preserve or enhance the symmetry and beauty of such public grounds.
151.04 STREET TREE PERMIT REQUIRED.
   Any person proposing to plant a tree on or in a public right-of-way shall be
required to obtain approval of permit from the City based on the process
described herein:
   1.   Plan Submitted. Any person proposing to plant a tree on or in a public
right-of-way shall first prepare a written plan which shall contain the
following information:
      A.   The names and addresses of the person making the proposal and of all
private property owners whose property is adjacent to or contiguous with the
public right-of-way upon or in which the proposed trees are to be planted.
      B.   The location of the property where the proposed planting is to take
place.
      C.   The type and number of trees proposed to be planted and a sketch or
drawing showing how the plantings will be placed on the property. The sketch or
drawing shall show distances between proposed trees and distances of proposed
tree plantings from existing streets, sidewalks, traffic signs, utility lines,
utility poles, hydrants and intersections.
      D.   The plan shall be signed by the person submitting the same.
   2.   Review of Plan. The City Public Works Director shall review each plan
submitted and shall either approve it or deny it, in writing, within 30 days
after it is received. If denied, the plan may be resubmitted with any
modifications required by the Public Works Director. The decision of the Public
Works Director shall be final.
   3.   Guidelines. No plan submitted pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter shall be approved unless all of the following conditions are met:
      A.   Any tree proposed to be planted in accordance with the terms of this
section must be of a type included on the list of tree species suitable for
planting within the right-of-way, as established from time to time by
resolution of the City Council, subsequent to a recommendation of the City Tree
Board.
      B.   Trees must be spaced at least 15 feet apart, center to center.
      C.   Every tree to be planted must have a trunk diameter of at least one
inch, measured 12 inches from the base.
      D.   Trees must be planted a minimum of:
         (1)   Five lineal feet from water service stop boxes.
         (2)   10 lineal feet from water hydrants, utility poles, transformers,
telephone junction boxes, manholes and driveway approaches.
         (3)   20 lineal feet from traffic signs and street lights.
      E.   No tree shall be planted closer than three feet from the curb line
and no closer than three feet from the edge of the sidewalk closest to the
street. No tree shall be planted where there is, or will be at the tree’s
maturity, less than two and one-half feet of soil on all sides of such tree.
      F.   Trees shall not be permitted within 30 feet of the intersection of
the rights-of-way of public streets or within 20 feet of the intersection of
the curb line of driveways of commercial, industrial or institutional
properties with a public street.
      G.   No tree shall be permitted in any case which, because of its size or
location, or because of its eventual growth, will interfere with street signs,
fire hydrants, street lights, utility poles or utility lines; or which will
create any hazard to the safe flow of traffic by obstructing vision or
otherwise.
      H.   During the development, redevelopment, razing or renovating of any
property, no more than 50 percent of the trees existing in the public right-of-
way adjoining such property shall be cut, damaged or removed, nor shall any
person excavate any ditch, tunnel or trench or lay any driveway within a radius
of 20 feet from any tree in the public right-of-way. Provided, however, the
Public Works Director may issue a special permit to allow cutting or removal of
trees or excavation which would otherwise violate this provision on application
therefor by the owner of the property and upon determination by the Public
Works Director that variance from the provisions of this section is reasonably
necessary to enable development of the property in accordance with previously
approved development plans.
      I.   No person shall intentionally damage, cut, carve, attach any rope,
wire, nails, advertising posters, or other contrivance to any tree in or on a
public right-of-way; or allow any gaseous, liquid, chemical, or solid substance
that is harmful to such trees to come into contact with them; or set fire to
any such tree or part thereof, or cause or permit any burning which will damage
any such tree or a part thereof.
      J.   Tree topping is not permitted on any tree in or on a public right-
of-way.
   4.   Maintenance; Liability. Any person planting trees in or on a public
right-of-way pursuant to this chapter and such person’s successors in interest
shall be and remain solely responsible for the proper maintenance of such tree
or trees in compliance with this chapter and all other ordinances and
regulations of the City. At the time that the request for approval for the
planting of such trees is made, such person shall agree in writing, as a
condition to such approval being given, to assume, pay and hold the City
harmless from payment or liability for any damages of any nature whatsoever
caused by the planting or maintenance of the trees.
151.05 DUTY TO TRIM.
   1.   All trees, shrubs, bushes, or woody vegetation; whether on public or
private property; which have branches overhanging a public street or sidewalk
shall be kept trimmed to a clearance height of 14 feet for branches overhanging
a street and 10 feet for branches overhanging a sidewalk. It is the duty of any
person owning or occupying real property adjoining a public street or sidewalk
and on which there may be trees, shrubs, bushes, or woody vegetation to prune
such plantings, at a minimum, in such a manner as to comply with this section,
and in addition, to the extent necessary, to preclude any obstruction or
shading of street lights, any obstruction to the passage of pedestrians on
sidewalk, any obstruction to the vision of traffic signs, or of street or alley
intersections.
   2.   It is the duty of any person owning or occupying real property
adjoining a public street or sidewalk and on which there may be trees, shrubs,
bushes, or woody vegetation to remove all dead, diseased or dangerous trees, or
broken or decayed limbs which constitute a menace to the safety of the public.
   3.   The City has the right to prune any tree or shrub on private property
when it interferes with the proper spread of light along the street from a
streetlight, interferes with the visibility of any traffic control device or
sign, or violates the terms of this subsection.
151.06 REMOVAL OF TREES AND STUMPS.
   1.   Dead or Diseased Tree Removal on Private Property. The owner or person
in possession of private property shall remove any trees constituting a hazard
to life or property, or trees harboring insects or disease which constitute a
potential threat to other trees within the City located on the private property
within the City.
   2.   All trees removed from public right-of-way shall be completely removed
below the surface of the ground so the top of the stump does not project above
the surface of the ground; and shall be disposed of in a lawful manner.
151.07 CITY ABATEMENT; ASSESSMENT OF COST.
   If the abutting property owner or person in possession of the abutting
property fails to trim the trees as required in Section
151.05 or remove trees and stumps as required in Section
151.06, the City may serve notice on the abutting property owner requiring the
property owner to do so within 30 days. If the property owner fails to trim the
trees within that time, the City may perform the required action and assess the
costs against the abutting property for collection in the same manner as a
property tax.
151.08 NON-CONFORMING TREES IN PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY.
   Any existing tree with 50 percent or more of its trunk located within the
public right-of-way at the time as of the effective date of the ordinance
codified in this chapter shall be considered a non-conforming public tree.
Maintenance of said non-conforming public tree shall be the responsibility of
the City, including removal of said tree at the sole discretion of the City.
Any existing tree with less than 50 percent of its trunk located within the
public right-of-way at the time as of the effective date of the ordinance
codified in this chapter shall be considered a non-conforming private tree.
Maintenance of said non-conforming private tree shall be the responsibility of
the property owner, provided however that should said non-conforming tree need
to be removed due to a City construction project then the cost of such removal
shall be the responsibility of the City.
151.09 PARKWAY AND BUFFER TREES.
   Maintenance of any and all trees located within a parkway easement, buffer
easement or similar landscape easement or within a buffer area required in
conformance of Section
165.19 shall be the responsibility of the property owner. Parkway trees shall
be maintained in a manner that preserves or enhance the symmetry and beauty of
the parkway and/or buffer area. Trees shall be of a type included on the list
of tree species suitable for planting within parkway or buffer easements unless
otherwise approved by City Council on a site plan. Any parkway or buffer tree
that has been removed for any reason shall be replaced as soon as practicable
with a tree of the same species as the original tree unless otherwise approved
by the City.
151.10 LANDSCAPE PLAN.
   1.   Submission of Plan; Required Information. In connection with the
submission of a site plan, site plan amendment, or preliminary plat for
approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Council, the applicant
shall submit a landscape plan, which must contain, at a minimum, the following
information:
      A.   The location of all existing trees four inches in diameter or
larger, when measured at the DBH, on public or private property, specifying the
size, species and condition of such existing trees (any such existing trees to
be removed shall be noted);
      B.   The location of all new plant material to be planted on the
property, shown by size and species; and
      C.   A landscape plan filed in connection with a preliminary plat need
only show the outline of existing trees and foliage, clarifying the drip line
area of trees with the use of “clouded” areas of individual or clumping of
trees. Existing tree areas to be protected shall be shaded. Existing tree areas
to be removed by grading, construction of public improvements, or within the
buildable area of each lot shall be hatched to clarify the limits of removal.
      D.   A parkway easement having a minimum width of 15 feet shall be
established on private lots abutting all public streets designated as parkways
on the Comprehensive Plan and/or so designated on the approved preliminary
plat. Said easement shall be designed to accommodate street trees, benches,
bike rack, and similar amenities. Parkway easements shall be exclusive of
public utility easements. A landscape plan shall be filed for each parkway
showing the size and species of all plant materials and clarifying whether the
trees will be planted by the developer at the time of plat construction or by
the homebuilder prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Tree species
shall be in conformance with the list of acceptable trees approved by the City
Council; a diversification of species along parkways is encouraged.
   2.   Preliminary Plat Evaluation; Considerations. In evaluating any
preliminary plat or site plan for approval, the Commission and the Council
shall consider the following issues addressed by the landscape plan:
      A.   Whether an excessive or unnecessary number of existing trees are to
be removed, taking into consideration the City’s goal of preserving existing
trees and any reasonable alternatives available to the developer;
      B.   All site plans in zoning districts shall be planted with a variety
of trees and shrubs which are substantial in size and number, and are in
accordance with the City’s policy on recommended trees;
      C.   Whether the applicant has provided for the replacement of existing
trees to be removed, at other locations on the property;
      D.   Whether the landscaping provides a visual buffer, where necessary,
from the surrounding property including headlight screening for streets; and
      E.   Whether the streets, sidewalks and lots are laid out in a manner to
preserve existing trees, where feasible, and whether the applicant has provided
for fencing off or protecting trees during construction, to the extent
feasible.
      F.   Whether parkways are designed in accordance with the Comprehensive
Plan.
   3.   Protection of Existing Trees Not Being Removed. Any and all existing
trees which are not to be removed pursuant to the landscape plan shall be
clearly identified and, prior to the issuance of a grading permit, shall be
protected at the construction site by fencing located around the drip line of
the tree, where feasible, maximizing the protection of the root zone area of
the tree. The foregoing fencing requirements may be waived or modified by the
City if the trees to be saved are not located in an area where construction is
occurring.
   4.   Grading Permits; Council Approval Before Permit Issuance. Prior to the
issuance of any grading permit or demolition permit for the development of any
property that will require site plan or plat approval, the applicant shall
disclose to the City whether any existing tree, four inches in diameter or
larger, when measured at the DBH, are to be removed. If any such trees are to
be removed, the City shall not issue a grading permit or demolition permit
until a site plan or preliminary plat has been approved by the Council. This is
not to include occupied single-family dwellings or two-family dwellings.
   5.   Certificate of Occupancy; Trees Required for Residential Uses.  Prior
to the issuance of a permanent certificate of occupancy for any new one- and
two-family residential home, all trees required by Section
151.11 of this chapter shall have been planted. Prior to the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy for any new multiple-family dwelling, each multiple-
family residential dwelling unit shall have all of the adjacent planting
materials as shown on the approved site plan and deemed by the Building
Inspector to be closest to said dwelling unit.
   6.   Illegal Tree Removal; Remedial Action. If any trees are removed in
violation of an approved site plan or plat, the owner or developer shall plant
three times such number of trees, of equal caliper, on such plat or site plan.
If it is impractical to replace such a tree with an equal caliper tree, then
several trees of a smaller caliper, totaling, in aggregate, the caliper of the
improperly removed tree, shall be required. The specific number and size of
such trees shall be determined by the City. For purposes of example only, if
one eight-inch caliper tree is improperly removed, the City may require: (i)
that three eight-inch caliper trees be planted;(ii) that six four-inch caliper
trees be planted; or (iii) that 12 two-inch caliper trees be planted. If it is
impractical to place all of such trees on that particular plat or site plan,
the City may require that some of the trees be planted on public property, such
as in a park.
   7.   Diseased or Damaged Plantings; Replacement. If any trees, vegetation or
other landscape materials shown on an approved landscape plan shall become
diseased or substantially damaged at any time after the landscape plan is
approved, the owner of the property shall promptly replace such trees,
vegetation, or landscape material to bring the property in compliance with the
landscape plan.
151.11 TREES REQUIRED WITH BUILDING PERMIT FOR ONE- AND TWO-FAMILY HOMES.
   In conjunction with a building permit for any new single-family home, one
overstory tree shall be planted in the front yard prior to issuance of a
permanent certificate of occupancy for said home. In conjunction with a
building permit for any new two-family home, two trees shall be planted in the
front yard, with one tree in front of each dwelling unit, prior to issuance of
a permanent certificate of occupancy for said homes. The required trees for the
two-family home may be either two overstory trees or one overstory and one
understory trees. All trees required by this section shall be from the list of
suitable trees as approved by City Council, provided, however, that species
selection shall be the responsibility of the property owner based on site
considerations. All trees required by this section shall be not less than one-
inch caliper. In cases where there are existing trees in the front yard of any
single-family or two-family home, deemed to be suitable in terms of condition
and species by the City Manager or designee thereof, the requirement for new
overstory trees may be reduced or waived by the City Manager.
151.12 TREE PLANTING GUIDELINES.
   Trees that are required to be planted on private property by a developer in
conjunction with a subdivision plat as required by Chapter 170; by a developer
in conjunction with a site plan as required by Chapter 157; or by a property
owner or homebuilder in conjunction with a building permit as required by
Section
151.11 shall be planted in conformance with the following guidelines. Trees not
required by City Code that property owners choose to plant on their own
property do not need to be planted by these guidelines.
   1.   All required trees shall be delivered to the site as balled-and-
burlapped trees or via tree spade. Trees in containers shall not be considered
acceptable.
   2.   The developer or property owner shall be responsible for regular
watering of said required trees. Gator bags, perforated buckets, or similar
means of slow release watering are recommended.
   3.   All required trees shall be mulched with wood chips, bark, or similar
material designed to prevent excessive evaporation.
   4.   All required trees shall be staked for a period of one year following
planting.
151.13 ENFORCEMENT.
   Unless another penalty is expressly provided by this chapter for any
particular provision or section, any violation of this chapter is declared to
be a municipal infraction. The rights and remedies of the City hereunder are in
addition to, and not in substitution of, any other or further rights or
remedies the City may have under this Code of Ordinances or State law.
151.14 TREE SERVICE BUSINESSES.
   Any person owning or operating a tree service business within the City shall
obtain, maintain, and provide to the Clerk evidence of liability insurance
coverage covering all risk of damage or liability arising out of the conduct of
such business in minimum amounts of $100,000.00 for property damage and
$300,000.00 for injury to or death of any one person. Proof of such coverage
delivered to the Clerk shall be a prerequisite to the conduct by any person of
a tree service business in the City.
CHAPTER 152
WEEDS
152.01 REMOVAL OF WEEDS.
   It is the duty of the owners of any property within the City to keep such
property free from weeds, vines, brush, or other vegetation when such growth
constitutes a health, safety, or fire hazard. No person shall allow or permit
grass or weeds to grow upon such person’s property to a height in excess of six
inches. The only exception to this chapter is prairie grass or forbes in
accordance with an approved site plan. All grass or weeds in excess of such
height shall be cut or eliminated by the City after giving three-days’ written
notice to the owner or occupant of such property. Such notice may be personally
mailed, by ordinary mail, to the owner’s last known address, no less than five
days before the required action. A failure to receive such notice shall not be
deemed to be a defense to any assessment certified under this section. The
actual cost of cutting or elimination of such grass or weeds shall be assessed
against the property for collection in the same manner as property taxes. An
owner or occupant of a property which receives two written notices in a 12-
month period may be subject to a municipal infraction in accordance with
Chapter 3 of this Code of Ordinances.

157.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   It is the intent and purpose of this chapter to establish a procedure by
which the City can review proposed improvements of property within a specified
zoning district. The site plan requirements of this chapter are designed to aid
the City Building Department, Planning and Zoning Commission, and the Council
in issuing building permits, promoting the most beneficial relation between the
uses of land and the circulation of traffic throughout the City, encouraging
adequate provisions for surface and subsurface drainage, insuring that the
proposed facilities shall meet the existing City zoning and building
requirements, and insuring the availability and capacity of public facilities
for the proposed installation.
157.02 SITE PLAN SUBMITTAL.
   1.   A site plan shall be submitted as outlined in this chapter for all
proposed improvement installations, including new building construction,
building addition construction, accessory building construction, and parking
facilities construction for proposed or existing structures and sites in any of
the zoning districts.

Department’s review, the Planning and Zoning Commission, at its next regular
meeting, shall approve the site plan as submitted if the same conforms to all
State and local regulations and ordinances. If the site plan fails to conform
to all State regulations and applicable ordinances, the Commission shall state
the reasons for its disapproval and shall return a copy to the applicant for
revision in accordance with the action taken. The applicant shall then submit
the revised copy to the Building Department and City Engineer for their review
and comments for presentation at the next regular Planning and Zoning

157.09 ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS.
   The requirements, guidelines and standards set forth in this section shall
apply to any development or redevelopment of property within the zoning
districts listed in Section
165.04 of this Code of Ordinances and within the City.
   1.   Statement of Intent. In the interest of promoting the general welfare
of the community and to protect the value of buildings and property, the image
and character of a community is considered important. It is recognized that a
community should be visually attractive, as well as financially prosperous and
the manner in which a use is accomplished is as important as the use. The
quality of architecture and building construction is important to the
preservation and enhancement of building and property values, prevention of the
physical deterioration of buildings and the promotion of the image of the
community and the general welfare of its citizens. Architectural design and use
of materials for the construction of any building shall be subject to the
approval of the Council upon input and recommendations of the Planning and
Zoning Commission.
   2.   Architectural Standards by Zoning District and Use. Architectural plans
for buildings shall be submitted simultaneously with an application for site
plan review as required in this chapter. Documentation to be submitted shall
include building elevations showing the building’s design and exterior
materials and any other information as deemed necessary to make a
recommendation for approval. Detailed information relating to any lighting or
signage on the structure shall be provided, including backlit material or
accent lighting and shall be in conformance with Chapter 166 of this Code of
Ordinances. The architectural design shall be in accordance with the standards
as contained in this section and shall be in compliance with the following
general provisions:
      A.   The architectural theme of any development within a C-2, C-3 or C-
4 District shall be dominated with permanency and strength of materials in
proportion to the aesthetic characteristics of the architectural bulk, shape,
materials and color, and shall be compatible with other structures within the
immediate surrounding development area and the zoning district. The buildings
within this district, both as principal permitted uses and accessory uses,
shall be designed and constructed with such materials as may be necessary in
order to assure durability, permanency and continued aesthetic quality. The
general manner in which any use and development is accomplished shall be
compatible to and in harmony with the character of the zoning district as
established or proposed. Existing or potential land use conflicts shall be
avoided through proper orientation, open space, setbacks, landscaping and
screening, grading, traffic circulation and architectural compatibility.
      B.   Canopies, awnings and similar portico coverings for windows and
walkways are encouraged for added architectural character.
      C.   Pitched roofs with gables, hips, dormers and similar offsetting and
intersecting roof lines are desirable for increased architectural interest.
   3.   Quality of Construction.
      A.   Wall Area Defined. In the application of these requirements, some
standards are based upon a percentage of the wall area. The wall area is
defined as the total square footage of the exterior elevation of the building,
excluding glass that is vertical to the ground. It shall contain a gable end or
dormer in the same plane of view. It does not contain the elevation area of a
pitched or mansard roof, but would include the area of a parapet wall. The non-
glazed area of all doors, including overhead doors, shall be considered part of
the total wall area. Each elevation must comply with the standards unless
otherwise provided for herein or as amended or approved by the Council.
      B.   In the C-TS District, all building facades facing a public street
shall have a minimum of 75 percent of the wall area constructed of brick or an
acceptable alternative as defined herein. All building facades not facing a
public street shall have a minimum of 50 percent of the wall area constructed
of brick or acceptable alternative.
      C.   In the C-1, C-2, C-3 and C-4 Districts, for all non-single-family or
two-family residential buildings, all building facades facing a public street
shall have a minimum of 60 percent of the wall area constructed of brick or an
acceptable alternative as defined herein. All facades of such buildings that
are not facing a public street shall have a minimum of 50 percent of the wall
area constructed of brick or acceptable alternative.
      D.   In PUD Districts, architectural design standards, including the
percentage of brick required for various building types and facades, shall be
as approved with the PUD Master Plan and/or rezoning ordinance.
      E.   In the R-2 District, for all non-single-family or two-family
residential buildings, all residential building facades facing a public or
private street shall have a minimum of 15 percent of the applicable wall area
constructed of brick or an acceptable alternative as defined herein.
      F.   In the R-2A District, for all non-single-family or two-family
residential buildings containing four or fewer dwelling units, all building
facades facing a public or private street shall have a minimum of 15 percent of
the applicable wall area constructed of brick or an acceptable alternative as
defined herein. For all non-single-family or two-family residential buildings
containing more than four dwelling units, all building facades facing a public
or private street shall have a minimum of 30 percent of the applicable wall
area constructed of brick or an acceptable alternative as defined herein.
      G.   In the R-3 District, for all non-single-family or two-family
residential buildings containing four or fewer dwelling units, all building
facades facing a public or private street shall have a minimum of 15 percent of
the applicable wall area constructed of brick or an acceptable alternative as
defined herein. For all non-single-family or two-family residential buildings
containing more than four dwelling units, all building facades facing a public
or private street shall have a minimum of 30 percent of the applicable wall
area constructed of brick or an acceptable alternative as defined herein.
      H.   For all nonresidential buildings in residential districts (other
than permitted accessory structures), all building facades facing a public or
private street shall have a minimum of 60 percent of the applicable wall area
constructed of brick or an acceptable alternative as defined herein. All
facades of such buildings that are not facing a public or private street shall
have a minimum of 50 percent of the applicable wall area constructed of brick
or acceptable alternative. Exceptions may be recommended to the Council by the
Planning and Zoning Commission to preserve any existing architectural theme or
historical ambiance, which may or may not be approved by the Council.
      I.   Existing non-conformance renovation or addition exceeding 50 percent
of building value or no more than 25 percent square footage of gross floor area
must bring entire building into conformance.
   4.   Acceptable Finish Materials for Exterior Building Walls.
      A.   Acceptable Materials. For the purposes of this section, the
following materials are deemed sufficient to provide for permanency and
strength of materials in proportion to the aesthetic characteristics of
architectural bulk, shape and materials:
         (1)   Brick, stone, marble, granite, and other similar masonry veneers
and fascia.
         (2)   Glass and glass window panel systems.
         (3)   Aluminum, steel, vinyl, fiber cement board, solid wood,
engineered wood, and similar lap siding when in character with the
architectural characteristics of the structure.
         (4)   Textured, fluted or similar exposed concrete block masonry
materials.
         (5)   Textured, concrete tilt-up panel construction systems.
         (6)   Stucco and staccato board and trim.
         (7)   Exceptions to the above may be granted by the Council in order
to be in character with surrounding development.
      B.   Acceptable Alternative Materials Where Brick is Required. On
exterior walls, where a percentage of the wall area is required by this section
to be constructed of brick or an acceptable alternative, the acceptable
alternatives are defined as follows:
         (1)   Brick, including thin brick veneer systems.
         (2)   Stone, including marble, granite, or cultured stone.
         (3)   Architectural concrete or stone panels.
         (4)   Architectural steel panels.
         (5)   Textured concrete block.
         (6)   Other acceptable materials deemed suitable by the Council upon
recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      C.   Unacceptable Materials. The following are not deemed sufficient to
provide permanency and strength of materials in proportion to the aesthetic
characteristics of the architectural bulk, shape and materials when not
specifically a part of an approved architectural character or theme:
         (1)   Plywood and similar sheet, untextured wood coverings.
         (2)   Particle board, pressed board and similar composite siding
materials.
         (3)   Common concrete block when used for exterior fascia, whether
painted or not.
         (4)   Vertical steel siding.
   5.   Additional Architectural Elements. In order to reduce the negative
aesthetic impacts of large buildings, additional architectural elements shall
be incorporated into the overall building design and shall incorporate the
following:
      A.   Non-single-family buildings proposed in residential districts shall
incorporate residential design elements such as pitched roofs, dormers,
cupolas, or other similar roof elements into the building design in order to
minimize the aesthetic impact of the differing uses.
      B.   Multiple-family buildings shall be designed in a manner compatible
with residential uses in the vicinity. Architectural design for multiple-family
buildings shall attempt to lessen the plainness of appearance, which can be
characteristic of large residential buildings. Multiple-family buildings with
plain walls and boxy appearance are not encouraged. Their architectural design
shall use a combination of the following design techniques, as appropriate:
         (1)   Exterior building materials shall employ a variety of textures
and colors and window and door details and be in compliance with Paragraphs F
and G of Subsection 2 of this section, as applicable.
         (2)   The roof shall be principally of gable, hip style or similar
residential design.
         (3)   The structures’ perimeter shall vary when multiple buildings are
proposed.
      C.   Buildings proposed in commercial districts that are adjacent to
residential developments are recommended to include an articulated roofline,
giving emphasis to architectural elements that will help divide the mass of a
large building into smaller, identifiable pieces. Flat roof buildings shall not
be encouraged. Building architectural design within these districts, and
including PUD Districts constituting similar uses, shall recognize the
importance of material strength and permanency through the selection of
building materials, and the principle of structural strength and permanency
shall dominate the structural and exterior materials and components in
compliance with Subsection 2 of this section.
      D.   Buildings shall not be designed or orientated to expose loading
docks, service areas, HVAC elements, garbage dumpsters, or nonresidential
overhead doors to the public rights-of-way.
         (1)   Buildings proposed in commercial districts adjacent to
residential developments or districts shall not be designed or orientated to
expose HVAC elements, garbage dumpsters, or nonresidential overhead doors
toward the adjacent residential developments or areas.
         (2)   If it is not feasible to design or orient the loading docks,
service areas, or similar operations away from the residential developments,
areas or public rights-of-way, additional landscape buffering, screening walls,
fences, and setbacks may be recommended by the Planning and Zoning Commission
to the Council which may or may not approve the recommendation.
      E.   Screening shall be provided for roof-mounted HVAC units to conceal
such units from public view.
   6.   General Provisions. Adequate treatment or screening of negative aspects
of buildings (loading docks, loading areas, outside storage areas, garbage
dumpsters and HVAC mechanical units) from any public street and adjoining
properties shall be required. The Council, in its sole discretion and after
receiving a recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission, may approve
additional primary materials on a case-by-case basis, provided that such
materials exhibit the structural strength and permanency desired, contain
sufficient architectural relief, and do not detract from the desired aesthetic
character of the building and the surrounding area.
157.10 APPROVAL AND PENALTIES.
   1.   No building permits shall be issued for any building or development
construction that is subject to this chapter until a site plan has been
submitted and approved for each development in accordance with this chapter. No
certification of occupancy shall be issued for such construction or development
until all terms and conditions of the approved site plan have been
satisfactorily completed or provided for with the approval of the City.
   2.   Construction, grading, or other development activities for those uses
listed above shall be carried out only in substantial compliance with the
approved site plan and any conditions or restrictions attached thereto. Except
for the construction contemplated and approved as a part of the site plan,
there shall be no construction within the development area unless the person
proposing such construction shall have first obtained approval of the Planning
and Zoning Commission. Any application for approval of subsequent construction
shall be accompanied by a fee in accordance with the fee schedule established
by resolution of the Council.
   3.   A site plan shall become effective upon approval by the Council,
pursuant to this chapter. The approval of any site plan required by this
chapter shall remain valid for one year after the date of approval, after which
time the site plan shall be deemed null and void if the development has not
been established or actual construction commenced. For the purpose of this
chapter “actual construction” means that the permanent placement of
construction materials has started and is proceeding without undue delay.
Preparation of plans, securing financial arrangements, issuance of additional
building permits, letting of contracts, grading of the property, or stockpiling
of materials on the site do not constitute actual construction. Site plans
without on-going construction activity on the site plan improvements for a
period of one year shall expire and terminate unless the Council has, upon
written notice by the developer, granted an extension for a period not to
exceed one additional year.
   4.   Appropriate actions and proceeding may be taken by law or in equity to
prevent any violations of these regulations, to prevent unlawful construction,
to recover damages, to restrain, to correct or abate a violation, to prevent
illegal occupancy of a building, structure or premises.
      A.   Failure to maintain a site in accordance with an approved site plan
shall constitute a violation of this chapter and a failure to correct such a
violation within 30 days following notice of violation shall render the site
plan and any certificates of zoning compliance and occupancy subject to
cancellation.
      B.   Failure to acquire site plan approval where required, prior to
construction, alteration, or other modification of a building, sign or
structure, shall constitute a violation of this chapter. Failure to correct
such a violation within 30 days following notice of violation shall render the
site plan and any certificates of zoning compliance and occupancy subject to
cancellation. In addition, the Building Official shall post a stop-work order
relating to work in the process of completion outside the requirements of this
chapter.
      C.   Penalties for a violation of this chapter or failure to comply with
any of its requirements shall constitute a municipal infraction as set forth in
Chapter 3 of this Code of Ordinances. Each day that a violation occurs shall
constitute a separate offense. In the event that the City seeks court
intervention for violation of any provisions of this chapter, the City may seek
reimbursement for reasonable attorney fees and administrative costs. Nothing
herein contained shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful action as
is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
   5.   It is unlawful to locate, erect, construct, reconstruct, enlarge,
change, maintain or use any building or land in violation of any regulation in
or any provisions of this chapter, or any amendment or supplement thereto. Any
person violating any regulation in or any provision of this chapter or of any
amendment or supplement thereto shall be in violation of this Code of
Ordinances and each and every day during which illegal location, erection,
construction, reconstruction, enlargement, change, maintenance, or use
continues may be deemed a separate offense.
   6.   Minor deviations to the approved site plan may be approved by the City
Manager.

means either the first placement or permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of pile, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a factory-built home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of the building, whether or not that alteration affects
the external dimensions of the building.
   33.   “Structure” means anything constructed or erected on the ground or
attached to the ground, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories,
sheds, cabins, factory-built homes, storage tanks, grain storage facilities,
and/or other similar uses.
   34.   “Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage
condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred. Volunteer labor and donated materials shall be
included in the estimated cost of repair.
   35.   “Substantial improvement” means any improvement to a structure which
satisfies either of the following criteria:
      A.   Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost
of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure
either: (i) before the start of construction of the improvement; or (ii) if the
structure has been substantially damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred. The term does not, however, include any project for
improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of State or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions. The term also does not include any alteration of
a historic structure, provided the alteration will not preclude the structure’s
designation as a historic structure.
      B.   Any addition which increases the original floor area of a building
by 25 percent or more. All additions constructed after the effective date of
the first floodplain management regulations adopted by the community shall be
added to any proposed addition in determining whether the total increase in
original floor space would exceed 25 percent.
   36.   “Variance” means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of
the floodplain management regulations.
   37.   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations.
160.02 STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
   1.   The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 364 of the Code of
Iowa, as amended, delegated the power to cities to exercise any power and
perform any function it deems appropriate to protect and preserve the rights,
privileges and property of the City or of its residents, and to preserve and
improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort and convenience of
its residents.
   2.   Findings of Fact.
      A.   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of
the community.
      B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are
caused by: (i) The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood
damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately
elevated or otherwise protected from flooding and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
      C.   This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
   3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Section
160.02(2)(A) of this chapter with provisions designed to:
      A.   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows
so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
      B.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
      C.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
      D.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
      E.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   1.   Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter shall
apply to all lands and uses which have significant flood hazards. The Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Polk County and Incorporated Areas, City of Polk
City, Panels 19153C0030F, 0040F, 0045F, dated February 1, 2019, which were
prepared as part of the Polk County Flood Insurance Study, and the Big Creek/
Wolf Creek Study, dated October 25, 2018, shall be used to identify such flood
hazard areas and all areas shown thereon to be within the boundaries of the
base flood shall be considered as having significant flood hazards. Where
uncertainty exists with respect to the precise location of the base flood
boundary, the location shall be determined on the basis of the base flood
elevation at the particular site in question. The Flood Insurance Study for the
County of Polk County is hereby adopted by reference and is made a part of this
chapter for the purpose of administering floodplain management regulations.
This chapter shall additionally apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of
the City that have not been mapped on a FIRM or a Flood Hazard Boundary Map
and/or have been identified by the community as having the presence of flood-
prone areas.
   2.   Rules for Interpretation of Flood Hazard Boundaries. The boundaries of
the Special Flood Hazard Areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the
official Flood Insurance Rate Map. When an interpretation is needed as to the
exact location of a boundary, the City Manager shall make the necessary
interpretation. In the event of a conflict between the Flood Insurance Rate Map
dated February 1, 2019, and the Big Creek/Wolf Creek Study dated October 25,
2018, the more stringent map shall be used. The Planning and Zoning Commission
shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any
requirement, decision, or determination made by the City in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
   3.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used, and no
structure shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered
without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
   4.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provision of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with
this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
   5.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
   6.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated Special Flood Hazard Areas will be
free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on
the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made there under.
   7.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.
160.04 ADMINISTRATION.

in writing, of the specific reasons, therefore. The Administrator shall not
issue permits for variances except as directed by the Planning and
Zoning Commission.
      D.   Construction and Use to be as Provided in Application and Plans.
Floodplain development permits based on the basis of approved plans and
applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in
such approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement or
construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. The applicant shall be
required to submit certification by a professional engineer or land surveyor,
as appropriate, registered in the State of Iowa, that the finished fill,
structure floor elevations, floodproofing, or other flood protection measures
were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to
the use or occupancy of any structure.
160.05 FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT STANDARDS.
   All development must be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage
and meet the following applicable performance standards. Where base flood
elevations have not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to determine: (i) whether
the land involved is either wholly or partly within the floodway or floodway
fringe; and (ii) the base flood elevation. Until a regulatory floodway is
designated, no development may increase the base flood elevation more than one
foot. The applicant will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural
Resources with sufficient technical information to make such determination.
Review by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources is not required for the
proposed construction of new or replacement bridges or culverts where: (i) the
bridge or culvert is located on a stream that drains less than two square
miles; and (ii) the bridge or culvert is not associated with a channel
modification that constitutes a channel change as specified in 567 IAC 71.2(2).
   1.   All Development. All development within the special flood hazard areas
shall:
      A.   Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement.
      B.   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
      C.   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
      D.   Obtain all other necessary permits from federal, State and local
governmental agencies including approval when required from the Iowa Department
of Natural Resources.
   2.   Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the base flood elevation. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed subject to favorable
consideration by the City Council, where existing topography, street grades, or
other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods used must
be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various forces
and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential structures located in
areas that would become isolated due to flooding of surrounding ground shall be
provided with a means of access that will be passable by wheeled vehicles
during the base flood. However, this criterion shall not apply where the
Administrator determines there is sufficient flood warning time for the
protection of life and property. When estimating flood warning time,
consideration shall be given to the criteria listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa
Administrative Code.
   3.   Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be flood proofed to such a level. When
floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State of
Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and
other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the
base flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
   4.   All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
      A.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
         (1)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
         (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
         (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
   Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access and
low damage potential storage.
      B.   New and substantially improved structures shall be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
      C.   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
electric meter, electrical service panel box, hot water heater, heating, air
conditioning, ventilation equipment (including ductwork), and other similar
machinery and equipment elevated (or, in the case of non-residential
structures, optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one foot above the base
flood elevation.
      D.   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
plumbing, gas lines, water meters, gas meters, and other similar service
utilities either elevated (or in the case of non-residential structures,
optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation or designed to be watertight and withstand inundation to such a
level.
   5.   Factory-Built Homes.
      A.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the structure
is a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation.
      B.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame
ties to ground anchors. Anchorage systems may include, but are not limited to,
use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors as required by the State
Building Code.
   6.   Utility and Sanitary Systems.
      A.   On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located or
designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
      B.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system as well as
the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment facilities
(other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood protection
equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood elevation.
      C.   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water
supply treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with
a level of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood
elevation.
      D.   Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
   7.   Storage of Materials and Equipment. Storage of equipment and materials
that are flammable, explosive, or injurious to human, animal or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or:
(i) not subject to major flood damage and be anchored to prevent movement due
to flood waters; or (ii) readily removable from the area within the time
available after flood warning.
   8.   Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as
levees, flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the base
flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for
adequate interior drainage. In addition, structural flood control works shall
be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
   9.   Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must be
designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations must be
approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
   10.   Subdivisions. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and
subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the base flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50 lots
(whichever is less) shall include base flood elevation data for those areas
located within the Special Flood Hazard Area.
   11.   Accessory Structures to Residential Uses. Detached garages, sheds, and
similar structures that are incidental to a residential use are exempt from the
base flood elevation requirements where the following criteria are satisfied.
      A.   The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage potential.
Its size shall not exceed 600 square feet in size. Those portions of the
structure located less than one foot above the BFE must be constructed of
flood-resistant materials.
      B.   The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage potential
purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure shall not
be used for human habitation.
      C.   The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building site
so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
      D.   The structure shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement.
      E.   The structure’s service facilities such as electrical and heating
equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above the base
flood elevation.
      F.   The structure’s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of Subsection 4(A) of this section.
   Exemption from the base flood elevation requirements for such a structure
may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of the
structure and its contents.
   12.   Recreational Vehicles.
      A.   Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of Subsection
5 of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built homes when
the following criteria are satisfied.
         (1)   The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less
than 180 consecutive days; and
         (2)   The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
      B.   Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than 180
consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements of
Subsection 5 of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built
homes.
   13.   Pipeline Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be
buried in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to
prevent rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
   14.   Maximum Damage Potential Development. All new or substantially
improved maximum damage potential development shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated a minimum of one foot above the elevation of the
500-year flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be
floodproofed to such a level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional
engineer registered in the State of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing
methods used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities,
impact and uplift forces and other factors associated with the base flood; and
that the structure, below the base flood elevation is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water. A record of the
certification indicating the specific elevation (in relation to North American
Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are flood proofed shall be
maintained by the Administrator. Where 0.2 percent chance flood elevation data
has not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The applicant will
be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with
sufficient technical information to make such determinations.
   15.   Special Floodway Provisions. In addition to the General Floodplain
Standards, development within the floodway must meet the following applicable
standards. The floodway is that portion of the floodplain which must be
protected from developmental encroachment to allow the free flow of flood
waters. Where floodway data has been provided in the Flood Insurance Study,
such data shall be used to define the floodway. Where no floodway data has been
provided, the Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to provide a
floodway delineation. The applicant will be responsible for providing the
Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make
such determination.
      A.   No development shall be permitted in the floodway that would result
in any increase in the base flood elevation. Consideration of the effects of
any development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption that an
equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly situated lands.
      B.   All development within the floodway shall:
         (1)   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
         (2)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
         (3)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are
resistant to flood damage.
      C.   No development shall affect the capacity or conveyance of the
channel or floodway of any tributary to the main stream, drainage ditch, or any
other drainage facility or system.
      D.   Structures, buildings, recreational vehicles, and sanitary and
utility systems, if permitted, shall meet the applicable General Floodplain
standards and shall be constructed or aligned to present the minimum possible
resistance to flood flows.
      E.   Structures, if permitted, shall have a low flood damage potential
and shall not be for human habitation.
      F.   Storage of materials or equipment that are buoyant, flammable,
explosive, or injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. Storage
of other material may be allowed if readily removable from the floodway within
the time available after flood warning.
      G.   Watercourse alterations or relocations (channel changes and
modifications) must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within
the altered or relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations
must be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
      H.   Any fill allowed in the floodway must be shown to have some
beneficial purpose and shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary.
   Pipeline river or stream crossings shall be buried in the streambed and
banks or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due to channel
degradation and meandering or due to the action of flood flows.
160.06 VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   1.   The Planning and Zoning Commission may authorize upon request in
specific cases such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be
contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary
hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.
      A.   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
      B.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
      C.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      D.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for structures than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance
coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
      E.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
   2.   Factors upon Which the Decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission
Shall Be Based. In passing upon applications for variances, the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall consider all relevant factors specified in other
sections of this chapter and:
      A.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
      B.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
      C.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
      D.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      E.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the City.
      F.   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
      G.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
      H.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
      I.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for the area.
      J.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.

161.01 PURPOSE.
   Soil erosion contributes to the impairment of drainage ways; increases
maintenance costs for streets, storm sewers, and open ditches; contributes to
the destruction and obstruction to traveled roadways creating a potential
hazard for vehicular traffic, and contributes to contamination and degradation
of land surfaces and streams, flooding and dusty conditions. This chapter
establishes requirements for grading, filling, fill material, and for obtaining
grading permits in an effort to control erosion and sediment transport and to
prevent pollution. These standards include the use of suitable fill material,
stable slope construction, proper site drainage, pollution prevention, and
usability of public and private easements.

inspections, providing ongoing maintenance of erosion control devices, and
filing a Notice of Discontinuation upon final stabilization of the site.
   2.   The City’s tree ordinance requires City Council approval of a
landscaping plan in conjunction with site plans, site plan amendments, and
preliminary plats that designates the trees that are to be removed and provides
for the protection of trees that are to be saved. Applications for grading
permits shall be in compliance with the City’s tree ordinance and approved
landscaping plan.
   3.   Filling or construction within floodplain limits as established by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency and including areas regulated by the City’s
Floodplain Management Ordinance (Chapter 160 of this Code of Ordinances) will

times unless personnel are on site. All components must be located at least
four feet from the fence.
      E.   Other Standards. Ground-mount systems must comply with all required
standards for structures in the district in with the system is located.
      F.   Ground Cover. The City of Polk City encourages (but does not
require) owners of ground-mount solar gardens to plant the land underneath the
solar collectors in pollinator friendly wildflowers. Such plantings must be
maintained in such a way that they do not go to weeds or become predominantly
grass but afford passers-by a predominantly flower view during blooming season.
Such plantings shall be considered flower beds and shall be exempt from the
mowing requirements of Chapter 152. If wildflowers are not planted, the land
underneath the collectors must be neatly maintained in compliance with Chapter
52 of this Code of Ordinances.
      G.   Building Permit. Development of a solar garden inside the City
limits requires the issuance of a building permit, according to the process
detailed in Chapter 156.
      H.   Decommissioning. The City of Polk City requires that, as part of the
construction permit application, a decommissioning plan shall be submitted to
ensure that the facilities are properly removed after their useful life.
Decommissioning of the solar garden must occur in the event it (or a majority
part of it) is not in use for 12 consecutive months. The plan shall include
provisions for removal of all structures and foundations, restoration of the
soil and vegetation, and a plan ensuring financial resources will be available
to fully decommission the site. Disposal of the solar panels, racks, and
foundations must meet State requirements applicable at the time of
decommissioning. The City may require the posting of a bond, letter of credit
or the establishment of an escrow account to ensure proper decommissioning.

and in project buffer areas shall be planted and maintained in perennial
vegetated ground cover, and meet the following standards:
         (1)   Top soils shall not be removed during development, unless part
of a remediation effort.
      D.   Soils shall be planted and maintained in perennial vegetation to
prevent erosion, manage run off, and build soil. Seeds may include a mix of
grasses and wildflowers, but shall be predominantly wildflowers, ideally native
to the region that will result in a short stature prairie with a diversity of
forbs of flowering plants that bloom throughout the growing season. Blooming
shrubs may be used in buffer areas as appropriate for visual screening. Seed
mixes and maintenance practices should be consistent with recommendations made
by qualified natural resource professionals such as those from the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources, Polk County Soil and Water Conservation
Service, or the Natural Resource Conservation Service. Plant material must not
have been treated with systemic insecticides, particularly neonicontinoids.
Such plantings must be maintained in such a way that they do not go to weeds or
become predominantly grass but afford passers-by a predominantly flower view
during blooming season. Such plantings shall be considered flower beds and
shall be exempt from the mowing requirements of Chapter 152. If wildflowers are
not planted, the land underneath the collectors must be neatly maintained in
compliance with Chapter 152 of this Code.

between banks of solar panels and to nearby electric substations or
interconnections with buildings shall be buried underground. Exemptions may be
granted by the City in instances where shallow bedrock, water courses, or other
elements of the natural landscape interfere with the ability to bury lines, or
distance makes undergrounding infeasible, at the discretion of the City.
      H.   Site Security. A solar farm located wholly or partly within the
limits of the City must be completely surrounded by a chain link fence at least
six feet high. All gates musts be locked at all times unless personnel are on
site. All components must be located at least four feet from the fence.
      I.   Site Plan Required. A detailed site plan in conformance with Chapter
157 for both existing and proposed conditions must be submitted, showing
location of all solar arrays, other structures, property lines, rights-of-way,
service roads, floodplains, wetlands and other protected natural resources,
topography, electric equipment, and all other characteristics requested by the
City. The site plan shall also show all zoning districts.
      J.   Aviation Protection. For solar farms located within 500 feet of an
airport or within approach zones of an airport, the applicant must complete and
provide the results of the Solar Glare Hazard Analysis Tool (SGHAT) for the
airport traffic control tower cab and final approach paths, consistent with the
Interim Policy, FAA Review of Solar Energy Projects on Federally Obligated
Airports, or most recent version adopted by the FAA.

are not in use for 12 consecutive months. The plan shall include provisions for
removal of all structures and foundations, restoration of soil and vegetation
and a plan ensuring financial resources will be available to fully decommission
the site. Disposal of the solar panels, racks, and foundations must meet State
requirements applicable at the time of decommissioning. The City shall require
the posting of a bond, letter of credit or the establishment of an escrow
account to ensure proper decommissioning.
162.05 RESTRICTIONS ON SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS LIMITED.
   As of the effective date of this ordinance, new homeowners’ agreements,
covenants, common interest community standards, or other contracts between
multiple property owners located within the City shall not restrict or limit
solar energy systems to a greater extent that the City’s energy standards.
162.06 SOLAR ACCESS.
   The City encourages protection of solar access in all new subdivisions and
allows for solar resources to be protected consistent with Iowa statues.
   1.   Solar Easements Allowed. The City allows solar easements to be filed,

requirements for a principal building are complied with. An accessory building
which is not a part of the principal building shall not occupy more than 30
percent of the required rear yard and shall not exceed 16 feet in average
height; however, this regulation shall not be interpreted to prohibit the
construction of a garage up to 440 square feet in size on any rear yard that

shall be constructed upon a lot until the construction of the principal
building has been actually commenced, and no accessory building shall be used

on said plat to be established based on a measurement from the easement line
rather than the property line.
   6.   Corner Lots. For corner lots or reverse corner lots, the street side

containing two or more uses housed vertically, the required side yards for the
first floor use shall control.

      A.   Purpose. The regulations of this chapter dealing with home
occupations are designed to protect and maintain the residential character of
the neighborhood, while permitting certain limited commercial activities which
have traditionally been carried out in a residential dwelling. The use of the
dwelling unit for a home occupation shall be clearly incidental to and
subordinate to its use for residential purposes by its occupants.
      B.   Definition of Home Occupation; Representative Activities. Permitted
home occupations include, but are not limited to, the following lists of
activities; provided, however, each permitted home occupation shall be subject
to the limitations hereinafter set forth, and to all other regulations
applicable to the district in which it is located:
         (1)   Facilities used by a physician, surgeon, dentist, lawyer,
clergyman, or other professional person, for emergency consultation or
treatment, but not for the general practice of such person’s profession.
         (2)   Providing instruction to no more than four students at a time.
         (3)   Daycare or babysitting of no more than five nonresident
children.
         (4)   Studio of an artist, photographer, craftsman, writer or
composer.
         (5)   Renting of rooms by a resident owner to no more than two
roomers.
         (6)   Millinery, dressmaking, tailoring, canning, laundering, and
similar domestic service activities.
      C.   Limitation on Home Occupation Activities. Wherever, in this chapter,
home occupation activities are authorized in any zoning district, such activity
may only be undertaken subject to the following limitations, unless otherwise
specified:
         (1)   No person who is not a member of the immediate family and
residing on the premises shall be employed in the activity on the premises.
         (2)   The activity shall be conducted entirely within the principal
dwelling unit or in a permitted accessory building.
         (3)   The activity shall not involve any outside storage nor in any
way create, outside the building, any external evidence of the operation,
including signage.
         (4)   No alteration of a building shall be made which changes the
character and appearance thereof as a residential building.
         (5)   No more than 25 percent of floor area of the principal building
shall be devoted to the home occupation.
         (6)   No mechanical, electrical, or other equipment shall be used
except of a type normally used on a residential premise.
         (7)   No activity shall be permitted which is noxious, offensive, or
hazardous by reason of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, or by creation of
noise, odor, refuse, heat vibration, smoke, radiation, or any other
objectionable emissions, or by interference with televisions, or radio
reception.
   10.   Building Lines on Approved Plats. Whenever the plat of a land
subdivision approved by the Zoning Commission and on record in the office of
the County Recorder shows a building line along any frontage for the purpose of
creating a front yard, rear yard or side street yard line, the building line
thus shown shall apply along such frontage in place of any other yard line
required in this chapter unless specific yard requirements in this chapter
require a greater setback.
   11.   Open Space. Yards or other open space provided around any building for
the purpose of complying with the provisions of this chapter shall not be
considered as providing a yard or open space for any other building. The lot
area per family shall not be reduced in any manner except in conformity with
the area regulations herein established for the district in which such building
is located. In addition, the minimum total land area devoted to open space in
the R-2A, R-3, R-4, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, M-1, and M-2 zoning districts only
shall not be less than 15 percent of the gross land area included in the
building lot. Such open space shall be maintained as grassed and landscaped
areas, interior or exterior malls, pedestrian walks and ornamental structures,
when part of the landscaping theme. Open space shall not include structures or
buildings, off-street parking areas, loading areas and access drive. Any owner
subject to the requirements of this subsection may make application to the
Planning and Zoning Commission for a variance from the same. The Commission
shall consider and make recommendation to the Council on the application and
variances will be granted only if the owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of
the Commission and Council that application of the open space requirements set
forth in this subsection work a peculiar hardship on the owner. A “peculiar
hardship” means that the owner’s property is so situated that an insufficient
amount of land is available to accommodate the open space requirements given
the nature of the proposed development and which makes the proposed development
unfeasible. No peculiar hardship will be determined to exist where the proposed
use of the property could accommodate the open space requirements when compared
to the space required or actually used in connection with other similar uses in
the Des Moines Metropolitan area.
   12.   Temporary Buildings. Temporary buildings, camping trailers, tents,
portable or potentially portable structures shall not be used for dwelling

165.10 COMMERCIAL ZONING DISTRICT REGULATIONS (C-TS, C-1, C-2, C-3, AND C-4).
   The commercially zoned districts are intended to provide for high quality
area of various densities and intensities in an effort to promote quality of
life, health and general welfare of citizens and visitors while providing a
large variety of services and shopping, all consistent with the Comprehensive
Plan. It shall be generally recognized that the type of use is not so important
as the manner in which the use is accomplished. It is intended that these
districts shall not be used indiscriminately to permit any use that could
potentially be detrimental to the intent of the Zoning Ordinance.
   1.   Commercial Districts.
      A.   C-TS Town Square Business District. The C-TS District is intended to
provide appropriate development regulations around the historic Town Square. A
variety of commercial uses are permitted, with ground level retail and office
uses and upper-level office or residential uses. This grouping of uses is
designed to strengthen the town square’s role as a center for trade, service
and civic life.
      B.   C-1 Central Business District. The C-1 District recognizes the
unique mixed-use character of the area surrounding the town square. The
development regulations are intended to provide for one- and two-family
residential uses interspersed with a variety of commercial uses in a harmonious
manner.
      C.   C-2 Commercial District. The C-2 District is intended and designed
to provide for general uses and activities of a retail business, service
industry or professional office character that, by nature of their business,
provide service and commodities that benefit the community at large. These uses
may create land use conflicts with adjacent residential areas, requiring
sensitivity in design. This district is most appropriately located along
arterial streets or in areas that can be adequately buffered from residential
districts.
      D.   C-3 Office Park Commercial District. The C-3 District is intended
and designed to provide for the development of business, professional, and
public service offices and office buildings. Auxiliary uses, such as
restaurants, will be allowed primarily to serve the needs of existing office
uses within the same C-3 district
      E.   C-4 Neighborhood Friendly Commercial District. The C-4 District is
intended and designed to provide for personal services for nearby residences
and convenience shopping of the locally travelling public. Uses are intended to
be low-intensity businesses that are wholly contained within the buildings. The
design of buildings in the district is encouraged to be residential in
character, with pitched roofs and landscaping, to blend with nearby
neighborhoods.
   2.   Principal Permitted Uses. Principal permitted uses for commercial
districts are as follows:

Plan. Said storage shall be limited to areas designated on the Site Plan and
shall be maintained and screened in conformance to the Site Plan.
      B.   Automobile, truck and equipment sales and service shall be permitted
provided that all outside storage, display and parking areas shall be used and
maintained in conformance with an approved Site Plan and the parking, display
and storage of vehicles for hire, rental or sale shall be limited to the area
designated for such use in the Site Plan. All storage shall be on paved
surfaces.
      C.   No uses shall be permitted to be established or maintained in any
district which by reason of its nature or manner of operation is or may become
hazardous, noxious, or offensive owning to the emission of odor, dust, smoke
cinders, gas, fumes, noise, vibrations, refuse matter, or water-carried waste.
      D.   Permitted uses with restrictions shall demonstrate said use will not
have any detrimental impact on existing neighboring uses due to traffic
congestion or parking needs, particularly in the C-TS, C-1, and C-4 Districts.
      E.   Adult Entertainment Business uses shall be subject to the following
restrictions:
         (1)   These uses shall not be located within 1,500 feet of any other
adult entertainment use; within 1,500 feet of any public, parochial or private
school, licensed daycare facility, regular school bus stop, church, public
park, supermarket, convenience store, or restaurant catering to family trade;
or within 1,500 feet of any residential or agricultural zoning district or
residentially-used or agriculturally-used property. Said distances shall be
measured from property line to property line.
         (2)   All building openings, entries, exits, windows and the like
shall be covered or screened in such a manner as to prevent a view into the
interior from any public or semi-public area. For new construction, and
whenever else it is considered feasible by the Zoning Enforcement Officer, the
building shall be oriented so as to minimize any possibility of viewing the
interior from pubic or semi-public areas.
         (3)   Advertisement, displays, signs or other promotional materials
shall not be shown or exhibited so as to be visible to the public from
pedestrian sidewalks, trails, or other public or semi-public areas.
         (4)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary otherwise set forth in
this chapter, adult entertainment businesses shall be permitted only in the C-
2 zoning district and then only in compliance with the other restrictions set
forth herein. It is the intent of this provision to permit the location of
adult entertainment businesses solely in areas zoned C-2 and not in any other
district including but not limited to agricultural, residential or industrial
districts.
   Religious Institutions shall be subject to the following restrictions:

Subsequent amendments to the Site Plan for improvements including but not
limited to additional parking areas, access roads, and building additions, may
be considered for approval by City Council.
   4.   Auxiliary Uses. An auxiliary use shall mean a conditional use
consisting of certain low-intensity commercial establishments which are
primarily intended, designed and utilized to serve the proven needs of the
principal permitted uses within the same zoning district. Possible auxiliary
uses are noted with an “A” in the Permitted Principal Uses table for commercial
districts. Auxiliary uses shall only be approved within a C-3 District in
conjunction with a Site Plan and only provided the following conditions are
satisfied:
      A.   The auxiliary uses shall primarily serve the needs of the principal
permitted uses within the same C-3 district that are either in existence or
will be constructed at or about the same time as the auxiliary use.
      B.   The design, aesthetics, location and character of the auxiliary
structure or use shall be compatible with the principal permitted uses with the
C-3 District.
      C.   The auxiliary use shall not adversely affect the setting and quality
of development for the principal permitted uses within the C-3 District due to
over concentration or over saturation of auxiliary uses within the same
district.
      D.   The auxiliary use shall not generate substantial additional traffic
nor create traffic congestion beyond that which would occur if any principal
permitted use was to locate on the same site.
      E.   The auxiliary use shall not be hazardous, detrimental, or disturbing
to principal permitted uses, nor to adjoining of abutting properties due to
dust, glare, noise, smoke, odor, fumes, vibration or other effects not
consistent with the principal permitted uses within the C-3 District.
   5.   Accessory Uses. Uses not permitted as a Principal Permitted Use for
that zoning district shall not be permitted as an accessory use except as
specifically permitted in this subsection. The following accessory uses are
permitted in commercial zoning districts:

principal uses.
      B.   Private garage or carport in association with a permitted
residential use.

165.11 INDUSTRIAL ZONING DISTRICT REGULATIONS (M-1 AND M-2).
   The industrially zoned districts are intended to provide for manufacturing
processes of various intensities needed on a local, State, or national level
while promoting the quality of life, health, and general welfare desired by the
citizens of the City, all consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. It is
intended that these districts shall not be used indiscriminately to permit any
use that could potentially be detrimental to the intent of the Zoning
Ordinance.
   1.   Industrial Districts.
      A.   M-1 Light Industrial District. The M-1 district is intended to
reserve sites appropriate for the location of industrial uses with relatively
limited environmental effects. The district is designed to provide appropriate
space and regulations to encourage good quality industrial development while
assuring that facilities are served with adequate parking and loading
facilities and buffered from less intensive uses.
      B.   M-2 Heavy Industrial District. The M-2 district is intended to
accommodate a wide variety of industrial uses, some of which may have
significant external effects. These uses may have operating characteristics
that create conflicts with lower-intensity surrounding land uses. The district
provides the reservation of land for these activities and includes buffering
requirements to reduce incompatibility.
   2.   Principal Permitted Uses. Principal permitted uses for industrial

165.13 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT REGULATIONS (PUD).
   1.   The PUD district is intended and designed to promote and encourage
development or redevelopment of tracts of land on a planned, unified basis by
allowing greater flexibility for those developments that propose a creative and
innovative design whose layout is not achievable under the standards of other
zoning districts. A PUD shall consist of an arrangement and selection of land
uses in groupings that are organized and designed as an integrated unit rather
than a collection of independent building and sites. The integrated design
shall include a holistic presentation of elements such as building orientation
and materials, utilities, parking areas, traffic circulation, sidewalks,
trails, landscaping and open spaces that satisfy the individual site needs
while achieving greater value for the entire development area. The PUD district
shall be reserved for only those developments, which meet one or more of the
following criteria:
      A.   Developments that provide for varying land uses to coexist within
the same development so that the growing demands of the population may be met
by greater variety in type, design, and layout.
      B.   Developments which encourage a more efficient use of land through
the incorporation of public/private spaces or uses which enhance the community
at large.
      C.   Developments that provide both public and private open spaces that
accent and enhance both the architectural and natural features of the
development and provide for the protection and preservation of existing
vegetative and water resources.
      D.   Developments that present a common and unified theme through the use
of architecturally compatible detailing to form a part of a larger composition
rather than separate land uses designed in isolation of one another.
   2.   Principal Permitted Uses. Principal permitted uses for PUD zoned
property may consist of residential uses, neighborhood commercial uses,
neighborhood office uses and any combinations thereof. If it is determined by
the Zoning Enforcement Officer that a proposed use is not compatible and
consistent with the proposed PUD, the property owner shall have the right to
appeal the decision to the Planning & Zoning Commission and City Council
pursuant to the regulations for amendments as expressed in Section
165.26 of this Chapter.
      A.   Residential uses shall be defined as single-family residential,
attached dwellings, multiple family residential, assisted and independent
living facilities and nursing homes.
      B.   Neighborhood Commercial uses shall be defined as those uses which
normally and customarily service the surrounding residential properties.
Neighborhood Commercial uses may include, but not be limited to, dry cleaners,
delis, coffee shops, markets, and small retail establishments.
      C.   Neighborhood Office uses shall be defined as those office uses which
normally and customarily service the surrounding residential properties.
Neighborhood Commercial uses shall include, but not be limited to, small
medical clinics, veterinarians, and banks.
   3.   Accessory Uses. The following accessory uses are permitted in PUD
districts:
      A.   Customary accessory uses and structures incidental to permitted
principal uses.
      B.   Private garage or carport in association with a permitted
residential use.
      C.   Golf courses, parks, playgrounds, aquatic centers and similar
amenities, whether public or private, that benefit the neighborhood and/or the
community at large.
      D.   Temporary buildings for uses incidental to construction work, which
buildings shall be removed upon the completion or abandonment of the
construction work.
   4.   Site Development Regulations.

whether or not they are under the same ownership, provided all tracts of land
are included in one overall Master Plan and all property owners sign a
Development Agreement.
 
   5.   Accessory Structures. Accessory structures may be constructed on
properties as permitted in Section 165.06. Where the planned unit development
is not specifically mentioned, the requirements shall be consistent with the
residential district requirements where the principal use of the property is
residential and the commercial district requirements where the principal use of
the property is commercial.
   6.   Site Development Regulations. Dimensional requirements, density,
setbacks and height requirements shall be clearly specified within the
Development Plan and Development Agreement. The minimum setbacks along the
perimeter of the project, abutting adjoining properties, shall meet the minimum
requirements of the zoning in place before the property is rezoned to PUD or of
the adjacent zoning district, whichever is greater.
   7.   Platting Required. Prior to development of any property within a PUD,
the entire tract of land within the PUD shall be platted in accordance with

issuance of any building permits. Parcels of land with said tract that are set
aside for future development shall be platted as outlots.
   8.   Common Elements. Covenants shall be provided and recorded with any plat
or site plan within a PUD.
   Said covenants shall enumerate all common elements within said plat and
establish the guidelines for maintenance of said common elements. Common
elements may include, but are not limited to, items such as private streets,
parking lots, sidewalks, trails, sanitary sewers, water lines, storm sewers,
detention facilities, landscaping, and multi-tenant signs.
   9.   Off-Street Parking. Adequate parking shall be provided within the PUD
based upon the proposed uses. Shared parking for varying uses shall be strongly
encouraged. Congestion on adjacent public streets shall be minimized.
   10.   Traffic. Traffic circulation within the PUD shall be designed to
minimize congestion both on adjacent public streets and within the development.
Traffic Impact studies may be required for review by the City Engineer. Turning
lanes shall be provided as needed.
   11.   Pedestrian and Recreational Circulation. Sidewalks shall be designed
within a PUD to encourage pedestrian circulation throughout residential and
commercial areas and to link the varying uses. Recreational trails shall be
provided to connect to existing and future trail systems and to promote
alternate modes of transportation.
   12.   Signs. Signage within a PUD shall serve as a unifying element while
creating measured and consistent identification of the various land uses within
the PUD.
   Monument and wall sign area and height limitations as well as lighting and
architectural style shall be clearly indicated on the Development Plan and
Development Agreement.
   13.   Architectural Design Standards. Buildings within a PUD shall be
designed to be architecturally compatible with each other and should be seen as
a larger composition as opposed to individual buildings. Buildings shall be
designed to promote quality architecture and design elements along all four
building elevations. The uses of similar colors, materials, façade projections
and recesses, articulated roof lines, enhanced entrances, lighting, windows and
architectural features such as awnings are encouraged to make the development
architecturally compatible as a whole.
   14.   Open Space and Landscaping Requirements. Open space requirements
within a PUD shall consist of both public and private landscape areas, natural
areas, plazas and courtyards designed to enhance the architectural and natural
features of the development
   15.   Buffer Screening. The Planned Unit Development shall consider
compatibility of uses. Landscaping shall be incorporated into the overall
design and transitional uses considered in order to minimize the need for
buffer easements and/or fences to screen neighboring uses.
   16.   Master Plan and Development Agreement. A Master Plan and Development
Agreement shall be required for all PUD districts. The Master Plan shall cover
the entire parcel to be zoned as PUD.
   The Master Plan shall have a unique name and include a narrative section
that identifies the primary objectives of the development as well as providing
specific guidelines and design standards related to the development including
but not limited to size, location and uses of buildings, bulk regulations,
parking configurations and requirements, architectural standards, landscaping,
open space design, signage design and location, pedestrian access, and
utilities. In addition to the Development Plan, a Development Agreement shall
be required of the developer, which shall acknowledge the developers commitment
to develop the property in accordance with the Development Plan.
      A.   Master Plans shall be required for all new Planned Unit Developments
in conformance with Chapter 171. Master Plans shall be submitted in conjunction
with the petition for rezoning and shall be approved prior to the third reading
of the ordinance rezoning the property to PUD.
      B.   For Planned Unit Developments approved prior to the adoption of the
ordinance codified in this chapter, a Master Plan in conformance with Chapter
171 shall be required prior to platting or further development of any portion
of the PUD-zoned land if an approved Master Plan is not on file with the City
Clerk.

165.14 GOVERNMENT FACILITY DISTRICT REGULATIONS (GF).
(Repealed by Ordinance No. 2023-8000 – Nov. 23 Supp.)
165.15 FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT REGULATIONS (FP).
   The regulations set forth in this section, or elsewhere in this chapter when
applicable, shall apply in the FP, Floodplain Overlay District. The FP District
is intended to identify the general location of areas within the floodway,
floodplain and/or having Special Flood Hazards.
   1.   The City has adopted the regulations and flood maps of the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in accordance with the National Flood
Insurance Act of 1968 and the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. The
floodplain regulations are stipulated in Chapter 160 (Floodplain Regulations)
of this Code of Ordinances.
   2.   Additional regulations are imposed upon properties within the FP
Floodplain overlay districts for the protection of life and property from
losses and hazards caused by the occupancy and use of the floodplain by
buildings, structures or activities that may increase the effects of flooding.
   1.   No structure or land shall be used and no structure or wastewater
treatment facility (including septic systems) shall be located, extended,
converted or structurally altered in any designated FP Floodplain Overlay
District without full compliance with the terms of Chapter 160 (Floodplain
Regulations), including but not limited to the requirement for a floodplain
development permit.
   2.   If there are any discrepancies between the floodplain as may be
depicted on the Official Zoning Map and the flood hazard areas as depicted on
the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Flood Insurance Rate Map shall govern.
   3.   All parcels and uses of property shall be in accordance with the
district regulations of the underlying zoning district, except as limited by
Chapter 160 (Floodplain Regulations).
165.16 EXCEPTIONS AND MODIFICATIONS.
   The regulations specified in this chapter shall be subject to the following
exceptions and interpretations:
   1.   Use of Existing Lots of Record. In any district where dwellings are
permitted, a single-family detached dwelling may be located on any lot or plot
of official record as of March 25, 1996, irrespective of its area or width;
provided, however, in all districts other than the “R-1 Single-Family Detached
Residential District”, if two or more such lots or plots, or parts thereof with
continuous frontage are combined into single ownership, such lots or plots or
parts thereof shall be considered buildable only if they have a total combined
minimum width of 50 feet. In the “R-1 Single-Family Detached Residential
District”, if two or more such lots or plots or parts thereof with continuous
frontage are combined into single ownership, such lots or plots or parts
thereof shall be considered buildable only if they have a total combined
minimum width of 80 feet.
      A.   The sum of the side yard widths of any such lot or plot shall not be
less than 30 percent of the width of the lot, but in no case less than 10
percent of the width of the lot for any one side yard.
      B.   The depth of the rear yard of any such lot need not exceed 20
percent of the depth of the lots, but in no case less than 10 feet.
   2.   Structures Permitted Above the Height Limit. The building height
limitations of this chapter shall be modified as follows:
      A.   Chimneys, cooling towers, cell towers, small wind energy conversion
systems, elevator bulk-heads, fire towers, monuments, stacks, stage towers, or
scenery lofts, tanks, water towers, ornamental towers and spires, radio or
television towers or necessary mechanical appurtenances may be erected to a
height in accordance with a special use permit subject to the provisions
contained herein and elsewhere within this City Code and further provided that
a fall zone setback equal to 150 percent of the total system height has been
met unless said fall zone setback requirement has been waived by City Council.
      B.   Public, semi-public or public service buildings, hospitals,
sanatoriums, schools, business colleges and related structures, churches and
temples, when permitted in a district, may be erected to a height not exceeding
125 feet, if the building is set back from each property line at least one foot
for each foot of additional building height above the height limit otherwise
provided in the district in which the building is located.
      C.   Single-family dwellings and two-family dwellings in the residence
districts may be increased in height but not more than 10 feet when two side
yards of not less than 15 feet each are provided, but they shall not exceed
three stories in height. Single-family semi-detached dwellings in residence
districts may be increased in height by not more than 10 feet when one side
yard of not less than 15 feet is provided, but they shall not exceed three
stories in height.
      D.   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
165.10 and Section
165.11, principal buildings in any “C-2” or “M” zoning district may be erected
to a height not exceeding 125 feet and the otherwise applicable maximum story
limitation waived if the portion of the building in excess of one story in
height is set back from the applicable front, side and rear yard at least
three-fourths of one foot for each one foot of additional building height above
the height limit otherwise provided for in the zoning district in which the
building is located.
   3.   Exceptions to Yard Requirements.
      A.   Yards Adjacent to Alleys. In computing the depth of a rear yard or
the width of a side yard where the rear or side yard opens on an alley, one-
half of the alley width may be included as a portion of the rear or side yard
as the case may be.
      B.   Minor Obstructions. Every part of a required yard shall be open to
the sky unobstructed with any building or structure, except for a permitted
accessory building in a rear yard and except for ordinary projections as
specified in Section
165.06. However, in a “C-2” Commercial District, an “M-1” Light Industrial
District or and “M-2” Heavy Industrial District, one sidewalk arcade, canopy or
similar architectural feature may be established and maintained in the front
yard of an interior lot or in the front yard or street side yard of a corner
lot; provided, the roof area occupied by such feature shall not exceed 600
square feet. In any “C-2”, “M-1” or “M-2” District, one such feature, not to
exceed 600 square feet of roof area, may be established and may be maintained
in the front yard of any interior lot, and two such features, not to exceed 600
square feet of roof area each, may be established and may be maintained in the
front yard or street side yard of a corner lot.
      C.   Atypical Setbacks. In residential areas where some lots are
developed with a front yard that is less than the minimum required for the
district by this chapter, or where some lots have been developed with a front
yard greater than required by this chapter, the following rule shall apply. The
front yard depth for a principal building (nursing and convalescent homes
excluded) located on a lot within 250 feet of any portion of two or more lots
in the same block occupied by dwellings that front on the same street as the
proposed principal dwelling shall be the average front yard depth of such
existing dwellings. The distance shall be measured along the street line from
the nearest corner of the lot under consideration.
         (1)   Buildings located entirely on the rear half of a lot shall be
counted.
         (2)   Buildings shall not be required to have a front yard greater
than 50 feet or less than that required in the zoning district in which it is
located.
         (3)   If no buildings exists on one side of a lot within 250 feet of
the lot in question, the minimum front yard shall be the same as the building
on the other side.
165.17 OFF-STREET LOADING SPACES.
   In all districts except the “C-TS” Town Square Business District, in
connection with every building or part thereof hereafter erected having a gross
floor area of 10,000 square feet or more, which is to be occupied by
manufacturing, storage, warehouse, goods, display, retail store, wholesale
store, market, hotel, hospital, mortuary, laundry, dry cleaning or other uses
similarly requiring the receipt or distribution by vehicles of material or
merchandise, there shall be provided and maintained on the same lot with such
building at least one off-street loading space for each 20,000 square feet, or
major fraction thereof, of gross floor area so used in excess of 10,000 square
feet.
   1.   Each loading space shall be not less than 10 feet in width and at least
25 feet in length.
   2.   Such space may occupy all or any part of any required yard or court
space, except where adjoining an “R” District, it shall be set back five feet
and an opaque screen of six feet in height shall be installed and shall be
maintained along all “R” District boundaries. In addition, except at designated
access points, wheel barriers shall be installed along the outside boundaries
of any parking area. The wheel barriers shall be installed in such a manner as
to prevent a parked vehicle from encroaching into any required setback. The
screen shall be in line with the front of any adjoining residential structure
in any adjoining ‘R” District or the front of the proposed commercial
structure, whichever is the lesser front yard setback. However, if the
adjoining “R” District property is vacant, the front yard setback for the “R”
District shall apply. A six-foot-high opaque screen shall not be required along
adjoining streets or adjoining alleys. An opaque screen of three feet shall be
installed and maintained along each street side lot line of a corner lot where
the premises is across from any “R” District. The opaque screen shall not
extend closer than 25 feet to the front property line. An opaque screen of
three feet shall be installed and maintained along each alley line where the
premises is across from any “R” District. The opaque screen need not extend
beyond the opaque screen installed along the street side lot line. Where there
is a difference in elevation on opposite sides of the screen, the height shall
consist of one or any combination of the following:
      A.   Wood or masonry walls or fences when constructed of materials which
provide openings of less than 50 percent in area of the vertical surface of the
wall or fence.
      B.   Berms constructed of earthen materials and landscaped.
      C.   Plant materials when used as a screen shall consist of compact
evergreen plants. They shall be of a kind or used in such a manner so as to
provide their screening function within 18 months after initial planting. The
Zoning Enforcement Officer shall require that either A or B above shall be
installed if, after 18 months after planting, plant materials have not formed
an opaque screen or if an opaque screen is not maintained. A wall or fence may
be combined with the plant materials. However, if such a wall or fence is
constructed of materials which provide openings of more than 50 percent in area
of the vertical surface of the wall or fence, it shall not be considered a part
of the opaque screen and it shall be located on the parking area side of the
plant materials.
      D.   When the finished elevation of the property is lower at the boundary
line or within five feet inside the boundary line than an abutting property
elevation, such change in elevation may be used in lieu of or in combination
with additional screening to satisfy the screening requirements for this
district.
165.18 OFF-STREET PARKING AREA.
   1.   In all districts except the “C-TS” Town Square Business District in
connection with every industrial commercial, business, trade, institutional,
recreational, or dwelling use, and similar uses, space for parking and storage
of vehicles shall be provided in accordance with the following schedule.
Required off-street parking facilities shall be primarily for the parking of
private passenger automobiles of occupants, patrons, or employees of the
principal use served.
      A.   The presumptions established by this section are that: (i) a
development must comply with the parking standards set forth in the parking
table, and (ii) any development that does meet these standards is in
compliance.
      B.   In determining the number of parking spaces required by the table of
parking requirements, if a fractional space results, any fraction less than
one-half may be disregarded while fractions in excess of one-half shall be
counted as one parking space.
      C.   The Council recognizes that the table of parking requirements set
forth in this section cannot and does not cover every possible situation that
may arise. Therefore, in cases not specifically covered, the Public Works
Director is authorized to determine the parking requirements using this table
as a guide. In accordance with the Comprehensive Plan, wherever possible
parking will be established in the rear or side yard with the building
orientation to the front sidewalk.
      D.   Table of Parking Requirements.

(Paragraph D – Ord. 2025-100 – Apr. 25 Supp.)
   2.   In case of any building, structure or premises, the use of which is not
specifically mentioned herein, the provisions for a use which is so mentioned,
and to which said use is similar, shall apply.
   3.   Where a parking lot does not abut on a public or private alley or
easement of access, there shall be provided an access drive not less than eight
feet in width in case of a dwelling and not less than 16 feet in width in all
other cases leading to the loading or unloading spaces and to secure the most
appropriate development of the property in question, provided however, such
easement of access or access drive shall not be located in any residence
district, except where serving a permitted use in a residence district.
   4.   Every parcel of land hereafter used as a public or private parking
area, including a commercial parking lot, shall be developed and maintained in
accordance with the following requirements:
      A.   No part of any parking space shall be closer than ten feet to any
established public street right-of-way or five feet to any established alley
line. In the case the parking area adjoins an “R” District, it shall be set
back at least five feet from the “R” District boundary and an opaque screen of
six feet in height shall be installed and shall be maintained along all “R”
District boundaries. In addition, except at designated access points, wheel
barriers shall be installed along the outside boundaries of any parking area.
The wheel barriers shall be installed in such a manner as to prevent a parked
vehicle from encroaching into any required setback. The screen shall be in line
with the front of any adjoining “R” District or the front of the proposed
commercial structure, whichever is the lesser front yard setback. However, if
the adjoining “R” District property is vacant, the front yard setback for the
“R” District shall apply. A six-foot-high opaque screen shall not be required
along streets or along alleys. An opaque screen of three feet shall be
installed and maintained along each street side lot line of a corner lot where
the premises is across from any “R” District. The opaque screen shall not
extend closer than 25 feet to the front property line. An opaque screen of
three feet shall be installed and maintained along each alley line where the
premises is across from any “R” District. The opaque screen need not extend
beyond the opaque screen installed along the street side lot line. Where there
is a difference in elevation on opposite sides of the screen, the height shall
be measured from the highest elevation. An opaque screen shall consist of one,
or any combination of, the following:
(Ord. 2022-2600 – Feb. 23 Supp.)
         (1)   Wood or masonry walls or fences when constructed of materials
which provide openings of less than 50 percent in area of the vertical surface
of the wall or fence.
         (2)   Berms constructed of earthen materials and landscaped.
         (3)   Plant materials when used as a screen shall consist of compact
evergreen plants that meet the approval of Section 165.19, Landscape, Planting
and Screening and SUDAS, Chapter 12, Section 5. They shall be of a kind or used
in such a manner so as to provide their screening function within 18 months
after initial planting. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall require that
either (1) or (2) above be installed if, after 18 months after planting, plant
materials have not formed an opaque screen or if an opaque screen is not
maintained. A wall or fence may be combined with the plant materials. However,
if such a wall or fence is constructed of materials which provide openings of
more than 50 percent in area of the vertical surface of the wall or fence, it
shall not be considered a part of the opaque screen and it shall be located on
the parking area side of the plant materials.
         (4)   When the finished elevation of the property is lower at the
boundary line or within five feet inside the boundary line than an abutting
property elevation, such change in elevation may be used in lieu of or in
combination with additional screening to satisfy the screening requirements for
this district.
      B.   In all zoning districts, all off-street parking areas and driveways
shall be surfaced with an asphaltic or Portland cement binder pavement or such
other surfaces as shall be approved by the City Engineer and the Building
Inspector so as to provide a durable and dustless surface, shall be so graded
and drained as to dispose of all surface water accumulation within the area and
shall be so arranged and marked as to provide for orderly and safe loading and
unloading and parking and storage of self-propelled vehicles. Such surfacing
shall be required to be installed at the time of site improvement construction
in conjunction with Site Plan approval when such approval is required and
issuance of building permits and shall be considered a required improvement to
be installed prior to issuance of occupancy permits; provided however, the
Council may, in its discretion, by resolution, authorize an extension of time
for the installation of the required surfacing and allow issuance of the
occupancy permit prior to installation of the required surfacing. The Council
may consider an extension of time only if a petition signed by the owner or
duly authorized representative requesting a time extension including a
statement of reasons therefor, is presented to the Council. The length of time
granted for the extension shall be determined and at the discretion of the
Council, but in no event longer than three years. Should a time extension be
granted by resolution of the Council, the owner shall provide to the City a
performance bond in the form as prescribed by the Subdivision Regulations,
Chapter 170 of this Code of Ordinances, and in the amount recommended by the
City Engineer and approved by the Council and for the duration of the time
stipulated in such grant. The Council may, in its discretion, by resolution
rescind the granted extension of time by reason of such facility becoming a
nuisance to surrounding property owners. In such instance, the required
surfacing shall be installed by the owner within six months from the date of
such resolution or the performance bond concerning surfacing shall be forfeited
and the surfacing installed by order of the City.
      C.   Vehicles, recreational vehicles, boats, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs)
or snowmobiles shall not be parked or stored within the front yard or street
side yard of a residential lot in any zoning district unless situated on a
paved driveway or parking lot. In the case of an existing residential driveway
that was unpaved at the time of the passage of the ordinance codified in this
chapter; vehicles, recreational vehicles, boats, ATVs and snowmobiles shall be
permitted to be parked or stored on such unpaved driveway until such time as
site improvements are made which require the driveway to be paved. Recreational
vehicles, boats, ATVs, and snowmobiles may be parked or stored within the
interior side yard or rear yard of a residential lot if contained within an
enclosed fence, or within an enclosed garage. Recreational vehicles or trailers
of any kind or type without current license plates shall not be parked or
stored on any lot other than in completely enclosed buildings.
      D.   Any lighting used to illuminate any off-street parking area
including any commercial parking lots shall be so arranged as to reflect the
light away from adjoining premises in any “R” District. Such lighting shall be
downcast lighting with a maximum of one foot-candle at the property line.
   5.   Off-street parking areas shall be provided on the same lot with the
principal use, except as provided in Subsection 6 below.
   6.   Subject to the requirements herein, off-street parking areas may be
established in any “R” District that immediately adjoins a “C” or “M” District,
or is directly across an alley from a “C” or “M” District, provided that:
      A.   Such parking shall be accessory to and for use of one or more
permitted uses in the adjoining “C” or “M” District and shall not include
trucks.
      B.   Such parking areas shall not extend more than 100 feet from the
boundary of the less restricted district. In no case shall said areas extend
closer than 10 feet to the street right-of-way line. The yard between said
parking areas and the adjoining streets shall be screen planted and landscaped
as provided in C below.
      C.   A 10-foot yard shall be maintained between said parking area and
adjoining lots in an “R” District. In addition, except at designated access
points, wheel barriers shall be installed along the outside boundaries of any
parking area. The wheel barriers shall be installed in such a manner as to
prevent a parked vehicle from encroaching into any required setback. An opaque
screen at least six feet in height shall be maintained along all “R” District
boundaries. The screen shall be in line with the front of any adjoining
residential structure in any adjoining “R” District or the front of the
proposed commercial structure, whichever is the lesser front yard setback.
However, if the adjoining “R” District property is vacant, the front yard
setback for the “R” District shall apply. A six-foot-high opaque screen shall
not be required along adjoining streets or adjoining alleys. An opaque screen
of three feet shall be installed and maintained along each street side lot line
of a corner lot where the premises is across from any “R” District. The opaque
screen shall not extend closer than 25 feet to the front property line. An
opaque screen of three feet shall be installed and maintained along each alley
line where the premises is across from any “R” District. The opaque screen need
not extend beyond the opaque screen installed along the street sides of the
screen; the height shall be measured from the highest elevation. An opaque
screen shall consist of one or any combination of the following:
         (1)   Wood or masonry walls or fences when constructed of materials
which provide openings of less than 50 percent in area of the vertical surface
of the wall or fence.
         (2)   Berms constructed of earthen materials and landscaped.
         (3)   Plant materials when used as a screen shall consist of compact
evergreen plants. They shall be of a variety or used in such a manner so as to
provide adequate screening function. A wall or fence may be combined with the
plant materials. However, if such a wall or fence is constructed of materials
which provide openings of more than 50 percent in area of the vertical surface
of the wall or fence, it shall not be considered a part of the opaque screen
and it shall be located on the parking area side of the plant materials.
         (4)   When the finished elevation of the property is lower at the
boundary line or within five feet inside the boundary line than an abutting
property elevation, such change in elevation may be used in lieu of or in
combination with additional screening to satisfy the screening requirements for
this district.
      D.   All entrances and exits for said parking areas shall be from said
adjoining alley for “C” or “M” District.
      E.   No such parking area shall be located in any required front yard in
a residence district or project in front of the immediately adjoining permitted
principal structures.
   7.   Parking spaces required by Subsections 1 and 2 hereof shall be provided
in accordance with SUDAS, Chapter 12, Section 3.
   8.   Parking spaces required by Subsections 1 and 2 hereof shall not be
located within any shared or common driveway or ingress/egress easement.
   9.   Flexibility in Administration.
      A.   The Council recognizes that, due to particularities of any given
development, the inflexible application of the parking standards set forth in
Subsection 1(D) of this section may result in a development either with
inadequate parking space or parking space far in excess of its needs. The
former situation may lead to traffic congestion or parking violations in
adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking in nearby private lots. The
latter situation wastes money as well as space that could more desirably be
used for valuable development or environmentally useful open space. Therefore,
the City Manager may permit deviations from the presumptive requirements of
Paragraph D and may require more parking or allow less parking whenever such
deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth herein.
165.19 LANDSCAPE, PLANTING, AND SCREENING.
   1.   Open Space Planting. Whenever property is required to include open
space pursuant to the provisions of Section
165.06, such open space shall be unencumbered by any structure or off-street
parking area. Such open space, except for the portion used as pedestrian walks
or courts, shall be landscaped and maintained with grass or other acceptable
ground cover and shall include trees and shrubs in the proportions hereinafter
set forth. Trees and shrubbery shall be provided at a minimum ratio of two
trees and six shrubs per 3,000 square feet of required open space; provided,
however, there shall be a minimum requirement of two trees and six shrubs.
Required plantings shall be installed prior to issuance of an occupancy permit.
The required number of trees and shrubs shall be determined as follows:
      A.   3,000 square feet or less of open space = two trees, six shrubs
      B.   More than 3,000 square feet of open space:
         (1)   Trees: (square feet of open space divided by 3,000) x 2 = No. of
trees required
         (2)   Shrubs: (square feet of open space divided by 3,000) x 6 = No.
of shrubs required
   1.   The plantings required hereunder are in addition to and not in
substitution of any planting requirements otherwise set forth in this Code of
Ordinances. Existing trees and shrubs on site and retained as part of the
development may be used to meet the requirements of this section.
   2.   Parking Area Landscaping. Parking areas required in R-3, R-4, C-1, C-2,
C-3, C-4, M-1, and M-2 zoning districts shall provide areas of natural shading,
accomplished through the planting of trees, in an amount equal to 20 percent of
the total square feet of drives and parking (Vehicle Pavement Area). Trees used
for this purpose shall be presumed to shade a circular area having 700 square
feet. New trees planted to meet the requirements of this section shall be
located so that each is surrounded by at least 190 square feet of unpaved area.
New and existing trees shall be protected from damage by vehicles and shall be
promptly replaced if destroyed. Plantings required hereunder shall be installed
prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit for the site. The number of trees
required hereunder shall be determined as follows:
      A.   Vehicle Pavement Area x 20 percent = Plant Square Footage
      B.   Plant Square Footage divided by 700 = No. of trees required.
   1.   The plantings required under this section are in addition to and not in
substitution of any open space or parking lot plantings or screening otherwise
required under this Code of Ordinances. Existing trees on a site which are
retained as a part of development, and which provide shade to parking areas may
be used to meet the requirements of this section.
   3.   Approved Trees. Any trees planted to meet the requirements of this
chapter shall be trees of a type included on the approved tree list of the City
as determined by the Tree Board.
   4.   Screens. The intent of the screening regulations hereinafter set forth
is to lessen the transmission from one property to another of noise, dust and
glare; to lessen visual pollution by creating the impression of separation of
spaces or entirely shielding one land use from another; and/or establishing a
sense of privacy from visual or physical intrusion. The Council specifically
finds that the provisions of this chapter are necessary to safeguard the public
health, safety and welfare.
      A.   General Screening Standard. Every development shall provide
sufficient screening so that neighboring properties are shielded from any
adverse external effects of that development; and the development is shielded
from the negative impacts of adjacent uses including streets and railroads.
      B.   Compliance with General Standard. The following “Table of Screening
Requirements” (the “Table”), in conjunction with the explanations set forth in
Subsection 4D concerning types of screens, establishes screening requirements
that presumptively satisfy the general standard established in Subsection 4A.
      C.   “Burdened Zoning District” means the zoning classification of the
property on which screening must be installed. “Benefited Zoning
Classification/Use” means the zoning classification of the property which is
benefited or protected by the required screening. The letter designations “A”,
“B” and “C” refer to types of screening required and which are described and
defined in Subsection 4D.
   The designation “ – ” means there are no presumptively required screening
requirements for abutting properties to which such designation applies under
the Table. Where screening is required under the Table, the owner of the
property in the burdened district is responsible for the installation of the
required screening prior to issuance of an occupancy permit. The burdened
zoning district shall be interpreted to mean the zoning district permitting
more intensive uses unless otherwise determined by City Council upon
recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission.

3. Where the burdened property lies adjacent to the corporate limits
at the time of development, buffer requirements shall be based upon
the Future Land Use of the benefited parcel as designated by the City
Comprehensive Plan.
4. Where the burdened property lies adjacent to an A-1 zoning district
at the time of development, buffer requirements shall be based upon
the Future Land Use of the benefited parcel as designated by the City

(Paragraph C – Ord. 2023-8000 – Nov. 23 Supp.)
      D.   Description of Screens. The following three basic types of screens
are hereby established and are designated “A”, “B” and “C” (corresponding to
the designations included in the Table):
         (1)   Broken screen, type “A”, means a screen composed of intermittent
visual obstructions from the ground to a height of at least 20 feet. The broken
screen is intended to create the impression of a separation of spaces without
necessarily eliminating visual contact between the spaces. It may be composed
of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing
vegetation. Compliance by use of planted vegetative screens or natural
vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density
of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation.
The screen may contain deciduous plants. A type “A” screen shall be located
within a buffer easement of sufficient width to accommodate the required broken
screen as shown on an approved Site Plan, but in no case shall it be less than
20 feet wide unless specifically waived by Council on an approved Site Plan.
Said easement will be exclusive of parking areas and accessory structures
except approved fences or walls.
         (2)   Semi-opaque screen, Type “B”, means a screen that is opaque from
the ground to a height of three feet, with intermittent visual obstruction from
above the opaque portion to a height of at least 20 feet. The semi-opaque
screen is intended to partially block visual contact between uses and to create
a strong impression of the separation of spaces. The semi-opaque screen may be
composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or
existing vegetation. Compliance by use of planted vegetative screens or nature
vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density
of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation.
At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain
any completely unobstructed openings more than 10 feet wide. The zone of
intermittent visual obstruction may contain deciduous plants. A type “B” screen
shall be located within a buffer easement of sufficient width to accommodate
the required semi-opaque screen as shown on an approved Site Plan, but in no
case shall it be less than 30 feet wide unless specifically waived by Council
on an approved Site Plan. Said easement will be exclusive of parking areas and
accessory structures except approved fences or walls.
         (3)   Opaque screen, Type “C”, means a screen that is opaque from the
ground to a height of a least six feet, with intermittent visual obstructions
from the opaque portion to a height of at least 20 feet. An opaque screen is
intended to exclude all visual contact between uses and to create a strong
impression of spatial separation. The opaque screen may be composed of a wall,
fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation.
Compliance by use of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be
judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the
subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. The opaque
portion of the screen must be opaque in all seasons of the year. At maturity,
the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any
completely unobstructed openings more than 10 feet wide. The portion of
intermittent visual obstructions may contain deciduous plants. A type “C”
screen shall be located within a buffer easement of sufficient width to
accommodate the required opaque screen as shown on an approved Site Plan, but
in no case shall it be less than 50 feet wide unless specifically waived by
Council on an approved Site Plan. Said easement will be exclusive of parking
areas and accessory structures except approved fences or walls.
      E.   Where commercial and/or industrial uses abut residential uses, the
developer of the commercial and/or industrial property shall construct all
required screens adjacent to said residential properties as part of the initial
phase of development of their property.
   5.   Buffer Easements Adjacent to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Land. Parcels
of land being developed that abut land owned by the United States of America
shall provide a 35 feet wide buffer easement across the developer’s property
adjacent to said public lands prior to approval of a Final Plat or Site Plan
for the developer’s property. The buffer easement shall prohibit construction
of principal or accessory structures within said easement, except approved
fences or walls. The buffer easement shall also restrict construction of
streets within said easement except where it is deemed necessary to cross said
easement to maintain continuity of the street system. The buffer easement shall
not restrict construction of trails.
   6.   Storage Areas. The outdoor storage of materials, equipment or supplies,
when permitted in any commercial or industrial district, shall be located or
screened, fenced or landscaped so as to effectively prevent visibility of such
storage from all abutting residential zoning districts or abutting existing
residential uses. Such screening shall be sufficient if it prevents visibility
of such storage area by persons traveling on public rights-of-way or standing
at level on the side or rear lot lines of such property. Such screening shall
comply with the standard for an opaque screen Type C.
165.20 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS AND ANTENNAS.
   1.   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish general guidelines
for the siting of wireless communications towers and antennas. The goals of
this section are to:
      A.   Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impacts of towers and antenna;
      B.   Encourage the location of towers in non-residential areas;
      C.   Minimize the total number of towers throughout the community;
      D.   Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as
a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers;
      E.   Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent
possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal;
      F.   Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way
that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas through
careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging
techniques;
      G.   Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services
to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and
efficiently;
      H.   Consider the public health and safety of communication towers; and
      I.   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
through engineering and careful siting of tower structures. In furtherance of
these goals, the City shall give due consideration to the City’s master plan,
zoning map, existing land uses, and environmentally sensitive areas in
approving sites for the location of towers and antennas.
   2.   Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have
the meanings set forth below:
      A.   “Alternative tower structure” means man-made trees, clock towers,
bell steeples, light poles and similar alternative-design mounting structures
that camouflage or conceal the presence of antennas or towers.
      B.   “Antenna” means any exterior transmitting or receiving device
mounted on a tower, building or structure and used in communications that
radiate or capture electromagnetic waves, digital signals, analog signals,
radio frequencies (excluding radar signals), wireless telecommunications
signals or other communication signals.
      C.   “Backhaul network” means the lines that connect a provider’s towers/
cell sites to one or more cellular telephone switching offices, and/or long
distance providers, or the public switched telephone network.
      D.   “FAA” means the Federal Aviation Administration.
      E.   “FCC” means the Federal Communications Commission.
      F.   “Height” means, when referring to a tower or other structure, the
distance measure from the finished grade of the parcel to the highest point on
the tower or other structure, including the base pad and any antenna.
      G.   “Preexisting towers and preexisting antennas” means any tower or
antenna for which a building permit or special use permit has been properly
issued prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter,
including permitted towers or antennas that have not yet been constructed so
long as such approval is current and not expired.
      H.   “Tower” means any structure that is designed and constructed
primarily for the purpose of supporting one or more antennas for telephone,
radio and similar communication purposes, including self-supporting lattice
towers, guyed towers, or monopole towers. The term includes radio and
television transmission towers, microwave towers, common-carrier towers,
cellular telephone towers, alternative tower structures, and the like. The term
includes the structure and any support thereto.
   3.   Applicability.
      A.   New Towers and Antennas. All new towers or antennas in the City
shall be subject to these regulations, except as provided in Subsections B
through D, inclusive.
      B.   Amateur Radio Station Operators/Receive-Only Antennas. This section
shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is under
70 feet in height and is owned and operated by a federal-licensed amateur radio
station operator or is used exclusively for receive only antennas.
      C.   Preexisting Towers or Antennas. Preexisting towers and preexisting
antennas shall not be required to meet the requirements of this section, other
than the requirements of Subsections 4(F) and 4(G).
      D.   AM Array. For purposes of implementing this section, an AM array,
consisting of one or more tower units and supporting ground system which
functions as one AM broadcasting antenna, shall be considered one tower.
Measurements for setbacks and separation distances shall be measured from the
outer perimeter of the towers included in the AM array. Additional tower units
may be added within the perimeter of the AM array by right.
   4.   General Requirements.
      A.   Principal or Accessory Use. Antennas and towers may be considered
either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use of an existing
structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or
tower on such lot.
      B.   Lot Size. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a
tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including but
not limited to setback requirements, lot-coverage requirements, and other such
requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the
antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lot.
      C.   Inventory of Existing Sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or
tower shall provide to the Zoning Enforcement Officer an inventory of its
existing towers, antennas, or sites approved for towers or antennas, that are
either within the jurisdiction of the City or within one mile of the border
thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design
of each tower. The Zoning Enforcement Officer may share such information with
other applicants applying for administrative approvals or special use permits
under this chapter or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the
jurisdiction of the City, provided, however, that the Zoning Enforcement
Officer is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or
warranting that such sites are available or suitable.
      D.   Aesthetics.  Towers and antennas shall meet the following
requirements:
         (1)   Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or,
subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so
as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
         (2)   At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related
structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures,
screening, and landscaping that will blend them into the natural setting and
surrounding buildings.
         (3)   If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower,
the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a
neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of
the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as
visually unobtrusive as possible.
         (4)   The alternative tower structure will be given preference for
approval over a typical tower.
      E.   Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required
by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the lighting
alternatives and design chosen must cause the least disturbance to the
surrounding views.
      F.   State and Federal Requirements. All towers must meet or exceed
current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of
the State or federal government with the authority to regulate towers and
antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the
towers and antennas governed by this section shall bring such towers and
antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six
months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a
different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling State or federal
agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised
standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower
or antenna at the owner’s expense.
      G.   Building Codes; Safety Standards.  To ensure the structural
integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in
compliance with standards contained in applicable State or local building codes
and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic
Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the
City concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and
constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to
the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into
compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into compliance
within said 30 days shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or
antenna at the owner’s expense.
      H.   Measurement.  For purposes of measurement, tower setbacks and
separation distances shall be calculated and applied to facilities located in
the City irrespective of municipal and County jurisdictional boundaries.
      I.   Not Essential Services.  Towers and antennas shall be regulated and
permitted pursuant to this section and shall not be regulated or permitted as
essential services, public utilities, or private utilities.
      J.   Franchises.  Owners and/or operators of towers or antennas shall
certify that all franchises required by law for the construction and/or
operation of a wireless communication system in the City have been obtained and
shall file a copy of all required franchises with the Zoning Enforcement
Officer.
      K.   Public Notice.  For purposes of this section, any special use
request, variance request, or appeal of an administratively approved use or
special use shall require public notice to all abutting property owners and all
property owners of properties that are located within the corresponding
separation distance listed in Table 2 of Subsection 7, in addition to any
notice otherwise required by this chapter.
      L.   Signs.  No signs shall be allowed on an antenna or tower.
      M.   Buildings and Support Equipment.  Buildings and support equipment
associated with antennas or towers shall comply with the requirements of
Subsection 8.
      N.   Multiple Antenna/Tower Plan.  The City encourages the users of
towers and antennas to submit a single application for approval of multiple
towers and/or antenna sites. Applications for approval of multiple sites shall
be given priority in the review process.
   5.   Permitted Uses.
      A.   General. The uses listed in this subsection are deemed to be
permitted uses and shall not require administrative approval or a special use
permit.
      B.   Permitted Uses.  The following uses are specifically permitted:
         (1)   Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased, or
otherwise controlled by the City provided a license or lease authorizing such
antenna or tower has been approved by the City.
   6.   Administratively Approved Uses.
      A.   General. The following provisions shall govern the issuance of
administrative approvals for towers and antennas.
         (1)   The Zoning Enforcement Officer and City Engineer must approve
the uses listed in this subsection.
         (2)   Each applicant for administrative approval shall apply to the
Zoning Enforcement Officer providing the information set forth in Subsections 7
(B)(1) and 7(B)(3) of this section and a nonrefundable fee as established by
resolution of the Council to reimburse the City for the costs of reviewing the
application.
         (3)   The Zoning Enforcement Officer and City Engineer shall review
the application for administrative and technical approval and determine if the
proposed use complies with Subsections 4, 7(B)(4), and 7(B)(5) of this section.
Applicant will pay all fees associated with the review process.
         (4)   The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall respond to each such
application within 60 days after receiving it by either approving or denying
the application.
         (5)   In connection with any such administrative approval, the Zoning
Enforcement Officer may, in order to encourage shared use, administratively
waive any zoning district setback requirements in Subsection 7(B)(4) or
separation distances between towers in Subsection 7(B)(5) by up to 50 percent.
         (6)   In connection with any such administrative approval, the Zoning
Enforcement Officer may, in order to encourage the use of monopoles,
administratively allow the reconstruction of an existing tower to monopole
construction.
         (7)   If an administrative approval is denied, the applicant shall
file an application for a special use permit pursuant to Subsection 7 prior to
filing any appeal that may be available under this chapter.
      B.   List of Administratively Approved Uses.  The following uses may be
approved by the Zoning Enforcement Officer after conducting an administrative
review:
         (1)   Locating a tower or antenna, including the placement of
additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said
tower or antenna, in any industrial or heavy commercial zoning district.
         (2)   Locating antennas on existing structures or towers consistent
with the terms of Subsections (a) and (b) below.
            a.   Antennas On Existing Structures. Any antenna which is not
attached to a tower may be approved by the Zoning Enforcement Officer as an
accessory use to any commercial, industrial, professional, institutional, or
multi-family structure of eight or more dwelling units, provided;
               (i)   The antenna does not extend more than 30 feet above the
highest point of the structure;
               (ii)   The antenna complies with all applicable FCC and FAA
regulations; and
               (iii)   The antenna complies with all applicable building codes.
            b.   Antennas On Existing Towers. An antenna which is attached to
an existing tower may be approved by the Zoning Enforcement Officer and, to
minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation and
clustering of towers, collocation of antennas by more than one carrier on
existing towers shall take precedence over the construction of new towers,
provided such collocation is accomplished in a manner consistent with the
following:
               (i)   A tower which is modified or reconstructed to accommodate
the collocation of an additional antenna shall be of the same tower type as the
existing tower, unless the Zoning Enforcement Officer allows reconstruction as
a monopole.
               (ii)   Height.
                  (a)   An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a
taller height, not to exceed 30 feet over the tower’s existing height, to
accommodate the collocation of an additional antenna.
                  (b)   The height change referred to in Subsection (iii) (a)
may only occur one time per communication tower.
                  (c)   The additional height referred to in Subsection (iii)
(a) shall not require an additional distance separation as set forth in
Subsection 7. The tower’s premodification height shall be used to calculate
such distance separations.
               (iii)   Onsite Location.
                  (a)   A tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate the
collocation of an additional antenna may be moved onsite within 50 feet of its
existing location.
                  (b)   After the tower is rebuilt to accommodate collocation,
only one tower may remain on the site.
                  (c)   A relocated onsite tower shall continue to be measured
from the original tower location for purposes of calculating separation
distances between towers pursuant to Subsection 7(B)(5). The relocation of a
tower hereunder shall in no way be deemed to cause a violation of Subsection 7
(B)(5).
                  (d)   The onsite relocation of a tower which comes within the
separation distances to residential units or residentially zoned lands as
established in Subsection 7(B)(5) shall only be permitted when approved by the
Zoning Enforcement Officer.
         (3)   New Towers In Non-Residential Zoning Districts. Locating any new
tower in a non-residential zoning district other than industrial or heavy
commercial, provided a licensed professional engineer certifies the tower can
structurally accommodate the number of shared users proposed by the applicant;
the Zoning Enforcement Officer concludes the tower is in conformity with the
goals set forth in Subsection 1 and the requirements of Subsection 4; the tower
meets the setback requirements in Subsection 7(B)(4) and separation distances
in Subsection 7(B)(5); and the tower meets the following height and usage
criteria:
            a.   For a single user, up to 90 feet in height;
            b.   For two users, up to 120 feet in height; and
            c.   For three or more users, up to 150 feet in height.
            d.   Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this section,
a tower of up to 270 feet in height may be approved by the Council upon a
showing that the tower will be used for at least three users and that the site
best addresses the needs and concerns of the City.
         (4)   Locating any alternative tower structure in a zoning district
other than industrial or heavy commercial that, in the judgment of the Zoning
Enforcement Officer, is in conformity with the goals set forth in Subsection 1.
         (5)   Installing a cable microcell network through the use of multiple
low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to existing wireline systems, such
as conventional cable or telephone wires, or similar technology that does not
require the use of towers.
   7.   Special Use Permits.  
      A.   The following provisions shall govern the issuance of special use
permits for towers or antennas by the Board of Adjustment:
         (1)   If the tower or antenna is not a permitted use under Subsection
5 of this section or is not approved administratively pursuant to Subsection 6
of this section, then a special use permit shall be required for the
construction of a tower or the placement of an antenna in all zoning districts.
         (2)   Applications for special use permits under this subsection shall
be subject to the procedures and requirements of Section
165.21 of this chapter, except as modified in this Subsection.
         (3)   In granting a special use permit, the Board of Adjustment may
impose conditions to the extent the Board of Adjustment concludes such
conditions are necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower
on adjoining properties.
         (4)   Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant
submits, whether civil, mechanical, or electrical, shall be certified by a
licensed professional engineer and also reviewed by the City Engineer.
         (5)   An applicant for a special use permit shall submit the
information described in this subsection and a non-refundable fee as
established by resolution of the Council to reimburse the City for the costs of
reviewing the application.
      B.   Towers.
         (1)   Information Required. In addition to any information required
for applications for special use permits pursuant to Section
165.21 of this chapter, applicants for a special use permit for a tower shall
submit the following information:
            a.   A scaled site plan clearly indicating the location, type and
height of the proposed tower, on-site land uses and zoning, adjacent land uses
and zoning (including when adjacent to other municipalities), Master Plan
classification of the site and all properties within the applicable separation
distances set forth in Subsection 7(B)(5), adjacent roadways, proposed means of
access, setbacks from property lines, elevation drawings of the proposed tower
and any other structures, topography, parking, and other information deemed by
the Zoning Enforcement Officer to be necessary to assess compliance with this
section.
            b.   Legal description of the parent tract and leased parcel (if
applicable).

         (2)   Factors Considered In Granting Special Use Permits For Towers.
In addition to any standards for consideration of special use permit
applications pursuant to Section
165.21 of this chapter, the Board of Adjustment shall consider the following
factors in determining whether to issue a special use permit, although the
Board of Adjustment may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or
more of these criteria if the Board of Adjustment concludes that the goals of
this section are better served thereby;
            a.   Height of the proposed tower;
            b.   Proximity of the tower to residential structures and
residential district boundaries;
            c.   Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
            d.   Surrounding topography;
            e.   Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
            f.   Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual
obtrusiveness;
            g.   Proposed ingress and egress; and
            h.   Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or
alternative technologies not requiring the use of towers or structures, as
discussed in Subsection 7 (B) (3) of this section.
         (3)   Availability of Suitable Existing Towers, Other Structures, or
Alternative Technology. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant
demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the Board of Adjustment that no
existing tower, structure or alternative technology that does not require the
use of towers or structures can accommodate the applicant’s a proposed antenna.
An applicant shall submit information requested by the Board of Adjustment
related to the availability of suitable existing towers, other structures or
alternative technology. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing
tower, structure or alternative technology can accommodate the applicant’s
proposed antenna may consist of any of the following:
            a.   No existing towers or structures are located within the
geographic area which meet applicant’s engineering requirements.
            b.   Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to
meet applicant’s engineering requirements.
            c.   Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient
structural strength to support applicant’s proposed antenna and related
equipment.
            d.   The applicant’s proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the
antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the
applicant’s proposed antenna.
            e.   The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the
owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing
tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower
development are presumed to be unreasonable.
            f.   The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting
factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
            g.   The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that
does not require the use of towers or structures, such as a cable microcell
network using multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to a
wireline system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new
tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology
unsuitable.
         (4)   Setbacks. The following setback requirements shall apply to all
towers for which a special use permit is required; provided, however, that the
Board of Adjustment may reduce the standard setback requirements if the goals
of this subsection would be better served thereby:
            a.   Towers must be set back a distance equal to at least 75
percent of the height of the tower from any adjoining lot line.
            b.   Guys and accessory buildings must satisfy the minimum zoning
district setback requirements.
         (5)   Separation. The following separation requirements shall apply to
all towers and antennas for which a special use permit is required; provided,
however, that the Board of Adjustment may reduce the standard separation
requirements if the goals of this section would be better served thereby.
            a.   Separation From Off-Site Uses/Designated Areas.
               (i)   Tower separation shall be measured from the base of the
tower to the lot line of the off-site uses and/or designated areas as specified
in Table 1, except as otherwise provided in Table 1.
               (ii)   Separation requirements for towers shall comply with the
minimum standards established in Table 1.

preliminary subdivision plan or valid development plan approval and any multi-
family residentially zoned land greater than duplex.
 
            b.   Separation Distances Between Towers.
               (i)   Separation distances between towers shall be applicable
for and measured between the proposed tower and preexisting towers. The
separation distances shall be measured by drawing or following a straight line
between the base of the existing tower and the proposed base, pursuant to a
site plan, of the proposed tower. The separation distances (listed in linear
feet) shall be as shown in Table 2.

         (6)   Security Fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing
not less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate
anti-climbing device; provided, however, that the Board of Adjustment may waive
such requirements, as it deems appropriate.
         (7)   Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the
landscaping surrounding towers for which a special use permit is required;
provided, however, that the Board of Adjustment may waive such requirements if
the goals of this section would be better served thereby.
            a.   Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant
materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from property
used for residences. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at
least four feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound.
            b.   In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be
minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived.
            c.   Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site
shall be preserved to the maximum extents possible. In some cases, such as
towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property
perimeter may be sufficient buffer.
   8.   Buildings or Other Equipment Storage.
      A.   Antennas Mounted on Structures or Rooftops. The equipment cabinet or
structure used in association with antennas shall comply with the following:
         (1)   The cabinet or structure shall not contain more than 320 square

uses permitted by special use to encourage collocation.
   9.   Removal of Abandoned Antennas and Towers.
      A.   Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of
six months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or
tower shall remove the same within 60 days of receipt of notice from the City
notifying the owner of such abandonment. Failure to remove an abandoned antenna
or tower within said 60 days shall be grounds to remove the tower or antenna at
the owner’s expense. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then
this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the
tower.
      B.   A written agreement signed by the communication facility owner and
property owner to remove the tower, foundation and any other accessory
equipment within 60 days after abandonment. As used herein, the term
“abandonment” shall mean a communication tower that is not used for its

consist of five members. The terms of office of the members of the Board of
Adjustment shall be for terms of five years of each. The terms of office of the
members of the Board of Adjustment shall be for five years on a staggered
basis, and their appointment shall be made by the Mayor, with the approval of
the Council. Any member of the Board who shall thereafter be absent from three
meetings of the Board during any one calendar year, without good cause, shall
be deemed to have vacated such office on the occasion of such third absence.
The Chairperson shall immediately report such vacancy to the Mayor, who shall,
with the approval of the Council, fill such vacancy for the unexpired term. The
Board shall not carry on its business without having at least three members
present. A majority of the members of the Board of Adjustment should not be
involved in the business of purchasing or selling real estate.
   2.   Meetings. The meetings of the Board of Adjustment shall be held at the
call of the Chairperson and at such other times as the Board may determine.
Such Chairperson, or in the absence of the Chairperson, the acting Chair, may
administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the
Board shall be open to the public. The Board shall keep minutes of its
proceedings, showing the vote of each member on each question, or, if a member
is absent or fails to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its
examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately
filed in the office of the Board and shall be a public record. The presence of
three members shall be necessary to constitute a quorum.
   3.   Appeal Procedure.
      A.   Appeals to the Board of Adjustment may be taken by any person
aggrieved or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the City affected
by any decision of the Zoning Enforcement Officer. Such appeal shall be taken
within 10 days by filing with the City Clerk a Notice of Appeal specifying the
grounds thereof. The City Clerk shall forthwith transmit to the Board all
papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from is taken. An
appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless
the Zoning Enforcement Officer certifies to the Board, after Notice of Appeal
has been filed with the City Clerk, that by reason of the facts stated in the
certificate, a stay would, in the opinion of the Zoning Enforcement Officer,
cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not
be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the
Board or by a court of record on application or notice to the City Clerk and
the Zoning Enforcement Officer and on due cause shown.
      B.   The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing on the appeal,
shall give public notice thereof as well as due notice to the parties in
interest, and shall decide the same within a reasonable time. At the hearing,
any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney. Before an appeal is
filed with the Board of Adjustment, the appellant shall pay a fee in an amount
established from time to time by resolution of the City Council.
   4.   Powers and Duties. The Board of Adjustment shall have the following
powers and duties:
      A.   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in
any order, requirement, rescission or determination made by the Zoning
Enforcement Officer in enforcement of this chapter.
      B.   To grant a variation in the regulations when a property owner can
show that his property was acquired in good faith; that by reason of
exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a specific piece of property
or by reason of exceptional topographical conditions or other extraordinary or
exceptional situation, the strict application of the terms of this chapter
actually prohibits the use of this property in the district, and that the Board
is satisfied under the evidence before it that a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter would result in unnecessary hardship; provided
however, all variations granted under this clause shall be in harmony with the
intended spirit and purpose of this chapter. In granting any variance, the
Board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with
this chapter. Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of
the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation and
punishable under provisions of this Code. Under no circumstances shall the
Board grant a variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this
chapter in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication
prohibited by its terms in said district.
      C.   To permit the following exceptions to the district regulations set
forth in this chapter, provided that all exceptions shall by their design,
construction and operation adequately safeguard the health, safety and welfare
of the occupants of adjoining and surrounding property, shall not impair an
adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, shall not increase
congestion in the public streets, shall not increase public danger of fire or
endanger the public safety, and shall not diminish or impair established
property values in surrounding areas:
         (1)   To permit erections and use of a building or the use of
premises, or vary the height, yard or area regulations in any location for a
public service corporation for public utility purposes, or for purposes of
public communication, including the distribution of newspapers, which the Board
determines is reasonably necessary for the public convenience or welfare;
         (2)   To permit the use of property in residential districts for off-
street parking purposes as accessory to permitted residential district uses
where said parking lots do not immediately adjoin the permitted residential
district use;
         (3)   To permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of
a district divides a lot in single ownership as shown on record or by existing
contract or purchase at the time of the passage of the ordinance codified in
this chapter, but in no case shall such extension of the district boundary line
exceed 40 feet in any direction.
      D.   In no instance may the Board of Adjustment grant a variance to any
provisions of the adopted Building Codes.
   5.   Decisions.
      A.   In exercising the powers and duties set forth in Subsection 4, the
Board of Adjustment may, in conformity with the provisions of law, reverse or
affirm, wholly or partly, or modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or
determination as it believes proper. To that end it shall have all the powers
of the Zoning Enforcement Officer. The concurring vote of three of the members
of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or
determination of the Zoning Enforcement Officer or to decide in favor of the
applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this chapter,
provided, however, that the action of the Board shall not become effective
until after the resolution of the Board, setting forth the full reason for its
decision and the vote of each member participating therein, has been filed.
Such resolution immediately following the Board’s final decision shall be filed
in the office of the Board and shall be open to public inspection.
      B.   Every variation and exception granted or denied by the Board shall
be supported by a written testimony or evidence submitted in connection
therewith.

City, or any person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision
of the Board, may present to a court of record a petition, duly verified,
setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying
the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court
within 30 days after the filing of the decision in the office of the Board.
      D.   The Board of Adjustment shall be permitted to approve, approve with
conditions or deny a request for a variance. Each request for a variance shall
be consistent with the following criteria:
         (1)   Limitations on the use of the property due to physical,
topographical and geologic features.
         (2)   The grant of the variance will not grant any special privilege
to the property owner.
         (3)   The applicant can demonstrate that without a variance there can
be no reasonable use of the property.
         (4)   The grant of the variance is not based solely on economic
reasons.
         (5)      The necessity for the variance was not created by the
property owner, including a certification that the variance is not being
requested due to the property owner having installed an improvement in
violation of Polk City Code.
(Ord. 2023-9200 – Nov. 23 Supp.)
         (6)   The variance requested is the minimum variance necessary to
allow reasonable use of the property.
         (7)   The grant of the variance will not be injurious to the public
health, safety or welfare.
         (8)   The property subject to the variance request possesses one or
more unique characteristics generally not applicable to similarly situated
properties.
165.24 OCCUPANCY PERMITS.
   No land shall be occupied or used and no building hereafter erected or
structurally altered shall be occupied or used in whole or in part for any
purpose whatsoever, until a certificate is issued by the Zoning Enforcement
Officer, stating that the building and use comply with the provisions of this
chapter and the building and health provisions of the Code. No change of use
shall be made in any building or part thereof, now or hereafter erected or
structurally altered, without a permit being issued therefor by the Zoning
Enforcement Officer. No permit shall be issued to make a change unless the
changes are in conformity with provisions of this chapter. Prior to the
issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy and Compliance, the applicant shall pay
to the City Treasurer an appropriate sum as established from time to time by
resolution of the City Council.
   Where applicable, such sums shall be paid to the City Treasurer upon
application for a building permit. Nothing in this part shall prevent the
continuance of a nonconforming use as heretofore authorized, unless a
discontinuance is necessary for the safety of life or property. Certificates of
Occupancy and Compliance shall be applied for coincidentally with the
application for a building permit and shall be issued within 10 days after the
lawful erection or alteration of the building is completed. A record of all
certificates shall be kept on file in the office of the Zoning Enforcement
Officer and copies shall be furnished on request to any person having a
proprietary or tenancy interest in the building affected. No permit for
excavation for, or the erection or alteration of, any building shall be issued
before the application has been made for Certificate of Occupancy and
Compliance, and no building or premises shall be occupied until that
certificate and permit is issued.
165.25 PLATS.
   Each application for a building permit shall be accompanied by a site sketch
in duplicate drawn to scale, showing the actual dimensions of the lot to be
built upon, the size, shape and location of the building to be erected
(including driveway collection), and such other information as may be necessary
to provide for the enforcement of this chapter. A record of applications and
site sketches shall be kept in the office of the Zoning Enforcement Officer.
165.26 AMENDMENTS.
   1.   The Council may, from time to time, on its own action or on petition
after report by the Commission, amend, supplement, or change the boundaries or
regulations herein or subsequently established. However, no such amendment,
supplement, restriction, change of boundaries, or regulations shall become
effective until after a public hearing in relation thereto, at which parties in
interest and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard. The notice of the
time and place of the hearing shall be published as provided in Section 362.3
of the Code of Iowa, except that at least seven-days’ notice must be given and
in no case shall the public hearing be held earlier than the next regularly
scheduled Council meeting following the published notice. The notice shall be
published in a paper of general circulation in the City. Such amendment,
supplement, or change shall not become effective except by a favorable vote of
a majority of all of the members of the Council.
   2.   Whenever any person desires that any amendment or change be made in
this Zoning Code, including the text and/or map, as to any property in the
City, and there shall be presented to the Council a petition requesting such
change or amendment and clearly describing the property and its boundaries as
to which the change or amendment is desired, duly signed by the owners of 50
percent of the area of all real estate included within the boundaries of said
tract as described in said petition, and in addition, duly signed by the owners
of 50 percent of the area of all real estate lying outside of said tract but
within 250 feet of the boundaries thereof, it shall be the duty of the Council
to vote upon such petition within a reasonable time after the filing of such
petition with the Clerk.
   3.   Where the person desires map to be amended to include the rezoning of
property to the Planned Unit Development (PUD) District only, the petition must
be duly signed by 100 percent of the area of all real estate included within
the boundaries of said tract as described in said petition. Where a person
desires to rezone a tract of land to PUD only, the requirement for said
petition to be duly signed by any owner of real estate lying outside of said
tract may be waived by City Council if Council, upon recommendation by the
Planning and Zoning Commission, determines the required Master Plan does not
show more intense development of the tract than would be permitted by the
existing zoning of said tract.
   4.   In case the proposed amendment, supplement or change is disapproved by
the Zoning Commission, including the text and/or map, or a protest is presented
duly signed by the owners of 20 percent or more either of the area of the lots
included in such proposed change or of those immediately adjacent to the rear
thereof, extending the depth of one lot or not to exceed 200 feet from the
street frontage of such opposite lots, such amendments shall not become
effective except by the favorable vote of at least four-fifths of all members
of the Council.
   5.   Whenever any petition for an amendment, supplement or change of the
zoning regulations herein contained or subsequently established shall have been
denied by the Council, then no new petition, including the text and/or map,
covering the same property and additional property shall be filed with or
considered by the Council until one year shall have elapsed from the date of
the filing of the first petition. Provided, however, the Council may, in its
discretion, by resolution, authorize the filing of a new petition within one
year, upon its showing that an enforcement of this provision would impose an
undue hardship upon the owner of such real estate.
   6.   Filing Fees. Before any action shall be taken as provided in this
section, the owner or owners of the property proposed or recommended to be
changed in the district regulations or district boundaries shall pay to the
Clerk a filing fee in an amount established from time to time by resolution of
the City Council. In addition to the fee, applicant shall pay to the Clerk,
prior to the Council’s final consideration of the proposed ordinance, a sum
representing the actual cost of mailing notice to surrounding property owners
and/or the cost of the publication of notice, as required by this chapter and
the actual cost of engineering services incurred by the City in the examination
and review of the proposed zoning amendment. Under no conditions shall said sum
or any part thereof be refunded for failure of said amendment to be enacted
into law.
165.27 ZONING ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.
   The City Manager (or designee) shall be the Zoning Enforcement Officer. The
Zoning Enforcement Officer (or designee) shall exercise the following powers
and duties:
   1.   The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall have all enforcement powers,
including but not limited to the investigation of complaints of zoning
violations, issuance of notices to violators, and the preparation and
submission to the City Attorney of reports of those zoning violations which
continue unabated after exhaustion of reasonable administrative remedies toward
their abatement, for such legal action as the facts of each such report may
require.
   2.   In all cases where the City commences court action, the Zoning
Enforcement Officer shall cooperate with the City Attorney by performing such
additional investigative work as the City Attorney shall require.
   3.   The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall attend the meetings of the
Planning and Zoning Commission and the Board of Adjustment as requested by
those bodies, shall investigate and review all cases presented to the Board of

institutes legal proceedings, the Zoning Enforcement Officer will cooperate
fully with the City Attorney in the perfecting of such proceedings.
165.28 VIOLATION AND PENALTIES.
   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to comply
with or who resists the enforcement of any of the provisions of this chapter
shall be in violation of this Code of Ordinances. Each day that a violation is
permitted to exist constitutes a separate offense.
165.29 ENFORCEMENT.
   In case any building, structure or sign is erected, constructed, or any
building, structure, sign, or land is used in violation of this chapter, the
City Attorney, in addition to other remedies, shall institute any proper action
or proceedings in the name of the City to prevent such unlawful erection,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance, or
use, to restrain, correct or abate such violation, to prevent the occupancy of
said building, structure or land, or to prevent any illegal act, conduct,
business or use in or about said premises.
165.30 SPECIAL EVENTS.
   The City recognizes that in certain instances, some flexibility to allow
special events out of the confines of a building can be beneficial to business

to promote public health, safety and general welfare. The following special
event applications shall require a fee in an amount determined by resolution of
the City Council from time to time.

involve the sale of dispensing of alcoholic beverages without prior approval
from the Council. Outdoor sales shall not create a burden on parking and access
facilities. Outdoor sales events shall maintain fire and emergency access at
all times. A Temporary Site Plan may be required by the City Manager to show

congestion, lighting, or additional factors.
   2.   Seasonal sales events shall be permitted for two events per year for a
maximum duration of 45 days per event subject to approval by the City Manager.
Seasonal sales events shall maintain fire and emergency access at all times.
Seasonal sales events are those events that, due to the nature of the product
being sold or the time of year that such product is for sale, are best
accomplished out of doors. Seasonal sales events do not include the sale or
dispensing of alcoholic beverages without prior approval from the Council. A
Temporary Site Plan may be required by the City Manager to show that the event
will not impact the neighboring properties due to noise, congestion, lighting,
or additional factors.

provisions of the Electrical Code, and the permit fees required thereunder.
This section does not apply to preexisting signs within the City as defined by
Section

by the Council.
166.04 PERMIT APPLICATION.
   Application for sign permits shall be made upon forms provided by the

166.05 PERMIT ISSUANCE PROCEDURE.

for a sign permit, to examine the same, and if it appears that all required
information has been submitted and that the proposed sign is otherwise in
compliance with all the requirements of this chapter, the approved Site Plan
when applicable, and all other ordinances of the City, the Building Inspector
shall then issue the sign permit. If the work authorized under a sign permit
has not been completed within six months after the date of issuance, the said

or home offices which are permitted in residential districts under the Zoning
Ordinance and other regulations of the City, except as provided in Section
166.13.
166.08 UNSAFE OR UNLAWFUL SIGNS.
   If the Building Inspector finds that any sign regulated hereunder is unsafe
or insecure or is a menace to the public, or has been constructed or erected or
is being maintained in violation of the provisions of this chapter, such
official shall give written notice thereof to the permit holder by certified
and regular mail, unless such illegal sign is a temporary sign located within
public rights-of-way or alleys, the removal of which requires no prior
notification by the Code Enforcement Officer, or designee. Such notice shall
include a statement explaining the alleged violations and deficiencies, an
order to repair or remove said sign, and an explanation of the consequences of
failure to comply with said order. If the permit holder fails to remove or
alter said sign so as to comply with the order within ten 10 days after such
notice, the offending sign may be removed or altered by the Code Enforcement
Officer or designee at the expense of the permit holder or owner of the
property on which it is located. The permit holder may appeal the order of the
Building Inspector to the City Council, and if such appeal is on file, the 10-
day compliance period shall be extended until 10 days following the Council’s
decision on the matter. If, however, the Building Inspector finds that any sign
imposes a serious and immediate threat to the safety or health of any person,
such official may order the removal of such sign summarily, and without notice
to the permit holder. Such an order may be appealed to the Council, and, if the
Council reverses, it shall order restitution at the City’s expense.
166.09 PERMIT REVOKED; EFFECT OF REVOCATION.
   Any permit holder who fails to comply with the valid order of the Building
Inspector within the allotted time, or who fails to pay reasonable removal or
repair expenses assessed under the preceding section, shall have the permit as
to such sign or signs revoked, and another permit for the erection of such sign
or signs shall not be issued to said permit holder for a period of one year
from the date of revocation.
166.10 PAINTING AND MAINTAINING.
   The owner of any sign, as defined and regulated by this chapter, shall be
required to have properly painted and maintained all parts and supports of the
said sign, including maintenance or treatment as is necessary to prevent rust.
166.11 WIND PRESSURE AND DEAD LOAD REQUIREMENTS.
   All signs and other advertising structures shall be designed and constructed
to resist wind pressure, live load, and dead load requirements. For any
particular sign in question, the City Inspector may require a structural
engineer’s certification indicating compliance with acceptable structural
standards.
166.12 REMOVAL OF CERTAIN SIGNS REQUIRED.
   Any sign now or hereafter existing, which has not yet been removed, for more
than six months after the last day of business, shall be taken down and removed
within 10 days after written notification from the Building Inspector, and upon
failure to comply with such notice within the time specified in such order, the
Building Inspector is hereby authorized to cause removal of such signs, and any
expense incident thereto shall be paid by the owner of the building or
structure to which said sign is attached. Time extension may be made by the
Council upon written request from said owner. Further, if any existing sign is,
upon inspection, found to be unsafe, or in a state of disrepair, such as to
affect the health, safety or welfare of the citizens, the sign shall be subject
to the provisions of Section
166.08 of this chapter.
166.13 EXEMPTIONS.

   1.   No sign shall be erected, located or maintained so as to prevent free
ingress to or egress from any door, window or fire escape. No sign of any kind
shall be attached to a stand pipe or fire escape.
   2.   No sign regulated by this chapter shall be erected at the intersection
of any streets in such a manner as to obstruct free and clear vision, or at any
location where, by reason of the position, shape or color, it may interfere
with, obstruct the view of, or be confused with any authorized traffic sign,
signal or device; in such a manner as to interfere with, mislead or confuse
traffic.
   3.   No signs regulated by this chapter shall encroach upon or have posts,
guides, or supports located within any public right-of-way or alley.

170.04 CLASSIFICATION OF LAND DIVISIONS.
   1.   Plat of Subdivision. A Plat of Subdivision shall be required for any
division of land that proposes either of the following actions or outcomes,
regardless of whether it is a major plat, minor plat, or a replat:
      A.   To divide a single interest in a parcel of land or other corporal
real property into two or more interests, including declarations and
establishments of horizontal property regimes and cooperative housing. For the
purpose of making such determination, a conveyance of one or more parcels to
the City or other public entity for use as right-of-way shall not be counted as
one of said three interests; or
      B.   To create a new street, whether by choice or by necessity in order
to comply with minimum frontage or other code requirements, and regardless of
whether the street is to be dedicated for public ownership and maintenance, or
held in common private ownership and use.
         (1)   Minor Plat of Subdivision. A subdivision that divides a single
parcel of land or other interest in corporal real property into not more than
four parcels or interest that each front onto existing, paved, public streets
may be classified as a minor subdivision. The City Engineer shall have the
authority to classify a subdivision as a minor subdivision provided said
subdivision:
            a.   Does not require any new public streets for access to any lot
or parcel;
            b.   Does not require extension of public sanitary sewer, storm
sewer, or water mains;
            c.   Does not require grading or drainage improvements, including
detention, to control runoff that may adversely affect downstream properties;
            d.   Does not adversely affect the future development or platting
of the remainder of the property or adjoining property; and
            e.   Is not in conflict with provisions of this Code of Ordinances,
the Zoning Ordinance, or Comprehensive Plan.
         (2)   Preliminary plats and final plats for minor plats of
subdivision, horizontal property regimes, and cooperatives may be filed for
concurrent review and approval.
   2.   Plat of Survey. A subdivision that divides a single parcel of land or
other interest in corporal real property into not more than two parcels or
interests; a plat that combines several parcels into a single parcel to clarify
or simplify its legal description; or a plat that clarifies the boundaries of
one or more parcels of land that have metes and bounds descriptions and that
does not create any subdivision, may be done by plat of survey if approved by
the City Engineer. Consecutive plats of survey on a single tract of land shall
not be used to circumvent the requirement for a plat of subdivision.
   3.   Acquisition Plat. An acquisition plat may be completed in the same
manner as a plat of survey, regardless of the number of new parcels of land or
other corporal real property that are created by the subdivision, if all of the
new parcels or interests will be held in public ownership by the City or other
governmental entity, or by other persons having the power of eminent domain for
the purpose of acquiring such corporal real property.
   4.   Auditor’s Plat. An auditor’s plat shall comply with all of the
submittals and procedures that are required for a plat of subdivision.
   5.   Condominiums. The establishment of a condominium, including the
conversion of existing buildings or construction of new buildings, with the
intent to establish a horizontal property regime with interest in real property
shared by co-owners shall comply with the requirements, conditions, and
restrictions of Chapter 499B of the Code of Iowa and all applicable building
codes, fire codes, zoning regulations, and subdivision regulations. All
required documents including declaration of horizontal regime, articles of
incorporation, bylaws, and rules and regulations shall be provided to the City
Manager for review by the Development Review Committee and approval by City
Council prior to recordation.
170.05 REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCEDURE.
   1.   Pre-Application Conference. Whenever a developer proposes a plat of
subdivision, the developer shall contact the City Manager to schedule a pre-
application conference. The pre-application conference shall include the
developer and representatives, representatives from the department of community
development and the engineering department, and such other City departments
that express a desire to be included in such pre-application conferences on a
regular basis, or that are deemed helpful or necessary by the City Manager. The
purpose of the pre-application conference shall be to acquaint the City staff
with the proposed subdivision, and to acquaint the developer with the
procedures and requirements of this code along with issues and regulations that
pertain to the subdivision. The developer shall furnish a reasonably specific
description of the property to be subdivided at the time of requesting the pre-
application conference and is encouraged to prepare and submit a conceptual
layout plan for the proposed subdivision prior to the conference in order to
facilitate the pre-application conference.
   2.   Neighborhood sketch plan. If the City Engineer determines there is no
existing master plan or neighborhood sketch plan or other plan that fulfills
the intent of this section by adequately demonstrating how a proposed land
development will be compatible with the development of adjoining lands and the
Comprehensive Plan, the developer shall submit a neighborhood sketch plan to
the City Clerk prior to or in conjunction with the development application for
a preliminary plat. Requirements for a neighborhood sketch plan shall be as set
forth in Section
170.10 of this Chapter. The procedure for review and approval of a neighborhood
sketch plan shall be the same as for a preliminary plat specified in Subsection
3(A) of this section.
   3.   Plat of Subdivision
      A.   Preliminary Plat. Following one or more pre-application conferences
as determined to be necessary by the City Engineer or as requested by the
developer, a preliminary plat of subdivision (“preliminary plat”) shall be
prepared by the developer and submitted to the City Clerk in accordance with
this chapter. Preliminary plats shall be reviewed and presented to the Planning
and Zoning Commission in general accordance with the Submittal and Meeting
Schedule further defined in Section
170.05, Subsection 9, of this Chapter.
         (1)   The City Engineer shall review the preliminary plat and the City
Clerk shall promptly convey one copy of it to each member of the Development
Review Committee for their review and recommendations. The Committee shall
review the preliminary plat for conformance to all of the City codes,
ordinances, and specifications that they customarily enforce, and for
conformance to applicable professional standards. Upon completion of their
reviews, each member of the Committee shall forward their recommendations for
action on the preliminary plat to the City Engineer for inclusion in a
consolidated, written staff report and recommendation that is to be prepared by
the City Engineer. The Committee may recommend that the plat be approved,
approved subject to conditions and revisions, or that the preliminary plat
application be denied for reasons that shall be set forth in the written
Committee recommendation.
         (2)   The City Engineer shall provide a copy of the written staff
report and the consolidated recommendations from the Development Review
Committee to the developer prior to providing the report and recommendations to
the Planning and Zoning Commission to afford the developer the opportunity to
make any revisions deemed necessary or appropriate prior to the preliminary
plat being provided to the Commission. After consulting with the developer and
City Engineer, the City Clerk shall forward the Development Application along
with the Committee report and recommendations, each as revised if applicable,
to the Commission.
         (3)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review the Development
Application and the recommendations of the Development Review Committee and act
on the proposed preliminary plat in a timely manner, and may recommend to the
City Council that it approve, approve subject to conditions or revisions, or
deny the preliminary plat application, whether or not such recommendations are
in accordance with the recommendations of the Development Review Committee. If
the Commission does not act on the preliminary plat in a timely manner, the
developer may request the City Council to consider the preliminary plat and
recommendations of the Development Review Committee without the provision of
any recommendations by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
         (4)   The Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council may, at
their discretion, hold public hearings on a preliminary plat and may provide
notice to nearby property owners or tenants in whatever manner or amount of
time that the Commission or Council deems appropriate.
         (5)   Once a preliminary plat has been reviewed and acted on by the
Planning and Zoning Commission, the City Engineer shall forward the
Commission’s recommendations and the Development Review Committee report and
recommendations to the City Council for consideration at its next available
meeting, subject to any notifications that may be directed by the Commission or
Council and revisions to the preliminary plat to satisfy all recommended
revisions and conditions, provided the City Council desires to have all such
revisions completed to the Development Review Committee’s satisfaction prior to
the Council’s consideration of the preliminary plat. The City Council may adopt
the recommendations of the Development Review Committee; recommendations of the
Commission if at variance with the Committee on one or more points; or act
freely of their own volition, provided that, the Council shall have no
authority to waive any requirements of the zoning code, or of any other City
code unless provisions are expressly set out in the pertinent code to grant the
Council the powers to waive or make exceptions to or from such code.
         (6)   Upon approval by the City Council and filing of a revised
preliminary plat that satisfies all conditions of approval, the City Clerk
shall retain a copy of the approved preliminary plat in the City files and
provide a copy to members of the Development Review Committee and to the
developer if requested.
      B.   Construction Drawings. Following approval of the preliminary plat
and during such time that the plat remains valid, the developer shall cause
detailed construction drawings of and specifications for the subdivision
improvements to be prepared by a professional civil engineer who is licensed in
the State of Iowa (herein “developer’s engineer”) and submitted for review and
approval by the City engineer.
         (1)   The developer’s engineer shall incorporate all of the
subdivision improvements that are required by this code and other applicable
regulations, and any that may be required by the City Council as a condition of
approval of the subdivision, in the subdivision improvement plans and
specifications and shall certify said plans and specifications as being fully
compliant with this code and all other applicable regulations.
         (2)   Said plans and specifications may allow for phased construction,
provided such phasing was depicted on a valid preliminary plat. In order to
facilitate such phasing, the City Engineer may require certain improvements,
including but not limited to temporary turn-arounds and extension of utilities
to structures set beyond pavement limits, to ensure each phase remains fully
compliant with this code and all other applicable regulations.
         (3)   Said plans and specifications shall be fully compliant with the
valid preliminary plat and the conceptual design of the improvements as
depicted therein. If the improvement plans and specifications deviate
substantially from the valid preliminary plat, the plans and specifications
shall be revised to conform, or the preliminary plat shall be revised and
resubmitted for review and approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission and
City Council, in full compliance with the requirements of this Code of
Ordinances.
         (4)   Any improvement that is proposed to be constructed in accordance
with special provisions that are in variation with or from the City’s standard
specifications shall first be reviewed and approved by the City Engineer, or
their designated agent, as part of the full and complete set of subdivision
improvement plans and specifications, and the City Engineer may require any
such variation to be submitted for review and approval by the City Council in
accordance with Section
170.14 of this chapter.
         (5)   No improvement or development, or work preparatory thereto
except clearing, grubbing and grading, shall be done prior to the City
Engineer’s finding that the subdivision improvement plans and specifications
are complete and in full compliance and have been properly certified by the
developer’s engineer, and are therefore approved; and that all required permits
have been issued by the City Engineer and all other applicable regulatory
agencies. Grading may be commenced at developer’s sole risk if the City
Engineer concurs with conceptual grading plans and stormwater management plans
that have been prepared by the developer’s engineer.
         (6)   The developer shall be responsible for applying for and
obtaining approval of all required permits from federal, State, and local
governmental agencies or jurisdictions prior to commencing construction of the
subdivision improvements.
         (7)   The developer’s engineer shall be solely responsible and liable
for ensuring that the subdivision improvement plans and specification are fully
compliant with the requirements of this code and all other applicable
requirements and permits. The City Engineer’s approval of the subdivision
improvement plans and specifications, or concurrence with conceptual grading
plans, shall only be deemed to allow the developer to commence work on the
correlating subdivision improvements or grading, in accordance with the
approved plans and specifications and all requirements of this code. The City
Engineer’s approval or concurrence shall not be found to assume, alleviate, or
relieve the developer or developer’s engineer from any liability or
responsibility for said plans or grading plans and the requirement to construct
the improvements in full compliance with this code; to create any vested right
to proceed with any development or improvement that is not in full compliance
with this code by reason of oversight, error or other reason; to waive any
requirement of this code unless this code expressly allows a waiver to be made
and any said waiver is made in writing; or to in any way create or assume any
liability by or for the City or any of its employees and agents.
      C.   Final Plat. Following the approval of a preliminary plat; approval
of the construction drawings and specifications for subdivision improvement
plans and specifications and acquisition of all required permits; and while the
preliminary plat remains valid, the developer shall cause a final subdivision
plat (“final plat”) to be prepared for all of the preliminary plat or for a
phase thereof as previously identified on the valid preliminary plat, and
submitted to the City Engineer in general accordance with the Submittal and
Meeting Schedule further defined in Section 170.05, Subsection 9, of this
Chapter.
         (1)   The City Engineer shall review the final plat and the City Clerk
shall promptly convey one copy of it to each member of the Development Review
Committee for their review and recommendations. The Committee shall review the
final plat for conformance to the valid preliminary plat; conformance to the
approved construction drawings and specifications; for conformance to all of
the City codes, ordinances and specifications that they customarily enforce,
and for conformance to applicable professional standards. Upon completion of
their reviews, each member of the Committee shall forward their recommendations
for action on the final to the City Engineer for inclusion in a consolidated,
written staff report and recommendation that is to be prepared by the City
Engineer. The Committee may recommend that the final plat be approved, approved
subject to conditions and revisions, or that the final plat application be
denied for reasons that shall be set forth in the written Committee
recommendation.
         (2)   The City Engineer shall provide a copy of the written staff
report and the consolidated recommendations from the Development Review
Committee to the developer prior to providing the report and recommendations to
the City Council or the Planning and Zoning Commission to afford the developer
the opportunity to make any revisions deemed necessary or appropriate prior to
the final plat being provided to the Commission. After consulting with the
developer, the City Engineer shall forward the Development Application along
with the Committee report and recommendations, each as revised if applicable,
to the City Council or the Commission if a recommendation from Planning and
Zoning is required.
         (3)   Only if the final plat includes substantial deviations from the
approved preliminary plat, as determined by the City Manager and excluding
phasing of the project, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall review the
Development Application and the recommendations of the Development Review
Committee and act on the proposed final plat in a timely manner, and may
recommend to the City Council that it approve, approve subject to conditions or
revisions, or deny the final plat application, whether or not such
recommendations are in accordance with the recommendations of the Development
Review Committee. If, in instances when a recommendation from the Planning and
Zoning Commission is required, the Commission does not act on the final plat in
a timely manner, the developer may request the City Council to consider the
final plat and recommendations of the Development Review Committee without the
provision of any recommendations by the Planning and Zoning Commission. If the
final plat does not include substantial deviations as defined herein, the final
plat shall proceed to City Council as described below.
         (4)   The City Engineer shall forward the Commission’s recommendations
and the Development Review Committee report and recommendations to the City
Council for consideration at its next available meeting, subject to any
notifications that may be directed by the Commission or Council and revisions
to the final plat to satisfy all recommended revisions and conditions, provided
the City Council desires to have all such revisions completed to the
Development Review Committee’s satisfaction prior to the Council’s
consideration of the preliminary plat. The City Council may adopt the
recommendations of the Development Review Committee; recommendations of the
Commission if at variance with the Committee on one or more points; or act
freely of their own volition, provided that, the Council shall have no
authority to waive any requirements of the zoning code, or of any other City
code unless provisions are expressly set out in the pertinent code to grant the
Council the powers to waive or make exceptions to or from such code.
         (5)   Upon approval by the City Council and filing of a revised final
plat that satisfy all conditions of approval, the City Engineer shall retain a
copy of the approved final plat and accompanying documents in the City files
and provide a copy to members of the Development Review Committee and to the
developer if requested.
      D.   Recording of Final Plat to Become an Official Plat.
         (1)   No final plat shall be submitted for filing of record in the
offices of the appropriate County Recorder, Auditor, and Assessor; officially
recognized by the City; improvements within a subdivision shall not be accepted
for public ownership and maintenance; building permits shall not be applied
for; and public funds shall not be expended or services provided within a
subdivision, until all provisions set forth in this code have been satisfied in
full and all approvals required by this code have been obtained and remain
valid.
         (2)   No final plat shall be released for filing of record unless and
until:
            a.   The required subdivision improvements shall be satisfactorily
completed to the full satisfaction of the City Engineer, all Record Drawings
have been provided in accordance with Section
170.11 Subsection 3, and all maintenance bonds shall be posted therefore in
accordance with Section
170.09 Subsection 6, and performance surety shall be posted for any subdivision
improvements that are incomplete and not ready for in accordance with
170.09 Subsection 5;
            b.   All fees and charges due to the City for review of all
Development Applications, construction observation of the subdivision
improvements; connection fees and other impact fees; assessments for streets
and other improvements; reimbursements for water mains; and any other costs and
financial obligations have been paid in full;
            c.   The developer has paid for the installation of streetlights;
            d.   The developer has reimbursed the City for all street name

            e.   Deeds and easements have been submitted to, and reviewed and
approved by the City Engineer, in consultation with the City Attorney, in
accordance with this code for all streets, parkland, recreational trails,
public utilities and subdivision improvements that are to be dedicated to the
City or owners’ association, as the case may be;
            f.   All attachments to subdivision plats as required by Chapter
354.11 of the Code of Iowa or contents of declaration as required by Chapter
499b.4 of the Code of Iowa as the case may be, development agreements,
covenants and declarations establishing an owners’ association, and any other
attachments, declarations, certifications or other documents that may be
required as a matter of the filing of a plat whether by this code or the City,
have been submitted to and reviewed and approved by the City Attorney in
consultation with the City Engineer;
            g.   All conditions of approval of the final plat by the City
Council have been satisfied in full.
         (3)   The final acceptance of the plat shall not be deemed to
constitute final acceptance by the City of any improvements or dedications
except as expressly set forth in a City Council resolution. The improvements
shall only be expressly accepted by separate action by the City Council after
the City Engineer submits a statement advising the Council that all of the
improvements have been inspected and found to have been completed in
substantial conformance with City specifications and the approved subdivision
improvement plans.
         (4)   Upon finding by the City Engineer that all requirements of this
code and of the Code of Iowa have been satisfied, the City Clerk shall release
the final plat, Council resolution approving said plat, and all necessary
documents for recording to the developer, and the developer shall promptly
submit same for filing of record in the offices of the appropriate County
recorder, auditor and assessor. Be it also provided that, the City Clerk may
choose to file any and all deeds and easements for the plat itself, to ensure
that they are in fact promptly and properly filed, and may charge the developer
for all costs associated with said filing.
         (5)   The developer shall submit to the City Clerk a certificate of
recording from the County Recorder’s office, or book and page of recordation,
to the City Clerk prior to issuance of any building permits within the platted
area.
   4.   Minor Plat of Subdivision. A minor plat of subdivision shall comply
with all of the requirements for a plat of subdivision, except that the
developer may incorporate the preliminary plat and final plat into a single
submittal for concurrent review and action by the City.
   5.   Plat of Survey. A plat of survey shall comply with the requirements of
a final plat with the exception of the provision of legal documents. However, a
plat of survey that does not create a new buildable parcel may be reviewed by
the City Engineer for compliance with this code and approved by City Council.
   6.   Acquisition Plat. An acquisition plat may be reviewed and approved by
the City Manager, with concurrency by the City Engineer, in the same manner as
a plat of survey.
   7.   Auditor’s Plat. An Auditor’s plat shall be submitted, reviewed, and
acted upon by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council in the same
manner as a plat of subdivision.
   8.   Subdivisions Outside of Corporate Limits. All plats of subdivision,
minor plats of subdivision, plats of survey, acquisition plats, and auditor’s
plats located in the unincorporated area within two miles of the corporate
limits of the City shall be reviewed and approved in the same manner (as a like
Development Application located within the corporate limits of the City). The
Development Application for such subdivisions that necessitate the extension
and/or the provision of municipal services, whether at the time of platting or
at some point in the future, shall be required to submit an application for
voluntary annexation, signed by the owner of the real property included in such
subdivision, which shall be recorded and kept on file in the City offices until
such time as City Council approves the petition for voluntary annexation.
   9.   Schedule for Development Review and Approval. All development
applications; with the exception of construction drawings, stormwater
management plan and record drawings; shall be reviewed by the Development
Review Committee and then presented to the Planning and Zoning Commission and
City Council in accordance with the Development Review Schedule issued each
year by the City Engineer. It shall be the developer’s responsibility to

shall be provided to the City Engineer including all information shown on the
approved as-built Record Drawings.
170.06 PARK AND OPEN SPACE DEDICATION.
   1.   This section shall not apply to any Development Application, or portion
thereof, which does not include residential development and is not zoned to
permit residential use.
   2.   The method for fulfilling the developer’s obligation for dedication of
park and open space shall be determined in conjunction with the preliminary
plat. An agreement regarding said dedication, if required, shall be approved at
the time of preliminary plat approval unless otherwise directed by the City
Engineer.
   3.   For purposes of this section, the term “Comprehensive Plan” shall be
deemed to mean the City’s Comprehensive Plan together with its companion
document, the City’s Comprehensive Park and Open Space Plan, including updates
and amendments thereto as may be adopted from time to time by City Council.
   4.   Dedicate Land For Park And Recreational Purposes.
      A.   All persons making a Development Application shall dedicate to
public use 8.284 acres of land for park purposes for each 1,000 people, based
upon the projected population of the completed development application as
calculated in accordance with this section. Therefore, the dedication of land
for park purposes shall be equivalent to 361square feet per resident. Such
dedication shall be prorated to the amount indicated by the projected
population to the nearest 1,000 square feet of land to be dedicated, but in any
event, no dedication of such parkland shall contain less than 10,000 square
feet of land to be dedicated for park usage.
      B.   For purposes of this section, population in the completed area
covered by the development will be determined by multiplying the number of
housing units projected in the area covered by the Development Application for
each type of dwelling unit times the anticipated average number of persons per
unit as given below times the required square footage per resident. The
quantity calculated for each type of dwelling unit shall be added together and
the sum shall be the projected population for purposes of the Development
Application. The selected dwelling unit type shall be based on the physical
characteristics of the structure rather than on the type of ownership planned
for the dwellings.
      C.   The parkland dedication for each dwelling unit type shall be as
listed below. If any proposed dwelling unit types are not listed below, the
City Engineer shall determine which dwelling unit types shall be used for
purposes of calculating the parkland dedication for the development.
 
Parkland Dedication Requirements
Dwelling Unit Type (As per Population Per Dwelling Land Dedication Per Dwelling
Zoning Ordinance)          Unit                    Unit
Single-Family Detached     2.76 persons            995.95 Square Feet
Single-Family Attached
(Bi-attached, duplex,      2.00 persons            721.70 Square Feet
townhomes)
Multiple Family            1.50 persons            541.28 Square Feet
(Apartments)
 
      D.   The City may require that all land dedicated under this section be
configured or located to optimize aggregations of land and thus may require
that the dedicated land be adjacent to the land affected by other development
applications or otherwise maximize usefulness of the land in accordance with
the Comprehensive Plan. The City may place similar requirements upon
dedications under this section in order to assure useful aggregations of land
for open space.
      E.   Only in locations where open space has been designated on the
Comprehensive Plan, such open space may be considered as parkland in fulfilling
the parkland dedication requirement, or portion thereof. On large tracts of
land where a future neighborhood park has been designated on Comprehensive
Plan, at least three acres of the required parkland dedication should be usable
for development of a neighborhood park. For purposes of this paragraph, land
dedicated for open space purposes includes natural resource areas, watershed
areas, wooded ravines or embankments, recreational trails, or similar open
spaces but shall be exclusive of floodplains.
      F.   In locations where recreational trails have been designated on the
Comprehensive Plan, trail right-of-way may be considered as parkland in
fulfilling the parkland dedication requirement. If said right-of-way exceeds 30
feet in width, and the City agrees to accept the excess right-of-way area, the
area to be considered as parkland for purposes of fulfilling the parkland
dedication requirement shall be based on a corridor no more than 30 feet wide.
In certain unique circumstances, the City Council may agree to accept a
Recreational Trail Easement in lieu of dedicated right-of-way and building
setbacks shall be adjusted such that there is no encroachment by foundations,
roofs, or cantilevered structures into the easement area.
      G.   For purposes of this section, the water area of ponds, streams,
detention basins, and other bodies of water as well as surrounding embankments
shall not be counted toward any required dedication for park or open space
purposes. Further, the land area within any floodway or designated as a
required buffer or open space shall not be included in determining any
dedication for park purposes.
      H.   The dedication of any land for park or open space purposes shall
include dedication of a corridor or point of connection from public pedestrian
access, the area of which shall be included in determining compliance with this
section. A minimum of 100 feet of frontage to a public street is required for
each park dedicated in accordance with this section, with the exception of land
dedicated for open space purposes which shall have a corridor or point of
connection that is at least 30 feet wide to accommodate recreational trails and
at least 60 feet wide where required by the City to accommodate park access
drives and trail.
      I.   Master Agreement. If the land to be developed is part of a larger
area being developed by a single developer or by a group of developers who
enter into a single agreement with the City, the developer or developers may
enter into a written agreement with the City providing for the dedication of
the land relating to the present development in a future subdivision plat,
which land shall be dedicated for recreational facilities serving the larger
area under development by the developer or developers. The written agreement
between the City and the developer or developers shall establish the timetable
for the dedication of the land by the developer. The amount of land dedicated
and the method of dedication shall be in accordance with the provisions of this
section.
      J.   Approval of a development application shall be conditioned upon the
construction of (or providing sufficient surety for the construction of) the
following improvements in accordance with the City’s design standards:
         (1)   Streets abutting any dedicated land.
         (2)   Utility services (including hookups) to the boundary of any
dedicated parkland, with the exception of open space land, including water
lines, sanitary sewers, storm sewers, drainage structures, gas lines, electric
lines, communications lines, and other such utilities as are (or will be upon
completion) available to adjacent tracts.
         (3)   Sidewalks abutting any public street including recreational
trail connections as appropriate.
         (4)   Site grading and seeding. A minimum of 75 percent of the
required parkland area, with the exception of areas designated as open space
per Subsection 4(E). of this section, shall be graded to accommodate active
recreation. The active recreation area shall be graded such that slopes are not
less than 1.5 percent or greater than five percent, except under special
conditions when greater slopes are desired to enhance recreation, such as a
sledding hill, as determined by the City Council. On-site drainage patterns
shall be designed and constructed to ensure runoff is not directed across
active recreation areas and approved by the City Engineer. Active recreation
areas and lawns shall have a minimum of four inches of clean, lightly compacted
topsoil. Seeding shall be completed using permanent seed mixtures based on
planned use of the property.
         (5)   Streetlights on public streets abutting the parkland and open
space land, with streetlights designed to illuminate park access locations.
      K.   If land dedication under this section requires an amendment to the
Comprehensive Plan, the need for such an amendment will be reported to the
Planning and Zoning Commission which shall make a recommendation to the City
Council on the development application.
      L.   The required land dedication under this section shall be reduced
when the person making the development application provides perpetual public
access by permanent easement to recreational facilities, playgrounds,
unobstructed open spaces, ball fields, soccer fields, tennis courts, basketball
courts, volleyball courts, picnic shelters, recreational trails and other
similar non-duplicated recreational facilities which have been (or will be)
constructed and maintained by the applicant and are not shown on the master
parks and trails plan. There shall not be any credit for swimming pools,
clubhouses and other recreational facilities not provided in public parks or
open spaces unless such recreational facilities are specifically designated on
the Comprehensive Plan. In order to determine the credit, the City shall
ascertain the fair market value of the land required to be dedicated under this
section and from such value subtract 50 percent of the cost of the recreational
facilities constructed by the applicant and provided under this section. The
person making the development application shall then only be required to
dedicate land equal in value to the remainder.
      M.   Property subject to public access for recreational trails shown on,
or proposed by the City to be shown on, the Comprehensive Plan shall be
included in the calculation of parkland dedicated under this section.
      N.   The dedication of land for recreational trails required under by
this chapter shall be platted as an outlot to be owned by the City upon final
platting. If specifically approved by City Council, the dedication may include
easements to the public of land used, provided such easement is in conformance
with Section
170.08, Subsection 16(G) of this chapter. The dedication of land shall be made
by the applicant by provision of a warranty deed transferring title of an
outlot or outlots to the City at the time of final approval of the plat. In the
case where the parkland dedication will be fulfilled, at least in part, by
dedication of an easement, the applicant shall provide an easement document
granting right of use to the City and the general public at the time of final
approval of the plat.
   5.   Alternative Location for Dedication. As an alternative to land
dedication under Subsection 4 of this section, any person filing a development
application may provide jointly with other persons for the dedication of land
in an amount at least equal to the amount required under Subsection 4 of this
section, at a location which is not part of the land for which approval is
sought, provided such alternative is within the same neighborhood park district
as the land for which a development application has been made, that the
alternative jointly provided will provide for a park with a total land area of
at least five acres and contiguous connective open space consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan, and that such alternative dedication of land is or has
actually been dedicated to the City and has been accepted by the City for use
in accord with the said plans.
   6.   Dedication Requirement Less Than One acre. Where application of the
formula set forth in Subsection 4 of this section results in a dedication
requirement of less than one acre, the person making or filing the development
application may elect to dedicate one acre of land or fulfill their obligation
by participating in an option provided by Subsection 5 of this section, but
such alternative participation shall be based upon the actual calculation under
Subsection 4 of this section and not upon the equivalent of one acre of land.
   7.   Alternate Plan. Subsections 4, 5 and 6 of this section notwithstanding,
any entity required to comply with this section may present an alternate plan
that meets the purposes of this section as a means of complying herewith. Such
alternate plans may include: (i) the developer’s payment of a fee in lieu of
land dedication that is based on the fair market value of land that has been
graded and seeded and includes one-half the cost of typical public improvements
based on the minimum 100 linear feet of frontage to a public street; or (ii)
the developer’s construction of park amenities or trails. It will be the burden
of the entity presenting such plan to establish that such plan meets the
purposes of this section. The Development Review Committee shall review such
plan and make a recommendation to the City Council. Any alternate proposal must
directly and proportionately benefit the development and must be approved by
City Council in conjunction with the preliminary plat.
   8.   Single-Family Residential Units: This section shall not apply to any
development application containing three or fewer single-family residential
units. A person making or filing a Development Application shall not divide
land into separate plats in order to seek a waiver under this provision. Where
a Development Application is made for multiple contiguous tracts within any two
years, the City may treat all the Development Applications as one for the
purposes of this section.
   9.   Horizontal Property Regime: No declaration of a condominium regime
under Chapter 499B of the Code of Iowa, nor any conversion of an apartment to a
condominium under said chapter shall be completed after the date of the
adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter unless the person or entity
filing the declaration shall have complied with the land dedication
requirements of this chapter.
   10.   Severability. If any subsection or provision of this section is held
invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect the
validity of any other provisions of this section which can be given effect
without the invalid portion or portions and to this end each subsection and
provision of this section is severable.
   11.   Appeal Procedure.
      A.   Notice of Appeal; Fee. Any person making or filing a Development
Application or any person, entity, or developer affected by any decision made
by any department acting under Section 170.06, may appeal to City Council by
filing notice of appeal with the City Clerk and a filing fee of $100.00 payable
to the City to be credited to the general fund of the City. Such appeal shall
be filed within 10 days from the decision of the department acting under this
chapter and shall set out in detail the reasons and grounds for the appeal. The
City Clerk shall forthwith transmit to the City Council all papers constituting
the record upon which the action appeal is taken. An appeal stays all
proceedings in furtherance of the appeal.
      B.   Public Hearing. The City Council shall upon the filing of an appeal
fix a reasonable time for a hearing, giving public notice thereof as well as
due notice to the parties in interest. All interested persons may offer oral or
written testimony at the public hearing on the appeal. A vote of three members
of the City Council may affirm, modify, or reverse any decision of the
Development Review Committee or any department acting under this chapter.
170.07 REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
   1.   The developer shall install and construct all public and private
improvements required by this chapter prior to Council approval of the final
plat except as may be provided for in Section
170.07(5). All required improvements shall be installed and constructed in
accordance with the approved specifications and under the supervision of the
City Council and to its satisfaction.
   2.   All improvements required to be installed pursuant to this chapter and
the approved construction drawings shall be installed prior to the issuance of
building permits for buildings or structures lying within the plan unless the
developer signs an Agreement to Complete covering the developer’s obligation to
complete all outstanding punch list items and has provided to the City Engineer
a performance bond, certified check or letter of credit to cover the cost of
completing such punch list items, provided the City Engineer determines none of
the outstanding punch list items negatively impacts the health, safety, or
welfare of builders and construction workers, future inhabits of the
subdivision, or the general public.
   3.   Plats of subdivision shall be improved by the developer to provide all
lots within the subdivision with adequate streets and access, public water
mains and fire hydrants, public sanitary sewers, storm sewers and other
drainage improvements, streets, sidewalks, recreational trails, parks and park
infrastructure, mailboxes, streetlights, street signs, and traffic control
signs, all to be designed and constructed by the developer as subdivision
improvements in full accordance with this chapter and particularly in
accordance with design standards set forth in Section
170.08.
   4.   A developer may be required to extend or expand existing off-site
public infrastructure as necessary to fully improve a proposed subdivision, or
the City Council may, at its sole discretion, require a proposed subdivision to
be delayed until such extension or expansion can be funded and constructed by
the City or other developer or governmental entity.
   5.   Developers shall provide for the perpetual maintenance of any and all
subdivision improvements that are not dedicated to the City or other
governmental entity, by establishing an owners’ association or other person,
whether an individual or individuals, in a manner and form that is acceptable
to the City. Such improvements may include but are not limited to stormwater
detention basins, ponds, bioswales, and infiltration basins; buffer yards,
landscaping, fencing or walls, and other screening; subdivision signs,
directional signs, traffic signs and pavement markings; and on-site lighting.
170.08 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   1.   General Requirements.
      A.   Subdivisions shall not endanger health, safety or general welfare of
the public or of persons residing or working on nearby properties, and shall
not impair an adequate supply of light and air to nearby properties.
      B.   Subdivisions shall be designed to locate and configure subdivision
improvements in a manner that will not unduly diminish or impair the use and
enjoyment of nearby properties. No subdivision shall be designed or improved in
a manner that impedes or appears to impede the development of nearby properties
that are within the City or the designated area of review.
      C.   Subdivisions and all subdivision improvements shall conform to the
Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Ordinance, Post-Construction Stormwater Management
regulations, and all other applicable City, State, and federal regulations.
      D.   Developers shall provide for the perpetual maintenance of any and
all subdivision improvements that are not dedicated to the City or other
governmental entity, by establishing an owners’ association or other person,
whether an individual or individuals, in a manner and form that is acceptable
to the City. Such improvements may include but are not limited to stormwater
detention and infiltration basins; buffer yards, landscaping, fencing or walls,
and other screening; subdivision signs, directional signs, traffic signs and
pavement markings; and on-site lighting. All such private improvement shall be
established within a permanent easement that defines maintenance
responsibilities for same.
      E.   Every subdivision shall be designed with regard for existing and
proposed topography and drainage patterns, by blending grading for the
subdivision smoothly into the land forms on adjoining properties; considering
and providing for drainage into and through the subdivision, both existing
conditions and at full development of the drainage basin; and by controlling
runoff.
         (1)   An attempt should be made to preserve mature upland forestation
and other natural vegetation and geological features, while recognizing that
the developer is required to substantially grade and contour a subdivision to
construct the required subdivision improvements and properly grade streets,
alleys, and lots to comply with this and other City codes and regulations, and
State and federal regulations, and recognizing that the probability of post-
development survival of trees and other existing vegetation may be greatly
diminished by such necessary site modifications and disturbances.
         (2)   Clear cutting shall not be permitted, particularly in areas
identified as agricultural reserve/open space or park/recreation on the
Comprehensive Plan, unless specifically approved by City Council and in
consideration of quality of species.
         (3)   Where preservation does not appear to be practical, subdivision
and development landscaping should select overstory tree species that will
create or reestablish the dominant tree species that would be native to the
environ when possible, or alternatively to create subdivision character that is
in keeping with the City as a whole, or that will uniquely identify the
subdivision.
         (4)   The timing of tree clearing operations shall be in compliance
with Iowa Department of Natural Resources regulations.
      F.   Subdivisions shall not create or perpetuate outlots that are
intended to prevent adjoining properties from having access to subdivision
improvements that are or will be dedicated to the City unless such outlot is
expressly approved by the City Council at the time of preliminary plat
approval.
      G.   Subdivisions and all subdivision improvements shall conform to the
Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Code, and all other applicable City and State
regulations.
      H.   Standard Specifications. All design and construction shall be in
accordance with the Statewide Urban Design and Specifications program (SUDAS).
The term “SUDAS” shall be interpreted to include both the SUDAS Design Manual
and the SUDAS Standard Specifications, each as current at the time the
preliminary plat was approved by City Council, including any amendments
approved by the City. Where any conflict exists between SUDAS and the design
standards prescribed by this chapter, the requirements of this chapter shall
govern. The preferred design alternative should be used whenever possible; in
certain unique cases, the City Engineer may allow the acceptable design
alternative to be used based upon justification provided by the developer’s
engineer.
   2.   Site Suitability.
      A.   Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used
safely for building purposes without danger to health or peril from fire, flood
or other menace, and shall not be subdivided until showing can be made that
those public utilities and improvements will be provided as required by this
chapter and/or other applicable ordinances of the City, and proper provision
has been made for drainage, water, sewage, transportation facilities and other
improvements, to the greatest extent possible, attention shall be directed to
the prevention of pollution of air, water, including streams, ponds, and
subsurface water aquifers.
      B.   Areas along major drainage ways and/or areas having steep or
unstable embankments shall be required to provide easements of sufficient size
to allow for slopes to be laid back at a 4:1 slope should regrading be required
in the future, unless such requirement is waived by the City Engineer.
      C.   Land which the City finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or
development due to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formations,
adverse earth formations or topography, utility easements, or other features
which will reasonably be harmful to the health, safety and general welfare of
the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision, surrounding areas, or
both, shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are
formulated by the developer and approved by City Council, upon recommendation
of the Planning and Zoning Commission to solve the problems created by the
unsuitable land conditions.
      D.   Soil tests and geotechnical report are required in accordance with
Section
170.11, Subsection 1(E); to ascertain whether expansive soils or other
conditions exist that may affect the suitability and design of the subdivision
and subdivision improvements.
   3.   Blocks.
      A.   No block shall be longer than 1,320 feet, measured from street
centerline to street centerline.
      B.   At street intersections, block corners shall be rounded with a
radius of not less than 25 feet as measured at the right-of-way line. However,
the right-of-way radii at intersections involving one or more arterial street
shall require special design as consideration and approval by the City
Engineer.
   4.   Lots.
      A.   Minimum lot dimensions and size shall conform to the requirements of
the Zoning Code for the applicable zoning district.
      B.   A subdivision may establish setback lines that are greater than the
minimum requirements of the Zoning Code or other City requirements for any or
all lots. By so drawing or designating such setback lines on the plat, such
setback lines shall thereafter be the minimum setback requirements for said
lots.
      C.   Setback lines shall parallel the street right-of-way. Minimum lot
widths and frontage shall be measured parallel or radial to the right-of-way
line respectively for straight or curved segments.
      D.   Side lot lines shall be at right angles to the street right-of-way,
or radial to the street right-of-way on curved streets.
      E.   Minimum street frontage. All lots shall front onto a street and
obtain vehicular access from a street. Lots that front onto a public street
shall have the minimum street frontage required by the Zoning Code, including
lots that front on cul-de-sac turnarounds.
      F.   Corner lots. All corner lots shall have a minimum width of 20 feet
greater than the minimum lot width required by the Zoning Code in order to
permit adequate building setbacks on both front and side streets.
      G.   Double Frontage Lots. Double frontage lots shall be prohibited,
except where such lots back onto a major thoroughfare or highway or in the case
of large commercial or industrial lots. Such double frontage lots shall have a
20’ wide landscape buffer easement adjoining the rear street frontage. The
building setback shall be measured from the boundary of landscape buffer
easement.
      H.   Flag Lots. The division of land into a flag lot or lots shall
generally be discouraged by the City; and only permitted to provide access to
lots where there exists unique topography, an unusual configuration of land
ownership, adjoining developed land will not allow access from a public street,
public land or environmentally sensitive land that is planned to be left
undisturbed, or to minimize streets or public infrastructure to reduce
maintenance responsibilities. Flag lots shall be permitted only when
specifically approved by City Council.
      I.   Buffers. Buffers and improvements thereto shall be provided by the
developer in accordance with the minimum requirements of the Zoning Code, or
such additional requirements that the City Council may stipulate as a condition
of approval of a plat. All fences, berms and buffer yard plantings and
improvements shall conform to the Zoning Code.
      J.   Lot Size where Public Services Are Not Available. For the purpose of
complying with minimum health standards, lots which cannot be reasonably served
by an off-site public or common sanitary sewer system shall have a minimum
width of 125 feet measured at the front yard setback line and an area of not
less than 40,000 square feet. Lots shall be a minimum of 10 acres where there
is proposed an on-site well for potable water and on-site sewage disposal is
proposed.
      K.   Building Envelope. Every lot, with the exception of townhome lots,
shall have at least 2,000 square feet of contiguous area, hereinafter referred
to as the “building envelope”, of a shape sufficient to hold a principal
building unless otherwise approved on a Planned Unit Development Master Plan.
The building envelope shall be exclusive of setbacks, floodway, and easements
and shall be shown on the preliminary plat.
   5.   Grading and Seeding.
      A.   The developer and/or his contractors shall be responsible for
obtaining approval of a grading permit from the City prior to commencing any
tree removal or grading operations. All tree removal and grading shall be in
conformance with the requirements of SUDAS, tree ordinance, grading ordinance,
and this chapter.
      B.   During grading operations, existing topsoil shall be stripped and
stockpiled on site. No topsoil shall be removed from the property without prior
approval of the City Council. A minimum of four inches of topsoil shall be
spread across the entire subdivision, exclusive of streets and wet-bottom
detention basins or ponds unless the geotechnical report clearly demonstrates
there is insufficient existing topsoil on site; in which case the developer
shall develop a mitigation plan for review by the City Engineer and approval by
City Council in conjunction with the Construction Drawings. The developer shall
provide verification of compliance with topsoil requirements.
      C.   All lots in subdivisions shall be graded to be entirely one foot or
more above the base flood elevation as determined by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) for a regulatory flood having a one percent or less
chance of occurring in any one year, or any such higher standard that may
hereafter be adopted by FEMA, and to allow basements that will be not less than
one foot above the base flood elevation of the regulatory flood to be included
in single-family detached residential and any and all other development that
customarily is constructed with basements or other low enclosed building areas,
on all lots. The developer shall cause minimum floor elevations (MFE) that are
fully compliant with City and FEMA regulations to be noted on the final plat,
or an engineer’s exhibit attached to the final plat, and the final plat shall
state that the property owner is responsible for maintaining their lot in
perpetual compliance with said minimum floor elevations (MFE).
      D.   When a portion of a proposed lot lies less than one foot above the
FEMA-established base flood elevation, said area shall be designated as an
unbuildable outlot and perpetually tied to the adjoining buildable lot by a
record of lot tie agreement that shall be recorded with the final plat.
      E.   Minimum opening elevation (MOE) requirements are intended to protect
property only from localized storm runoff, detention basins and ponds, or
shallow flooding, and shall not be allowed or construed to satisfy or comply
with FEMA requirements or City code requirements and intent to protect persons
and property from the dangers and adverse effects of flooding, regardless of
whether a LOMR-F has been obtained for a property. MOE requirements shall be
construed to apply to an entire lot and all portions of every building unless
an exception is expressly noted and approved with whatever conditions and
limitations that are deemed appropriate for any such exception, including, but
not limited to, a case where MOE protection is necessary for surface water
flowage or stormwater management that is contained within a public easement on
a portion of a lot, and does not affect the entire lot. The developer shall
cause minimum opening elevations (MOE) to be noted on the final plat, or an
engineer’s exhibit recorded with the final plat, and the final plat shall state
that the property owner is responsible for maintaining their lot in perpetual
compliance with said minimum opening elevations (MOE).
      F.   No cut trees, timber, debris, contaminated soil, waste concrete,
junk, rubbish, sewage, garbage, or food waste shall be buried, or left
deposited on any private or public lot or outlot at the time the public
improvements are accepted. Debris and soil deposited on existing public streets
during construction shall be removed by the developer before the end of each
work day.
      G.   As soon as practicable following completion of grading, the entire
site shall be seeded with an erosion control seed mixture in accordance with
SUDAS.
   However, areas designated for parks or similar areas that will be owned by
the City or under common ownership by an Owners Association shall be seeded
with a permanent lawn mixture. Detention basins and ponds shall be seeded with
a permanent seed mixture that is deemed suitable to wet conditions by the City
Engineer.
   6.   Streets.
      A.   The street layout in proposed plats and subdivisions shall conform
to the Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Regulations.
      B.   General. Streets shall be platted with appropriate regard for
topography, creeks, wooded areas, and other natural features which would lend
themselves to attractive treatment whenever possible.
      C.   Connectivity. Public streets in all subdivisions shall be designed
and configured to provide connectivity between adjoining properties and
subdivisions to facilitate access and circulation within neighborhoods; to be
in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan and Complete Streets Policy; and to
thereby minimize and reduce traffic congestion, improve the efficiency of
providing municipal services and enhance public health, safety and welfare
together with protecting and increasing property values. Subdivisions of large
parcels shall be designed and phased accordingly, to establish such
connectivity at the earliest reasonable date.
      D.   Functional Classification. The City Engineer shall have the sole
authority to establish the municipal functional classification of a street as a
major arterial, minor arterial, collector or local street for the purposes of
this code. The municipal functional classification may deviate from the federal
functional classification for the same street.
      E.   Right-of-Way. All new street rights-of-way shall be conveyed by
warranty deed and without any conditions or limitations, in accordance with the
following:
         (1)   Major arterial street rights-of-way shall be designed to have a
total minimum right-of-way width of 120 feet, or wider if so required by the
City Engineer or City Council, and subdivisions on each side of the centerlines
thereof shall dedicate one-half of such width;
         (2)   Minor arterial street rights-of-way shall be designed to have a
total minimum right-of-way width of 100 feet, or wider if so required by the
City Engineer or City Council;
         (3)   Parkways shall be designed to include a continuous 15 feet wide
parkway easement on both sides of the parkway.
         (4)   Collector street rights-of-way for residential subdivisions
shall be designed to have a total minimum right-of-way width of 70 feet, and
collector street rights-of-way for nonresidential subdivisions shall be
designed to have a total minimum right-of-way width of 80 feet, or wider if so
required by the City Engineer or City Council.
         (5)   Local street rights-of-way for residential subdivisions shall be
designed to have a total minimum right-of-way width of 60 feet, and local
street rights-of-way for nonresidential subdivisions shall be designed to have
a total minimum right-of-way width of 70 feet, or wider if so required by the
City Engineer or City Council.
         (6)   Additional street rights-of-way widths may be required to be
dedicated at the intersections of streets and access points, in order to
accommodate turn lanes and sidewalks within the rights-of-way.
         (7)   Additional street rights-of-way widths may be required to
accommodate alternative forms of transportation, including but not limited to
pedestrians and bicycles, in accordance with the City’s Complete Streets
Policy.
   The foregoing street rights-of-way widths may be amended if previously
approved by the City on a Master Plan or Planned Unit Development (PUD) plan.
      F.   Costs; Responsibilities. Developers shall be fully responsible for
the following costs related to street improvements, all of which shall be
designed and constructed in accordance with SUDAS:
         (1)   The entire cost of providing and installing all collector and
local streets within a subdivision.
         (2)   A portion of the cost of improving any existing, unimproved
granular street, or any existing substandard or non-conforming street, that
abuts the proposed subdivision. The developer’s cost share shall be 50 percent
of the cost of the street improvement project up to a maximum width of 15.5
feet of P.C.C. pavement, along with associated storm sewers grading and
engineering, and shall be based on a cost opinion prepared by the City Engineer
for design and reconstruction of the existing street to meet City standards. If
the City Engineer determines it is impractical for the developer to pave said
abutting, unimproved street as a subdivision improvement, generally based on
the status of development on the opposite side of the unimproved street, the
City shall require the developer to provide a Subdivision Bond, a cash payment
to the City to be held in escrow for future paving of the unimproved street, or
similar security as may be approved by the City Attorney to cover the
developer’s responsibility for paving of the unimproved street.
         (3)   The cost for providing and installing turn lanes, street
widening, medians, traffic signals and similar traffic and transportation
improvements based on a Traffic Impact Study if required for the subdivision in
accordance with Section
170.08, Subsection 6(X) and other issues as may be determined by the City
Manager.
         (4)   The cost of planting street trees at approximately 40 feet on
center on each side of the street on all designated parkways.
      G.   Continuation of Existing and Planned Streets. Subdivisions shall be
designed to provide for the continuation of existing and planned public
streets, and those in valid preliminary plats, in whatever manner is deemed
appropriate by the City Engineer. Streets shall be designed and configured to
conveniently channel local traffic onto collector and arterial streets and to
discourage through traffic, being that which does not have an origin or
destination within the subdivision or nearby area, from utilizing collector or
local streets as a means of traveling from arterial street to arterial street.
      H.   Intersections. Street intersections shall be in conformance with
SUDAS and shall be at right angles wherever possible and not less than a 90-
degree angle or shall be in conformance with SUDAS requirements if said
requirements are more restrictive. The minimum offset between street
intersections shall be in conformance with SUDAS.
      I.   Improvement and Dedication. Streets shall be so located and designed
as to be improved and dedicated to the full rights-of-way and roadway widths as
required by this code. No street shall be designed or accepted for half-width
paving or right-of-way dedication.
      J.   Limited Access to Arterial and Collector Streets.
         (1)   Streets and other vehicular accesses shall be designed to
intersect or otherwise connect to arterial streets at points measuring not less
than a nominal minimum distance of 600 feet between full movement accesses and
of 300 feet between any access and right-turn only or other limited-movement
accesses to said arterial street; provided that access shall be in conformance
with SUDAS requirements if they are more restrictive.
         (2)   Single-family lots in plats of subdivision shall not be allowed
to have driveway access to an arterial street, except where no other streets
are reasonably available to provide access and subject to the locations of any
such accesses being shown on the plat and approved by the City Council. Such
access restriction shall be noted on the final plat.
         (3)   The final plat shall restrict access to corner lots and double-
frontage lots to the lower-order street unless otherwise approved by City
Council.
      K.   Turn Lanes and Traffic-Control Devices.
         (1)   Right and left turn lanes shall be provided at all points that
provide or are intended to provide access to an arterial street from existing
or proposed nonresidential or multi-family residential development, unless such
requirement is waived by the City Engineer. The City Engineer may require right
and left turn lanes to be provided for access to a collector street based on
the design of the subdivision or neighborhood and expected traffic volumes.
         (2)   The City Engineer may require traffic signalization or other
traffic control devices to be included in the subdivision improvements for any
plat of subdivision if zoned or planned for nonresidential or multi-family
development.
      L.   Shared access and alignment. Streets and other vehicular accesses
shall be designed to align with existing or proposed, approved streets and
other vehicular access points on the opposing frontage of arterial and
collector streets. Cross-access easements shall be provided, in whatever
configuration, dimension, and manner that the City Engineer deems necessary and
appropriate, to allow and facilitate the sharing of access to public streets by
multiple properties, whether the properties are within or outside of the
subdivision boundaries, in order to reduce traffic conflicts and congestion,
and improve safety.
      M.   Culs-De-Sac.
         (1)   Culs-de-sac shall not exceed a length of 600 feet as measured
from the centerline of the intersecting street to the center of the turnaround,
and shall not serve more than 30 dwelling units, unless a longer length or
larger numbers of units is approved by the City Council, upon recommendation of
the City Manager and Fire Chief, in accordance with Section
170.14 of this chapter.
         (2)   Only two cul-de-sacs are allowed per 40 acres, with exceptions
granted administratively of up to three culs-de-sac per 40 acres based on the
topography.
         (3)   Land uses generating a maximum of 300 average daily trips
(“ADT”) or a maximum of 30 single-family detached dwelling units will be
permitted access to a cul-de-sac street without a second means of access.
Traffic generation will be based upon trip generation in accordance with the
Institute of Traffic Engineers. Land uses exceeding said maximums shall have
secondary access unless otherwise approved by City Council in accordance with
Section
170.14 of this chapter.
         (4)   A permanent turn around shall be provided at the end of each
cul-de-sac in accordance with SUDAS, except that the minimum cul-de-sac radii
shall be 45 feet as measured at the back of curb of the roadway and 62 feet as
measured at the street right-of-way. Permanent dead-end street other than culs-
de-sac are prohibited, and no lots shall take their access from a dead-end
street other than a cul-de-sac, permanent or temporary, unless waived by City
Engineer or if driveway access is restricted. Hammerheads shall not be
considered an acceptable alternative to a cul-de-sac.
         (5)   “Eyebrow” Culs-de-sac. A cul-de-sac bulb used at an “L-shaped”
intersection in the street shall be discouraged, and only permitted to improve
access to lots at the “eyebrow” cul-de-sac intersection due to the unique
topography of the area, unusual configuration of land ownership, or existing
adjoining developed land will not allow access from a through street or
traditional cul-de-sac, or the existence of public land or environmentally
sensitive land that is planned to be left undisturbed. The “eyebrow cul-de-sac”
at an intersection shall be designed with dimensions, radii and curve standards
as used for culs-de-sac with the center of the cul-de-sac bulb located at the
intersection of the street centerlines and shall have a minimum radius of 50
feet as measured at the back of curb of the roadway and 65 feet as measured at
the street right-of-way.
         (6)   Temporary Culs-de-sac. Streets that are temporary dead-end
streets shall be provided with a turnaround having a cul-de-sac with radii no
less than 40 feet and of a design that is satisfactory to the City Engineer. A
gravel turnaround shall be considered acceptable if the temporary dead-end
street is part of a larger subdivision by the same developer, provided the
street is extended within two years and provided the developer maintains the
gravel turnaround in a manner that is acceptable to the City Engineer until
such time as the street is extended. Hammerheads shall not be considered an
acceptable alternative to a cul-de-sac unless specifically approved by City
Engineer for short-term applications only.
      N.   Access to Bi-attached or Townhomes From Public Streets. Any
subdivision designed to accommodate townhomes and bi-attached homes shall
provide driveways off private streets rather than public streets whenever
possible. In unique cases, the City may approve driveway access for bi-attached
dwellings or townhomes off a public street provided the driveway approaches
with public right-of-way are spaced no closer than 80 feet on center. Shared
driveways may be required to achieve said driveway approach spacing.
      O.   Secondary Access Required. Land uses generating more than 300
average daily trips or more than 30 single-family detached dwelling units shall
have a secondary means of access to the lots, unless otherwise approved on a
valid preliminary plat. Traffic generation will be based on actual traffic
counts or upon trip generation in accordance with the Institute of Traffic
Engineers.

accordance with SUDAS, based on the functional classification of the roadway as
determined by the City Engineer or unless otherwise approved by the City on a
Planned Unit Development (PUD) Master Plan.
      Q.   Pavement and Subbase Material. All proposed public streets shall be
paved with Portland cement concrete (PCC) and shall have six-inch integral curb
and gutter, unless an alternative paving material or design is approved by the
City Council in accordance with Section
170.14 of this chapter. All streets shall be continuously reinforced pavement
in accordance with the City’s standard details as may be provided by the City
Engineer. Pavement thickness shall be per SUDAS, based on the municipal
functional classification of an equivalent street as determined by the City
Engineer. The City Engineer may require the developer’s engineer to complete a
pavement thickness design per SUDAS to determine required thickness of
materials, subdrain requirements, and other design parameters based on a 50-
year analysis period.
      R.   Extension to Plat Boundary. All public streets shall be extended to
the plat boundary unless otherwise specifically approved by City Council upon
recommendation by the City Engineer. In such unique cases, the responsibility
for future extension of the public street may be addressed though a Development
Agreement approved by City Council.
      S.   Private Streets. Unless otherwise approved by City Council, private
streets serving commercial uses shall be a minimum of 24 feet wide unless the
City Engineer determines greater width is necessary due to expected traffic
volume or truck traffic. Private streets serving residential uses shall be in
conformance with Zoning Code. Pavement thickness shall be per SUDAS, based on
the functional classification of an equivalent street as determined by the City
Engineer. All public utilities shall be located outside the pavement unless
otherwise approved by the City Engineer and the easement for said public
utilities specifies the City shall not be responsible for removal and/or
replacement of the street pavement should utility repair, replacement,
upsizing, or similar work be deemed necessary by the City.

         (2)   Cul-de-sacs shall bear the same name as the entering street and
shall be designated as “Circle.”
         (3)   Streets running in a predominantly north/south direction shall
be numbered according to the City’s address grid.
         (4)   All street names shall have a directional prefix based on the
City’s address grid.
         (5)   Private streets shall be designated as “Way.”
      U.   Half Streets. Dedication of half streets will not be permitted.
Where there exists a dedicated or platted half street or alley adjacent to the
property to be subdivided, the other half shall be platted if deemed necessary
by the Council.
      V.   Alleys. Alleys may be permitted in commercial areas provided the
alley is privately owned and maintained. Alleys may be permitted in residential
areas to provide access to the rear of the lots where said lot also has
frontage on a public street. Alleys serving multiple properties shall be
maintained by a property owners or property owners association. Dead-end alleys
shall be provided with a means of turning around at the end of the alley.
Public utilities shall not be located within an alley.
      W.   Driveways. Driveways for single-family residential uses shall not be
permitted to access arterial streets or, to the extent possible, collector
streets. Such access restrictions shall be noted on the final plat.
      X.   Traffic Impact Study. A Traffic Impact Study shall be required when
a proposed subdivision will generate 100 or more added (new) trips during the
adjacent roadway’s peak hour or at the development’s peak hour. The developer
will be responsible for completing an application for traffic analysis
including the preliminary plat or detailed concept plan; building locations,
types, quantity, and land use; and all proposed access locations; and peak hour
trips in accordance with Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) standards.
The Traffic Impact Study, when required, will be completed by the City
Engineer. The developer will be responsible for the entire cost of said Traffic
Impact Study, with these costs paid in full prior to any work being commenced
on the study in accordance with Section
170.13. The City Engineer has the authority to waive the requirement for a
Traffic Impact Study if deemed appropriate.
   7.   Water Mains.
      A.   Water mains shall be a minimum of eight inches in diameter, or
larger if increased size is determined to be necessary to provide domestic and
fire flows as determined to be satisfactory and necessary by the City Engineer.

      D.   Fire hydrants shall be provided in the number and locations required
by the City Engineer, in consultation with the Fire Department, and shall be
supplied with appropriate connections as may be specified by the Fire
Department. Fire hydrant coverage shall be in conformance with City fire code
or SUDAS, whichever is more restrictive. The City Engineer may approve
adjustment to building setback lines on the preliminary and final plats to
ensure adequate hydrant coverage is provided to the buildable areas of the
lots. Water mains shall be located within public right-of-way wherever
possible. If the City allows a fire hydrant to be located on private property,
the developer shall provide paved access to said hydrant, with pavement
designed to support fire trucks and including a turn-around as approved by the
Fire Chief.
      E.   Fire hydrants shall be located at least two feet outside all
sidewalks and trails, whether existing, proposed, or future; or at a minimum

      H.   For subdivisions that cannot reasonably be served by a public water
system, a private water system shall be installed to meet City standards,
including provision of fire flows and construction observation, and an
agreement shall be executed and recorded providing for conveyance of the water
system to the City without cost upon annexation. All such private facilities
shall be restricted to personal household and agricultural uses, and shall be
subject to approval by Polk County Board of Health or to certification by an
independent professional engineer and qualified testing laboratory if not
subject to County regulation or if the County lacks the ability to perform the
necessary testing and approval of the facility’s design and construction.
   8.   Sanitary Sewers.
      A.   Sanitary sewers shall be a minimum of eight inches in diameter, or
larger if increased size is determined to be necessary to serve the entire
service area as determined by the City Engineer. Developers shall be fully
responsible for the costs of all sanitary sewers that are 8 inches or less in
diameter, however developers shall not be responsible for the cost of upsizing
the sanitary sewer to a larger pipe unless the larger pipe is needed to serve
the developer’s subdivision or property. The cost of the sanitary sewer shall
include the pipe and bedding, together with all structures and other
appurtenances thereto, and as may be otherwise required to be in full
accordance with the requirements of SUDAS and applicable City codes.
      B.   Sanitary sewer service lines shall be extended to each lot. The
minimum size for a sanitary sewer service line serving a single-family dwelling
shall be four inches and shall terminate 10 feet inside the lot. Duplexes, bi-
attached, and townhomes shall have a separate sanitary sewer service line to
each dwelling unit. No lot shall have more than one service line, whether or
not in actual use, unless expressly approved by the City Engineer.

to the surface elevation of the ground at that location.
      G.   Sanitary sewer manhole castings shall be located at least one foot
outside all sidewalks and trails, whether existing, proposed, or future.
      H.   Where sanitary sewer services are added to an existing sanitary
sewer line or when a new manhole is constructed on top of an existing sanitary
sewer line, the developer shall be responsible for re-testing the existing line
following construction.
      I.   Extension to boundary. Sanitary sewers and appurtenances thereto
shall be extended to the boundary of the plat of subdivision where necessary to
accommodate future extensions as determined by the City Engineer.
      J.   Subdivisions within corporate limits shall be connected to the
City’s sanitary sewer system. Subdivisions without sanitary sewer service shall
only be permitted by special approval of City Council and shall require
construction of dry sanitary sewers within a 50-foot wide easement or provision
of a 100-foot wide easement for construction and maintenance of future sanitary
sewers.
      K.   For subdivisions outside corporate limits that cannot reasonably be
served by a public sanitary sewer system, dry sanitary sewers shall be
installed to meet City standards, and an agreement shall be executed and
recorded providing for conveyance of the sanitary sewer system to the City
without cost upon annexation. The sanitary sewer easement for such dry sewers
shall be 50 feet wide, minimum. In certain unique cases, City Council may waive
the requirement for dry sewers provided a sanitary sewer easement not less than
100 feet wide shall be provided to allow for construction and maintenance of
future sanitary sewers.
   9.   Storm Sewers and Drainage.
      A.   Stormwater Management Plan. A stormwater management plan, prepared
and certified by the developer’s engineer, shall be provided for review and
approval by the City Engineer. Such plan shall be in conformance with SUDAS and
municipal code including but not limited to the tree ordinance, floodplain
management ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, grade ordinance, and
this chapter.
      B.   Developers shall be fully responsible for the cost of all storm
sewers, structures, and appurtenances thereto, drainage ways and other surface
water flows, and stormwater detention facilities; all of which shall be
designed and constructed in accordance with SUDAS and applicable City codes.
Sump pump collector lines conveying no surface drainage shall be eight inches
minimum in size and shall contain clean-outs set in a 12-inch x 12-inch
concrete pad.
      C.   All curb intakes, storm sewer cross runs, structures, and manholes
shall include placement and compaction of a layer of special backfill. For curb
intakes, the layer of special backfill shall be placed from one-half foot below
the finished grade elevation, measured behind the curb, to a depth of three and
one-half feet. This layer shall be two feet in width installed on all sides of
intake outside of pavement. For area intakes and manholes, the layer of special
backfill shall be placed from the finished grade elevation to a depth of three
feet. This layer shall be two feet in width installed on all sides of the
structure. For storm sewer cross runs, the layer of special backfill shall be
placed from the bottom of subgrade to a depth of three feet. This layer shall
be two feet wide on each side of the pipe’s outside diameter.
      D.   Storm sewer manhole and intake castings shall be located at least
one foot outside all sidewalks and trails, whether existing, proposed, or
future.
      E.   Subdrains shall be provided along both sides of all public streets
unless waived by the City Engineer and approved by the Public Works Director.
Open jointed storm sewers may be considered as an alternative to subdrains if
approved by the City Engineer.
      F.   In areas where the longitudinal slope of the proposed roadway meets
or exceeds 6.0 percent, flowable mortar cutoff walls per SUDAS Figure 7040.105
are required located at a spacing not to exceed 150 feet. Lateral subdrains
will be continued longitudinally along pavement to the nearest intake or
approved free outlet.
      G.   All lots that are zoned or planned for single-family residential
development shall be provided with a storm sewer service line that is capable
of collecting and conveying footing drain discharges to an appropriate outlet.
Open discharge of footing drains shall not be permitted unless specifically
approved by the City Engineer and only if an acceptable drainage way with
overland flowage easement is available on the same lot.
      H.   The end of all storm sewer service lines shall be marked with a wood
2x4, set at the flowline elevation at the end of the pipe and extending up to
the surface elevation of the ground at that location.
      I.   Provisions for large storm events. Provisions shall be made and
maintained for surface passage of runoff from storms that exceed the design
capacity of the storm sewer system, without causing flooding or damage to
public streets or nearby properties. Surface water flowage easements shall be
provided over any and all such areas of flow that convey any off-site runoff
through a lot, of sufficient dimensions to cover the runoff resulting from a
storm having a one percent chance of occurrence in any single year, as defined
by SUDAS.
      J.   Detention. Stormwater detention shall be calculated and provided in
accordance with SUDAS.
         (1)   Whenever possible, stormwater detention shall be accommodated in
regional basins serving multiple parcels of land rather than individual lots;
and shall be constructed as a subdivision improvement whenever possible rather
than being deferred as a future site improvement.
         (2)   Stormwater detention facilities shall be privately owned and
maintained. However, in certain unique circumstances with demonstrated
recreational needs, the City Council may consider taking ownership of a
detention facility or pond. In such unique cases, the developer shall sign an
Agreement to Complete with appropriate security that obligates the developer to
certify the grading of said facility or pond is complete at the time the
subdivision is 80 percent developed, with the timing of said certification to
be as determined by the City Engineer. This Agreement shall specifically
require the developer to remove accumulated silt and sediment as may be
necessary to demonstrate the as-built conditions correspond to the approved
design in accordance with the approved Construction Drawings.
         (3)   Stormwater detention shall not be located within a Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) designated one percent floodplain. Unless
otherwise approved by the City Engineer, stormwater detention shall be located
adjacent to, rather than within natural drainageways. Storm detention shall not
be located within minimum required buffer yards or landscape setbacks unless
the detention is located within a subsurface structure of sufficient depth
below the surface to allow required landscaping to be planted and maintained
over such buried detention.
         (4)   Low flows shall be piped through detention basins whenever
possible, and a paved trickle channel shall be provided to convey the low flows
if piping is not practical, to facilitate maintenance of the basin unless the
basin is expressly designed to facilitate the absorption or infiltration of
runoff storm detention.
         (5)   The high water level, based on a 100-year storm event, shall be
noted on the preliminary plat and construction drawings. Easement area shall be
based on one foot of freeboard above said high water level. Wet-bottom
detention ponds shall have a 10 feet wide easement area around the perimeter of
the pond to allow full access for maintenance and repair purposes. All
easements shall connect to the public right-of-way.
         (6)   Staged outlet control of detention basins shall be required to
insure discharge is restricted during both five-year and 100-year rainfall
events.
      K.   Lot Drainage. Drainage swales shall be developed as necessary to
ensure positive drainage away from each lot; such required drainage swales
shall be preserved by an overland flowage easement. Vegetated areas shall have
a two percent minimum slope to maintain positive drainage throughout each lot
and the subdivision as a whole. Subsurface drainage shall be provided in such
locations and manner as may be required by the City Engineer, which may include
but is not limited to the rear lot lines of any or all lots.
      L.   Erosion Control. Erosion control improvements shall be installed in
and along all surface drainage channels to reduce flow velocities and protect
channel bottoms and banks from scouring and cutting, and at storm sewer
outfalls and discharge points, in whatever matter and extent that the City
Engineer finds necessary to prevent channel and sheet erosion to a reasonable
extent. Such improvements may include, but are not limited to, drop structures,
stilling basins, check dams, placement of rip-rap and weirs.
      M.   Off-Site Discharge. If it is necessary to discharge a concentration
of surface runoff onto an adjoining property, provisions shall be made to
dissipate the erosive energy from said concentration of runoff and to maintain
the general drainage pattern as it existed prior to construction of the
subdivision improvements. It shall be the developer’s responsibility to acquire
permanent easements from the adjoining property owner.
      N.   Extension to Boundary. Storm sewers and appurtenances thereto shall
be extended to the boundary of the plat of subdivision where necessary for
collecting and/or discharging runoff as determined by the City Engineer.
   10.   Franchise Utilities. All public utility lines and appurtenances
thereto; including, but not limited to, electrical, gas, and telecommunication
lines; shall be buried underground within public utility easements provided for
said public utilities in accordance with City code. The developer shall be
responsible for making the necessary arrangements with each of the serving
utilities to comply with this requirement, including payment of any
construction or installation charges or fees by any utility company.
   11.   Sidewalks. Public sidewalks with a minimum width of five feet are
required along the frontages of all public streets and along both sides of all
common private access drives, unless alternative routing such as a rear lot
walkway or open space trail system is approved by the City Council on a valid
preliminary plat. The developer shall be responsible for constructing two ADA-
compliant ramps and the common square at each corner of all intersections,
unless otherwise specifically approved on the preliminary plat. The developer
shall be responsible for constructing all sidewalks within the subdivision that
do not front on a buildable lot as a plat improvement. The developer shall be
responsible for constructing sidewalks across drainage swales or flow paths
where a depressed sidewalk is required to maintain unobstructed flowage. The
developer shall be responsible for constructing public sidewalks along arterial
streets and parkways as a subdivision improvement. A sidewalk performance bond
shall be posted for all sidewalks not constructed with the subdivision.
   12.   Recreational Trails.
      A.   Where access to a regional or municipal trail is reasonably
available, the developer shall be responsible for installing a 10-foot wide PCC
trail connector from the public sidewalks within the subdivision to the
regional or municipal trail as a subdivision improvement. The trail connector
shall be located in a minimum 20 feet wide lot that is dedicated to the City.
      B.   Where a recreational trail is designated along an arterial or
collector street in front of any multiple-family residential, commercial or
industrial lot, the developer shall be responsible for paving the 10’ wide PCC
trail along said lots, along with associated ADA-compliant ramps at designated
crosswalks.
      C.   In accordance with the Comprehensive Plan or other applicable plan,
all required recreational trails shall be paved to a minimum width of 10 feet
when located within a park or open space corridor, or a width of 10 feet when

constructed of PCC unless an alternative material is approved by the City
Engineer. Base preparation and all other construction specifications shall be
fully compliant with SUDAS.
      D.   Costs; Responsibilities. When paving of a recreational trail is not
the responsibility of the developer, the developer shall grade a platform to
accommodate future trail construction. When recreational trails are constructed
by the developer as a subdivision improvement, the developer shall be
responsible for all construction costs. In certain unique circumstances, the
City Council may agree to allow the construction of the trail to be deferred
until a building permit is issued for specific lots, the requirement for the
property owner of said lots to pave the recreational trail shall be noted on
the final plat, including specifications for the type, width, and thickness of
pavement.
   13.   Cluster Mailboxes. All lots in all subdivisions shall be served by a
cluster box unit (“CBU”); private mailboxes serving individual lots shall not
be permitted in new subdivisions. The developer shall be responsible for paving
an ADA compliant Portland Cement Concrete pad and the accessory four feet wide
sidewalk that connects to the public sidewalk system and curb. The developer
shall be responsible for making the necessary arrangements with the United
States Postal Service, including but not limited to obtaining approval from the

associated sidewalks as a subdivision improvement.
   14.   Street Lights. The developer shall cause plans and specifications to
be prepared for street lighting on all new public streets within the
subdivision, for approval by the City Engineer and MidAmerican Energy or
Midland Cooperative and their successors in interest. Upon approval of said
plans and specifications, the developer shall cause the lights to be installed
in accordance with said plans and specifications, as part of the required
subdivision improvements along all streets in the subdivision, all in
accordance with City street lighting policies, SUDAS, and the Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). Street lights shall be designed to prioritize
lighting of intersections, turn lanes, and major access points, including park
and school entrances and shall not be more than 300 feet apart. Wooden poles
and overhead wiring shall be prohibited.
   15.   Street and Traffic Control Signs and Markings. Street name signs;
traffic-control signs including but not limited to speed limit signs, stop
signs, and no parking signs; and pavement markings are the responsibility of
the developer as subdivision improvements and shall be designed and shown on
all construction documents. Said improvements shall be provided at all new
intersections within and bordering the subdivision, and traffic control signs
and pavement markings including parking prohibitions and restrictions shall be
installed and provided along all streets in the subdivision, all in accordance
with SUDAS and the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). Street
name signs and traffic control signs shall be installed by the City and shall
be reimbursed by the developer to the City prior to acceptance of the public
improvements.
   16.   Easements. Easements shall be provided for all subdivision
improvements that serve or benefit more than one property owner, to enable
access to, use of, service from or by, operation, maintenance and any and all
other benefits that may be obtained from or provided by such improvements.
Subdivision improvements for which easements shall be provided include but are
not limited to those improvements that are to be dedicated to the City, other
governmental entity, or an owners’ association. Easements for improvements
being dedicated to the City shall be dedicated by legal instrument on the

structures shall be located in a separate storm sewer easement. In cases where
the responsible parties fail to perform necessary maintenance as required by
the City, the stormwater detention easement shall allow the City to make any
necessary repairs or maintenance and assess the responsible parties for such
work. Where a detention basin is maintained by multiple lots or parcels, said
assessment shall be prorated to all responsible property owners by the City
Engineer based on the area and use of each the lot or parcels, whether or not
the shared maintenance responsibilities are under the control of an owners’
association, unless otherwise stipulated in the easement document. The

expenditure of City funds within any part of the subdivision.
      B.   The surety shall be provided in the form of a performance or
subdivision bond, letter of credit, cash escrow held in City trust account or
other collateral that is acceptable to City Attorney and approved by the City
Council, and shall be of an amount that the City Engineer determines to be
necessary and sufficient to cover all of the City’s costs for constructing the
uncompleted subdivision improvements, including inspections and tests that
customarily would be conducted by the City, at some future date.
      C.   The surety shall remain in full force and effect until the
subdivision improvements have been completed to the satisfaction of the City
Engineer, and have been accepted by the City Council, provided that surety may
be called by the City for any subdivision improvements that have not been
completed within six years after the date of City Council approval of a final
plat without any further finding beyond the factual passing of such date, and
further provided that surety that is not called at such time shall not be
deemed to have been released or voided. Maintenance bonds for completed work
shall be provided in accordance with Subsection 5 of this section.

   1.   Whenever the tract proposed to be subdivided is characterized by unique
and unusual topography, size, or shape, or is surrounded by such development or
unusual conditions that the strict application of the requirements contained in
this chapter would result in substantial hardships or injustices that are not
self-created by the developer, the City Council, upon recommendation of the
Commission, may vary or modify such requirements so that the subdivider is
allowed to develop the property in a reasonable manner; but so, at the same
time, the public welfare and interest of the City and surrounding area are
protected and the general intent and the spirit of this chapter are preserved.
   2.   Any such variation or exception shall be limited to the minimum relief
that is necessary for a subdivision that creates lots for reasonable
development of the real property. Variations or exceptions that may be
indicated on the plans but have not been formally requested shall not be
considered as approved.

Agreement
171.07 Additional Requirements for     
Mobile Home Parks and Tiny Home Parks
 
171.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to promote and encourage development or
redevelopment of tracts of land on a planned, unified basis by allowing greater
flexibility and diversification than is normally permitted by conventional
single lot development in zoning districts, because of the substantial public
advantages of planned development. Although Planned Unit Developments (PUDs),
including mobile home parks and tiny home parks, may appear to deviate in
certain respects from a literal interpretation of the Comprehensive Plan,
regulations adapted to such unified planning and development are intended both
to accomplish the purposes of zoning and other applicable regulations to an
equivalent or higher degree than where such regulations are designed to control
unscheduled development on individual lots, and to promote economical and
efficient land use, an improved level of amenities, appropriate and harmonious
variety, creative design, and a better living environment.
171.02 WHERE PERMITTED.
   Planned Unit Developments shall be permitted on any 10-acre or larger tract
of land, or contiguous tracts of land, that has been zoned or rezoned for PUD
purposes by the City Council. Said PUDs may consist of residential, commercial,
public, semi-public land, conservancy land, or any combinations of land uses
thereof. Mobile home parks and tiny home parks are permitted only on any 20-
acre or larger tract of land that has been zoned or rezoned for mobile home
park and tiny home park purposes by the City Council. Said mobile home parks
and tiny home parks shall consist of mobile home or tiny home spaces and
accessory structures including a required storm shelter. A Master Plan shall be
submitted by the applicant in conjunction with any petition requesting rezoning
of a parcel or parcels of land to either Planned Unit Development District
(PUD) or R-4 Mobile Home Residential District (R-4). However, the Master Plan
for such PUD, mobile home park, or tiny home park shall not become effective
until the appropriate zoning, either PUD or R-4, has been approved by the City
Council.
171.03 PRE-APPLICATION CONFERENCE.
   In order to eliminate unnecessary expenditures of time and money, the
developer shall first schedule a pre-application conference with the City
Manager, who shall involve the City Engineer and representatives of other
departments as deemed appropriate. The City Manager may require submittal of a
generalized sketch plan providing such information as follows:
   1.   Location and size of the overall site, and of the individual types of
development or uses proposed within the site.
   2.   Existing topography, indicating slopes, major earth-work areas,
drainage courses, embankment stability, soil suitability, runoff on
considerations, floodplains, and any problem areas.
   3.   Existing tree masses and other geological and environmentally important
characteristics.
   4.   Generalized vehicular and pedestrian systems and parking areas.
   5.   Generalized building locations.
   6.   Approximate gross density, and number and types of dwelling units, in
accordance with the Comprehensive Plan; approximate gross floor areas of
commercial and industrial land uses.
   7.   Generalized stormwater management plan for drainage and detention,
including embankment protection and erosion controls.
   8.   Generalized utility line considerations with sanitary sewer capacity
limitations so noted.
   9.   Generalized public and private ownership boundaries, including common
ownership areas, if any.
   10.   Generalized building locations for small PUD proposals.
   11.   Proposed development schedule and phasing plan.
171.04 APPLICATION FOR REZONING.
   1.   Following the pre-application conference, the applicant shall submit a
petition for rezoning to PUD or R-4 in accordance with standard City procedures
for rezoning, accompanied by a Master Plan, development agreement and related
documents containing the information required by this chapter, and required
fees.
   2.   The petition, Master Plan, and development agreement shall be referred
to the Planning and Zoning Commission for study and report and for public
hearing if required for rezoning by the Commission. The Commission shall review
the Master Plan for conformity to the standards of this chapter, and may
approve the plan as submitted; require the petitioner to modify, alter, adjust,
or amend the plan as deemed necessary to preserve the intent and purpose of
this chapter to promote public health, safety, and general welfare; or
recommend that it be denied. The action of the Planning and Zoning Commission
shall be reported to the City Council, where upon the Council may approve or
disapprove the petition and Master Plan as reported, or may require such
changes thereto as deemed necessary to effectuate the intent and purpose of
this chapter.
   3.   The City staff shall schedule all required public hearings as soon as
possible after all required information has been submitted. The Planning and
Zoning Commission shall report their findings to the City Council in a timely
manner. In the event they fail to take action within 60 days after the date of
public hearing, the petitioner or anyone located within the notification area
as defined for rezoning may request in writing that the Commission complete
their considerations. The Commission shall then take action within the next 30
days and report their findings to the Council for consideration by the Council,
unless the Council expressly grants the Commission additional time to complete
negotiations, studies, or other items necessary.
171.05 DEVELOPMENT CONTROLS.
   Although PUD’s are intended to promote and permit flexibility of design, and
thereby may involve modifications of conventional regulations or standards,
certain requirements which are set forth below shall be applied to ensure that
the development is compatible with the intent of this chapter. Mobile home
parks and tiny home parks are intended to be developed in a consistent manner.
   1.   Any use that is approved and made a part of the Master Plan, subject to
any conditions attached thereto, shall be permitted.
   2.   Height, setback, bulk, and other requirements set out in the Master
Plan shall constitute the basis for, and become the zoning requirement for,
that particular PUD, provided that refinements may be made through Preliminary
Plat and Site Plan approval if not defined as a substantial modification; in
lack of any special provisions set out in the Master Plan, the requirements of
the most proximate zoning district, as defined by use, shall be applied.
   3.   Project phases shall be substantially and functionally self-contained
and self-sustaining with regard to access, parking, utilities, required open
space, screening and transitional elements and other support features, and be
capable of supporting required operation and maintenance activities; temporary
provisions, such as turnarounds or access easements, may be required for this
purpose; the initial phases generally should include development of common
amenities and should provide a feasible means of developing the property in
terms of access, sewer service, or similar physical constraints.
   4.   The combination of adjoining tracts of land into one cohesive Planned
Unit Development shall be encouraged. Where such adjoining tracts of land are
not under the same ownership, the owners of all property within the PUD shall
sign the development agreement indicating concurrence with the requirements of
the Master Plan and rezoning ordinance.
   5.   Attention shall be given to mitigation of existing or potential land
use conflicts through proper orientation, open space setbacks, landscaping and
screening, grading, traffic circulation, and architectural compatibility. It is
the intent of this chapter to recognize that appropriate use of design
techniques will provide the required mitigation, and thereby eliminate the need
for certain conventional regulations or standards. As examples and not
requirements:
      A.   Provision of landscaped parks and open space to mitigate densities,
orienting views, access, and principal activities away from the land use
needing protection, placing those least compatible activities farthest from the
common boundary and those most compatible nearest, can create an effective
buffer.
      B.   Setbacks in conjunction with landscaping can mitigate conflicts by
providing a visual buffer, controlling pedestrian access, softening visual
contrast by subduing the differences in architecture and bulk, and reducing
heat. Dense landscaping can reduce the width of physical separation needed for
such purposes.
      C.   Proper grading will control drainage, can alter views and subdue
sound, and channel access.
      D.   Fences, walls, and berms will channel access and control visual,
sound, and light pollution.
      E.   Proper architectural use of color, bulk, materials, and shape will
enhance compatibility and reduce contrast, although details added to the
building for aesthetic purposes without consideration to form and surroundings
may be detrimental rather than helpful.
      F.   Proper design of pedestrian ways, streets, and points of access, and
proper location of parking areas, will reduce congestion and safety hazards and
help prevent introduction of noise, pollutants, and other conflicts into areas
with less intensive land use.
      G.   Other techniques may also be used.
   6.   Permanent care and maintenance of open space, recreation amenities, and
other common elements shall be provided in a legally binding development
agreement.
   7.   Except where the City agrees to other arrangements, a PUD shall be
comprised of either a single owner or a group of owners acting as a partnership
or corporation with each agreeing in advance to be bound by the conditions
which will be effective in the PUD.
171.06 MASTER PLAN AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT.
   The following information, plans, and maps shall be submitted as part of the
application for a Planned Unit Development, mobile home park, or tiny home
park.
   1.   Names, addresses, and telephone numbers of owners, developer, and
designer; name of development, date, north point, and scale.
   2.   Legal description of the property, and map of the boundary of the
proposed PUD, as well as interior boundaries of proposed development phases,
and of any existing separate ownerships.
   3.   Sufficient information on adjacent properties to indicate relationships
to the proposed development, including such information as land divisions, land
use, pedestrian and vehicular circulation, significant natural features or
physical improvements, and drainage pattern.
   4.   Existing site conditions including contours at intervals sufficient to
indicate topographic conditions (generally two feet), drainage ways and 100-
year floodplains (base floodplains), floodways, heavy woods or other
significant natural areas, and existing structures.
   5.   General locations of proposed lots and attached residential, multiple
family, commercial, and industrial structures, and recreation facilities;
further delineating areas with different uses or building types, and gross
density per acre.
   6.   General location and size of areas to be dedicated or reserved for
common open space, parks, landscaping areas, schools, recreation area, and
similar uses, and how any private facilities are proposed to be maintained.
   7.   Existing and proposed general circulation systems, including streets,
pedestrian ways, recreation trails, major off-street parking and loading areas,
and major points of access.
   8.   Existing and proposed general sanitary sewer collection systems, water
main distribution systems, and stormwater management plan including storm
sewers, drainage ways, and detention facilities. All utilities, including
franchise utilities, shall be underground.
   9.   Proposed development standards, including uses, density, floor area
ratios for nonresidential developments, lot areas and widths, setbacks, and
exceptions or variances from general requirements of zoning and other
ordinances.
   10.   Sewer usage computations in accordance with the criteria of the sewer
district.
   11.   Treatment of transitional zones around the perimeter of the project
for protection of adjoining properties, including setbacks and buffer areas,
landscaping, fences or other screening, height limitations, or other
provisions.
   12.   A narrative or graphic explanation of the planning and design concepts
and objectives the owner intends to follow in implementing the proposed
development, including a description of the character of the proposed
development; the rationale behind the assumptions and choices made; the
compatibility with the surrounding area; and design considerations for
architecture, engineering, landscaping, open space, and so forth.
   13.   A statement of intent with regard to selling or leasing all or
portions of the proposed development.
   14.   Proposed energy conservation methods, such as siting or design of
structures.
   15.   Proposed phasing timetable including a phasing plan indicating the
limits of each phase of development along with buffers for each phase where
appropriate.
   16.   A development agreement shall be signed by the property owners and the
applicant if the applicant does not own all of the property within the PUD,
mobile home park, or tiny home park. This agreement shall reference the Master
Plan drawings and shall include narrative information as deemed necessary
regarding specific development provisions and densities, such information may
also be incorporated into the ordinance rezoning the property.
   17.   The City Manager may require any additional information which may be
needed to evaluate the proposed development on the basis of special or
unforeseen circumstances, or may waive any of the above requirements if it is
found that such information is unnecessary to properly evaluate the proposed
development.
   18.   The Master Plan and development agreement shall be binding on the
petitioner and any and all successors in title so long as PUD or R-4 zoning
applies to the land, unless amended in accordance with the procedures set
forth. The development agreement and the ordinance for rezoning may include a
sunset clause such that the zoning of the land or a portion of the land may
revert to the original zoning should development not occur within a specified
time frame if such sunset clause is deemed necessary by City Council.
   The above information should be shown in a clear and logical manner in a
legible scale. Sheet size should not exceed 24 inches by 36 inches. Generally,
existing conditions should be illustrated on a separate sheet for sake of
clarity, although existing topography, access, utility and sewer lines, and
other items that are appropriate for understanding the proposal should also
appear on the proposed development plan. It is strongly recommended that an
architect, landscape architect, and civil engineer be employed to prepare the
plans.

Master Plan and development agreement, the applicant shall be required to
submit a Preliminary Plat in compliance with the requirements of Chapter 170 –
Subdivision Regulations.
      A.   Such plat shall contain all information and be processed in the
manner set forth in said regulations, in addition to complying with any
specific provisions of the Master Plan, and shall generally comply with the
development concepts outlined in the Master Plan and development agreement.
      B.   The initial Preliminary Plat filed for the property shall be
required to include the entire PUD, mobile home park, or tiny home park, with
lots assigned for Phase 1 development and outlots assigned for approved future
phases of development. Each approved phase shall demonstrate the ability to be
self-sustaining in terms of access, services, utilities, open space, economic
viability, and other major considerations.
      C.   The Preliminary Plat may be required to subdivide the property in
outlots based on use prior to platting into lots for further development.
      D.   For all uses other than single-family detached residential lots, the
Preliminary Plat shall include a Site Plan providing detailed design
information including architectural elevations, building materials, sidewalks
and walkways, landscaping, sidewalks and trails, monument and building signage,
and various site amenities, all in conformance with Chapter 157 – Site Plans.
Site Plans may be required for single-family detached residential lots or for
amenities such as parks serving said lots if so designated on the Master Plan
or if requested by the Commission or Council.
      E.   No public notice or hearing shall be required for Preliminary Plats
or Site Plans unless required by the Master Plan or development agreement or
caused to be required by the Commission or Council as deemed appropriate.
Provided, however, minor deviation from the Master Plan may be permitted as
refinements to the design and planning if not defined by this chapter as a
substantial modification requiring amendment to the Master Plan. Such minor
deviations shall be expressly set out and shall be approved by the Planning and
Zoning Commission and City Council.
   2.   Construction Drawings and Final Plats of Subdivision. Following City
Council approval of a Preliminary Plat, and Site Plan if required, the
applicant shall submit a Final Plat including accompanying information in
conformance with all requirements of Chapter 170 – Subdivision Regulations.
      A.   Final Plat shall be in conformance with the Master Plan, Preliminary
Plat, and Site Plan.
      B.   If the Master Plan or Preliminary Plat include any public
improvements, the applicant shall submit construction drawings for review by
the City Engineer and approval by City Council as required by Chapter 170.
Construction of the public improvements shall be completed, and said
improvements accepted by Council, prior to Final Plat approval; unless this
requirement is specifically waived by the City Council and appropriate bond or
security as recommended by the City Attorney has been provided to the City
Clerk.
      C.   No public notice or hearing shall be required for Final Plats or
Construction Drawings unless required by the Master Plan or development
agreement or caused to be required by the Commission or Council as deemed
appropriate. Provided, however, minor deviation from the Master Plan may be
permitted as refinements to the design and planning if not defined by this
chapter as a substantial modification requiring amendment to the Master Plan.
Such minor deviations shall be expressly set out and shall be approved by the
Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council.
   3.   Upon the approval of Preliminary Plat and Site Plan and the approval
and recordation of the Final Plat, building permits shall be issued in the same
manner as for building permits generally, including siting for individual
mobile homes or tiny homes. Certificates of Occupancy shall be issued in
conformance with applicable City codes.
171.09 AMENDMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS.
   1.   Substantial modifications to the Master Plan shall be processed in the
same manner as a rezoning and additionally shall comply with the provisions of
this section. Notice and public hearing requirements and the effect of a denial
shall be the same as for rezoning, provided that the notification area shall be
those property owners proximate to the parcel covered by the amendment, as
opposed to the entire PUD.
   Further provided that in the event a requested amendment for a portion of
the entire PUD is denied, such action shall not create any limitations under
rezoning procedure on the filing of an amendment to another portion of the PUD
having a substantially different notification area. Any ambiguities or disputes
between this chapter and procedures for rezoning shall be resolved in favor of
the more restrictive requirements.
   2.   Substantial modifications are hereby defined to include, but are not
limited to, the following: increased density; intensification of use by
changing to a lower classification, with conventional single-family being the
highest classification and progressing to attached single-family, multiple-
family, commercial offices, retail, warehousing, and light industry, to heavy
industry; addition of uses, or elimination of conditions or restrictions on a
use or uses; increased floor area ratios, or other modifications considered
probable to generate increased traffic, sewage, waste consumption, or other
detrimental conditions; significant modifications to peripheral buffering or
screening, setbacks, height, locations of buildings, drives, or other
improvements which were intended for protection of proximate properties,
provided that substitution of equivalent screening materials shall not be
considered a substantial modification; modifications to the street pattern,
such as that of major streets or continuations of existing streets, which will
have a demonstrable impact on traffic flow such as to effectively change the
functional classification of the street; modifications to access which may lead
to increased congestion, or to additional commercial or industrial traffic on a
local residential street; or other changes deemed substantial by the City
staff.
   3.   Modifications to final plans shall follow the procedures of the site
planning or subdivision regulations, as appropriate, except in the case of a
substantial modification as defined above.
   4.
171.10 VALIDITY.
   1.   In the event the first development phase has not commenced within two
years after the date of rezoning, or if subsequent phases are delayed more than
two years beyond the indicated development schedule, the developer shall file
appropriate information detailing the reasons for the delay with the City
Manager. The City Manager shall review the circumstances and prepare a report
recommending appropriate action to be taken concerning the PUD, mobile home
park, or tiny home park. The Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council
shall review the matter, and may continue the PUD zoning with revised time
limits; require that appropriate amendments be made or action taken, such
amendments to comply with the procedures of this chapter if deemed substantial;
continue the PUD or R-4 zoning for part of the area, with or without revised
time limits, and initiate rezoning of the remainder to an appropriate district;
or initiate rezoning of the entire parcel to an appropriate district, provided
that the rezoning shall not be to a zone more restrictive than the applied
immediately prior to the rezoning to PUD except after comprehensive planning
analysis. The Commission and Council may schedule such public hearings as
deemed appropriate.
   2.   Approval of a Site Plan or Preliminary Plat shall be deemed to commence
development, provided that the permanent placement of construction materials
shall have started and be proceeding without delay within two years after the
date of Site Plan approval, and a Final Plat approved within one year after the
date of Preliminary Plat approval in the event a Site Plan is not required.
Failure to comply with this provision shall void the Site Plan and Preliminary
Plat approvals, and make the PUD subject to review as provided above.
   3.   It shall be the responsibility of the developer to comply with all
prescribed time limits without notice from the City.
171.11 APPLICATION TO EXISTING PUD DISTRICTS.
   Existing PUD districts shall comply with the requirements and provisions of
this chapter, provided that no additional filings shall be required to maintain
current valid status, and no currently expired approvals shall be deemed to
have been reapproved by this chapter. Validity of existing PUDs shall be
computed according to the time limits set forth herein.
171.12 FEES.
   Before any action shall be taken by the Commission on any petition for
rezoning or on any Master Plan, the applicant or agent shall deposit with the
Clerk a fee according to a schedule adopted from time to time by resolution of
the City Council. The applicant shall also be responsible for any development
review fees incurred by the City Engineer for review of the PUD and related
documents; said fees shall be reimbursed to the City prior to any action by the
Commission and paid in full prior to Council action. Site Plans and Plats of
Subdivision within a PUD shall also be subject to the normal fees for such
filings.
