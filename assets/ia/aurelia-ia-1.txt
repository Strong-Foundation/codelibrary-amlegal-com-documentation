the leaks and spills of hazardous substances, these regulations are promulgated
to establish responsibility for the treatment, removal and cleanup of hazardous
substance spills within the City limits.
36.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter the following terms are defined:
   1.   “Cleanup” means actions necessary to contain, collect, control,
identify, analyze, clean up, treat, disperse, remove, or dispose of a hazardous
substance.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[1])
   2.   “Hazardous condition” means any situation involving the actual,
imminent, or probable spillage, leakage, or release of a hazardous substance

an immediate or potential danger to the public health or safety or to the
environment.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[4])

listed by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection
Agency under the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended by the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, or any toxic pollutant listed under

(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[7])
36.03 CLEANUP REQUIRED.
   Whenever a hazardous condition is created by the deposit, injection,
dumping, spilling, leaking or placing of a hazardous substance, so that the
hazardous substance or a constituent of the hazardous substance may enter the
environment or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters, including
ground waters, the responsible person shall cause the condition to be remedied
by a cleanup, as defined in the preceding section, as rapidly as feasible to an
acceptable, safe condition. The costs of cleanup shall be borne by the
responsible person. If the responsible person does not cause the cleanup to
begin in a reasonable time in relation to the hazard and circumstances of the
incident, the City may, by an authorized officer, give reasonable notice, based
on the character of the hazardous condition, said notice setting a deadline for
accomplishing the cleanup and stating that the City will proceed to procure
cleanup services and bill the responsible person for all costs associated with
the cleanup if the cleanup is not accomplished within the deadline. In the
event that it is determined that immediate cleanup is necessary as a result of
the present danger to the public health, safety and welfare, then no notice
shall be required and the City may proceed to procure the cleanup and bill the
responsible person for all costs associated with the cleanup. If the bill for
those services is not paid within 30 days, the City Attorney shall proceed to
obtain payment by all legal means. If the cost of the cleanup is beyond the
capacity of the City to finance it, the authorized officer shall report to the

evacuate people from the area threatened by a hazardous condition caused by the
person.

condition caused by that person, including the costs of assessing the injury,
destruction or loss.

of the City in responding at and to the scene of a hazardous condition caused
by that person.

   1.   A person manufacturing, storing, handling, transporting, or disposing
of a hazardous substance shall notify the State Department of Natural Resources
and the Police Department of the occurrence of a hazardous condition as soon as
possible but not later than six hours after the onset of the hazardous
condition or discovery of the hazardous condition. The Police Department shall
immediately notify the Department of Natural Resources.
   2.   Any other person who discovers a hazardous condition shall notify the

MINORS
 
46.01 Curfew                 46.03 Contributing to Delinquency
46.02 Cigarettes and Tobacco
 
46.01 CURFEW.
   The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote
the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and
specifically to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults
responsible for minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors
committed after the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences
and criminal activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.

      A.   “Emergency errand” means, but is not limited to, an errand relating

requiring immediate action to prevent serious illness, bodily injury, or loss
of life.
      B.   “Knowingly” means knowledge that a responsible adult should
reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that
responsible adult’s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful
or careless adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult
responsibility through an objective test. It is therefore no defense that an
adult responsible for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or
conduct or whereabouts of the minor.
      C.   “Minor” means any unemancipated person under the age of 18 years.
      D.   “Nonsecured custody” means custody in an unlocked multipurpose area,

secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically
accompanied by a law enforcement officer or a person employed by the facility
where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to
providing nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate
juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the person’s
parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but
not for longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or
magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
      E.   “Public place” includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys, and sidewalks dedicated to public use and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises, whether publicly or privately owned,
that are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited
commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is
permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has
access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is
considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.
      F.   “Responsible adult” means a parent, guardian or other adult
specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have
custody or control of a minor.
   2.   Curfew Established. It is unlawful for any minor to be or remain upon
any of the alleys, streets or public places or to be in places of business and
amusement in the City between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 6:00 a.m. of the
following day on days commencing on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday and between the hours of 1:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. on Friday and

in which the minor is permitted by law to be engaged or, if traveling, within
one hour after the end or before the beginning of work;
         (2)   Minor’s place of religious activity or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of the religious activity;

         (4)   School activity or, if traveling, within one hour after the end

         (5)   Assembly such as a march, protest, demonstration, sit-in or
meeting of an association for the advancement of economic, political, religious
or cultural matters, or for any other activity protected by the First Amendment
of the U.S. Constitution guarantees of free exercise of religion, freedom of
speech, freedom of assembly or, if traveling, within one hour after the end or
before the beginning of the activity.
      D.   The minor is on an emergency errand for a responsible adult;
      E.   The minor is engaged in interstate travel through the City
beginning, ending or passing through the City when such travel is by direct
route.
   4.   Responsibility of Adults. It is unlawful for any responsible adult
knowingly to permit or to allow a minor to be in any public place in the City
within the time periods prohibited by this section unless the minor’s presence
falls within one of the above exceptions.
   5.   Enforcement Procedures.
      A.   Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in
the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driver’s
license, a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance,
use his or her best judgment in determining age.
      B.   Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody. Grounds for arrest are
that the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the person’s
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any nonsecured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into
custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.
      C.   Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into
custody, the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the
minor as soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible
for the minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at
such time as the court may direct.
      D.   Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minor’s parent, guardian or other person
legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the
law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative
of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person
who is known to the child.
   6.   Penalties.
      A.   Responsible Adult’s First Violation. In the case of a first
violation by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall, by certified mail,
send to the adult responsible for the minor, written notice of the violation
with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of
the curfew ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with
applicable penalties.
      B.   Responsible Adult’s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as
defined in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows
the minor to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a
municipal infraction.
      C.   Minor’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a
minor, the law enforcement officer shall give the minor a written warning,

the City or destroy it. The decision and order shall immediately be served upon
the person against whom rendered in the same manner as the notice of removal.
If the original order of the Mayor or peace officer is not appealed and is not
complied with within three days or the order of the Council after appeal is not
complied with within three days of its issuance, the Mayor or peace officer is
authorized to seize, impound or destroy such dangerous or vicious animal.

or should the work be improperly done, the City shall have the right to finish
or correct the work, and the Council shall assess the costs to the property
owner or the plumber. If the plumber is assessed, the plumber must pay the
costs before receiving another permit. If the property owner is assessed, such
assessment may be collected with and in the same manner as general property
taxes.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[3a & h])

system, or if there is clear and convincing evidence that the accessible public
water supply is inadequate to meet the needs of the landowner, then a variance
from this section may be obtained from the Planning and Zoning Board if a well
permit is obtained pursuant to State law or County ordinance. Exception:

separate water meter. The City will not allow readings from an existing water
meter before or after an outside water use to be recorded for the purposes of
exemption on the sanitary sewer charges. Outside water use meters shall be
installed so no subtraction is necessary from the existing water meter for the
purpose of billing. The property owner shall bear all costs, to include the

City, the property owner or customer may be required to purchase and install
such meter in accordance with requirements established by the City.
91.09 METER REPAIRS.
   Whenever a water meter or remote reader owned by the City is found to be out
of order the Superintendent shall have it repaired. If it is found that damage
to the meter or remote reader has occurred due to the carelessness or
negligence of the customer or property owner, or the meter is not owned by the
City, then the property owner shall be liable for the cost of repairs.
91.10 RIGHT OF ENTRY.

shall be tested by the City. A meter check fee of $10.00 shall be paid when the
customer requests a meter test.
91.12 ESTIMATED READINGS.
   Where a meter has ceased to register, or meter reading could not be
obtained, the quantity of water consumed for billing purposes will be based
upon an average of the prior 12 months’ consumption, and the conditions of
normal water usage expected during the period in which the meter failed to
register.

residence, business or other structure with any sanitary sewer shall be made
unless the basement floor is poured, or in the case of a building with a slab
or crawl space, unless the ground floor is installed with the area adjacent to
the foundation of such building cleared of debris and backfilled. The backfill
shall be well compacted and graded so that the drainage is away from the
foundation. Prior to the time the basement floor is poured, or the first floor
is installed in buildings without basements, the sewer shall be plugged and the
plug shall be sealed by the Superintendent. Any accumulation of water in any
excavation or basement during construction and prior to connection to the
sanitary sewer shall be removed by means other than draining into the sanitary
sewer.
96.06 INTERCEPTORS REQUIRED.

wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner’s
expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
97.08 TESTING OF WASTES.
   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from
periodic grab samples).

attempt to secure said funds and provide them to the Company to compensate the
Company for the costs of relocation.

code regarding its depth and composition. The Company shall not be required to
restore or modify public right-of-way, sidewalks, or other areas in or adjacent

shall not deprive the Company of its right to operate and maintain existing
facilities on, below, above, or beneath the vacated property. Prior to the City

entity to reimburse the Company for the cost of such relocation as a
precondition to relocation. The Company shall not be required to relocate in
order to facilitate such private project at its expense.

specific basis, information indicating the horizontal location, relative to

required to receive the tier or tiers, and any changes in the nature of the
services provided, including the program services included in the tier or

155.01 PURPOSE AND RULE OF INTERPRETATION
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish uniform rules and controls to
ensure public safety and provide efficient delivery of services by the City and
others wishing to utilize streets and other public property for the delivery of
utility or other services, in order to protect public and private investment,
ensure orderly use of public property and ensure the health, safety and welfare
of the population, to provide for the regulation and administration of the
public streets and other public property and secure the rights of the City to a
return on its investment in public property. This chapter is to be interpreted
in light of these findings for the benefit of the public and users of the
streets and other public property.
155.02 LICENSE OR LEASE REQUIRED
   No person or other entity shall use the public right-of-way or other public
property without first obtaining a license or lease from the City. The City
shall not enter into or issue any license or lease that grants exclusive
rights. An application for a license or lease shall be filed with the City
Director of Public Works on a form provided by the City and shall include as a
minimum the following information: the name, address and telephone number of
the applicant; the name, address and telephone number of a person whom the City
may notify or contact at any time concerning the license or lease; an
engineering site plan showing the proposed location of the facilities including
any manholes, the size, type and proposed depth of any conduit or other
enclosures; and any additional information the City may require. All licenses
or leases required by this section shall be granted by the Council.
155.03 FEES REQUIRED
   No license or lease for the use of public right-of-way or other public
property shall be granted without requiring the grantee thereof to pay a
reasonable and competitively neutral fee for the use of public right-of-way or
other public property. The fees will be as follows:
   1.   A license or lease fee will be assessed on all new licenses or leases
for space in the right-of-way. This license or lease fee is a one-time fee for
the term of the license or lease. Payment is expected when the license or lease
is signed; however, a payment schedule may be entered into between the City and
the licensee or lessee. If the license or lease is renewed, a new license or
lease fee will be assessed. The fee shall be based on the term of the renewal.
The fee to be paid shall be as follows:
      A.   A person or entity whose end use is solely dedicated to a
governmental use, including education, shall pay a fee based on an annual fee
of 13 cents per linear foot of right-of-way used.
      B.   All other persons or entities shall pay a fee based on an annual fee
of 65 cents per linear foot of right-of-way used.
   2.   In addition to the license or lease fee, an annual right-of-way
management fee will be assessed on July 1 of each year that the license or
lease is in force. The fee is based on the number of linear feet of wire laid
in the City right-of-way, and reflects the actual management cost the City
incurs while managing the right-of-way. The fee is established as follows:
      Each entity or person shall pay an annual fee of three cents per linear
foot of right-of-way used. Payment shall be made within 30 days after the
beginning of each year the license or lease is in force.
   3.   In addition to the license or lease fee and annual management fee, any
person or other entity shall pay a fee every time their facility requires
excavation in the right-of-way. This fee will cover costs for street
degradation and replacement, inspection and obstruction and routing of
pedestrian and vehicle traffic. The fee to be paid for each cut into the street
will be based on a Degradation Fee schedule maintained by the City Director of
Public Works. All or part of this fee may be waived if work is done in
conjunction with City construction. In addition, no fee will be charged if
lateral boring is done and there is no cut into the street.
155.04 LIMIT ON TERM
   No license or lease for use of the public right-of-way or other public
property shall be granted for a term of more than 10 years.
155.05 PLACEMENT OF FACILITIES
   The facilities, fixtures and equipment of the distribution, transmission or
sale of any utility services, or services provided under license or lease or
easement, shall be placed and maintained so as not to unnecessarily or
unreasonably interfere with the travel on the streets, highways, avenues,
alleys, bridges and public places in the City, nor shall such facilities,
fixtures and equipment interfere with the proper use of the same, including,
but not limited to, ordinary drainage, or the functioning of the sewers,
underground pipe or other property of the City. In the event that facilities,
fixtures and equipment of any person or other entity located within a public
right-of-way must be relocated because of paving, road construction or road
reconstruction, sewer construction or sewer reconstruction or the construction
or reconstruction of public drainage systems or similar public works or the
construction or reconstruction of the facilities of any City-owned utility,
such relocation, at the written request of the City, shall be completed by the
owner of such facilities at the owner’s cost. The City shall upon request of
any person or other entity holding a license or lease, review any plans for the
construction of facilities, fixtures and equipment within the public right-of-
way and advise the person or other entity of any conflict such construction may
have with planned or anticipated public improvements, but failure of the City
to so advise such person or other entity will not relieve the owner of such
facilities of its obligations under this chapter. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Director of Public Works may require placement of equipment or
facilities belonging to any holder of a license or lease be limited to
locations designated by the Director of Public Works if such limitation is
deemed by the Director of Public Works to be necessary to protect the integrity
of use of present and future users of the public right-of-way or other public
property.
155.06 INDEMNIFICATION AND BOND
   The holder of any license or lease shall indemnify and hold the City
harmless at all times during the term of the license or lease from and against
all claims for injury or damage to any person or property, including payments
under worker’s compensation laws, caused by the construction, erection,
operation or maintenance of its facilities, fixtures or equipment, or the
negligence of its contractors or its employees. In case of any suit or action
at law being commenced against the City, upon any claim for damage arising out
of any loss, injury or damage claimed to have been caused by any installation,
improvement, obstruction or excavation made or left in, under or upon such
street, sidewalk, alley or public place by the holder of a license or lease,
its agents, contractors or employees, upon being notified in writing by the
City of such action or proceeding, the holder of said license or lease shall
appear and make proper defense thereto at the expense of the holder of the
license or lease; and if any judgment or decree shall in any such case be
rendered against the City therein, the holder of said license or lease shall
assume, pay and satisfy such judgment or decree, with the cost thereof.
Immediately upon issuance of the license or lease, the holder of the license or
lease shall purchase general liability insurance. The amount of insurance shall
be a minimum of $1,000,000.00 with a maximum deductible of $5,000.00. The
holder of the license or lease shall file with the Clerk a certificate of
insurance which clearly discloses on its face coverage in conformity with these
requirements. Upon request of the City, the holder of the license or lease
shall at the holder’s cost submit a certified copy of the policy.
155.07 REGULATION BY THE CITY
   The City reserves the right to make reasonable general regulations for the
use of streets and other public property which unless otherwise specifically
provided shall apply to any holder of a license or lease.
155.08 CONSTRUCTION AND EXCAVATION BY HOLDERS
   A written permit will be obtained from the Director of Public Works whenever
it becomes necessary for the holder of any license or lease to excavate in
streets or public grounds of the City. Such permits shall state a particular
part or point of the street where the excavation is to be made and the length
of time in which such permit shall authorize the work to be done. An exception
to a requirement for a permit shall be made in cases of emergency involving
public safety, in which case a permit will be obtained at the earliest
opportunity after the work has started. In making excavations in the streets,
the holder of any license or lease shall proceed with such work as to cause the
least possible inconvenience to the public. The holder of any license or lease
shall properly protect, according to safety standards generally accepted at the
time of placement as may be determined from time to time by the Director of
Public Works, all excavations and obstructions by proper placement of shoring,
surface plates, barricades, warning lights and such other or additional devices
as circumstances may warrant. If in the opinion of the Director of Public Works
such excavation or obstruction is not properly and safely protected, the Clerk
shall notify such holder of a license or lease, who shall immediately comply
with such reasonable instructions. Immediately after use, any trenches for
excavations which the holder of a license or lease has opened shall be filled.
However, no trench or excavation in the streets shall be filled or covered
without giving the City the right to inspect the same. All backfilling in
streets will be according to City specifications. Temporary street surfacing
will be placed in such excavations as soon as the same has been backfilled.
Pavements, sidewalks, curbs and gutters or other portions of streets and public
places opened, disturbed or damaged shall be promptly restored and replaced
with like materials at the expense of the holder of a license or lease and left
in as good condition as before the opening, disturbance or damage occurred. In
the event like replacement materials are not available, the holder of the
license or lease shall notify the Director of Public Works, who must approve
the use of any alternate materials. In the event that the holder of a license
or lease fails to comply with the provision of this section, after having been
given reasonable notice, the City may do such work as may be needed to properly
repair such pavements, sidewalks, curbs and gutters or other portions of
streets and public places and the cost thereof shall be repaid to the City by
the holder of the license or lease. In cases where a cut or disturbance is made
in a section of street paving or sidewalks, but causes greater disturbance than
to just the area cut, rather than replace only the area cut, the holder of a
license or lease shall replace that area as may be ordered by the Director of
Public Works, which in no event shall exceed the panel or panels disturbed.
155.09 CITY CONSTRUCTION AND PAVING
   Whenever the City shall pave or repave any street or shall change the grade
line of any street or public place or shall construct or reconstruct any
conduit, water main service or water connection, sewer or other City-owned
public works or City-owned utility, it shall be the duty of the holder of any
license or lease, when so ordered by the City, to relocate its service lines
and other property in the streets or other public places at its own expense so
as to conform to the established grade or line of such street or public place
and so as not to interfere with the public improvements so constructed or
reconstructed. In the case of other public improvements, including but not
limited to urban renewal projects, the City may require the holder of a license
or lease to relocate its poles, service lines and appurtenances in the streets
at the owner’s expense. The City may at its discretion assign personnel for
inspection of excavation and related work being performed by the holder of a
license or lease. Should the holder of the license or lease fail or refuse to
do and perform the things provided in this section, the City may, after
reasonable notice, perform the work and charge the expense thereof to the
holder of the license or lease and the holder of the license or lease shall
promptly pay said charges.
155.10 DESIGN NOTICE TO CITY
   The holder of a license or lease shall promptly, upon request, furnish the
Council a detailed map or maps of its distribution system both within the City
limits and the area within two miles surrounding the City unless that area is
within another city. The holder of a license or lease shall thereafter update
the map or maps at least annually or upon request, showing all subsequent
additions or deletions to the distribution system. Prior to any excavation by
the City or its agents, a representative must contact the holder of any license
or lease regarding current information on the location of underground lines or
facilities in the area concerned. The obligation to contact the holder of a
license or lease under this section shall be satisfied if contact is made with
the corporation organized pursuant to Code of Iowa Chapter 480 or an entity
with a similar function utilized by both the City and the company, currently
the Iowa One Call System.
155.11 ABOVE-GROUND CABLES, WIRES, CONDUITS AND POLES
   All cables, wires, and conduits shall be placed underground except where
above-ground connection to buildings or other locations above ground is
reasonably necessary. Such above-ground connection shall be by means of poles
located, as far as reasonably practical, within alleys. No such poles shall be
installed or erected until the Council has approved the proposed location,
construction and pole heights.
155.12 ASSIGNMENT
   No sale or assignment of any license or lease of the use of the public
right-of-way or other public property shall be effective until it is approved
by the Council and until the holder thereof has filed in the office of the
Clerk written notice of the proposed sale, transfer, disposition or assignment,
such notice to clearly summarize the proposed procedure and the terms and
conditions thereof. If the City determines it needs additional information, the
holder of the license or lease shall be required to provide said information.
The City shall be reimbursed by the holder of the license or lease for its
reasonable costs incurred in reviewing all matters relating to said sale or
assignment, including the reasonable costs for consultants or technical
experts. Such approval by the City shall not be unreasonably withheld. The
proposed vendee, assignee or lessee shall similarly file an instrument, duly
executed, reciting such proposal, accepting the terms of the license or lease
and agreeing to perform all of the conditions thereof.
155.13 FORFEITURE
   The violation of any material portion of a license or lease by the holder
thereof or its successors or assigns or its failure promptly to perform any of
the provisions of this chapter shall be cause for forfeiture of said license or
lease and the termination of all rights thereunder. Such forfeiture shall be
accomplished by ordinance of the City after written notice to the holder
thereof and a continuation of the violation, failure or default specified on
the notice for at least 30 days from the date the notice was served.
155.14 APPLICATION
   This chapter shall apply to all licenses or leases and easements granted by
the City, including all existing licenses or leases and easements.
155.15 REMOVAL OF MATERIAL; BOND REQUIRED
   The holder of any license or lease, at the termination of said license or
lease, shall remove from the public property or public right-of-way whatever
was placed in said right-of-way and shall restore the property to a condition
reasonably comparable to the condition it was in prior to the right-of-way
being used. Before a license or lease is issued to any person or entity, a bond
shall be obtained to insure that the holder of the license or lease shall be
responsible for removing whatever was placed in the public property or right-
of-way and to further insure that said public property or right-of-way shall be
restored to a condition reasonably comparable to the condition it was in prior
to the right-of-way being used. The amount of the bond to be secured shall be
determined by the City and shall be dependent upon the amount of the cable,
wire or other material that is being placed in the right-of-way and the
estimated cost it would take to remove said material and restore the property
at the expiration of said license or lease.
155.16 HOME RULE
   This chapter is intended to be and shall be construed as consistent with the
reservation of local authority contained in the 25th Amendment to the Iowa
Constitution granting cities Home Rule powers. To such end, any limitation on
the power of the City contained herein is to be strictly construed and the City
reserves to itself the right to exercise all power and authority to regulate
and control its local affairs and all ordinances and regulations of the City
shall be enforceable against the holder of any license or lease.
155.17 NEW TECHNOLOGIES
   Should, within the term of any license or lease, developments within the
field for which the grant was made offer to the holder thereof the opportunity
to effectively, efficiently and economically serve its customers through use of
a substance or material other than those for which the grant was originally
made, then the holder of the license or lease may petition the Council, which,
with such requirements or limitation as it deems necessary to protect public
health, safety and welfare, may allow the use of such substances under the
terms and conditions of the license or lease.

either: (i) before the start of construction of the improvement; or (ii) if the
structure has been substantially damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred. The term does not, however, include any project for
improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions. The term also does not include any alteration of
a historic structure, provided the alteration will not preclude the structure’s
designation as a historic structure.
      B.   Any addition which increases the original floor area of a structure
by 25 percent or more. All additions constructed after the effective date of
the first floodplain management regulations adopted by the community shall be
added to any proposed addition in determining whether the total increase in
original floor space would exceed 25 percent.
   35.   “Variance” means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of
the floodplain management regulations.
   36.   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to

160.02   STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
   1.   The Legislature of the State of Iowa has, in Chapter 414 of the Code of
Iowa, as amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to
secure safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
   2.   Findings of Fact.
      A.   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of
the community.
      B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by: (i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
      C.   This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
   3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Paragraph 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
      A.   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows
so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
      B.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
      C.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
      D.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
      E.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   1.   Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter shall
apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City which are located within
the boundaries of the Floodplain (Overlay) District as established in this
section.
   2.   Establishment of Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) for Cherokee County and Incorporated Areas, City of Aurelia,
Panels 19035C0277C, 19035C0279C, 19035C0281C, and 19035C0283C, dated December
2, 2021, which were prepared as part of the Flood Insurance Study for Cherokee
County is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be the Official
Floodplain Zoning Map. The Cherokee County Flood Insurance Study is hereby
adopted by reference and is made a part of this chapter for the purpose of
administering floodplain management regulations.
   3.   Rules for Interpretation of Floodplain (Overlay) District. The
boundaries of the Floodplain (Overlay) District areas shall be determined by
scaling distances on the official Flood Insurance Rate Map. When an
interpretation is needed as to the exact location of a boundary, the City Clerk
shall make the necessary interpretation. The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall
hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any
requirement, decision, or determination made by the City Clerk in the
enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   4.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used, and no
structure shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered
without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
   5.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
   6.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
   7.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated Floodplain (Overlay) District areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create
liability on the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
   8.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.

permits for variances except as directed by the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
      D.   Construction and Use to Be as Provided in Application and Plans.
Floodplain Development Permits based on the basis of approved plans and
applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in
such approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement, or
construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. The applicant shall be
required to submit certification by a professional engineer or land surveyor,
as appropriate, registered in the State of Iowa, that the finished fill,
structure floor elevations, flood proofing, or other flood protection measures
were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to
the use or occupancy of any structure.
160.05   ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING (OVERLAY) DISTRICTS.
The floodplain areas within the jurisdiction of this chapter are hereby divided
into the following districts:
   1.   Floodplain (Overlay) District – those areas identified as Zone A on the
Official Floodplain Zoning Map.
The boundaries shall be as shown on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map. Within
these districts, all uses not allowed as permitted uses are prohibited unless a
variance to the terms of this chapter is granted after due consideration by the
Zoning Board of Adjustment.
160.06   STANDARDS FOR FLOODPLAIN (OVERLAY) DISTRICT.
   1.   Permitted Uses.
      A.   All development within the Floodplain District shall be permitted to
the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance (or underlying
zoning district) and provided they meet the applicable performance standards of
the Floodplain District.
      B.   Any development which involves placement of structures, factory-
built homes, fill or other obstructions, storage of materials or equipment,
excavation or alteration of a watercourse shall be reviewed by the Department
of Natural Resources to determine (i) whether the land involved is either
wholly or partly within the floodway or floodway fringe and (ii) the base flood
elevation. The applicant shall be responsible for providing the Department of
Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make the
determination.
      C.   Review by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources is not required
for the proposed construction of new or replacement bridges or culverts where:
         (1)   The bridge or culvert is located on a stream that drains less
than two square miles, and
         (2)   The bridge or culvert is not associated with a channel
modification that constitutes a channel change as specified in 567-71.2(2),
Iowa Administrative Code.
   2.   Performance Standards. All development must be consistent with the need
to minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance
standards. Where base flood elevations and floodway data have not been provided
in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be
contacted to compute such data. The applicant will be responsible for providing
the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to
make such determination. All development shall:
      A.   Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement.
      B.   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
      C.   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
   3.   Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the base flood elevations. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
base flood elevations and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed, subject to favorable
consideration by the Zoning Board of Adjustment, where existing topography,
street grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the
methods used must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the
various forces and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential
structures located in areas that would become isolated due to flooding of
surrounding ground shall be provided with a means of access that will be
passable by wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this criterion
shall not apply where the Administrator determines there is sufficient flood
warning time for the protection of life and property. When estimating flood
warning time, consideration shall be given to the criteria listed in 567-75.2
(3), Iowa Administrative Code.
   4.   Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be flood proofed to such a level. When
flood proofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State of
Iowa shall certify that the flood proofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and
other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the
base flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
   5.   All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
      A.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
         (1)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
         (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
         (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
      Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, structure access
and low damage potential storage.
      B.   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.

optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation.
      D.   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
plumbing, gas lines, water meters, gas meters, and other similar service
utilities either elevated (or in the case of non-residential structures,
optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation or designed to be watertight and withstand inundation to such a
level.
   6.   Factory-Built Homes.
      A.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the structure
is a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation.
      B.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame
ties to ground anchors. Anchorage systems may include, but are not limited to,
use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors as required by the State
Building Code.
   7.   Utility and Sanitary Systems.
      A.   On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located or
designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
      B.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system as well as
the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment facilities
(other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood protection
equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood elevation.
      C.   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water
supply treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with
a level of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood
elevation.
      D.   Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
   8.   Storage of Materials and Equipment. Storage of equipment and materials
that are flammable, explosive, or injurious to human, animal or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or:
(i) not subject to major flood damage and be anchored to prevent movement due
to flood waters; or (ii) readily removable from the area within the time
available after flood warning.
   9.   Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as
levees, flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the base
flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for
adequate interior drainage. In addition, structural flood control works shall
be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
   10.   Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must
be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations must be
approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
   11.   Subdivisions. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and
subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the base flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50 lots
(whichever is less) shall include base flood elevation data for those areas
located within the Floodplain (Overlay) District.
   12.   Accessory Structures to Residential Uses. Detached garages, sheds, and
similar structures that are incidental to a residential use are exempt from the
base flood elevation requirements where the following criteria are satisfied.
      A.   The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage potential.
Its size shall not exceed 600 square feet in size. Those portions of the
structure located less than one foot above the BFE must be constructed of
flood-resistant materials.
      B.   The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage potential
purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure shall not
be used for human habitation.
      C.   The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building site
so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
      D.   The structure shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement.
      E.   The structure's service facilities such as electrical and heating
equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above the base
flood elevation.
      F.   The structure’s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of Subsection 5(A) of this section.
   Exemption from the base flood elevation requirements for such a structure
may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of the
structure and its contents.
   11.   Recreational Vehicles.
      A.   Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of Subsection
6 of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built homes when
the following criteria are satisfied.
         (1)   The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less
than 180 consecutive days; and
         (2)   The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
      B.   Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than 180
consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements of
Subsection 6 of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built
homes.
   12.   Pipeline Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be
buried in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to
prevent rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
   13.   Maximum Damage Potential Development. All new or substantially
improved maximum damage potential uses shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated a minimum of one foot above the elevation of the 500-year
flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed
to such a level. When flood proofing is utilized, a professional engineer
registered in the State of Iowa shall certify that the flood proofing methods
used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact
and uplift forces and other factors associated with the 0.2 percent annual
chance flood; and that the structure, below the 0.2 percent annual chance flood
elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water. A record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in
relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are
flood proofed shall be maintained by the Administrator. Where 0.2 percent
chance flood elevation data has not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study,
the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such
data. The applicant will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural
Resources with sufficient technical information to make such determinations.
160.07   ESTABLISHMENT OF APPEAL AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide: (i) appeals; and (ii)
requests for variances to the provisions of this chapter, and shall take any
other action which is required of the Board.
   1.   Appeals. Where it is alleged there is any error in any order,
requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in
the enforcement of this chapter, the aggrieved party may appeal such action.
The notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board and with the official from
whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason for the
appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to the Board
all the documents constituting the record upon which the action appealed from
was taken.
   2.   Variance. The Board may authorize upon request in specific cases such
variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances
granted must meet the following applicable standards.
      A.   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
      B.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
      C.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      D.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for structures than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance
coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
      E.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
   3.   Hearings and Decisions of the Board.
      A.   Hearings. Upon the filing with the Board of an appeal or a request
for a variance, the Board shall hold a public hearing. The Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the hearing and give public notice thereof, as well as due
notice to parties in interest. At the hearing, any party may appear in person
or by agent or attorney and present written or oral evidence. The Board may
require the appellant or applicant to provide such information as is reasonably
deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or evaluation of
a professional engineer or other expert person or agency, including the
Department of Natural Resources.
      B.   Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal or
variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an appeal, the Board may, so
long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter,
reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in
writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision.
In granting a variance, the Board shall consider such factors as contained in
this section and all other relevant sections of this chapter and may prescribe
such conditions as contained in Subparagraph (2) below.
         (1)   Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board Shall Be Based. In
passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all relevant
factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
            a.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights
or velocities caused by encroachments.
            b.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
            c.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the
ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary
conditions.
            d.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            e.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the City.
            f.   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
            g.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to
flooding for the proposed use.
            h.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing
development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
            i.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for the area.
            j.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            k.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.
            l.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer,
gas, electrical, and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
            m.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
chapter.
         (2)   Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the
factors listed above, the Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such
conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
            a.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
            b.   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
            c.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed
restrictions.
            d.   Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this chapter.
            e.   Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the
flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration,
rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated
with the regulatory flood. The Board shall require that the applicant submit a
plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
   4.   Appeals to the Court. Any person or persons, jointly or severally,
aggrieved by any decision of the Board may present to a court of record a
petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole
or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be
presented to the court within thirty days after the filing of the decision in
the office of the Board.
160.08   NONCONFORMING USES.
A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before the
passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but which is
not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be continued subject
to the following conditions:
   1.   If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any future use
of the structure premises shall conform to this chapter.
   2.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
   3.   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless
it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
State or local health, sanitary, building, or safety codes or regulations or
the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
designation.
Except as provided in Subsection 2 of this section, any use which has been
permitted as a variance shall be considered a conforming use.
160.09   PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
the requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this
chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction
thereof be fined not more than $500.00. Nothing herein contained shall prevent
the City from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy violation.
160.10   AMENDMENTS.
The regulations and standards set forth in this chapter may from time to time
be amended, supplemented, changed, or repealed. No amendment, supplement,
change, or modification shall be undertaken without prior approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.

regulate and limit the height and bulk of buildings hereafter erected or
altered; to regulate and limit the intensity of the use of lot areas, and to
regulate and determine the area of yards, courts, and other open spaces within
and surrounding such buildings, the City is hereby divided into six classes of
districts. The use, height and area regulations are uniform in each class of
district and said districts shall be known as:
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 414.2)
   R-1   Residential District
   C-1   Central Commercial District
   C-2   Suburban Commercial District
   I-1   Industrial District
   A   Agricultural District
   F-1   Flood Hazard Area
165.06 BOUNDARIES
   The boundaries of these districts are indicated upon the OFFICIAL ZONING MAP
of the City, which map is made a part of these regulations by reference. The
said OFFICIAL ZONING MAP and all notations, references, and other matters shown
thereon shall be as if the notations, references and other matters set forth by
said map were all fully described herein. The OFFICIAL ZONING MAP shall be
filed in the office of the Clerk. The OFFICIAL ZONING MAP shall be identified
by the signature of the Mayor, attested by the Clerk under the following words:
This is to certify that this is the OFFICIAL ZONING MAP-- adopted by Ordinance
_______ of the City of Aurelia, Iowa.
The district boundaries are either lot lines or the centerlines of streets and
alleys, unless otherwise shown. Where the districts designated are bounded
approximately by street, alley, or lot lines and are not dimensioned otherwise,
the lot lines or the centerlines of streets and alleys shall be considered to
be the boundary of the district.
165.07 CONFORMANCE REQUIRED GENERALLY
   Except as hereinafter specified, no building or structure shall be erected,
converted, enlarged, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered, nor shall
any building or land be used which does not comply with all of the district
regulations established by these regulations for the district in which the
building or land is located.
165.08 CONTINUING EXISTING USES
   The lawful use of a building existing at the time of the enactment of these
regulations may be continued even though such use may not conform with these
regulations for the district in which it is located.
165.09 NONCONFORMANCE
   Within the districts established by these regulations or by amendments which
may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures, buildings and uses which
were lawful before these regulations were effective or amended, but which would
be prohibited, regulated or restricted under these regulations or future
amendment. It is the intent of this regulation to permit these nonconformities
to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is
further the intent of these regulations that nonconformities shall not be
enlarged upon, expanded or extended, or be used as grounds for adding other
structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. In any district
in which dwellings are permitted, such a use and customary accessory buildings
may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption of
these regulations, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions
contained herein. Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through
action of the Board.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 414.12)
165.10 NONCONFORMING USES
   No building or land devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in the
district in which such building or land is located, except when required by
law, shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, substituted or
structurally altered, unless the use thereof is changed to a use permitted in
the district in which such building, structure or premises is located, except
as follows:
   1.   Substitution. If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming
use of a building or structure may be changed to another nonconforming use of
the same or of a more conforming use, but not less conforming. Whenever a
nonconforming use has been changed to a more conforming use or to a conforming
use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less conforming use.
   2.   Discontinuance. In the event that a nonconforming use of any building,
structure and/or land is discontinued for a period of one year, the use of the
same shall conform thereafter to the uses permitted in the district in which it
is located. The use of land upon which no building or structure is erected or
constructed which either does not conform to the provisions of this chapter and
the use of land upon which no building is erected or constructed or which
becomes nonconforming by reason of a subsequent change in this chapter, shall
be discontinued if vacant for a period of 30 days.
   3.   Replacing Damaged Nonconforming Buildings. Any nonconforming building
or structure damaged more than 60 percent of its replacement cost, as
determined by the City Engineer, exclusive of the foundations at the time of
damage by fire, flood, explosion, war, riots, or act of God, shall not be
restored or reconstructed and used as before such happening; but if damage is
less than 60 percent of replacement cost above the foundation, it may be
restored, reconstructed or used as before provided that it be done within 12
months of such happening.
   4.   Additions and Expansions. A structure which does not conform with
district regulations shall not be added to, expanded or enlarged unless such
addition, expansion or enlargement conforms to all the regulations of the
district in which it is located, provided, however, that such addition,
expansion or enlargement maintains a side yard width not less than the side
yard width of the nonconforming structure existing prior to such expansion or
enlargement. A nonconforming use of land shall not be expanded or extended
beyond the area it occupies at the date of adoption of these regulations.
165.11 STREET FRONTAGE REQUIRED
   Lots containing any building used in whole or in part for residence purposes

alley may be located in a rear or side yard area which abuts the alley;
providing, however, that such garage building shall comply with the following

yards; an attached garage facing an alley which abuts a rear lot line shall be
set back from the side lot lines no less than the requirements for the
principal building.

accessory building which is not a part of the main building shall be a distance
of at least 10 feet from any other building on the lot including the principal
building.

the district in which it is located, plus 20 feet; i.e., for a minimum required
side yard of 10 feet the street side yard shall be not less than 30 feet;
provided, however, this regulation shall not be interpreted as to require a
side street yard of greater width than the minimum required front yard width.
For corner lots, platted after the effective date of these regulations, the
minimum required lot width shall be increased by any amount not less than 20
feet so as to allow for the additional required street side yard, i.e., for a
minimum required lot width of 80 feet, the minimum width of a corner lot shall
be not less than 100 feet. On corner lots platted and of record at the time of
the effective date of these regulations, the same regulations shall apply
except that this regulation shall not be so interpreted as to reduce the
buildable width of the corner lot of record or as shown by existing contract of
purchase at the time of the effective date of these regulations, to less than
28 feet or to prohibit the erection of an accessory building.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 414.1)

the yard requirement for that particular district; however, in no case shall
the front yard depth be less than three-fourths of the smallest front yard
depth of an existing building in the same block, located within 200 feet of
either side lot line and fronting on the same street; however, this regulation
shall not be interpreted as to require a greater setback than double the
minimum required front yard for the district in which it is located; or to
permit a setback which is less than the minimum required front yard for the
district in which it is located.
165.15 SIDE YARD
   In only residential districts the principal structure shall have no portion
of the building closer than five feet to the side lot line.

certain uses of land, these requirements may be inadequate. Where review of the
site plans and intended land use indicate through the application of proven
standards or experience that the requirements herein are inadequate for the
specific land use adaptation, a greater requirement for off-street parking
space is justified and may be required to preserve the intent of this section.

   3.   Procedure. Procedures for approval of site plans are as follows:
      A.   Referral to City Engineer. The Clerk shall immediately refer a copy
of the site plan to the City Engineer, who shall review said site plan as to
its compliance with the regulations of the City, its effect upon public
utilities and the public street system, and submit findings as soon as possible
to the Commission.

thereof, the site plan of the proposed development shall be deemed to be
approved by the Commission.
      D.   Public Hearing. The Chairperson of the Commission may, in his or her
sole discretion, by written order, fix a date, time and place for a public
hearing to be held by the Commission on the site plan of the proposed
development and prescribe the notice thereof and to whom such notice shall be
given. If the Chairperson of the Commission orders a public hearing, the
Commission shall hold such hearing at such date, time and place and at such
hearing all affected property owners shall be given an opportunity to be heard.

construction or proposed construction or occupancy of a development on a tract
of land for which a site plan has been approved will not substantially comply
with the site plan as approved, or if the Zoning Administrator finds that the
construction and development of the tract is not being carried out in
accordance with the development schedule filed with the site plan, the Zoning
Administrator shall suspend all building permits for the development and order
all construction stopped until such time as the owner of the project, or the
owner’s successors in interest, shall have provided the Zoning Administrator
with proof satisfactory to said official that the site plan and schedule of
development will be complied with. The Zoning Administrator shall not issue a
certificate of zoning compliance and occupancy for any structure within the
development while the building permit for the development has been suspended
pursuant to this paragraph. Any person aggrieved by any decision or action of
the Zoning Administrator under this paragraph may appeal such action or
decision to the Board.
      I.   Time Extension. If the owner or developer of a tract of land for
which a site plan has been approved determines that an extension of time is
necessary in the development schedule, or that a modification of the site plan
would provide for a more appropriate or more practicable development of the
site, said owner or developer may apply for an amendment of the site plan. The
Commission may grant an extension of time or a modification of a previously

165.41 ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
   The provisions of this chapter shall be enforced and administered by the
Zoning Administrator. If the Zoning Administrator finds that any of the
provisions of this chapter are being violated, said official shall notify in
writing the person responsible for such violations, indicating the nature of
the violation and ordering the action necessary to correct it. The Zoning
Administrator shall order discontinuance of illegal use of land, buildings, or
structures; removal of illegal buildings or structures or of additions,
alterations or structural changes thereto or the discontinuance of any illegal
work being done, or shall take any other action authorized by this chapter to
insure compliance with or to prevent violation of its provisions.
165.42 BUILDING PERMITS REQUIRED
   Buildings or other structures shall not be erected, moved, added to,
modified or structurally altered without a permit therefor, issued by the
Zoning Administrator. Building permits shall be issued in conformance with the
provisions of this chapter, or upon written order from the Board of Adjustment.
Fees for building permits shall be as provided by Section 165.52 of this
chapter. Building permits issued in accordance with the provisions of this
section shall be null and void at the end of six months from the date of issue
if the construction, alteration, or change of use has not commenced during the
six month period. Construction must be completed within two years after the
date of the issue of the permit. After the permit has expired, a new permit
must be applied for before any further construction can begin or continue.
165.43 APPLICATION FOR BUILDING PERMIT
   All applications for building permits shall be accompanied by a plan showing
the actual dimensions and shape of the lot to be built upon, and the location
and dimensions of the existing or proposed building or alteration. The
application shall include existing or proposed building or alteration; existing
or proposed uses of the building and land; the number of families, housekeeping
units, or rental units the building is designed to accommodate; conditions
existing on the lot; and such other matters as may be necessary to determine
conformance with and enforcement of this chapter.
165.44 CERTIFICATES OF ZONING COMPLIANCE
   It is unlawful to use or occupy or permit the use or occupancy of any
building or premises, or both, or part thereof hereafter created, erected,
changed, converted, or wholly or partly altered or enlarged in its use or
structure until a certificate of zoning compliance shall have been issued
therefor by the Zoning Administrator stating that the proposed use of the
building or land conforms to the requirements of this chapter. Certificates of
zoning compliance shall be applied for coincidentally with the application for
a building permit and shall be issued within 10 days after the lawful erection
or alteration of the building is completed in conformity with the provisions of
this chapter. A temporary certificate of zoning compliance may be issued by the
Zoning Administrator for a period not exceeding six months during alterations
or partial occupancy of a building pending its completion, provided that such
temporary certificate may require such conditions and safeguards as will
protect the safety of the occupants and the public. The Zoning Administrator
shall maintain a record of all certificates of zoning compliance and copies
shall be furnished upon request to any person. Failure to obtain a certificate
of zoning compliance shall be a violation of this chapter.
165.45 CONFORMITY TO APPLICATION, PERMIT AND CERTIFICATE OF ZONING COMPLIANCE
   Building permits or certificates of zoning compliance issued on the basis of
plans and applications, approved by the Zoning Administrator, authorize only
the use, arrangement and construction set forth in such approved plans and
applications, and no other use, arrangement or construction. Any use,
arrangement or construction in conflict with that authorized shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter.
165.46 BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
   1.   Board Created. A Board of Adjustment is hereby established which shall
consist of five members. The term of office of the members of the Board shall
be as provided by Section 414.8, Code of Iowa. The Board shall be appointed by
the Council.
   2.   Meetings. Meetings of the Board shall be held at the call of the
Chairperson, and at such other times as the Board may determine. Such
Chairperson, or in the absence of the Chairperson, the acting Chairperson may
administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the
Board shall be open to the public. The Board shall keep minutes of its
proceedings showing the vote of each member on each question, or if absent or
failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its
examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately
filed in the office of the Board and shall be a public record. The presence of
three members shall be necessary to constitute a quorum.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 414.9 and 414.14)
   3.   Appeals. Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person aggrieved or
by any officer, department, board or bureau of the City affected by any
decision of the Zoning Administrator. Such appeal shall be taken within 10 days
of the decision by filing with the Zoning Administrator and with the Board a
notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The Zoning Administrator shall
forthwith transmit to the Board all papers constituting the record upon which
the action appealed from is taken. An appeal stays all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Zoning Administrator
certifies to the Board after notice of appeal shall have been filed with the
Zoning Administrator, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay
would in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator, cause imminent peril to life
or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by a
restraining order which may be granted by the Board or by a court of record
upon application or notice to the Zoning Administrator and upon due cause
shown.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 414.10 and 414.11)
   4.   Fee For Appeal. The fee for appeal to the Board of Adjustment is
$10.00.
   5.   Hearings; Notice. The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing
on the appeal. Notice of the hearing shall be published twice in the Council-
designated paper with no less than 14 days between the date of the first
publication and the date of the hearing. Written notice to all property owners
within 200 feet of the property shall be sent 14 days prior to the hearing. At
the hearing any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney.
   6.   Powers -- Administrative Review. The Board has the power to hear
appeals where it is alleged there is error in requirements, decision or
determination made by Zoning Administrator in the enforcement of these
regulations.
   7.   Powers -- Special Exceptions. The Board has the power to permit the
following exceptions to the district regulations set forth in this chapter
subject to the requirements of this section:
      A.   Public Service Uses and Buildings. To permit erection and use of a
building or the use of premises or vary the height and the regulations in any
location for a public service corporation for public utility purposes or for
purposes of public communication, which the Board determines is reasonably
necessary for the public convenience or welfare.
      B.   Extension of a Use. To permit the extension of a use into a district
where it would be otherwise prohibited in a case where a district boundary line
is so located that a lot or plot is in more than one district.
      C.   Special Exceptions. To hear and decide only such other special
exceptions as the Board is specifically authorized to pass on by the terms of
this chapter; to decide such questions as are involved in determining whether
special exceptions should be granted; and to grant special exceptions with such
conditions and safeguards as are appropriate under this chapter, or to deny
special exceptions when not in harmony with the purpose and intent of this
chapter. A special exception shall not be granted by the Board unless and until
all of the following conditions are met:
         (1)   A written application for special exception is submitted
indicating the section of this chapter under which the special exception is
sought and stating the grounds on which it is requested.
         (2)   Notice of public hearing shall be given in advance of public
hearing. The owner of the property for which special exception is sought or
said owner’s agent and any other affected property owners shall be notified by
mail. Notice of hearing may also be posted on the property for which special
exception is sought.
         (3)   The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in
person, or by agent or attorney
         (4)   The Board shall make a finding that it is empowered under the
section of this chapter described in the application to grant the special
exception, and that the granting of the special exception will not adversely
affect the public interest. In granting any special exception, the Board may
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this
chapter. Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the
terms under which the special exception is granted, shall be deemed a violation
of this chapter. The Board may prescribe a time limit within which the action
for which the special exception is required shall be begun or completed, or
both. Failure to begin or complete, or both, such action within the time limit
set shall void the special exception.
   8.   Powers -- Variances. The Board has the power to authorize upon appeal
in specific cases such variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be
contrary to the public interest where owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would result in unnecessary
hardship. A variance from the terms of this chapter shall not be granted by the
Board unless and until all of the following are met:
      A.   Written Application. A written variance is submitted demonstrating:
         (1)   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved, and which are not
applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings, in the same district; and
         (2)   That literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this chapter; and
         (3)   That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from
the actions of the applicant; and
         (4)   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands,
structures or buildings in the same district. No nonconforming use of
neighboring lands, structures or buildings in the same district, and no
permitted use of lands, structures or buildings in other districts shall be
considered grounds for the issuance of a variance.
      B.   Hearing Notice. Notice of the hearing shall be published twice in
the Council-designated paper with no less than 14 days between the date of the
first publication and the date of the hearing. Written notice to all property
owners within 200 feet of the property shall be sent 14 days prior to the
hearing. At the hearing any party may appear in person or by agent or by
attorney.
      C.   Hearing. The public hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in
person or by agent or by attorney.
      D.   Findings as to Requirements of this Section. The Board shall make
findings that the requirements of this section have been met by the applicant
for a variance.
      E.   Findings as to Reasons Stated in Application. The Board shall
further make a finding that the reasons set forth in the application justify
the granting of the variance.
      F.   Conditions on Variance. The Board shall further make a finding that
the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and
intent of this chapter and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or
otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. In granting any variance, the
Board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with
this chapter. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of
the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of
this chapter. Under no circumstances shall the Board grant a variance to allow
a use not permissible under the terms of this chapter in the district involved
or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this chapter
in said district.
   9.   Decisions of the Board of Adjustment. In exercising the above-mentioned
powers, the Board may, so long as such action is in conformity with the terms
of this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order,
requirement, decision, or determination appealed from and may make such order,
requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made and to that end
shall have powers of the Zoning Administrator from whom the appeal is taken.
The concurring vote of three members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse
any order, requirement, decision or determination of the Zoning Administrator
or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required
to pass under this chapter or to effect any variation in the application of
this chapter.
   10.   Appeals From Decision of the Board Of Adjustment. Any taxpayer or any
officer, department, board or bureau of the City or persons jointly or
severally aggrieved by any decision of the Board may present to a court of
record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal,
in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition
shall be presented to the court within 30 days after the filing of the decision
in the office of the Board. The court may reverse or affirm, wholly or in part,
or may modify the decision brought up for review.
165.47 MATTERS OF APPEAL
   It is the intent of this chapter that all questions of interpretation and
enforcement shall be first presented to the Zoning Administrator and that such
questions shall be presented to the Board only on appeal from the decision of
the Zoning Administrator, and that recourse from the decisions of the Board
shall be to the courts as provided by law. It is further the intent of this
chapter that the duties of the Council in connection with this chapter shall
not include hearing and deciding questions of interpretation and enforcement
that may arise. The procedure for deciding such questions shall be as stated in
this section and in this chapter. Under this chapter, the Council shall have
only the duties of:
   1.   Considering Proposed Amendments. Considering and adopting or rejecting
proposed amendments or the repeal of this chapter as provided by law and
specified in Section
165.48,
165.49 and
165.50 of this chapter.
   2.   Considering Applications. Considering applications for special permits
for temporary uses as specified in Sections
165.33,
165.34 and
165.35 of this chapter.
165.48 CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS
   The Council may on its own motion or on petition after public notice and
hearing by the Council as provided by law (See Code of Iowa Section 414.4), and
after report by the Commission, amend, supplement or change the boundaries or
regulations herein or subsequently established. Any owner or owners of property
may present a petition duly signed and verified, requesting an amendment,
supplement or change in the regulations prescribed for a district or part
thereof. Amendments, supplements, or changes of the boundaries of districts as
shown on the official zoning map shall be made by ordinance. The amending
ordinance shall refer to the official zoning map and shall set out the
identification of the area affected by legal description and identify the
zoning district as the same exists and the new district designation applicable
to said property. The Commission shall make a report to the Council within 60
days from the date of receipt of such petition. In case the proposed amendment,
supplement or change is disapproved by the Commission, or in case of a protest
against any proposed amendment or change signed by the owners of 20 percent or
more, either of the area of the lots included in such proposed change, or of
those immediately adjacent in the rear thereof, extending the depth of one lot
or not to exceed 200 feet therefrom, or of those directly opposite thereto,
extending the depth of one lot or not to exceed 200 feet from the street
frontage of such opposite lots, such amendment shall not become effective
except by the favorable vote of at least four-fifths of all the members of the
Council. Said ordinance shall, after adoption and publication, be recorded by
the Clerk as other ordinances and a certified copy thereof attached to the
official zoning map. Such amendatory ordinance shall, however, not repeal or
re-enact said map, but only amend it. The official zoning map, together with
amending ordinances, shall be the final authority as the current zoning status
of land and water areas, buildings, and other structures in the City. (See
EDITOR’S NOTE at the end of this chapter for ordinances amending the zoning
map.)
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 414.5)
165.49 MAP REPLACEMENT
   In the event that the official zoning map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost
or difficult to interpret because of use, the Council may by resolution adopt a
new official zoning map which shall supersede the prior official zoning map.
The new official zoning map may correct drafting or other errors or omissions
in the prior official zoning map, but no such correction shall have the effect
of amending the original zoning ordinance or any subsequent amendment thereof.
The new official zoning map shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor
attested by the Clerk, under the following words:
This is to certify that this Official Zoning Map supersedes and replaces the
Official Zoning Map adopted (date of adoption of map being replaced)
as part of Ordinance No. ________ of the City of Aurelia, Iowa.
165.50 ZONING OF ANNEXED AREAS
   Procedures for the zoning of annexed areas are as follows:
   1.   Voluntary Annexations. All applications for voluntary annexation of
land to the City shall, in addition to the necessary requirements for
annexation, designate the zoning classification which the applicant wishes for
the property. Upon receipt thereof, the application shall be referred to the
Commission for recommendation on both the annexation and the requested zoning.
The Commission shall have the same time periods for its consideration as in any
rezoning matter. The Commission may recommend approval of the requested zoning
or the denial thereof. In the event the Commission recommends denial, they
shall make an additional recommendation as to what zoning classification the
Commission would recommend. A copy of this report shall be forwarded to the
applicant and shall be on the agenda for the next meeting of the Council. The
Council shall set the zoning matter for public hearing, prescribing the same
notice requirements as for a rezoning application and shall specify the
proposed zoning for consideration. If the Council approves the zone, it shall
be set by ordinance. No zoning classification not recommended by the Commission
shall become effective except by the favorable vote of four-fifths of the
members of the Council and no voluntary annexation not recommended by the
Commission shall be approved by the Council except by a favorable vote of four-
fifths of the members of the Council. The resolution providing for annexation
shall be acted upon by the Council at the time of the public hearing on the
zoning classification. In the event the applicant fails to designate a zoning
classification in the application, the Commission shall recommend a district
designation to the Council and the Council shall act upon the recommendation as
provided in this chapter.
   2.   Involuntary Annexations. Whenever, after public hearing thereon, the
Council determines that involuntary annexation proceedings should be undertaken
against lands to be annexed, the matter shall be referred to the Commission for
its recommendation as to the zoning of said lands. Upon receipt of said
recommendation, the Council shall hold a public hearing thereon, prescribing
the regular notice for rezoning set forth in this chapter. If the Council
approves said zoning, it shall adopt an ordinance setting forth the various
zoning classifications for said lands. The Council may approve a higher
classification or more restrictive classification than recommended by the
Commission after the hearing but prior to approval of any lower classification
or less restrictive classification, the Council must send the matter back to
the Commission for action on the lower classification. This may be done prior
to the public hearing. In the event it is returned subsequent to the public
hearing, a new public hearing shall be held thereon. If the Commission
recommends against the lower classification, it shall not become effective
except by a favorable vote of four-fifths of the members of the Council.
165.51 COMPLAINTS REGARDING VIOLATIONS
   Whenever a violation of this chapter occurs, or is alleged to have occurred,
any person may file a written complaint. Such complaint, stating fully the
causes and basis thereof, shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator. The
Zoning Administrator shall record properly such complaint, immediately
investigate and take action thereon as provided by this chapter.
165.52 SCHEDULE OF FEES.

license for any use, structure or purpose if the same would not conform to the
provisions of this chapter.
165.54 PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION
   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
its requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor. In addition to the standard
penalty, violators shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each
day such violations continue shall be considered a separate offense. The owner
or tenant of any building, structure, premises or part thereof, and any
architect, builder, contractor, agent or other person who commits, participates
in, assists in, or maintains such violation may each be found guilty of a
separate offense and suffer the penalties herein provided. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful action as is
necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

tentative approval of the plat. The application shall:
   1.   Forms and Fees. Be made on forms available from the Clerk together with
a fee of $10.00 per lot.
   2.   Number of Plats. Be accompanied by a minimum of 10 copies of the
preliminary plat.
   3.   Time of Submission. Be presented to the Clerk at least four weeks prior
to the meeting of the Commission.
166.11 REFERRAL OF PRELIMINARY PLAT
   The Clerk shall immediately refer two copies of the preliminary plat to the
City Engineer and seven copies to the Commission. In the case of a subdivision
outside the corporate limits of the City, the Clerk shall refer one copy of the
preliminary plat to the County Board of Supervisors.
166.12 REVIEW OF PRELIMINARY PLAT
   The preliminary plat shall be reviewed by the Commission to determine its
conformity with these regulations and all other ordinances and regulations in
force affecting subdivisions. Copies of the preliminary plat may be transmitted
to other City or school officials, as the Commission deems necessary, for their
recommendations concerning matters within their jurisdiction. Their
recommendations, along with those of the City Engineer, shall be transmitted to
the Commission within three weeks after the date the plat is filed. The
Commission may confer with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the
kind and extent of such improvements to be made.
166.13 ACTION BY THE COMMISSION ON PRELIMINARY PLAT
   The Commission, as soon as possible, but within 30 days after receiving the
preliminary plat, shall pass upon the preliminary plat as originally submitted
or modified. If the Commission does not act within 30 days, the preliminary
plat shall be deemed to be approved; provided, however, the subdivider may
agree to an extension of the time period, not to exceed an additional 60 days.
It shall then set forth its recommendations in writing, whether of approval,
modification or disapproval. If no action is taken by the Commission after the
agreed to 60-day extension, the preliminary plat shall be deemed to be
approved.
   1.   Reasons for Changes or Disapproval. In the event that substantial
changes or modifications are made by the Commission or the Commission
recommends disapproval of the plat, it shall give its reasons therefor and it
may request and cause the revised preliminary plat to be resubmitted in the
same manner as the original plat; however, no additional fee shall be required.
   2.   Tentative Approval. If the Commission recommends approval, it shall
express its approval as “Tentative Approval” and state the conditions of such
approval, if any.
   3.   Documenting Approval. The action of the Commission shall be documented
on seven copies of the preliminary plat, referenced and attached to any
conditions determined. One copy shall be returned to the subdivider, one copy
shall be retained by the Commission, and five copies shall be referred to the
Council, with the completed checklist for plats.
166.14 ACTION BY COUNCIL ON PRELIMINARY PLAT
   Within 30 days of its receipt of the preliminary plat, the Council shall, by
resolution, tentatively approve or disapprove the plat. If the preliminary plat
is disapproved, objections to it shall be returned to the Commission for
further review and the Clerk shall notify the subdivider of such action. If
approved, the Clerk shall affix his or her signature to five copies of the
preliminary plat with the notation of the date the preliminary plat received
the Council’s tentative approval. One copy shall be returned to the Commission
and three copies shall be returned to the subdivider. The “Tentative Approval”
by the Council shall not constitute final acceptance of the addition or
subdivision by the City but an authorization to proceed with preparation of the
final plat.
166.15 EFFECTIVE PERIOD OF TENTATIVE APPROVAL
   The tentative approval of a preliminary plat shall be effective for a period
of one year at the end of which time final approval must have been obtained.
Any plat not receiving final approval within this period of time shall be void,
and the subdivider shall be required to resubmit a new plat for tentative
approval subject to all new zoning restrictions and subdivision regulations.
166.16 COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS
   Before the Council will approve the final plat, all of the required
improvements shall be constructed and either accepted by formal resolution of
the Council or provided for as under Section
166.17. Before passage of said resolution of acceptance, the City Engineer
shall report that said improvements meet all City specifications and ordinances
or other City requirements, and the agreements between subdivider and the City.
166.17 PERFORMANCE BOND
   The completion requirement for improvements may be waived in whole or in
part if the subdivider will post a performance bond with the Council
guaranteeing that improvements not completed will be constructed within a
period of one year from final acceptance of the plat. A performance bond for
street paving is required guaranteeing that paving will be completed no less
than 12 months and no more than 24 months after completion and acceptance of
water and sewer. However, final acceptance of the plat will not constitute
final acceptance by the City of any improvements to be constructed.
Improvements will be accepted only after their construction has been completed.
Such performance bond shall be satisfactory to the City Attorney as to form,
sufficiency and manner of execution. Upon recommendation of the Commission, the
Council may extend the completion date set forth in the bond for a maximum
period of one additional year.
166.18 FINAL PLAT
   The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as
approved, and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that
portion of the approved preliminary plat which the subdivider proposes to
record and develop at the time, provided, however, that such portion conforms
to all requirements of these regulations.
166.19 REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINAL PLAT

indicated by a direct bearing reference or by an angle between the boundary
line and an intersecting line having a shown bearing, except when the boundary
line has an irregular or constantly changing course, as along a body of water,
or when a description of the boundary line is better achieved by measurements
shown at points or intervals along a meander line having a shown course. All
bearings and angles shown shall be given to at least the nearest minute of arc.
      K.   Curve data shall be stated in terms of radius, central angle and
tangent, or length of curve. In all cases, the curve data must be shown for the
line affected.

of the area shown on the final plat, but the subdivider or owner shall cause
such plat to be recorded in the office of the County Recorder, and shall file
satisfactory evidence of such recording in the office of the Clerk before the
City shall recognize the plat as being in full force and effect.
166.24 RESUBDIVISION OF LAND
   The following requirements shall govern the resubdividing of land.
   1.   Procedure for Resubdividing. For any change in a map of an approved or
recorded subdivision plat, if such change affects any street layout shown on
such map, or area reserved for public use indicated on the map, or any lot
line, or if it affects any map or plan legally established prior to the
adoption of any regulations controlling subdivisions, such parcel shall be
approved by the same procedure, rules and regulations as for a subdivision.
   2.   Acreage Lots. Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the
subdivision plat shows one or more lots containing more than one acre of land
and there are indications that such lots will eventually be resubdivided into
smaller building sites, the Commission and Council may require that such parcel
of land allow for future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of
adjacent streets. Easements providing for the future opening and extension of
such streets may be made a requirement of the plat.
166.25 COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS
   Before the final plat is approved by the Council, all applicants shall be
required to complete, in accordance with the Council’s decision and to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer, all the street, sanitary sewer, water and
other improvements as required in these regulations, specified in the final
plat, and as approved by the Council, and to dedicate the same to the City,
free and clear of all liens and encumbrances on the property and public
improvements thus dedicated.
166.26 PERFORMANCE BOND
   The Council in its discretion may waive the requirement that the applicant
complete and dedicate all public improvements prior to approving the final
plat, and that, as an alternative, the applicant post a bond in accordance with
Section
166.17 at the time of application for final plat approval in an amount
estimated by the Council as sufficient to secure to the City the satisfactory
construction, installation and dedication of the incomplete portion of required
improvements. In addition:
   1.   Approved by City Attorney. Such performance bond shall comply with all
statutory requirements and shall be satisfactory to the City Attorney as to
form, sufficiency, and manner of execution as set forth in these regulations.
   2.   Completion Period. The period within which required improvements must
be completed shall be specified by the Council in the resolution approving the
final plat shall be incorporated in the bond, and shall not exceed one year
from date of final approval.
   3.   Extension of Completion Period. The performance bond shall be approved
by the Council as to the amount and surety and conditions satisfactory to the
Council. The Commission may, upon proof of difficulty, recommend to the Council
an extension of the completion date set forth in such bond for a maximum period
of one additional year. The Council may at any time during the period of such
bond accept a substitution of principal or sureties on the bond.
   4.   Temporary Improvements. The applicant shall build and pay for all costs
of temporary improvements required by the Council and shall maintain same for
the period specified by the Council. Prior to the construction of any temporary
facility or improvement, the developer shall file with the City a separate
suitable bond for temporary facilities, which bond shall insure that the
temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained and removed.
   5.   Failure to Complete Improvement. For subdivisions for which no
performance bond has been posted, if the improvements are not completed within
the period specified by the Council in the resolution approving the plat, the
approval shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases where a performance
bond has been posted and required improvements have not been installed within
the terms of such performance bond, the City may declare the bond to be in
default and require that all the improvements be installed regardless of the
extent of the building development at the time the bond is declared to be in
default.
166.27 INSPECTION OF IMPROVEMENTS
   The Council shall provide for inspection of required improvements during
construction and insure their satisfactory completion. The applicant shall pay
to the City an inspection fee equal to the actual cost of inspection. These
fees shall be due and payable upon demand of the City and no building permits
or certificates of occupancy shall be issued until all fees are paid. The
subdivider shall furnish the Council with a construction schedule prior to the
commencement of any and all construction, and notify the City not less than 24
hours in advance of readiness for required inspections.
166.28 RELEASE OR REDUCTION OF PERFORMANCE BOND
   The performance bond may not be released or reduced except as follows:
   1.   Certificate of Satisfactory Completion. The Council will not accept
dedication of required improvements, nor release or reduce a performance bond,
until the City Engineer has submitted a certificate stating that all required
improvements have been satisfactorily completed and until the applicant’s
engineer has certified to the City through submission of detailed “as built”
plans of the subdivision indicating location, dimensions, materials and other
information required by the City, that all public improvements are in
accordance with construction plans for the subdivision.
   2.   Reduction of Performance Bond. A performance bond may be reduced upon
actual dedication of public improvements and then only to the ratio that the
public improvement dedicated bears to the total public improvements for the
plat.
166.29 MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS
   Improvements shall be maintained and a maintenance bond provided as follows:
   1.   Maintenance of Improvements Before Acceptance. The applicant shall be
required to maintain all improvements on the individual subdivided lots and
provide for snow removal on streets and sidewalks, if required, until
acceptance of said improvements by the Council. If there are any certificates
of occupancy on a street not dedicated to the City, the City may, on 12 hours’
notice, plow the street or effect emergency repairs and charge same to
applicant.
   2.   Maintenance Bond. The applicant shall be required to file a maintenance
bond with the Council, prior to dedication, in an amount considered adequate by
the Council and in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney, in order to assure
the satisfactory condition of the required improvements for a period of two
years after the date of their acceptance by the Council and dedication of same
to the Council.
166.30 DEFERRAL OR WAIVER OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
   Required improvements may be deferred or waived as follows:
   1.   Waiver of Required Improvements. The Council may defer or waive at the
time of final approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any
or all such improvements as in its judgment are not requisite in the interests
of the public health, safety and general welfare, or which are inappropriate
because of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities.
   2.   Deferral of Required Improvements. Whenever it is deemed necessary by
the Council to defer the construction of any improvement required herein
because of incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate or lack of
connecting facilities, or for other reasons, the applicant shall pay his or her
share of the costs of the future improvements to the City prior to the approval
of the final plat, or the applicant may post a bond insuring completion of said
improvements upon demand of the City.
166.31 ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY
   No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the extent of street
improvement is adequate for vehicular access by the prospective occupant and by
police and fire equipment.
166.32 IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED
   The subdivider shall install and construct all improvements required by
these regulations in accordance with the specifications and under the
supervision of the Council and to its satisfaction.

subdivision is not in conformance with the above guides or policy and purposes
of these regulations.
166.35 SUBDIVISION NAME
   The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate, or too closely
approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision in the area covered
by these regulations. The Council, after consultation with the Commission,
shall have the final authority to designate the name of the subdivision which
shall be determined at preliminary plat approval.
166.36 MONUMENTATION
   Monuments shall be in conformance with the following requirements:
   1.   Establishment of Permanent Control Monuments. Prior to the offering of
the plat of any subdivision for record, the surveyor shall confirm the prior
establishment of permanent control monuments at each controlling corner on the
boundaries of the parcel or tract of land being subdivided. If no permanent
control monuments exist, the surveyor shall establish at least two permanent
control monuments for each block created, or if the area subdivided into lots
is less than a block in size, at least two permanent control monuments shall be
established for the subdivision. Permanent control monuments shall be
constructed of reasonably permanent material solidly embedded in the ground and
capable of being detected by commonly used magnetic or electronic equipment.
The surveyor shall affix a cap of reasonably inert material bearing an embossed
or stencil cut marking of the Iowa registration number of the surveyor to the
top of the monument.
   2.   Other Monuments of Record. Other monuments established prior to the
recording of the plat of the subdivision and described on the plat shall be
considered monuments of record and shall be given the same weight as original
permanent control monuments if the monuments remain undisturbed in their
original positions. The additional monuments shall be constructed and embedded
according to the provisions for permanent control monuments prescribed in
subsection 1 of this section.
   3.   Establishment and Recording of Other Monuments. Monuments other than
the permanent control monuments required in subsection 1 of this section shall
not be required to be established before the recording of the plat or the
conveyancing of lands by reference to the plat if the registered land surveyor
includes in the surveyor’s statement on the plat that the additional monuments
required by these regulations shall be established before a specified future
date.
   4.   Additional Monuments Required. Additional monuments shall be
constructed and embedded according to the provisions for permanent control
monuments prescribed in subsection 1 of this section, and shall be set in all
of the following locations whether set prior to the recording of the plat, or
subsequent to such recording:
      A.   At every corner and angle point of every lot, block or parcel of
land created.
      B.   At every point of intersection of the outer boundary of the
subdivision with an existing or created right-of-way line of any street,
railroad or other way.
      C.   At every point of curve, tangency, reversed curve or compounded
curve on every right-of-way line established.
   5.   Placement of Monument. When the placement of a monument required by
this chapter at the prescribed location is impractical, it is permissible to
establish a reference monument in close proximity to the prescribed location.
If the reference monument is established prior to the recording of the plat and
its location properly shown on the plat, the reference monument shall have the
same status as other monuments of record. Where any point requiring
monumentation has been previously monumented, the existence of the monument
shall be confirmed by the surveyor. The existing monument shall be considered a
monument of record when properly shown and described on the recorded plat.
166.37 CHARACTER OF THE LAND
   Land which the City finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or development
due to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse
earth formations or topography, utility easements or other features which will
reasonably be harmful to the safety, health and general welfare of the present
or future inhabitants of the subdivision or its surrounding areas or both,
shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are formulated by
the subdivider and approved by the Council, upon recommendation of the
Commission, to solve the problems created by the unsuitable land conditions.
Such land shall be set aside for uses as shall not involve such a danger.
166.38 LOTS

and industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service
and parking facilities required by the type of use and development
contemplated.
      C.   Corner lots for residential use shall have an extra 20 feet of width
to permit appropriate building setback from and orientation to both streets.
   2.   Street Access. Each lot shall be provided with satisfactory access to a
public street.
   3.   Double Frontage and Reverse Frontage Lots. Double frontage and reverse
frontage lots shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of
residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific
disadvantages of topography and orientation. A planting screen easement of at
least 10 feet, and across which there shall be no right of access, shall be
provided along the line of lots abutting such a traffic artery or other
disadvantageous use.
   4.   Side Lot Lines. Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles
to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines.
   5.   Lot Drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage
away from all buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with
the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so
as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent
lots.
   6.   Building Lines. Building lines conforming with zoning standards shall
be shown on all lots within the platted area. Where the subdivided area is not
under zoning control, the Council may require building lines in accordance with
the needs of each subdivision.
166.39 BLOCKS.
   Blocks shall conform to the following requirements:
   1.   Provision for Lots. Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for
two tiers of lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions shall be permitted in
blocks adjacent to arterial streets, railroads or waterways.
   2.   Design Considerations. The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall
be determined with due regard to:
      A.   Provision for adequate building sites.
      B.   Zoning requirements where applicable.
      C.   Topography.
      D.   Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of
street traffic.
   3.   Block Lengths. The lengths of blocks shall be appropriate to the type
of development contemplated, but block lengths in residential developments
shall not exceed 2,000 feet, or be less than 500 feet. Wherever practicable,
blocks along arterials and collector streets shall not be less than 1,000 feet
in length.
   4.   Easement Reservation. In blocks over 800 feet in length, the Council
may require the reservation of an easement to accommodate utilities, drainage
facilities or pedestrian traffic.
   5.   Pedestrian Crosswalks. Pedestrian crosswalks, not less than 10 feet
wide, may be required by the Council through the center of blocks more than 800
feet in length. Pedestrian crosswalks shall not exceed 12 percent in grade
unless steps of an approved design are to be constructed.
166.40 STREETS – GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
   Streets shall conform with the following general requirements:
   1.   Frontage on Improved Roads. No subdivision shall be approved unless the
area to be subdivided shall have frontage on and access from an existing
street.
   2.   Grading and Improvement Plan. Streets shall be graded and improved and
conform to the City construction standards and specifications and shall be
approved as to design and specifications by the City Engineer, in accordance
with the construction plans required to be submitted.
   3.   Topography and Arrangement. Streets shall be in conformance with the
following requirements related to topography and arrangement:
      A.   Streets shall be related appropriately to be topography. All streets
shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as possible of the building sites at
or above the grades of the streets. Grades of streets shall conform as closely
as possible to the original topography. A combination of steep grades and
curves shall be avoided. Specific standards are contained in the design
standards of these regulations.
      B.   All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and
proposed system of streets and dedicated right-of-way.
      C.   All arterials shall be properly related to special traffic
generators such as industries, business districts, schools, churches and
shopping centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and
proposed land uses.
      D.   Municipal service streets shall be laid out to conform as much as
possible to the topography to discourage use by through traffic, to permit
efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of
streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property.
      E.   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical
conditions, or unless in the opinion of the Council such extension is not
necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision
with the existing layout or the most advantageous future development of
adjacent tracts.
      F.   In business and industrial developments, the streets and other
accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings,
location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and
maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of
movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian.
   4.   Access to State or County Jurisdictional Roads. Whenever any part of a
subdivision is designed with access to a road under State or County
jurisdiction, permission for access to such roads shall be obtained from the
appropriate jurisdiction and such access shall be designed according to the
standards of the appropriate jurisdiction.
   5.   Access to Arterial Streets. Where a subdivision borders on or contains
an existing or proposed arterial street, the Council may require that lot
access to such streets be limited by one of the following means:
      A.   Lots shall be designed so as to back onto the primary arterial and
front onto a parallel municipal service street; no access shall be provided
from the arterial street, and screening shall be provided in a strip of land
along the rear property line of such lots.
      B.   A series of cul-de-sacs entered from and designed generally at right
angles to such a parallel street, with the rear lines of their terminal lots
backing onto the arterial street.
      C.   A frontage or service road, separated from the primary arterial by a
planting or grass strip and having access thereto at suitable points.
   6.   Street Names. Streets that are in alignment with others already
existing shall bear the name of the existing streets. The proposed names of new
streets shall not duplicate or sound similar to existing street names. Street
names shall be subject to the approval of the Council and Commission.
   7.   Street Name Signs. Street name signs are to be placed at all
intersections within or abutting the subdivision, the type and location of
which to be approved by the Council. The City shall install all street name
signs. The applicant shall deposit with the City at the time of final
subdivision approval the estimated cost of installation of each street sign
required by the Council.
   8.   Street Lights. Installation of street lights shall be required in
accordance with design and specification standards approved by the Council
after consultation with the Board of Trustees of the Aurelia Municipal Electric
Utility.
   9.   Construction of Streets and Dead-end Streets. Streets and dead-end
streets shall be in conformance with the following requirements:
      A.   Construction of Streets. The arrangement of streets shall provide
for the continuation of principal streets between adjacent properties when such
continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire
protection, and for efficient provision of utilities. If the adjacent property
is undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right-
of-way shall be extended to the property line. A temporary T or L shaped
turnabout shall be provided on all temporary dead-end streets, with the
notation on the subdivision plat that land outside the normal street right-of-
way shall revert to abutters whenever the street is continued. The Council may
limit the length of temporary dead-end streets in accordance with the design
standards of these regulations.
      B.   Permanent Dead-end Streets. Where a road does not extend to the
boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by the Council
for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall normally not be nearer to
such boundary than 150 feet. However, the Council may require the reservation
of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian
traffic or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be provided at the end of a
permanent dead-end street in accordance with City construction standards and
specifications. For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police
and fire protection, permanent dead-end streets shall, in general, be limited
in length in accordance with the design standards of these regulations.
166.41 STREETS – DESIGN STANDARDS
   The following design standards shall apply to the design of streets:
   1.   General. In order to provide for streets of suitable location, width
and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory
access to police, fire fighting, snow removal, sanitation and street
maintenance equipment, and to coordinate streets so as to compose a convenient
system and avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, the following design
standards for streets are hereby required:
      A.   A tangent of at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between
reverse curves on municipal arterial and municipal collector streets, and 75
feet on municipal service streets.
      B.   When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one
point by more than 10 degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius
adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than 100 feet for municipal
service and municipal collector streets, and of such greater radii as the
Council shall determine for special cases.
      C.   Minimum Roadway and Right-of-way Standards:
         (1)   Municipal arterial streets shall have a right-of-way width of
not less than 80 feet and a roadway width of not less than 44 feet.
         (2)   Municipal collector streets shall have a right-of-way width of
not less than 60 feet and a roadway width of not less than 36 feet.
         (3)    Municipal service streets shall have a right-of-way width of
not less than 50 feet and a roadway width of not less than 26 feet.
         (4)   Frontage streets shall have a right-of-way width of not less
than 40 feet and a roadway width of not less than 26 feet.
         (5)   Cul-de-sacs shall meet all the requirements for a municipal
service street and, in addition, shall provide a turnaround with a right-of-way
radius of 50 feet and a roadway radius of 40 feet. No cul-de-sac shall exceed
500 feet in length.
      D.   Street grades, wherever feasible, shall not exceed the following:
         (1)   Municipal arterial streets – six percent;
         (2)   Municipal collector streets – eight percent;
         (3)   Municipal service streets – 10 percent;
         (4)   Frontage streets – six percent.
      E.   All changes in street grade shall be connected by vertical curves of
minimum length in feet equal to 20 times the algebraic difference in
percentages of grade.
      F.   No street grade shall be less than one-half of one percent.
   2.   Street Surfacing and Improvements. At least 12 but not more than 24
months after sewer, water and other utilities to be located underground within
the right-of-way have been installed by the applicant, the applicant shall
construct curbs and gutters and shall surface or cause to be surfaced roadways
to the widths prescribed in these regulations. Said surfacing shall be of
Portland concrete cement. Adequate provisions shall be made for culverts,
drains and bridges. All road pavement, shoulders, drainage improvements and
structure, curbs, turnarounds and sidewalks shall conform to all construction
standards and specifications adopted by the City, and shall be incorporated
into the construction plans required to be submitted by the developer for plat
approval.
   3.   Excess Right-of-way. Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards
designated in these regulations shall be required whenever, due to topography,
additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes. Such slopes
shall not be in excess of three to one.
   4.   Railroads and Limited Access Highways. Railroad rights-of-way and
limited access highways were so located as to affect the subdivision of
adjoining lands shall be treated as follows:
      A.   In residential districts, a buffer strip at least 25 feet in depth
in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be
provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway. This
strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the plat:
“This strip is reserved for screening. The placement of structures hereon is
prohibited.”
      B.   In districts zoned for business, commercial or industrial uses, the
nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad
shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure
suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
      C.   Streets parallel to the railroad when intersecting a street which
crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a
distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance
shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for
future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
   5.   Intersections. The following standards shall apply to the design of
intersections:
      A.   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible
at right angles. A proposed intersection of two new streets at an angle of less
than 75 degrees shall not be acceptable. An oblique street should be curved
approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right angles for at
least 100 feet therefrom. No more than two streets shall intersect at any one
point unless specifically approved by the Council.
      B.   Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street
shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the
opposite side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than
150 feet shall not be permitted, except where the intersected street has
separated dual drives without median breaks at either intersection. Where
streets intersect major streets, their alignment shall be continuous.
Intersection of major streets shall be at least 800 feet apart.
      C.   Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two municipal service
streets shall be at least 20 feet; and minimum curb radius at an intersection
involving a municipal collector street shall be at least 25 feet. Abrupt
changes in alignment within a block shall have the corners cut off in
accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe vehicular
movement.
      D.   Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever
practical. In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a
leveling area shall be provided having not greater than a two percent rate at a
distance of 60 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the
intersecting street.
      E.   Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing
vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting
visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation, including
trees, in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent
deemed necessary to provide an adequate sight distance.
      F.   The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall be
three percent or less.
   6.   Bridges. Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined by
the Council, shall be constructed at the full expense of the applicant without
reimbursement from the City. The sharing expense for the construction of
bridges not of primary benefit to the applicant as determined by the Council,
will be fixed by special agreement between the Council and the applicant. Said
cost shall be charged to the applicant pro rata as the percentage of his or her
land developed and so served.
   7.   Alleys. The following design standards for alleys shall be required of
all subdividers:
      A.   Alleys shall be prohibited in residential districts.
      B.   Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts,
except that the Council may waive this requirement where other definite and
assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading,
unloading and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed.
      C.   Alleys shall have a right-of-way of not less than 30 feet and a
roadway width of not less than 20 feet.
      D.   Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided,
but where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit safe
vehicular movement.
      E.   Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable,
shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead end, as
determined by the Council.
   8.   Street Dedications and Reservations. The following provisions shall
apply to street dedications and reservations:
      A.   Street systems in new subdivisions shall be laid out so as to
eliminate or avoid new perimeter half streets. Where an existing half street is
adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the street shall be improved
and dedicated by the subdivider. The Council may authorize a new perimeter
street where the subdivider improves and dedicates the entire required street
right-of-way width within his or her own subdivision boundaries.
      B.   Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow street or when City
plans or zoning setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening
a road that would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the
applicant shall be required to improve and dedicate at his expense such areas
for widening or realignment of such roads. Such frontage roads and streets
shall be improved and dedicated by the applicant at his or her own expense to
the full width as required by these subdivision regulations. Land reserved for
any street purposes may not be counted in satisfying yard or area requirements
of the zoning regulations whether the land is to be dedicated to the City in
fee simple or an easement is granted to the City.
166.42 STORM SEWERS AND DRAINAGE
   The following requirements shall apply to the provision of storm sewers and
drainage:
   1.   General Requirements. The Commission shall not recommend for approval
any plat of a subdivision which does not make adequate provision for storm or
flood water run-off channels or basins. The storm water drainage system shall
be separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers, where
required, shall be designed by methods as approved by the Council, and a copy
of design computations shall be submitted along with plans. Inlets shall be
provided so that surface water is not carried across or around any
intersection, or for a distance of more than 600 feet in the gutter. When
calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a point, no further
allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point, and basins shall be used to
intercept flow at that point. Surface water drainage patterns shall be shown
for each and every lot and block. Storm sewers, where required, shall be
installed at the time of curb and gutter construction.
   2.   Nature of Storm Water Facilities. The applicant may be required by the
Council to carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that
may exist either previously to or as a result of the subdivision. Such drainage
facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible, or in
perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width, and shall be constructed
in accordance with the construction standards and specifications.
      A.   Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the applicant shall
install storm sewer facilities, or if no outlets are within a reasonable
distance, adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of storm waters,
subject to the specifications of the Council. However, in subdivisions
containing lots less than 15,000 square feet in area and in business and
industrial districts, underground storm sewer systems shall be constructed
throughout the subdivisions and be conducted to an approved outfall.
      B.   If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided eventually,
as determined by the Council, the subdivider shall make arrangement for future
storm water disposal by a public storm sewer system at the time the plat
receives final approval. Provision for such connection shall be incorporated by
inclusion in the performance bond required for the subdivision plat.
      C.   A culvert or other drainage facility shall in each case be large
enough to accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area,
whether inside or outside the subdivision. The Council shall determine the
necessary size of the facility, based on the provisions of the construction
standards and specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed
development permitted by applicable zoning regulations.
      D.   The Council shall also study the effect of each subdivision on
existing downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision.
City drainage studies together with such other studies as shall be appropriate
shall serve as a guide to needed improvements. Where it is anticipated that the
additional runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will overload
an existing downstream drainage facility, the Council may withhold approval of
the subdivision until provision has been made for the recovery of the cost for
the improvement of said potential condition in such sum as the Council shall
determine. No subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be
provided to an adequate drainage watercourse or facility.
      E.   The Council may, when it deems it necessary for the health, safety
or welfare of the present and future population of the area and necessary to
the conservation of water, drainage and sanitary facilities, prohibit the
subdivision of any portion of the property which lies within the flood plain of
any stream or drainage course.
   3.   Dedication of Drainage Easements. The following shall apply to the
dedication of drainage easements.
      A.   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel or stream, there shall be provided a storm water easement or drainage
right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse, and of
such width and construction or both as will be adequate for the purpose.
Wherever possible, it is desirable that the drainage be maintained by an open
channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume
of flow.
      B.   Drainage easements:
         (1)   Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within street rights-of-way,
perpetual unobstructed easements at least 15 feet in width for such drainage
facilities shall be provided across property outside the street lines and with
satisfactory access to the road. Easements shall be indicated on the plat.
Drainage easements shall be carried from the street to a natural watercourse or
to other drainage facilities.

plans of other public bodies to be used for schools or parks, the developer
shall reserve such site for such use. If sites which have been reserved are not
acquired by the City or other public body within two years of the date of the
preliminary plat approval, then such sites may be subdivided by the developer.
The appropriate public body may release the reserved site sooner by certifying
to the Council that it does not intend to acquire such site within the two-year
period.

and completed public roads shall be accepted by the Board of Supervisors for
public maintenance.
166.51 VARIATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS
   The following shall apply to the granting of variations and exceptions:
   1.   Hardships. Where the Council finds that extraordinary hardships or
particular difficulties regarding the physical development of land may result
from strict compliance with these regulations, it may make variations or
exceptions to the regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the
public interest secured, provided that such variation or exception shall not
have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations; and
further provided, the Council shall not grant variations or exceptions to these
regulations unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to
it in each specific case that:
      A.   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health or welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located.
      B.   The conditions upon which the request for a variation is based are
unique to the property for which the variation is sought, and are not
applicable, generally, to other property.
      C.   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out.
      D.   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire
to make more money out of the property.
   2.   Conditions. In granting variations and exceptions the Council may
require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the
objectives of the standards or requirements of these regulations.
   3.   Procedure for a Variance. A petition for any such variance shall be
submitted in writing by the developer at the time when the preliminary plat is
filed. The petition shall state fully the grounds for the application and all
of the facts relied upon by the petitioner.
166.52 CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS
   Any provisions of these regulations may be changed and amended from time to
time by the Council; provided, however, that such changes or amendments shall
not become effective until after a public hearing has been held, public notice
of which shall have been given as required by law. Such proposed amendments
shall first be submitted to the Commission for study and recommendation before
the hearing is held. The Commission shall forward its recommendations to the
Council within 30 days, after which the Council shall give notice of and hold a
public hearing on the proposed amendment.
166.53 ENFORCEMENT, VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES
   No plat or subdivision within the City or within two miles thereof shall be
filed or recorded with the County, nor shall any plat or subdivision have any
validity until it complies with the provision of these regulations, has been
approved by the Council as herein set forth, and further:
   1.   Issuance of Building Permits. No more than two building permits for
each separate tract existing at the time of the effective date of these
regulations shall be issued unless the tract has been platted in accordance
with these regulations; except that this provision shall not limit the number
of building permits that may be issued for accessory buildings as defined by
applicable land use regulations such as zoning and restricted residence
regulations or additions or improvements to a main or accessory building
already legally located upon said tract.
   2.   Sale or Lease Without Plat. Any person who shall dispose of or offer
for sale or lease any lots in the City or addition to the City, until the plat
thereof has been acknowledged and recorded as provided in these regulations,
shall forfeit and pay $50.00 for each lot and part of lot sold or disposed of,
leased or offered for sale.
