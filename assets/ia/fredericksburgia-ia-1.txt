perform any act or duty required by the same, with the exception of those

   (C)   Environmental violation. A municipal infraction which is a violation
of Iowa Code Ch. 455B or of a standard established by the city in consultation

applicable until the city has offered to participate in informal negotiations

or requirement referred to in 40 C.F.R. § 403.8;

a violation exists or continues.
         (b)   A municipal infraction classified as an environmental violation
is punishable by a penalty of not more than $1,000 for each occurrence.

startup, cleaning, repairing, performing scheduled maintenance, testing, or
conducting a shutdown of either equipment causing the violation or the
equipment designed to reduce or eliminate the violation;

and subject to the conditions of Rule of Civil Procedure 1.311. A copy of the

      (7)   The penalty for failure to appear in court.
(Prior Code, § 4.04)
   (F)   Alternative relief. Seeking a civil penalty as authorized in this

court in the same action. Such alternative relief may include, but is not
limited to, an order for abatement or injunctive relief.
(Prior Code, § 4.05)
   (G)   Criminal penalties. This section does not preclude a peace officer
from issuing a criminal citation for a violation of this code of ordinances or

this code of ordinances by criminal sanctions or other lawful means.
(Prior Code, § 4.06)
Statutory reference:
   Related provisions, see Iowa Code §§ 364.22(1), 364.22(3), 364.22(4), 364.22
(8), 364.22(11), and 364.3(2)
APPENDIX A: USE AND MAINTENANCE IN THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
The following information is provided to assist in the use and proper
maintenance of this Code of Ordinances.
   DISTRIBUTION OF COPIES
   1.   OFFICIAL COPY. The “OFFICIAL COPY” of the Code of Ordinances must be
kept by the City Clerk and should be. identified as the “OFFICIAL COPY.”
   2.   DISTRIBUTION. Other copies of the Code of Ordinances should be made
available to all persons having a relatively frequent and continuing need to
have access to ordinances which are in effect in the City as well as reference
centers such as the City Library, County Law Library and perhaps the schools.
   3.   SALE. The sale or distribution of copies in a general fashion is not
recommended as experience indicates that indiscriminate distribution tends to
result in outdated codes being used or misused.
   4.   RECORD OF DISTRIBUTION. The City Clerk should be responsible for
maintaining an accurate and current record of persons having a copy of the Code
of Ordinances. Each official, elected or appointed, should return to the City,
upon leaving office, all documents, records and other materials pe1taining to
the office, including this Code of Ordinances.
   (Iowa Code § 372.13(4))
   NUMBERING OF ORDINANCES AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
It is recommended that a simple numerical sequence be used in assigning
ordinance numbers to ordinances as they are passed. For example, if the
ordinance adopting the Code of Ordinances was No. 163, we would suggest that
the fu.st ordinance passed changing, adding to or deleting from the Code be
assigned the number 164; the next ordinance be assigned the number 165, and so
on. We advise against using the Code of Ordinances numbering system for the
numbering of ordinances.
   RETENTION OF AMENDING ORDINANCES
Please note that two books should be maintained: (1) the Code of Ordinances,
and (2) an ordinance book. We will assist in the maintenance of the Code of
Ordinances book, per the Supplement Agreement, by revising and returning
appropriate pages for the Code of Ordinances book as required to accommodate
ordinances amending the Code. The City Clerk is responsible for maintaining the
ordinance book and must be sure that an original copy of each ordinance
adopted, bearing the signatures of the Mayor and Clerk, is inserted in the
ordinance book and preserved in a safe place.
   SUPPLEMENT RECORD
A record of all supplements prepared for the Code of Ordinances is provided in
the front of the Code. This record will indicate the number and date of the
ordinances adopting the original Code and of each subsequently adopted
ordinance which has been incorporated in the Code. For each supplemented
ordinance, the Supplement Record will list the ordinance number, date, topic,
and chapter number of the Code affected by the amending ordinance. A periodic
review of the Supplement Record and ordinances passed will assure that all
ordinances amending the Code have been incorporated therein.
   DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPLEMENTS
Supplements containing revised pages for insertion in each Code will be sent to
the Clerk. It is the responsibility of the Clerk to see that each person having
a Code of Ordinances receives each supplement so that each Code may be properly
updated to reflect action of the Council in amending the Code.
   AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
The Code of Ordinances contains most of the laws of the City as of the date of
its adoption and is continually subject to amendment to reflect changing
policies of the Council, mandates of the State, or decisions of the Courts,
Amendments to the Code of Ordinances can only be accomplished by the adoption
of an ordinance.

may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building
sewer.
   (C)   Installation. The connection of the building sewer into the public
sewer shall conform to the requirements of Division 4, Plumbing Rules and
Regulations, of the State Building Code, applicable rules and regulations of
the city, or the procedures set forth in A.S.T.M. Specification C-12. All such
connections shall be made gaslight and watertight. Any deviation from the
prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the Superintendent
before installation.
   (D)   Water lines. When possible, building sewers should be laid at least
ten feet horizontally from a water service. The horizontal separation may be
less; provided, the water service line is located at one side and at least 12
inches above the top of the building sewer.
   (E)   Size. Building sewers shall be sized for the peak expected sewage flow
from the building with a minimum building sewer size of four inches.
   (F)   Alignment and grade. All building sewers shall be laid to a straight
line to meet the following:

building at an elevation below the basement floor. The depth of cover above the
sewer shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost.
   (H)   Sewage lifts. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low
to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such
drain shall be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the
building sewer.
   (I)   Pipe specifications. Building sewer pipe shall be free from flaws,
splits, or breaks. Materials shall be as specified in Division 4 of the State
Building Code except that the building sewer pipe, from the property line to

Superintendent. Solvent-welded joints are not permitted.
   (L)   Unstable soil. No sewer connection shall be laid so that it is exposed
when crossing any watercourse. Where an old watercourse must of necessity be
crossed or where there is any danger of undermining or settlement, cast iron
soil pipe or vitrified clay sewer pipe thoroughly encased in concrete shall be
required for such crossings. Such encasement shall extend at least six inches
on all sides of the pipe. The cast iron pipe or encased clay pipe shall rest on
firm, solid material at either end.
   (M)   Preparation of basement or crawl space. No connection for any
residence, business, or other structure with any sanitary sewer shall be made
unless the basement floor is poured, or in the case of a building with a slab
or crawl space, unless the ground floor is installed with the area adjacent to
the foundation of such building cleared of debris and backfilled. The backfill
shall be well compacted and graded so that the drainage is away from the
foundation. Prior to the time the basement floor is poured, or the first floor
is installed in buildings without basements, the sewer shall be plugged and the
plug shall be sealed by the Superintendent. Any accumulation of water in any
excavation or basement during construction and prior to connection to the
sanitary sewer shall be removed by means other than draining into the sanitary
sewer.

repaired promptly. This should be in the form of a licensed plumber’s invoice
or statement or a materials receipt.
      (3)   The adjustment may be granted only for the billing period prior to

§ 152.03 PLAT APPROVAL AND ACCEPTANCE.
   Procedures for plat approval and acceptance are as follows.
   (A)   Preliminary approval by City Engineer. Whenever the owner of any tract
or parcel of land is required by law to secure the approval of the Council to
any plat or subdivision, said owner shall file said preliminary plat in
triplicate, together with any other required information, with the City Clerk.
Two copies of said plat and other information shall be referred by the City
Clerk to the City Engineer for preliminary study and approval. Such preliminary
plat shall contain such information and data as outlined in §
152.02.
   (B)   Study of preliminary plat by the City Engineer. The City Engineer
shall study such preliminary plat and other information submitted to see if it
conforms with the requirements of this chapter and shall approve or reject such
plat and plan within 30 days after the date of the submission thereof. The
approval of the preliminary plat and plan constitutes authorization to proceed
with the preparation of the final plat, but the final plat must be submitted to
the Council for approval as provided in the following section.
   (C)   Final plat of subdivision. The subdivider shall also file with the
City Clerk for submission to the City Engineer, for approval or rejection, the
final plat and plan of the subdivision which shall contain the data and
information outlined in §
152.04(B). If the City Engineer approves the final plat and plan, such approval
and the date thereof shall be noted on the plat and plan.
   (D)   Approval by the Council. After the approval of the final plat and plan
by the City Engineer, it shall be submitted to the Council for final approval
and for acceptance of all streets, alleys, easements, parks, or other areas
preserved for or dedicated to the public.
   (E)   Approval by the Council after the disapproval by the City Engineer. If
the City Engineer does not approve the final plat and plan of the subdivision,
the Council may approve said plat and plan and accept the streets, alleys,
easements, parks, or other areas preserved for or dedicated to the public by
said plat or plan, only by a four-fifths vote of the entire membership of the
Council.
   (F)   Filing in office of City Clerk. After approval of the final plat and
plan by the Council, two copies of such final plat and plan shall be filed in
the office of the City Clerk.
(Prior Code, § 165.03)
§ 152.04 INFORMATION REQUIRED ON PLATS.
   Plat information requirements are as follows.
   (A)   Preliminary plat. In seeking to subdivide land, the owner shall submit
two copies of a preliminary plat before submission of the final plat. The
preliminary plat shall be drawn to scale and shall show the proposed location
and width of streets, lot shall be drawn to scale and shall show the proposed
location and width of streets, lot lines, building lines, and areas of each
proposed lot. The plat shall also show surrounding streets, lots, water
courses, sewers, and water mains. The scale of such preliminary plat shall not
be less than one inch to 100 feet. Wherever the land is so rolling or rugged
that the preliminary location and grades of streets and sewers cannot be
properly considered without the aid of a topographical map, the Council may
require the developer to provide a topographical map of the property showing
contour intervals of not less than five feet. Any plat not containing all
information specified above shall not be considered by the Council. A filing
fee of $100 shall be required to cover processing costs.
   (B)   Final plat. The final map on a reproducible original (mylar) and two
prints thereof shall be submitted to the Council. It shall show:
      (1)   The boundaries of the property;
      (2)   The lines of all proposed streets and alleys, with their widths and
names, and any other areas intended to be dedicated to public use; the names of
the streets shall be a continuation of the existing method of naming streets in
the city;
      (3)   The lines of adjoining streets and alleys, with their widths and
names;
      (4)   All lot lines, building lines, and easements, with figures showing
their dimensions;
      (5)   All dimensions, both linear and angular, necessary for locating
boundaries of the subdivided area or of the lots, streets, alleys, easements,
and building line setbacks, and any other similar public or private uses. The
linear dimensions shall be expressed in feet and decimals of a foot;
      (6)   Radii, arcs, and chords, points of tangency, central angles for all
curvilinear streets, and radii for all rounded corners;
      (7)   All monuments, together with their descriptions;
      (8)   Title and description of property subdivided, showing its location
and extent, points of compass, scale of plan, classification of property under
zoning law, and name of subdivider and of registered land surveyor staking the
lots;
      (9)   Profiles may be required of any streets;
      (10)   Any private restrictions shall be shown on the plat or reference
made to them thereon; and plats shall contain proper acknowledgments of owners
and mortgagees accepting said platting and restrictions.
(Prior Code, § 165.04)
§ 152.05 ATTACHMENTS TO PLATS.
   Final plats shall be accompanied by the following documents:
   (A)   A statement by the proprietors and their spouses, if any, that the
plat is prepared with their free consent and in accordance with their desire,
signed and acknowledged before an officer authorized to take the
acknowledgments of deeds. The statement by the proprietors may also include a
dedication to the public of all lands within the plat that are designated for
streets, alleys, parks, open areas, school property, or other public use, if
the dedication is approved by the Council;
   (B)   A statement from the mortgage holders or lienholders, if any, that the
plat is prepared with their free consent and in accordance with their desire,
signed and acknowledged before an officer authorized to take the acknowledgment
of deeds. An affidavit and bond as provided for in Iowa Code § 354.12 may be
recorded in lieu of the consent of the mortgage or lienholder. When a mortgage
or lienholder consents to the subdivision, a release of mortgage or lien shall
be recorded for any areas conveyed to the city or dedicated to the public;
   (C)   An opinion by an attorney-at-law who has examined the abstract of
title of the land being platted. The opinion shall state the names of the
proprietors and holders of mortgages, liens, or other encumbrances on the land
being platted and shall note the encumbrances, along with any bonds securing
the encumbrances. Utility easements shall not be construed to be encumbrances
for the purpose of this section;
   (D)   A certificate of the County Treasurer that the land is free from
certified taxes and certified special assessments or that the land is free from
certified taxes and that the certified special assessments are secured by bond

   (E)   A resolution and certificate for approval by the Council and for
signatures of the Mayor and City Clerk.
(Prior Code, § 165.05)
§ 152.06 MINIMUM STANDARDS OF DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT.
   No preliminary or final plat of a subdivision shall be approved by either
the City Engineer or by the Council unless it conforms to the minimum standards
and requirements contained in this chapter.
   (A)   Acre subdivision. Whenever the area is divided into lots containing
one or more acres and there are indications that such lots will eventually be
subdivided into small building plots, consideration must be given to the street
and lot arrangement of the original subdivision so that additional streets can
be opened which will permit a logical arrangement of smaller lots.
   (B)   Relation to adjoining street system. The arrangement of streets in new
subdivisions shall make provisions for the continuation of the principal
existing streets in adjoining additions (or their proper projection where
adjoining property is not subdivided) insofar as they may be necessary for
public requirements. The width of such streets in new subdivisions shall not be
less than the minimum street widths established herein. The street and alley
arrangement must also be such as to cause no hardship to owners of adjoining
property when they plat their own land and seek to provide for convenient
access to it. Whenever there exists a dedicated or platted half-street or alley
adjacent to the tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street or alley
shall be platted.
   (C)   Streets in relation to railroads. When the area to be subdivided
adjoins a railroad right-of-way, no street shall be dedicated which is parallel
or approximately parallel to the railroad, unless it is 100 feet or more from
the line of the railroad right-of-way.
   (D)   Street right-of-way width. The minimum width of street right-of-ways
shall be 60 feet.
   (E)   Street width. The minimum width of streets shall be 20 feet, except in
those cases where topographical conditions, existing streets, or special
conditions make a street of less width more suitable. Under these conditions
the Council may waive the minimum requirements.
   (F)   Street jogs at intersections. At street intersections, street jogs
with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be prohibited, except where
topographic or other physical conditions make such jogs unavoidable.
    (G)   Street angles at intersections. Streets shall intersect as nearly at
right angles as possible, and no street shall intersect any other street at an
angle less than 60 degrees.
   (H)   Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets are prohibited except where a
street is planned to continue past the subdivider’s property. A dead-end street
shall terminate in a temporary circular right-of-way with a minimum diameter of
90 feet, unless the Council approves an equally safe and convenient space. No
dead-end street shall be longer than 600 feet. Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed 600
feet in length and shall be provided with a turn-around with a minimum right-
of-way diameter of 120 feet. The length of the cul-de-sac shall be measured
along its centerline from the turn-around to the intersecting point.
   (I)   Alleys. The minimum width of an alley in a residential block shall be
15 feet (alleys are not recommended for residential districts except under
unusual conditions). Alleys will be required in the rear of all business lots
and shall be at least 20 feet wide.
   (J)   Easements where there are no alleys. Where alleys are not provided,
easements of not less than five feet in width shall be provided on each side of
all rear lot lines and on those side lines where necessary for poles, wires,
conduits, storm and sanitary sewers, gas, water, and heat mains. Easements of
greater width may be required along lines or across lots where necessary for
the extension of main sewers and similar utilities.
   (K)   Length of blocks. No blocks shall be longer than 1,000 feet between
street lines. Blocks over 750 feet in length shall provide a cross-walk near
the center of the block. The right-of-way through such blocks shall not be less
than ten feet in width.
   (L)   Width of blocks. The width of blocks shall not be less than 200 feet
and not more than 300 feet, except that when such requirement would entail
unusual and substantial difficulties or hardship or when it is desired to
provide a development containing large residential lots, the Council may modify
such requirements and allow the subdivider to plat blocks of other widths.
   (M)   Lot lines. All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to straight
street lines or radial to curved street lines, unless a variation of this rule
will give a better street and lot plan. Lots with double frontage shall be
avoided.
   (N)   Size and shape of lots. The minimum dimensions for lots shall be 66
feet for width and 100 feet for depth, and in no case shall a lot that is to be
used for residential purposes contain less area than is required by the lot
area regulation of the zoning district in which the property is located, in
laying out an arrangement of lots, the subdivider should, whenever possible,
arrange for wide, shallow lots and avoid long, narrow lots.
   (O)   Corner lots. All corner lots shall have extra width sufficient to
permit the maintenance of building lines on both the front end and side streets
as required by any applicable building and land use regulations.
   (P)   Building lines. Building lines shall be shown on all lots intended for
residential use of any character, and on commercial lots immediately adjoining
residential areas. Such building lines shall not be less than required by any
applicable building and land use regulations.
   (Q)   Character of development. The City Engineer shall confer with the
subdivider regarding the type and character of development that will be
permitted in the subdivision, and may require that certain minimum deed
restrictions be placed upon the property, which restrictions would prevent such
construction which would clearly depreciate the character and value of
adjoining property. The City Engineer may also require that the deed
restrictions provide for the creation of a property owners’ association which
would be responsible for the enforcement of the restrictions and for the
protection and improvement of the general welfare of the subdivision.
   (R)   Improvements. Before any final plat of any subdivision is finally
approved for recording, the subdivider shall make and install improvements as
required in divisions (A) through (G) above throughout the area to be platted.
In lieu of final completion of the minimum improvements before the plat is
finally approved, the subdivider may post a bond (approved by the Council) with
the city or make other provisions which will ensure to the city that the
improvements will be completed by the subdivider within one year (or other time
period if so defined) after final approval of the plan. The amount of the bond
shall be not less than the estimated cost of the improvements, and the amount
of the estimate must be approved by the city. If the improvements are not
completed within the specified time, the Council may use the bond or any
necessary portion thereof to complete the same.
      (1)   Grading and improving streets. The subdivider shall grade and
improve all streets and alleys contained within the subdivision. The surfacing
of such streets and alleys shall be of such character as is suitable for the
expected traffic and in harmony with similar improvements in the surrounding
areas, but in no case shall it consist of less than either six and one-half
inches of Portland Cement over a four-inch base of drainage rock or four and
one-half inches of asphaltic cement over an eight-inch base of rock. If the
asphaltic cement surface is used, minimum 30-inch wide Portland Cement curb and
gutter is required for each side of the surfacing. The street design shall be
certified by a registered professional engineer.
      (2)   Tile drainage. Edges of new streets that do not have storm sewer
adjacent to them are to be drained with drainage tile with a minimum diameter
of five inches. The tile is to be designed to drain the base rock of the street
and provide a discharge for sump pumps from homes in the new subdivision. Drain
tiles should normally be designed for a depth of approximately four and one-
half feet, but depth may have to be adjusted in design to accommodate other
drain line considerations. Generally, the drain lines shall be located just
outside the back of curb.
      (3)   Grading and improving lots. The subdivider shall, whenever
necessary, grade any portion of the property subdivided into lots so that each
lot that is to be offered for sale will be usable and suitable for the erection
of residential or other structure thereon.
      (4)   Sanitary sewers. The subdivider shall install sanitary sewer mains
and provide a service connection to each lot. Such installations shall be in
accordance with the requirements of the city, county, and the State Department
of Natural Resources. The sewer improvements shall be designed by a registered
engineer to provide adequate capacity for installation. If area beyond the
subdivision is to be drained through the mains in the future, the subdivider’s
engineer is to discuss the design with the city. Any costs to the city for up-
sizing the lines beyond requirements of the subdivision to allow for future
flows shall be resolved before the lines are constructed. As a minimum, the
mains shall be constructed using PVC SDR-35 pipe between precast manholes
equipped with steps. Tees, wyes, or saddles shall be used for the connection of
each service line to the mains. Service lines shall be made or PVC and their
locations marked by use of a marker wire buried along the service line. A
service connection permit must be obtained from. the city before each
connection is constructed, and the connection must be inspected by the city
before the trench is backfilled. Service lines to single family buildings shall
be, as a minimum, Schedule 40 PVC pipe, four inches in diameter. Service lines
to multi-family buildings shall be, as a minimum, Schedule 40 PVC pipe, six
inches in diameter.
      (5)   Potable water. The subdivider shall install water mains, valves,
and fire hydrants in the subdivision area. Such installations shall be in
accordance with the standards, guidelines, and specifications of the city and
State Department of Natural Resources. Fire hydrant locations shall meet with
the approval of the City Water Department and the City Fire Chief. As a
minimum, the water mains shall be six-inch diameter PVC DR-18 or DIP pipe, with
mechanical joint cast or ductile iron fittings. If PVC mains are used, a tracer
wire is to be installed with the pipe, and a proper saddle shall be used at
each service connection to the main. Corporations are to be installed on each
service at the main, and curb stop and box are to be installed at the right-of-
way/lot line. Only copper service line is to be used from the main to a
distance of at least 18 inches past the curb stop. For new construction, copper
service line is to run to the house. If the service line exists as plastic, a
tracer tape and wire are to be installed 12 inches below ground level over the
line from the house to the curb stop. If the city desires a water main to be
up-sized from the minimum six-inch main, it will cover up-sizing costs. Service
connection permits must be obtained from the city before each is constructed,
and the city is to inspect each connection before the trench is backfilled. All
gate valves shall be resilient wedge, Mueller Model A-2360-20 with mechanical
joint ends. All valves deeper than six and one-half-foot bury shall have pinned
extension operators. All fire hydrants shall be Mueller Centurion Model A-423
with six-inch mechanical joint inlet. Hydrants shall include two two-and-one-
half-inch hose nozzles and one four-and-one-half-inch pumper nozzle. Nozzle
threads shall match common existing city hydrant threads. Unit shall have a
break-away traffic flange at ground level.
      (6)   Stormwater drainage. Where deemed necessary by the Council, the
developer shall install a stormwater detention/drainage system adequate to
serve the platted area. The system shall control runoff from the platted area
so as to limit discharge flows from a 100-year frequency storm after
development to no greater flow rate than the five-year frequency storm before
the development. Design of the stormwater detention/drainage system shall be
certified by a registered engineer. As a minimum, reinforced concrete pipe
shall be used under either present or future street surface areas.
      (7)   Other improvements. It may also be desirable to install other
improvements such as sidewalks, electric lines, street lights, gas mains, and
similar facilities in any subdivision. Whenever the Council deems it necessary,
they may require that such improvements shall be installed before the plat is
approved.
(Prior Code, § 165.06)
§ 152.07 ENFORCEMENT.
   Enforcement provisions are as follows.
   (A)   Filing of plat. No plat of any subdivision shall be entitled to record
in the County Recorder’s office or have any validity until it shall have been
approved in the manner prescribed herein.
   (B)   Building permits. The City Clerk shall not issue building or repair
permits for any structure located on a lot in any subdivision; the plat of
which has been prepared after the date of the adoption of the ordinance
codified in this chapter but which has not been approved in accordance with the
provisions contained herein. An original tract may be divided into two lots or
tracts and not be subject to the provisions of this section. If an original
tract shall be divided into more than two lots or tracts after the date of the
adoption of such ordinance, no building or repair permits shall be issued for
any structure located or proposed to be located on any of such tracts or lots,
unless or until a plat as required by this chapter has been fully approved by
the Council.
   (C)   Public improvements. The Council shall not permit any public
improvement over which it has any control to be made or any money expended for
improvements in any area that has been subdivided or upon any street that has
been platted after the date of the adoption of the ordinance codified in this
chapter unless such subdivision or street has been approved in accordance with
the provisions contained therein.
(Prior Code, § 165.07)
§ 152.08 VARIATIONS.
   Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape or is
surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict
application of the subdivision improvements would result in real difficulties
and substantial hardships, the Council may vary or modify such requirements so
that the subdivider is allowed to develop the property in a reasonable manner,
but, at the same time, the public welfare and interests of the city are
protected and the general intent and spirit of this chapter are preserved.
