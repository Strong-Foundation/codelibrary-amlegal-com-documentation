46.01Â Â Â CURFEW.
The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote the
public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and specifically
to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults responsible for
minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors committed after
the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences and criminal

be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that responsible
adultâ€™s custody. This is an objective standard. It shall, therefore, be no

other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but not for
longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or

the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the personâ€™s
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any non-secured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into

soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible for the
minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at such
time as the court may direct.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a peace officer determines that a
minor does not have adult supervision because the peace officer cannot locate
the minorâ€™s parent, guardian or other person legally responsible for the care
of the minor, within a reasonable time, the peace officer shall attempt to
place the minor with an adult relative of the minor, an adult person who cares
for the child or another adult person who is known to the child.

claim, or interest of the owner, lienholders, or claimants after the expiration
of the 10-day reclaiming period.
7.Â Â Â If it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identities
and addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders, notice by one
publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the
vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice

vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without notification
procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more wheels or

94.03 Emergency Conservation Levels 94.07 Violation
94.04 Conditions
Â 
94.01Â Â Â PURPOSE.
In the event of drought conditions, equipment failure or chemical
contamination, the water supply of the City may become significantly depleted
so that there is an insufficient supply of water to meet all customary and
usual demands. In the event of these conditions, the City Council may find, and
may declare by resolution, a Water Advisory, a Water Warning, or a Water
Emergency, defined below, during which time this chapter shall be in effect to
product an orderly and equitable reduction of water consumption until, by
resolution, the City Council finds and declares the water shortage to be ended.
94.02Â Â Â NOTIFICATION.
The City Water Superintendent shall see that the appropriate public officials
are notified, and that the City staff notifies the water users impacted by the
emergency of their need to participate in the Water Emergency Response
elements.
94.03Â Â Â EMERGENCY CONSERVATION LEVELS.
The level of appropriate response to a water emergency will depend upon
conditions of usage and availability of supply. Three levels are established,
beginning with voluntary measures up to mandatory restrictions on water usage.
The levels of response regarding a water emergency event are as follows:
1.Â Â Â Water Advisory.
2.Â Â Â Water Warning.
3.Â Â Â Water Emergency.
94.04Â Â Â CONDITIONS.
The following conditions are defined for determining if a water emergency
exists and the level of response by the City. The availability of water supply
will be assessed and used as contributing information in determining the level
of water emergency. The levels of emergency are as follows:
1.Â Â Â Phase I â€“ Water Advisory. A Water Advisory may be declared when a water
shortage or equipment failure poses a potential threat to the ability of the
water system to meet the needs of its customers currently or in the foreseeable
future. Indicators of the need to impose a Water Advisory include: moderate
decrease in the pumping water level of the water tower, or other potential
moderate threats to the reliable availability of water supply.
2.Â Â Â Phase 2 â€“ Water Warning. A Water Warning may be declared when a water
shortage or equipment failure poses a serious threat to the ability of the
water system to meet the needs of its customers currently or in the foreseeable
future. Indicators of the need to impose a Phase 2 Water Warning include:
significant decrease in the pumping water level of tower or severe system
emergencies such as a chemical spill or major system failure.
3.Â Â Â Phase 3 â€“ Water Emergency. A Water Emergency may be declared when a water
shortage or equipment failure poses a severe and immediate threat to the
ability of the water system to meet the needs of its customers. Indicators of
the need to impose a water emergency include: serious decrease in the pumping
water level of tower or serious decrease in recovery rate of water level in
tower or serious lack of water supply delivered to the City by water supplier.
94.05Â Â Â RESPONSE.
Upon determination of the level of water emergency, the City will respond with
the actions described in this section. Each phase may encompass elements of the
preceding phase. City staff will contact large water consumers first, and then
implement other elements as the need arises.
1.Â Â Â Phase 1 â€“ Water Advisory. Under a Water Advisory, all customers of the
water utility are encouraged to limit or curtail all nonessential uses of water
in order to conserve water resources during the time of shortage or equipment

accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHâ€™s are determined from
periodic grab samples.)

5.Â Â Â Rules Adopted. Rules and regulations pertaining to the operation and
maintenance of the Cityâ€™s natural gas system have been adopted and are on file
with the Clerk.

(Section 110.06 â€“ Ord. 365 â€“ Jun. 24 Supp.)
110.07Â Â Â TEMPORARY DISCONTINUANCE.
When any customer desires to discontinue the gas service to his or her premises
due to sickness or seasonal nonuse, a charge of $10.00 will be made for the
disconnection of the gas service. A charge of $10.00 will be made for

110.08Â Â Â SERVICE DISCONTINUED WITHOUT NOTICE.
Service may be discontinued without notice in the event of a condition on the
customerâ€™s premises determined by the City to be hazardous to life or property;
or in the event the customer is using equipment in such a manner as to
adversely affect the Cityâ€™s equipment or the service of the City to other
customers; or if the customer has tampered with the equipment furnished and
owned by the City. However, no disconnection without notice will be made for
tampering with equipment furnished and owned by the City on the date preceding
a day or days on which the Cityâ€™s business office is closed, unless such
tampering would be reasonably hazardous to life or property or would adversely
affect the Cityâ€™s equipment or the service of the City to other customers.
110.09Â Â Â SERVICE DISCONTINUED WITH NOTICE.
Written notice will be given by first class United States mail, postage
prepaid, deposited at the U.S. Post Office not less than five days, excluding
Sundays and legal holidays, before service to any customer will be
discontinued. However, if written notice is being given because of nonpayment
of a bill for service or for failure to provide a deposit, or an additional
deposit, the time frames and conditions governing written notice and
disconnection shall be as in Subsection 5 of this section. Discontinuation or
refusal of service with written notice may be for any of the following causes:
1.Â Â Â A customer may be disconnected or refused service for violation of or
noncompliance with the City rules on file with the State Utilities Board or on
file in the office of the Clerk.
2.Â Â Â A customer may be disconnected or refused service for failure of the
customer or prospective customer to furnish such service equipment, permits,
certificates, or rights-of-way as are specified to be furnished in the Cityâ€™s
rules as conditions of obtaining service or for the withdrawal of that same
equipment or the termination of those same permissions or rights, or for the
failure of the customer or prospective customer to fulfill the contractual
obligations imposed upon the customer as conditions of obtaining service and
any contract filed with and subject to the regulatory authority of the State
Utilities Board.
3.Â Â Â A customer may be disconnected or refused service for fraudulent or
unauthorized use of gas service or the resale of gas.
4.Â Â Â A customer may be disconnected or refused service for failure to permit
the City reasonable access to its equipment.
5.Â Â Â A customer may be disconnected or refused service for the nonpayment of a
bill for service or for failure of the customer to provide the City with a
deposit, or additional deposit, provided that the City:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Has made a reasonable attempt to effect collection.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Has given the customer written notice that the customer has 12 days in
which to make a settlement, together with a written summary of rights and
remedies and information on whom to contact. (The written summary of the rights
and remedies will include â€“ but will not be limited to â€“ a statement on the
Cityâ€™s budget billing policy, a statement on the Cityâ€™s policy on reasonable
agreement to pay and will state that the customer may contact the billing
office for any questions or disputes concerning the bill.)
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Has mailed a copy of the written notice and summary to a person or
agency designated by the customer in the customerâ€™s application for gas
service, if so designated.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Has made a good faith attempt to contact the customer (if a residential
customer), by telephone or in person to inform the customer of the pending
disconnection and the customerâ€™s rights and remedies; during the period of
November 1 to April 1, if the attempt fails, the premises must be posted with a
notice informing the customer of the same information at least one day prior to
the disconnection. (The oral explanation of the pending disconnection, and of
rights and remedies of the customer, and the substance of the posted notice,
will substantially conform to the information given in the original written
notice, and the written summary of rights and remedies.)
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Has given the customer reasonable opportunity to dispute the reason for
the disconnection and, if financial difficulty is confirmed, an opportunity to
enter into a reasonable agreement to pay in accord with the â€œreasonable
agreement to payâ€ provisions of the State Utilities Board. Such disconnection
of a residential customer may not take place on a weekend, a holiday, or after
2:00 p.m., unless the City is prepared to reconnect the same day and may not
take place when the temperature for the remainder of the day and the following
day, forecast by the nearest Federal Weather Service Station, is predicted to
be less than 20 degrees Fahrenheit. During the period November 1 to April 1,
disconnection shall be postponed if the discontinuance of service would present
a special danger to the health of the customer or any permanent resident of the
premises; however, the utility may require verification of the special danger
to health by a physician or a public health or social service official.
Verification shall postpone disconnection for 30 days; however, the
postponement may be extended by renewal of the verification. A special danger
to health is indicated if one appears to be seriously impaired and may, because
of mental or physical problems, be unable to manage his or her own resources,
carry out activities of daily living or protect oneself from neglect or
hazardous situations without assistance from others. Indicators of a special
danger to health include, but are not limited to: age, infirmity, or mental
incapacitation; serious illness; physical disability, including blindness and
limited mobility; and any other factual circumstances which indicate a severe
or hazardous health situation.
6.Â Â Â A customer may be disconnected or refused service for failure of the
customer to provide the utility with a deposit as authorized by the Cityâ€™s
service rules. (See Section
92.09, Combined Utility Deposit.)
7.Â Â Â No service will be discontinued, after notice, on the day preceding a day
or days on which the Cityâ€™s business office is closed.
110.10Â Â Â SERVICE CALLS.
A customer shall be charged $25.00 for each service call where trouble is found
to be on the customerâ€™s side of the meter. The customer shall be advised to
contact a qualified contractor to remedy the problem.
110.11Â Â Â CUSTOMER-REQUESTED METER TESTS.
A customer shall be charged $25.00 for each customer-requested meter test where
the meter is found to be within the allowable tolerance.
110.12Â Â Â RETURNED CHECKS.
A service charge of $30.00 shall apply to each check returned unpaid by the
bank on which it is drawn.
110.13Â Â Â LATE PAYMENT PENALTY.
Payments received by the municipal utility on or after the delinquent date
shall include a late payment penalty of 1.5 percent per month of the last due
amount.
110.14Â Â Â LINE INSTALLATION.
The City will furnish and install all materials for one natural gas service, up
to one inch C.T.S. Any additional lines and all upgrades or modifications will
be at the ownerâ€™s expense. This includes time and materials as well as
equipment rental fees. All materials will be supplied by the City at the
ownerâ€™s expense. Installation must be inspected and approved by a certified gas
operator.
110.15Â Â Â EXTENSION OF MAIN AND SERVICE LINES.
The utility shall extend gas mains without charge to the customer, except where
the governing body of the utility determines that extension costs are not
justified by anticipated revenue. In such cases, the customer contribution
shall be determined by the governing body on a case-by-case basis. In making
the determination, the governing body shall consider the estimated construction
costs, estimated revenue and contributions required from similarly situated
customers.
110.16Â Â Â GAS MAIN EXTENSION ROUTES.
All customers requesting gas main extension must furnish one print to the
Utility of the property or platted area in question. The customer must also
furnish easements to the Utility or assist the Utility in securing easement
rights when it becomes necessary to cross private property with gas mains. All
gas main extensions will be constructed by the Utility or its contractor along
existing improved public roads, streets and alleys or a route selected by the
Utility. Gas mains will normally be installed in the alley or street rights-of-
way. The length of any main extension shall be considered as the distance from
the nearest existing gas main and continuing across the customerâ€™s property to
his farthest lot line.
1.Â Â Â The Utility will construct a gas main extension only if it is deemed in
the best interest of the Utility.
2.Â Â Â All gas main extensions and revenue therefrom shall remain the property of
the Utility. The Utility reserves the right to maintain, repair and replace the
mains.
110.17Â Â Â GAS MAIN EXTENSIONS TO SUBDIVISIONS OUTSIDE CORPORATE CITY LIMITS.
Whenever an extension of the Utilityâ€™s gas mains is necessary to serve a real
estate subdivision, the gas main extension will include the entire subdivision.
Prior to the construction of the extension, a refundable investment must be
made by the developer and/or property owner(s) in the subdivision.
1.Â Â Â The refundable investment will be equal to the entire estimated cost to
serve the subdivision with gas mains; less credit for any gas heating customers
that have applied for gas service. No interest will be paid on the refundable
investment. The credit is computed by using the estimated cost per foot for the
gas main extension, multiplied by 100-feet, multiplied by the number of
properties that have applied for gas heating service.
2.Â Â Â The refundable investment will include the cost of all gas distribution
mains that are necessary to bring gas to the subdivision. The Utility will
determine the size of the gas distribution main required to serve the
subdivision. If it is deemed in the best interest of the Utility to install a
larger size gas distribution main than the subdivision requires, the Utility
will pay the difference in estimated cost.
3.Â Â Â The cost estimate of construction and revenue to be derived from the main
extension will be calculated by the Utility. Installation will be subject to
availability of natural gas.
110.18Â Â Â RETURN OF REFUNDABLE INVESTMENT.
A refundable investment is subject to return without interest in the following
manner:
1.Â Â Â As additional permanent gas heating customers are connected to the
subdivision gas mains, the Utility will each quarter refund to the original
customer or developer who paid the refundable investment an amount equal to
100-feet, multiplied by the original estimated cost per foot of gas main for
the extension, multiplied by the number of new additional permanent gas heating
customers in the subdivision. At no time shall total refunds exceed the
original investment.
2.Â Â Â The refunding period shall be in effect for 10 years from the date the gas
main was installed. If the Utility is unable to provide gas service to new
customers during this 10-year period, the time period length will be extended
as determined by the Utility.
110.19Â Â Â GAS SERVICE LINE COSTS OUTSIDE OF CORPORATE CITY LIMITS.
The Utility or its contractor will install a gas service line of adequate size
for the first 100-feet beyond the property line or to the nearest point of the
building, whichever is less, at no charge to primary gas heating customers.
Charges for service in excess of the 100-feet will be billed to the customer at
the actual cost per foot. For customers other than primary gas heating
customers, the Utility will install a gas service to the nearest point of the
building with customer paying for the footage from the property line to the
structure. Installation of the gas service cannot begin until the finished
grade has been established and dirt has been backfilled around the foundation.
Before the gas in the home may be turned on, any charges to the customer
pertaining to the gas service installation must be paid in full. The owner or
contractor must complete a Location Gas Service form and an Agreement for
Utilization of Gas Service form with the Utility before the gas service line
can be installed.

remedies and information on whom to contact. (The written summary of the rights
and remedies will include â€“ but will not be limited to â€“ a statement on the
Cityâ€™s budget billing policy, a statement on the Cityâ€™s policy on reasonable
agreement to pay and will state that the customer may contact the billing
office for any questions or disputes concerning the bill.)
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Has mailed a copy of the written notice and summary to a person or
agency designated by the customer in the customerâ€™s application for electric
service, if so designated.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Has made a good faith attempt to contact the customer (if a residential
customer), by telephone or in person to inform the customer of the pending
disconnection and the customerâ€™s rights and remedies; during the period of
November 1 to April 1, if the attempt fails, the premises must be posted with a
notice informing the customer of the same information at least one day prior to
the disconnection. (The oral explanation of the pending disconnection, and of
rights and remedies of the customer, and the substance of the posted notice,
will substantially conform to the information given in the original notice, and
the written summary of rights and remedies.)
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Has given the customer reasonable opportunity to dispute the reason for
the disconnection and, if financial difficulty is confirmed, an opportunity to
enter into a reasonable agreement to pay in accord with the â€œreasonable
agreement to payâ€ provisions of the State Utilities Board. Such disconnection
of a residential customer may not take place on a weekend, a holiday or after
2:00 p.m., unless the City is prepared to reconnect the same day and may not
take place when the temperature for the remainder of the day and the following
day, forecast by the nearest Federal Weather Service Station, is predicted to
be less than 20 degrees Fahrenheit. During the period November 1 to April 1,
disconnection shall be postponed if the discontinuance of service would present
a special danger to the health of the customer or any permanent resident of the
premises; however, the utility may require verification of the special danger
to health by a physician or a public health or social service official.
Verification shall postpone disconnection for 30 days; however, the
postponement may be extended by renewal of the verification. A special danger
to health is indicated if one appears to be seriously impaired and may, because
of mental or physical problems, be unable to manage his or her own resources,
carry out activities of daily living or protect oneself from neglect or
hazardous situations without assistance from others. Indicators of a special
danger to health include but are not limited to: age, infirmity, or mental
incapacitation; serious illness; physical disability, including blindness and
limited mobility; and any other factual circumstances which indicate a severe
or hazardous health situation.
6.Â Â Â A customer may be disconnected or refused service for failure of the
customer to provide the utility with a deposit as authorized by the Cityâ€™s
service rules. (See Section
92.09, Combined Utility Deposit.)
7.Â Â Â No service will be discontinued, after notice, on the day preceding a day
or days on which the Cityâ€™s business office is closed.
111.15Â Â Â SERVICE CALLS.
A customer shall be charged $25.00 for each service call where trouble is found

bank on which it is drawn.
111.18Â Â Â LATE PAYMENT PENALTY.
Payments received by the municipal utility on or after the delinquent date
shall include a late payment penalty of 1.5 percent per month of the last due
amount.
111.19Â Â Â EXTENSION OF MAIN AND SERVICE LINES.
The utility shall extend electric mains without charge to the customer, except
where the governing body of the utility determines that extension costs are not
justified by anticipated revenue. In such cases, the customer contribution
shall be determined by the governing body on a case-by-case basis. In making
the determination, the governing body shall consider the estimated construction
costs, estimated revenue and contributions required from similarly situated
customers.
111.20Â Â Â ELECTRICAL SERVICES.
1.Â Â Â Single-Family Dwelling.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Basic Service. The City will furnish and install up to a 200 amp basic
service to all single-family residential dwellings.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Upgraded Service. If a meter socket with disconnect or breaker is
required, and/or if more than 200 amps is desired, the homeowner/developer will
pay the difference between the basic socket and the latter.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Underground or Overhead service. The Electric Department will determine
if underground or overhead service shall be installed. If overhead service is
necessary, the owner is responsible for the installation of the service
entrance wire and mast. Any and all service upgrades and or repairs will be at
the ownerâ€™s expense and must be approved by the Electric Department and comply
with State of Iowa inspection rules and regulations.
2.Â Â Â All Other Services. Any services which do not meet the description above
(single-family residential dwellings) shall be purchased, and installed by the
owner/developer and must be approved by the Electric Department and comply with
State of Iowa inspection rules and regulations.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A credit, calculated at the rate of a 200 amp single service, will be
issued to the owner/developer to offset the cost.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In the event that a duplex, triplex or larger service is constructed
the credit calculated in the above section will be multiplied by the number of
dwellings, up to a maximum of four.
3.Â Â Â Special consideration will be given by the City Council on a case-by-case
basis for large or industrial situations.
111.21Â Â Â ELECTRICAL REINSTATEMENT.
If the meter has been removed for a time in excess of six months, for any
reason, State inspection is required prior to reinstatement of service. This
inspection is called â€œinspection not required by lawâ€ and is administered by
the State. In addition, an inspection will also be required if the Electric
Department deems it necessary to maintain the safety of the building and/or
City electrical system.

160.02Â Â Â STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSE.
1.Â Â Â The Legislature of the State has in Chapter 364 of the Code of Iowa, as
amended, delegated the power to cities to exercise any power and perform any
function it deems appropriate to protect and preserve the rights, privileges,
and property of the City or of its residents, and to preserve and improve the
peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort, and convenience of its residents.
2.Â Â Â Findings of Fact.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation
which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by:
(i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The ordinance codified in this chapter relies upon engineering
methodology for analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the standards
established by the Department of Natural Resources.
3.Â Â Â Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Subsection 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows so
that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03Â Â Â GENERAL PROVISIONS.
1.Â Â Â Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter shall apply
to all areas having special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the City.
For purposes of this chapter, the special flood hazard areas are those areas
designated as Zone A on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Buchanan County
and Incorporated Areas, City of Fairbank, Panel(s) 19019C0020E and 0025E, dated
December 30, 2020, which were prepared as part of the Buchanan County Flood
Insurance Study, shall be used to identify such flood hazard areas, and all
areas shown thereon to be within the boundaries of the base flood shall be
considered as having significant flood hazards. The Flood Insurance Study for
Buchanan County is hereby adopted by reference and is made a part of this
chapter for the purpose of administering floodplain management regulations.
2.Â Â Â Rules for Interpretation of Flood Hazard Boundaries. The boundaries of the
Special Flood Hazard areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the
official Flood Insurance Rate Map. When an interpretation is needed as to the
exact location of a boundary, the Mayor shall make the necessary
interpretation. The Council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged
that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by
the Mayor in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
3.Â Â Â Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used, and no structure
shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered, without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
4.Â Â Â Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
5.Â Â Â Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
6.Â Â Â Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated special flood hazard areas will be
free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on
the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
7.Â Â Â Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.

authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in such
approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement, or construction.
Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that authorized shall be
deemed a violation of this chapter. The applicant shall be required to submit
certification by a professional engineer or land surveyor, as appropriate,
registered in the State, that the finished fill, structure floor elevations,
floodproofing, or other flood protection measures were accomplished in
compliance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to the use or occupancy
of any structure.
160.05Â Â Â FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT STANDARDS.
All development must be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and
meet the following applicable performance standards. Where base flood
elevations have not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to determine: (i) whether
the land involved is either wholly or partly within the floodway or floodway
fringe; and (ii) the base flood elevation. The applicant will be responsible
for providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical
information to make such determination. Review by the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources is not required for the proposed construction of new or
replacement bridges or culverts where: (i) the bridge or culvert is located on
a stream that drains less than two square miles; and (ii) the bridge or culvert
is not associated with a channel modification that constitutes a channel change
as specified in 567 IAC 71.2(2).
1.Â Â Â All Development. All development within the special flood hazard areas
shall:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood damage.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant to
flood damage.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Obtain all other necessary permits from federal, State, and local
governmental agencies including approval when required from the Iowa Department
of Natural Resources.
2.Â Â Â Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the base flood elevation. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed subject to favorable
consideration by the Council, where existing topography, street grades, or
other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods used must
be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various forces
and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential structures located in
areas that would become isolated due to flooding of surrounding ground shall be
provided with a means of access that will be passable by wheeled vehicles
during the base flood. However, this criterion shall not apply where the
Administrator determines there is sufficient flood warning time for the
protection of life and property. When estimating flood warning time,
consideration shall be given to the criteria listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa
Administrative Code.
3.Â Â Â Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be flood proofed to such a level. When
floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State
shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to withstand the
flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and other factors
associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the base flood
elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water. A record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in
relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
4.Â Â Â All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including basements)
that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than
one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one-foot above
grade.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
Â Â Â Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access and
low damage potential storage.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures must be constructed with
electric meter, electrical service panel box, hot water heater, heating, air
conditioning, ventilation equipment (including ductwork), and other similar
machinery and equipment elevated or flood-proofed to a minimum of one foot
above the base flood elevation.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
plumbing, gas lines, water meters, gas meters, and other similar service
utilities, either elevated (or, in the case of non-residential structures,
optionally flood-proofed to) a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation or designed to be watertight and withstand inundation to such a
level.
5.Â Â Â Factory-Built Homes.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including those
placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be elevated
on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the structure is a
minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including those
placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be anchored
to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may
include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground
anchors. Anchorage systems may include, but are not limited to, use of over-
the-top or frame ties to ground anchors as required by the State Building Code.
6.Â Â Â Utility and Sanitary Systems.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located or
designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system as well as
the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment facilities
(other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood protection
equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood elevation.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water supply
treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a
level of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood
elevation.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
7.Â Â Â Storage of Materials and Equipment. Storage of equipment and materials
that are flammable, explosive, or injurious to human, animal or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or:
(i) not subject to major flood damage and be anchored to prevent movement due
to flood waters; or (ii) readily removable from the area within the time
available after flood warning.
8.Â Â Â Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as levees,
flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the base flood
with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for adequate
interior drainage. In addition, structural flood control works shall be
approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
9.Â Â Â Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must be
designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations must be
approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
10.Â Â Â Subdivisions. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and
subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the base flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50 lots
(whichever is less) shall include base flood elevation data for those areas
located within the Special Flood Hazard Area.
11.Â Â Â Accessory Structures to Residential Uses. Detached garages, sheds, and
similar structures that are incidental to a residential use are exempt from the
base flood elevation requirements where the following criteria are satisfied.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage potential. Its
size shall not exceed 600 square feet in size. Those portions of the structure
located less than one foot above the BFE must be constructed of flood-resistant
materials.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage potential
purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure shall not
be used for human habitation.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building site so
as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The structure shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation, collapse,
and lateral movement.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The structureâ€™s service facilities such as electrical and heating
equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above the base
flood elevation.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The structureâ€™s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of Subsection 4(A) of this section.
Exemption from the base flood elevation requirements for such a structure may
result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of the structure
and its contents.
12.Â Â Â Recreational Vehicles.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of Subsection 5
of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built homes when
the following criteria are satisfied.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less than
180 consecutive days; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than 180
consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements of
Subsection 5 of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built
homes.
13.Â Â Â Pipeline Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be buried
in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent
rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
14.Â Â Â Maximum Damage Potential Development. All new or substantially improved
maximum damage potential development shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated a minimum of one foot above the elevation of the 500-year
flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed
to such a level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer
registered in the State shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are
adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and
uplift forces and other factors associated with the base flood; and that the
structure, below the base flood elevation is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water. A record of the
certification indicating the specific elevation (in relation to North American
Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are flood proofed shall be
maintained by the Administrator. Where 0.2 percent chance flood elevation data
has not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The applicant will
be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with
sufficient technical information to make such determinations.
160.06Â Â Â VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
1.Â Â Â The Council may authorize upon request in specific cases such variances
from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the public interest
where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of
this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances granted must meet
the following applicable standards.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection
for structures than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the applicant
shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator that: (i)
the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage;
and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
2.Â Â Â Factors upon Which the Decision of the Council Shall Be Based. In passing
upon applications for variances, the Council shall consider all relevant
factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or downstream
to the injury of others.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
City.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for
the proposed use.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for the area.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood water expected at the site.
Â Â Â L.Â Â Â The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
Â Â Â M.Â Â Â Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this chapter.
3.Â Â Â Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed
above, the Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as
it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such conditions may
include, but not necessarily be limited to:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Limitation of periods of use and operation.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes, levees,
and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the Department of
Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative to achieving
the purpose of this chapter.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the flood
protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration, rate
of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated with
the regulatory flood. The Council shall require that the applicant submit a
plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
160.07Â Â Â NONCONFORMING USES.
1.Â Â Â A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before
the passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but which
is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be continued
subject to the following conditions:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any future use
of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless
it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
State or local health, sanitary, building, or safety codes or regulations, or
the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
designation.
2.Â Â Â Except as provided in Subsection
160.07(1)(B), any use which has been permitted as a variance shall be
considered a conforming use.
160.08Â Â Â PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
the requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this
chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction
thereof be fined not more than $500.00 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days.
Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful
action as is necessary to prevent or remedy violation.
160.09Â Â Â AMENDMENTS.

165.11Â Â Â SUBMISSION OF PRELIMINARY PLAT.
The subdivider shall prepare the preliminary plat and shall file with the Clerk
an application in triplicate for the tentative approval of the plat. The
application shall:
1.Â Â Â Forms and Fees. Be made on forms available from the Clerk together with a
fee of $10.00 per lot.
2.Â Â Â Number of Plats. Be accompanied by a minimum of 10 copies of the
preliminary plat.
3.Â Â Â Time of Submission. Be presented to the Clerk at least three weeks prior
to the regular meeting of the Council.
165.12Â Â Â REFERRAL OF PRELIMINARY PLAT.
The Clerk shall immediately refer two copies of the preliminary plat to the
City Engineer and six copies to the Council and one copy to the City Attorney.
In the case of a subdivision outside the corporate limits of the City, the
Clerk shall refer one copy of the preliminary plat to the County Board of
Supervisors.
165.13Â Â Â REVIEW OF PRELIMINARY PLAT.
The preliminary plat shall be reviewed by the Council and City Engineer to
determine its conformity with these regulations and all other ordinances and
regulations in force affecting subdivisions. Copies of the preliminary plat may
be transmitted to other City or school officials, as the Council deems
necessary, for their recommendations concerning matters within their
jurisdiction. Their recommendations, along with those of the City Engineer,
shall be transmitted to the Council within three weeks from the date the plat
is filed. The Council may confer with the subdivider on changes deemed
advisable and the kind and extent of such improvements to be made.
165.14Â Â Â ACTION BY THE COUNCIL ON PRELIMINARY PLAT.
The Council shall, as soon as possible, but not more than 30 days thereafter,
pass upon the preliminary plat as originally submitted or modified. If the
Council does not act within 30 days, the preliminary plat shall be deemed to be
approved; provided, however, the subdivider may agree to an extension of the
time period not to exceed an additional 60 days. The Council shall then set
forth its recommendations in writing, whether of approval, modification or
disapproval.
1.Â Â Â Reasons for Changes or Disapproval. In the event that substantial changes
or modifications are made by the Council, or the Council recommends disapproval
of the plat, it shall give its reasons therefor and it may request and cause
the revised preliminary plat to be resubmitted in the same manner as the
original plat.
2.Â Â Â Tentative Approval. If the Council recommends approval, it shall express
its approval as â€œTentative Approvalâ€ and state the conditions of such approval,
if any.
3.Â Â Â Documenting Approval. The action of the Council shall be documented on six
copies of the preliminary plat, referenced and attached to any conditions
determined. One copy shall be returned to the subdivider, and six copies shall
be retained by the Council. The â€œTentative Approvalâ€ by the Council shall not
constitute final acceptance of the addition or subdivision by the City but an
authorization to proceed with preparation of the final plat.
165.15Â Â Â EFFECTIVE PERIOD OF TENTATIVE APPROVAL.
The tentative approval of a preliminary plat shall be effective for a period of
one year at the end of which time final approval must have been obtained. Any
plat not receiving final approval within this period of time shall be void, and
the subdivider shall be required to resubmit a new plat for tentative approval
subject to all new regulations.
165.16Â Â Â COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Before the Council will approve a final plat, all of the required improvements
shall be constructed and inspected by the City Engineer for compliance with
design plans, City ordinances regarding said improvements and State laws.
Before passage of a resolution of acceptance, the City Engineer shall report to
the Council that said improvements meet all City specifications and ordinances
or other City requirements, and the agreements between the subdivider and the
City.
165.17Â Â Â PERFORMANCE BOND.
The completion requirement for improvements may be waived in whole or in part
if the subdivider posts a performance bond with the Council guaranteeing that
improvements not then completed will be constructed within a period of one year
from final acceptance of the plat; but final acceptance of the plat will not
constitute final acceptance by the City of any improvements to be constructed.
Improvements will be accepted only after their construction has been completed.
Such performance bond shall be satisfactory to the City Attorney as to form,
sufficiency and manner of execution and shall be in an amount equal to 125
percent of the anticipated costs of construction of said improvements. Upon
approval of a majority of the Council, the completion date set forth in the
bond may be extended for a maximum period of one additional year.
165.18Â Â Â FINAL PLAT.
The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as approved,
and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that portion of the
approved preliminary plat which the subdivider proposes to record and develop
at the time, provided, however, that such portion conforms to all requirements
of these regulations.
165.19Â Â Â REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINAL PLAT.
The following graphic and descriptive material is required to be provided on
the final plat and in the accompanying material.
1.Â Â Â Contents of the Final Plat. Every plat of a subdivision offered for record
shall conform to all of the following provisions where applicable:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The plat shall be a permanent copy or a photographic print made on a
stable plastic film. Exact copies of the plat to be recorded shall be provided
to and filed with the County Recorder, Assessor, and Auditor. The original plat
drawing shall remain the property of the registered land surveyor.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The size of each sheet showing any portion of the subdivided lands
shall not be greater than 18 inches by 24 inches nor less than 8Â½ inches by 11
inches.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Whenever more than one sheet is used to accurately portray the lands
subdivided, each sheet shall display both the number of the sheet and the total
number of sheets included in the plat, as well as clearly labeled match lines
indicating where the other sheets adjoin. An index sheet shall be provided to
show the relationship between the sheets.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â A scale of one hundred feet to one inch (100â€™ = 1â€) shall be used. The
scale used shall be clearly stated and graphically illustrated by a bar scale
drawn on every sheet showing any portion of the lands subdivided.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Subdivisions shall be designated, by name or as otherwise prescribed,
in bold letters inside the margin at the top of each sheet included in the
plat.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â An arrow indicating the northern direction shall be drawn in a
prominent place on each sheet included in the plat, as well as the scale and
date.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â All monuments to be of record shall be adequately described and clearly
identified on the plat. When additional monuments are to be established
subsequent to the recording of the plat, the location of the additional
monuments shall be shown on the plat.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Sufficient survey data shall be shown to positively describe the bounds
of every lot, block, street, easement or other areas shown on the plat, as well
as the outer boundaries of the subdivided lands.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â All distances shall be shown in feet to the nearest one-hundredth of a
foot, and in accordance with the definition of a foot adopted by the United
States Bureau of Standards. All measurements shall refer to the horizontal
plane.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â The course of every boundary line shown on the plat shall be indicated
by a direct bearing reference or by an angle between the boundary line and an
intersecting line having a shown bearing, except when the boundary line has an
irregular or constantly changing course, as along a body of water, or when a
description of the boundary line is better achieved by measurements shown at
points or intervals along a meander line having a shown course. All bearings
and angles shown shall be given to at least the nearest minute of arc.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Curve data shall be stated in terms of radius, central angle chord and
tangent, or length of curve. In all cases, the curve data must be shown for the
line affected.
Â Â Â L.Â Â Â The minimum unadjusted acceptable error of closure for all subdivision
boundaries shall be 1:10,000 and shall be 1:5,000 for any individual lot. The
unadjusted error of closure shall be shown on the plat.
Â Â Â M.Â Â Â When any lot or portion of the subdivision is bounded by an irregular
line, the major portion of that lot or subdivision shall be enclosed by a
meander line showing complete data with distances along all lines extending
beyond the enclosure to the irregular boundary shown with as much certainty as
can be determined or as â€œmore or less,â€ if variable. In all cases, the true
boundary shall be clearly indicated on the plat.
Â Â Â N.Â Â Â All interior excepted parcels shall be clearly indicated and labeled,
â€œnot a part of this plat.â€
Â Â Â O.Â Â Â All adjoining properties shall be identified and where such adjoining
properties are a part of a recorded subdivision, the name of that subdivision
shall be shown. If the subdivision platted is a resubdivision of a part or the
whole of a previously recorded subdivision, sufficient ties shall be shown to
controlling lines appearing on the earlier plat to permit an overlay to be
made. Re-subdivisions shall be labeled as such in a subtitle following the name
of the subdivision wherever the name appears on the plat.
Â Â Â P.Â Â Â The purpose of any easement shown on the plat shall be clearly stated
and shall be confined to only those easements pertaining to public utilities
including gas, power, telephone, water, sewer and such drainage easements as
are deemed necessary for the orderly development of the land encompassed within
the plat.
Â Â Â Q.Â Â Â A strip of land shall not be reserved by the subdivider unless the land
is of sufficient size and shape to be of some practical use or service as
determined by the Council.
Â Â Â R.Â Â Â The purpose of all areas dedicated to the public must be clearly
indicated on the plat.
Â Â Â S.Â Â Â The plat shall contain a statement by a registered land surveyor that
the plat was prepared by the surveyor or under the surveyorâ€™s direct personal
supervision and shall be signed and dated by the surveyor and bear the
surveyorâ€™s Iowa registration number or seal.
Â Â Â T.Â Â Â Street names and clear designation of public alleys.
Â Â Â U.Â Â Â Block and lot numbers.
Â Â Â V.Â Â Â Name and address of owner and subdivider.

and his or her spouse.
Â Â Â Y.Â Â Â A sealed certification of the accuracy of the plat by the registered
land surveyor who drew the plat.
Â Â Â Z.Â Â Â A correct legal description of the subdivision land.
2.Â Â Â Information to be Provided in Accompanying Material. The following
material shall be submitted with the final plat:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A statement by the proprietors and their spouses, if any, that the plat
is prepared with their free consent and in accordance with their desire, signed
and acknowledged before an officer authorized to take the acknowledgments of
deeds. The statement by the proprietors may also include a dedication to the
public of all lands within the plat that are designated for streets, alleys,
parks, open areas, school property, or other public use, if the dedication is
approved by the Council.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A statement from the mortgage holders or lienholders, if any, that the
plat is prepared with their free consent and in accordance with their desire,
signed and acknowledged before an officer authorized to take the acknowledgment
of deeds. An affidavit and bond as provided for in Section 354.12 of the Code
of Iowa may be recorded in lieu of the consent of the mortgage or lienholder.
When a mortgage or lienholder consents to the subdivision, a release of
mortgage or lien shall be recorded for any areas conveyed to the City or
dedicated to the public.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â An opinion by an attorney-at-law who has examined the abstract of title
of the land being platted. The opinion shall state the names of the proprietors
and holders of mortgages, liens or other encumbrances on the land being platted
and shall note the encumbrances, along with any bonds securing the
encumbrances. Utility easements shall not be construed to be encumbrances for
the purpose of this section.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â A certificate of the County Treasurer that the land is free from
certified taxes and certified special assessments or that the land is free from
certified taxes and that the certified special assessments are secured by bond

Council has agreed that the City will provide the necessary improvements and
installations and assess the costs against the subdivider or future property
owners in the subdivision.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â The encumbrance bond, if any.
165.20Â Â Â SUBMISSION OF FINAL PLAT.
The subdivider shall prepare the final plat and shall file with the Clerk an
application in triplicate for the final approval of the plat. The application
shall:
1.Â Â Â Forms and Fees. Be made on forms available from the Clerk together with a
fee of $10.00 per lot.
2.Â Â Â Number of Copies of Plat. Be accompanied by a minimum of 10 copies of the

the case of a subdivision outside the corporate limits of the City, the Clerk
shall refer one copy of the final plat to the County Board of Supervisors.
165.22Â Â Â ACTION BY THE COUNCIL ON FINAL PLAT.
Upon receipt of the final plat by the Council, the Council shall, as soon as
possible, but not more than 60 days, either approve or disapprove the final
plat.
1.Â Â Â Disapproval of Plat. In the event that said plat is disapproved by the
Council, such disapproval shall be expressed in writing and shall point out
wherein said proposed plat is objectionable.
2.Â Â Â Acceptance of Plat. In the event that said plat is found to be acceptable
and in accordance with this chapter, the Council shall accept the same.
3.Â Â Â Final Approval and Recording of Plat. The passage of a resolution by the
Council accepting the plat shall constitute final approval of the platting of
the area shown on the final plat, but the subdivider or owner shall cause such
plat to be recorded in the office of the County Recorder of the County where
the land to be subdivided is located, and shall file satisfactory evidence of
such recording in the office of the Clerk before the City shall recognize the
plat as being in full force and effect.
165.23Â Â Â RESUBDIVISION OF LAND.
The following requirements shall govern the resubdividing of land.
1.Â Â Â Procedure for Resubdividing. For any change in a map of an approved or
recorded subdivision plat, if such change affects any street layout shown on
such map, or area reserved for public use indicated on the map, or any lot
line, or if it affects any map or plan legally established prior to the
adoption of any regulations controlling subdivision, such parcel shall be
approved by the same procedure, rules and regulations as for a subdivision.
2.Â Â Â Acreage Lots. Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision
plat shows one or more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are
indications that such lots will eventually be resubdivided into smaller
building sites, the Council may require that such parcel of land allow for
future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets.
Easements providing for the future opening and extension of such streets may be
made a requirement of the plat.
165.24Â Â Â COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Before the final plat is approved by the Council, all applicants shall be
required to complete, in accordance with the Councilâ€™s decision and to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer, all the street, sanitary and other
improvements as required in these regulations, specified in the preliminary
plat, and as approved by the Council, and to dedicate the same to the City,
free and clear of all liens and encumbrances on the property and public
improvements thus dedicated.
165.25Â Â Â PERFORMANCE BOND.
The Council in its discretion may waive the requirement that the applicant
complete and dedicate all public improvements prior to approving the final
plat, and that, as an alternative, the applicant post a bond at the time of
application for final plat approval in an amount estimated by the Council as
sufficient to secure to the City the satisfactory construction, installation
and dedication of the incompleted portion of required improvements. In
addition:
1.Â Â Â Approved by City Attorney. Such performance bond shall comply with all
statutory requirements and shall be approved by the City Attorney as to form,
sufficiency, and manner of execution and shall be in an amount equal to 125
percent of the anticipated cost of construction of said improvements.
2.Â Â Â Completion Period. The period within which required improvements must be
completed shall be specified by the Council in the resolution approving the
final plat, shall be incorporated in the bond, and shall not exceed one year
from date of final approval.
3.Â Â Â Extension of Completion Period. The performance bond shall be approved by
the Council as to the amount and surety and conditions satisfactory to the
Council. The Council may, upon proof of difficulty, extend the completion date
set forth in such bond for a maximum period of one additional year. The Council
may at any time during the period of such bond accept a substitution of
principal and sureties on the bond.
4.Â Â Â Temporary Improvements. The applicant shall build and pay for all costs of
temporary improvements required by the Council and shall maintain same for the
period specified by the Council. Prior to the construction of any temporary
facility or improvement, the developer shall file with the City a separate
suitable bond for temporary facilities, which bond shall insure that the
temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained and removed.
5.Â Â Â Failure to Complete Improvement. For subdivisions for which no performance
bond has been posted, if the improvements are not completed within the period
specified by the Council in the resolution approving the plat, the approval
shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases where a performance bond has
been posted and required improvements have not been installed within the terms
of such performance bond, the City may declare the bond to be in default and
require that all the improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the
building development at the time the bond is declared to be in default.
165.26Â Â Â INSPECTION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
The Council shall provide for inspection of required improvements during
construction and insure their satisfactory completion. The applicant shall pay
to the City an inspection fee equal to the actual cost of inspection. These
fees shall be due and payable upon demand of the City and no building permits
or certificates of occupancy shall be issued until all fees are paid. The
subdivider shall furnish the Council with a construction schedule prior to the
commencement of any and all construction, and notify the City not less than 48
hours in advance of readiness for required inspections.
165.27Â Â Â RELEASE OR REDUCTION OF PERFORMANCE BOND.
The performance bond may not be released or reduced except as follows:
1.Â Â Â Certificate of Satisfactory Completion. The Council will not accept
dedication of required improvements, nor release nor reduce a performance bond,
until the City Engineer has submitted a certificate stating that all required
improvements have been satisfactorily completed and until the applicantâ€™s
engineer has certified to the City through submission of detailed â€œas builtâ€
plans of the subdivision indicating location, dimensions, materials and other
information required by the City, that all public improvements are in
accordance with construction plans for the subdivision and are in compliance
with City ordinances and State statutes.
2.Â Â Â Reduction of Performance Bond. A performance bond may be reduced upon
actual dedication of public improvements and then only to the ratio that the
public improvement dedicated bears to the total public improvements for the
plat.
165.28Â Â Â MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Improvements shall be maintained and a maintenance bond provided as follows:
1.Â Â Â Maintenance of Improvements Before Acceptance. The applicant shall be
required to maintain all improvements on the individual subdivided lots and
provide for snow removal on streets and sidewalks, if required, until
acceptance of said improvements by the Council. If there are any certificates
of occupancy on a street not dedicated to the City, the City may, on 12 hoursâ€™
notice, plow the street or effect emergency repairs and charge same to
applicant.
2.Â Â Â Maintenance Bond. The applicant shall be required to file a maintenance
bond with the City, prior to dedication, in an amount considered adequate by
the Council, upon the recommendation of the City Engineer and in a form
satisfactory to the City Attorney, in order to assure the satisfactory
condition of the required improvements for a period of four years for the
street pavement and a period of two years for all other improvements after the
date of their acceptance and dedication of same to the City.
165.29Â Â Â DEFERRAL OR WAIVER OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
Required improvements may be deferred or waived as follows:
1.Â Â Â Waiver of Required Improvements. The Council may defer or waive at the
time of final approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any
or all such improvements as in its judgment are not requisite in the interests
of the public health, safety and general welfare, or which are inappropriate
because of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities.
2.Â Â Â Deferral of Required Improvements. Whenever it is deemed necessary by the
Council to defer the construction of any improvement required herein because of
incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate or lack of connecting
facilities, or for other reasons, the applicant shall pay his or her share of
the costs of the future improvements to the City prior to the approval of the
final plat, or the applicant may post a bond insuring completion of said
improvements upon demand of the City.
165.30Â Â Â CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY REQUIRED.

by these regulations. The Council shall have the final authority to designate
the name of the subdivision which shall be determined at preliminary plat
approval.
165.36Â Â Â MONUMENTATION.
Monuments shall be in conformance with the following requirements:
1.Â Â Â Establishment of Permanent Control Monuments. Prior to the offering of the
plat of any subdivision for record, the surveyor shall confirm the prior
establishment of permanent control monuments at each controlling corner on the
boundaries of the parcel or tract of land being subdivided. If no permanent
control monuments exist, the surveyor shall establish at least two permanent
control monuments for each block created, or if the area subdivided into lots
is less than a block in size, at least two permanent control monuments shall be
established for the subdivision. Permanent control monuments shall be
constructed of reasonably permanent material solidly embedded in the ground and
capable of being detected by commonly used magnetic or electronic equipment.
The surveyor shall affix a cap of reasonably inert material bearing an embossed
or stencil cut marking of the Iowa registration number of the surveyor to the
top of the monument.
2.Â Â Â Other Monuments of Record. Other monuments established prior to the
recording of the plat of the subdivision and described on the plat shall be
considered monuments of record and shall be given the same weight as original
permanent control monuments if the monuments remain undisturbed in their
original positions. The additional monuments shall be constructed and embedded
according to the provisions for permanent control monuments according to the
provisions for permanent control monuments prescribed in Subsection 1 of this
section.
3.Â Â Â Establishment and Recording of Other Monuments. Monuments other than the
permanent control monuments required in Subsection 1 of this section shall not
be required to be established before the recording of the plat or the
conveyancing of lands by reference to the plat if the registered land surveyor
includes in the surveyorâ€™s statement on the plat that the additional monuments
required by these regulations shall be established before a specified future
date.
4.Â Â Â Additional Monuments Required. Additional monuments shall be constructed
and embedded according to the provisions for permanent control monuments
prescribed in Subsection 1 of this section, and shall be set in all of the
following locations whether set prior to the recording of the plat, or
subsequent to such recording:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â At every corner and angle point of every lot, block or parcel of land
created.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â At every point of intersection of the outer boundary of the subdivision
with an existing or created right-of-way line of any street, railroad or other
way.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â At every point of curve, tangency, reversed curve or compounded curve
on every right-of-way line established.
5.Â Â Â Placement of Monument. When the placement of a monument required by this
chapter at the prescribed location is impractical, it is permissible to
establish a reference monument in close proximity to the prescribed location.
If the reference monument is established prior to the recording of the plat and
its location properly shown on the plat, the reference monument shall have the
same status as other monuments of record. Where any point requiring
monumentation has been previously monumented, the existence of the monument
shall be confirmed by the surveyor. The existing monument shall be considered a
monument of record when properly shown and described on the recorded plat.
165.37Â Â Â CHARACTER OF THE LAND.
Land which the City finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or development due
to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth
formations or topography, utility easement or other features which will
reasonably be harmful to the safety, health and general welfare of the present
or future inhabitants of the subdivision or its surrounding areas or both,
shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are formulated by
the subdivider and approved by the Council to solve the problems created by the
unsuitable land conditions. Such land shall be set aside for uses as shall not
involve such a danger.
165.38Â Â Â LOTS.
The lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation shall be appropriate for the
location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use
contemplated.

industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service and
parking facilities required by the type of use and development contemplated.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Corner lots for residential use shall have a minimum of an extra 15
feet of width to permit appropriate building setback from and orientation to
both streets.
2.Â Â Â Street Access. Each lot shall be provided with satisfactory access to a
public street.
3.Â Â Â Double Frontage and Reverse Frontage Lots. Double frontage and reverse
frontage lots shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of
residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific
disadvantages of topography and orientation. A planting screen easement of at
least 10 feet, and across which there shall be no right of access, shall be
provided along the line of lots abutting such a traffic artery or other
disadvantageous use.
4.Â Â Â Side Lot Lines. Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles to
straight street lines or radial to curved street lines.
5.Â Â Â Lot Drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage
away from all buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with
the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so
as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent
lots.
6.Â Â Â Building Lines. Building lines shall be shown on all lots within the
platted area. Where the subdivided area is not under zoning control, the
Council may require building lines in accordance with the needs of each
subdivision.
165.39Â Â Â BLOCKS.
Blocks shall conform to the following requirements:
1.Â Â Â Provision for Lots. Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two
tiers of lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions shall be permitted in blocks
adjacent to arterial streets, railroads or waterways.
2.Â Â Â Design Considerations. The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be
determined with due regard to:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Provision for adequate building sites.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Topography.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street
traffic.
3.Â Â Â Block Lengths. The lengths of blocks shall be appropriate to the type of
development contemplated, but block lengths in residential developments shall
not exceed 1,200 feet, or be less than 500 feet. Wherever practicable, blocks
along arterials and collector streets shall not be less than 1,000 feet in
length.
4.Â Â Â Easement Reservation. In blocks over 800 feet in length, the Council may
require the reservation of an easement to accommodate utilities, drainage
facilities or pedestrian traffic.
5.Â Â Â Pedestrian Crosswalks. Pedestrian crosswalks, not less than 10 feet wide,
may be required by the Council through the center of blocks more than 800 feet
in length. Pedestrian crosswalks shall not exceed 12 percent in grade unless
steps of an approved design are to be constructed.
165.40Â Â Â STREETS â€“ GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
Streets shall conform with the following general requirements:
1.Â Â Â Frontage on Improved Roads. No subdivision shall be approved unless the
area to be subdivided shall have frontage on and access from an existing
street.
2.Â Â Â Grading and Improvement Plan. Streets shall be graded and improved and
conform to the City construction standards and specifications and shall be
approved as to design and specifications by the City Engineer, in accordance
with the construction plans required to be submitted.
3.Â Â Â Topography and Arrangement. Streets shall be conformance with the
following requirements related to topography and arrangement:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Streets shall be related appropriately to be topography. All streets
shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as possible of the building sites at
or above the grades of the streets. Grades of streets shall conform as closely
as possible to the original topography. A combination of steep grades and
curves shall be avoided. Specific standards are contained in the design
standards of these regulations.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed
system of streets and dedicated right-of-way.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â All arterials shall be properly related to special traffic generators
such as industries, business districts, schools, churches and shopping centers;
to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and proposed land uses.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Municipal service streets shall be laid out to conform as much as
possible to the topography to discourage use by through traffic, to permit
efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of
streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract
to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions,
or unless in the opinion of the Council such extension is not necessary or
desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the
existing layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â In business and industrial developments, the streets and other
accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings,
location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and
maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of
movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian.
4.Â Â Â Access to State or County Jurisdictional Roads. Whenever any part of a
subdivision is designed with access to a road under State or County
jurisdiction, permission for access to such roads shall be obtained from the
appropriate jurisdiction and such access shall be designed according to the
standards of the appropriate jurisdiction.
5.Â Â Â Access to Arterial Streets. Where a subdivision borders on or contains an
existing or proposed arterial street, the Council may require that lot access
to such streets be limited by one of the following means:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Lots shall be designed so as to back onto the primary arterial and
front onto a parallel municipal service street; no access shall be provided
from the arterial street, and screening shall be provided in a strip of land
along the rear property line of such lots.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A series of cul-de-sacs entered from and designed generally at right
angles to such a parallel street, with the rear lines of their terminal lots
backing onto the arterial street.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â A frontage or service road, separated from the primary arterial by a
planting or grass strip and having access thereto at suitable points.
6.Â Â Â Street Names. Streets that are in alignment with others already existing
shall bear the name of the existing streets. The proposed names of new streets
shall not duplicate or sound similar to existing street names. Street names
shall be subject to the approval of the Council.
7.Â Â Â Street Name Signs. Street name signs are to be placed at all intersections
within or abutting the subdivision, the type and location of which to be
approved by the Council. The City shall install all street name signs. The
applicant shall deposit with the City at the time of final subdivision approval
the estimated cost of installation of each street sign required by the Council.
8.Â Â Â Street Lights. Installation of street lights shall be required in
accordance with design and shall be located on street corners not more than 300
feet apart.
9.Â Â Â Construction of Streets and Dead-End Streets. Streets and dead-end streets
shall be in conformance with the following requirements:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Construction of Streets. The arrangement of streets shall provide for
the continuation of principal streets between adjacent properties when such
continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire
protection, and for efficient provision of utilities. If the adjacent property
is undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right-
of-way shall be extended to the property line. A temporary T or L shaped
turnabout shall be provided on all temporary dead-end streets, with the
notation on the subdivision plat that land outside the normal street right-of-
way shall revert to abutters whenever the street is continued. The Council may
limit the length of temporary dead-end streets in accordance with the design
standards of these regulations.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Permanent Dead-end Streets. Where a road does not extend to the
boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by the Council
for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall normally not be nearer to
such boundary than 150 feet. However, the Council may require the reservation
of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian
traffic or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be provided at the end of a
permanent dead-end street in accordance with City construction standards and
specifications. For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police
and fire protection, permanent dead-end streets shall, in general, be limited
in length in accordance with the design standards of these regulations.
165.41Â Â Â STREETS â€“ DESIGN STANDARDS.
The following design standards shall apply to the design of streets:
1.Â Â Â General. In order to provide for streets of suitable location, width and
improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access
to police, firefighting, snow removal, sanitation and street maintenance
equipment, and to coordinate streets so as to compose a convenient system and
avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, the following design standards
for streets are hereby required:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse
curves on municipal arterial and municipal collector streets, and 75 feet on
municipal service streets.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point
by more than 10 degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius
adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than 100 feet for municipal
service and municipal collector streets, and of such greater radii as the
Council shall determine for special cases.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Minimum Roadway and Right-of-way Standards:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Municipal arterial streets shall have a right-of-way width of not
less than 80 feet and a roadway width of not less than 44 feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Municipal collector streets shall have a right-of-way width of not
less than 60 feet and a roadway width of not less than 24 feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Municipal service streets shall have a right-of-way width of not
less than 60 feet and a roadway width of not less than 24 feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Frontage streets shall have a right-of-way width of not less than
40 feet and a roadway width of not less than 24 feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Cul-de-sacs shall meet all the requirements for a municipal service
street and, in addition, shall provide a turnaround with a right-of- way radius
of 50 feet and a roadway radius of 40 feet. No cul-de-sac shall exceed 500 feet
in length.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Street grades, wherever feasible, shall not exceed the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Municipal arterial streets - six percent;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Municipal collector streets - eight percent;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Municipal service streets â€“ 10 percent;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Frontage streets - six percent.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â All changes in street grade shall be connected by vertical curves of
minimum length in feet equal to 20 times the algebraic difference in percents
of grade.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â No street grade shall be less than one-half of one percent.
2.Â Â Â Street Surfacing and Improvements. After sewer, water and other utilities
to be located underground within the right-of-way have been installed by the
applicant, the applicant shall construct concrete cement pavement with integral
curb and gutter at a minimum thickness of six and one-half inches. Adequate
provisions shall be made for culverts, drains and bridges. All road pavement,
shoulders, drainage improvements and structures, curbs, turnarounds and
sidewalks shall conform to all construction standards and specifications
adopted by the City, and shall be incorporated into the construction plans
required to be submitted by the developer for plat approval. At the option of
the developer, the street surface may be constructed with six-inch rock base
and three inches of asphalt. In either case, integral curb and gutter
constructed of concrete cement shall be required.
3.Â Â Â Excess Right-of-way. Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards
designated in these regulations shall be required whenever, due to topography,
additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes. Such slopes
shall not be in excess of three to one.
4.Â Â Â Railroads and Limited Access Highways. Railroad rights-of-way and limited
access highways were so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands
shall be treated as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â In residential areas, a buffer strip at least 25 feet in depth in
addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be
provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway. This
strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the plat:
â€œThis strip is reserved for screening. The placement of structures hereon is
prohibited.â€
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In business, commercial or industrial areas, the nearest street
extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad shall, wherever
practicable, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure suitable depth for
commercial or industrial sites.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Streets parallel to the railroad when intersecting a street which
crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a
distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance
shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for
future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
5.Â Â Â Intersections. The following standards shall apply to the design of
intersections:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles. A proposed intersection of two new streets at an angle of less
than 75 degrees shall not be acceptable. An oblique street should be curved
approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right angles for at
least 100 feet therefrom. No more than two streets shall intersect at any one
point unless specifically approved by the Council.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall,
wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite
side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet
shall not be permitted, except where the intersected street has separated dual
drives without median breaks at either intersection. Where streets intersect
major streets, their alignment shall be continuous. Intersection of major
streets shall be at least 800 feet apart.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two municipal service
streets shall be at least 20 feet; and minimum curb radius at an intersection
involving a municipal collector street shall be at least 25 feet. Abrupt
changes in alignment within a block shall have the corners cut off in
accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe vehicular
movement.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever practical.
In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a leveling area
shall be provided having not greater than a two percent rate at a distance of
60 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting
street.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing
vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting
visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation, including
trees, in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent
deemed necessary to provide an adequate sight distance.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall be
three percent or less.
6.Â Â Â Bridges. Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined by the
Council, shall be constructed at the full expense of the applicant without
reimbursement from the City. The sharing expense for the construction of
bridges not of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined by the Council,
will be fixed by special agreement between the Council and the applicant. Said
cost shall be charged to the applicant pro rata as the percentage of his or her
land developed and so served.
7.Â Â Â Alleys. The following design standards for alleys shall be required of all
subdividers:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Alleys shall be prohibited in residential districts.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts, except
that the Council may waive this requirement where other definite and assured
provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading and
parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Alleys shall have a right-of-way of not less than 30 feet and a roadway
width of not less than 20 feet.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided,
but where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit safe
vehicular movement.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable,
shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead end, as
determined by the Council.
8.Â Â Â Street Dedications and Reservations. The following provisions shall apply
to street dedications and reservations:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Street systems in new subdivisions shall be laid out so as to eliminate
or avoid new perimeter half streets. Where an existing half street is adjacent
to a new subdivision, the other half of the street shall be improved and
dedicated by the subdivider. The Council may authorize a new perimeter street
where the subdivider improves and dedicates the entire required street right-
of-way width within his or her own subdivision boundaries.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow street or when City
plans indicate plans for realignment or widening a road that would require use
of some of the land in the subdivision, the applicant shall be required to
improve and dedicate at his expense such areas for widening or realignment of
such roads. Such frontage roads and streets shall be improved and dedicated by
the applicant at his or her own expense to the full width as required by these
subdivision regulations. Land reserved for any street purposes may not be
counted in satisfying yard or area requirements whether the land is to be
dedicated to the City in fee simple or an easement is granted to the City.
165.42Â Â Â STORM SEWERS AND DRAINAGE.
The following requirements shall apply to the provision of storm sewers and
drainage:
1.Â Â Â General Requirements. The Council shall not approve any plat of a
subdivision which does not make adequate provision for storm or flood water
run-off channels or basins. The storm water drainage system shall be separate
and independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers, where required,
shall be designed by methods as approved by the Council, and a copy of design
computations shall be submitted along with plans to the City Engineer. Inlets
shall be provided so that surface water is not carried across or around any
intersection, nor for a distance of more than 600 feet in the gutter. When
calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a point, no further
allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point, and basins shall be used to
intercept flow at that point. Surface water drainage patterns shall be shown
for each and every lot and block.
2.Â Â Â Nature of Storm Water Facilities. The applicant may be required by the
Council to carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that
may exist either previously to or as a result of the subdivision. Such drainage
facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible, or in
perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width, and shall be constructed
in accordance with the construction standards and specifications.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the applicant shall install
storm sewer facilities, or if no outlets are within a reasonable distance,
adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of storm waters, subject to
the specifications of the Council. However, in subdivisions containing lots
less than 15,000 square feet in area and in business and industrial districts,
underground storm sewer systems shall be constructed throughout the
subdivisions and be conducted to an approved outfall.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided eventually, as
determined by the Council, the subdivider shall make arrangement for future
storm water disposal by a public storm sewer system at the time the plat
receives final approval. Provision for such connection shall be incorporated by
inclusion in the performance bond required for the subdivision plat.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â A culvert or other drainage facility shall in each case be large enough
to accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether
inside or outside the subdivision. The Council shall determine the necessary
size of the facility, based on the provisions of the construction standards and
specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed development.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The Council shall also study the effect of each subdivision on existing
downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision. City
drainage studies together with such other studies as shall be appropriate shall
serve as a guide to needed improvements. Where it is anticipated that the
additional runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will overload
an existing downstream drainage facility, the Council may withhold approval of
the subdivision until provision has been made for the recovery of the cost for
the improvement of said potential condition in such sum as the Council shall
determine. No subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be
provided to an adequate drainage watercourse or facility.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The Council may, when it deems it necessary for the health, safety or
welfare of the present and future population of the area and necessary to the
conservation of water, drainage and sanitary facilities, prohibit the
subdivision of any portion of the property which lies within the floodplain of
any stream or drainage course.
3.Â Â Â Dedication of Drainage Easements. The following shall apply to the
dedication of drainage easements.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel
or stream, there shall be provided a storm water easement or drainage right-of-
way conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse, and of such
width and construction or both as will be adequate for the purpose. Wherever
possible, it is desirable that the drainage be maintained by an open channel
with landscaped banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume of flow.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Drainage Easements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within street rights-of- way,
perpetual unobstructed easements at least 15 feet in width for such drainage
facilities shall be provided across property outside the street lines and with
satisfactory access to the road. Easements shall be indicated on the plat.
Drainage easements shall be carried from the street to a natural watercourse or
to other drainage facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and
indicated on the plat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The applicant shall dedicate, either in fee or by drainage or
conservation easement of land on both sides of existing watercourses, to a
distance to be determined by the Council.

Â Â Â A.Â Â Â In the discretion of the Council, if a public water system is not
available, individual wells may be used or a central water system provided in
such a manner that an adequate supply of potable water will be available to
every lot in the subdivision. Water samples shall be submitted to the
appropriate County or State agency for testing, and individual wells and
central water systems shall be approved by the appropriate County or State
health authorities. Orders of approval shall be submitted to the Council.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If the Council requires that a connection to a public water main be
eventually provided as a condition to approval of an individual well or central
water system, the applicant shall make arrangements for future water service at
the time the plat receives final approval. Performance or cash bonds may be
required to insure compliance.
3.Â Â Â Fire Hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be required for all subdivisions except
those coming under Subsection 2 of this section. Fire hydrants shall be located

constructed as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The subdivider shall install a public sanitary sewage system if the
subdivision is within the City and shall provide sewers accessible to each lot
in the subdivision. The City shall provide public sanitary sewage system to a
property line of the subdivision if a public sanitary sewer system is required
by this provision.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If the subdivision is outside the City, and public sanitary sewage
systems are not reasonably accessible but will become available within a
reasonable time, not to exceed 15 years, the applicant may choose one of the
following alternatives:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Install a central sewage system, operated and maintained by the
benefited property owners. Where plans for future public sanitary sewage
systems exist, the applicant shall install the sewer lines, laterals and mains
to be in permanent conformance with such plans and ready for connection to such
public sewer mains.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Individual disposal systems, provided the applicant shall install
sanitary sewer lines, laterals and mains from the street curb to a point in the
subdivision boundary where a future connection with the public sewer main shall
be made. Sewer lines shall be laid from the house to the street line, and a
connection shall be available in the home to connect from the individual
disposal system to the sewer system when the public sewers become available.
Such sewer systems shall be capped until ready for use and shall conform to all
plans for installation of the public sewer system, where such exist, and shall
be ready for connection to such public sewer main.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â If a public sanitary sewage system is reasonably accessible, the
City shall provide public sanitary sewage system to a property line of the
subdivision.

sewage systems.
3.Â Â Â Individual Disposal System Requirements. If public sewer facilities are
not available and individual disposal systems are proposed, minimum lot areas
shall conform to the requirements of these regulations. Percolation tests and
test holes shall be made as directed by the City and the results submitted to
the local board of health.
4.Â Â Â Water Supply Interconnections. There shall be no physical connection
between a public or private potable water supply system and a sewer which will
permit the passage of any sewage or polluted water into the potable supply.
Sewers shall be kept removed from water supply wells or other water supply
sources and structures.
165.45Â Â Â SIDEWALKS.
The following requirements shall apply to the provision of sidewalks:

underground through the subdivision. All utility facilities existing and
proposed throughout the subdivision shall be shown on the preliminary plat.
Underground service connections to the street property line of each platted lot
shall be installed at the subdividerâ€™s expense. At the discretion of the
Council, the requirement for service connections to each lot may be waived in
the case of adjoining lots to be retained in single ownership and intended to
be developed for the same primary use. Any required transformers shall be
provided by the City without expense.
2.Â Â Â Easements. Easements shall be provided as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Easements centered on rear lot lines shall be provided for utilities.
Such easements shall be at least 10 feet wide. Proper coordination shall be
established between the subdivider and the applicable utility companies for the
establishment of utility easements established in adjoining properties.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where topographical or other conditions are such as to make impractical
the inclusion of utilities within the rear lot lines, perpetual unobstructed
easements at least 10 feet in width shall be provided along side lot lines with
satisfactory access to the street or rear lot lines. Easements shall be
indicated on the plat.
3.Â Â Â The City shall provide utility facilities to a property line of the
subdivision for subdivisions located within the City adjacent to or abutting
the City boundary line.

City as a whole, such as trees, watercourses and falls, beaches, historic spots
and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved in the design of the
subdivision. No trees shall be removed from any subdivision nor any change of
grade of the land effected until approval of the preliminary plat has been
granted. All trees on the plat required to be retained shall be preserved, and
all trees where required shall be protected against change of grade.
165.48Â Â Â NONRESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
The following provisions shall apply to nonresidential subdivisions:
1.Â Â Â General. If a proposed subdivision includes land that is used for
commercial or industrial purposes, the layout of the subdivision with respect
to such land shall make such provision as the Council may require. A
nonresidential subdivision shall be subject to all the requirements of these
regulations, as well as such additional standards required by the Council, and
shall conform to the proposed land use and standards established in City plans
and regulations.
2.Â Â Â Standards. In addition to the principles and standards in these
regulations, which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the
applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the street,
parcel and block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the uses
anticipated and takes into account other uses in the vicinity. The following
principles and standards shall be observed:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and dimensions to
the types of industrial development anticipated.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Streets rights-of-way and pavement shall be adequate to accommodate the
type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated thereupon.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Special requirements may be imposed by the City with respect to street,
curb, gutter and sidewalk design and construction.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Special requirements may be imposed by the City with respect to the
installation of public utilities, including water, sewer and storm water
drainage.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas from
potential nuisance from a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision,
including the provision of extra depth in parcels backing up on existing or
potential residential development and provisions for a permanently landscaped
buffer strip when necessary.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic,
shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or
potential residential areas.
165.49Â Â Â IMPROVEMENTS WITHIN UNINCORPORATED JURISDICTION.
Improvements in the two-mile unincorporated area under the jurisdiction of
these regulations shall be the same as required herein, except as otherwise
specifically stated, provided they are not less than that required by the
applicable County subdivision regulations, and provided further that all
construction plans shall be approved by the County, and completed public roads
shall be accepted by the Board of Supervisors for public maintenance.
165.50Â Â Â VARIATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.
The following shall apply to the granting of variations and exceptions:
1.Â Â Â Hardships. Where the Council finds that extraordinary hardships or
particular difficulties regarding the physical development of land may result
from strict compliance with these regulations, it may make variations or
exceptions to the regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the
public interest secured, provided that such variation or exception shall not
have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations; and
further provided, the Council shall not grant variations or exceptions to these
regulations unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to
it in each specific case that:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health or welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The conditions upon which the request for a variation is based are
unique to the property for which the variation is sought, and are not
applicable, generally, to other property.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical
conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the
owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict
letter of the regulations were carried out.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to
make more money out of the property.
2.Â Â Â Conditions. In granting variations and exceptions the Council may require
such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives
of the standards or requirements of these regulations.
3.Â Â Â Procedure for a Variance. A petition for any such variance shall be
submitted in writing by the developer at the time when the preliminary plat is
filed. The petition shall state fully the grounds for the application and all
of the facts relied upon by the petitioner.
165.51Â Â Â CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.
Any provisions of these regulations may be changed and amended from time to
time by the Council; provided, however, that such changes or amendments shall
not become effective until after a public hearing has been held, public notice
of which shall have been given as required by law. Such proposed amendments
shall first be submitted to the Council for study and recommendation before the
hearing is held. The Council shall make and give its recommendations and
findings at a Council meeting to be held within 30 days. The Council shall give
adequate notice thereof and hold a public hearing on the proposed amendment.
165.52Â Â Â ENFORCEMENT, VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
No plat or subdivision within the City or within two miles thereof shall be
filed or recorded with the County, nor shall any plat or subdivision have any
validity until it complies with the provision of these regulations, has been
approved by the Council as herein set forth, and further: Any person who shall
dispose of or offer for sale or lease any lots in the City or addition to the
City, until the plat thereof has been acknowledged and recorded as provided in
these regulations, shall forfeit and pay $50.00 for each lot and part of lot
sold or disposed of, leased or offered for sale.
