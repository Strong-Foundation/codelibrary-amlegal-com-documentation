for eligibility for a tax exemption on new construction. If the City Council
resolves to consider such proposal, it shall publish notice and hold a public
hearing thereon. Thereafter, at least 30 days after such hearing, the City
Council, by ordinance, may give its prior approval of a tax exemption for new
construction if the new construction is in conformance with City zoning. Such
prior approval shall not entitle the owner to exemption from taxation until the
new construction has been completed and found to be qualified real estate.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 427B.4)

   There shall be a Zoning Board of Adjustment, hereinafter referred to as the
Board, consisting of seven members. Five members shall be residents of the
City, appointed by the Council, and two members shall be residents of the area

   3.   Meetings of the Board shall be open to the public, minutes shall be

member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating that
fact, and records shall be made of the Board’s examination and other official
actions, all of which shall be filed immediately in the office of the Board as
a public record.
   4.   The concurring vote of four members of the Board is necessary to
reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the Zoning
Administrator or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which
it is required to pass under any ordinance or to effect any variation in an
ordinance.
29.02 APPLICATIONS AND APPEALS.
   1.   An application to the Board, in cases in which it has original
jurisdiction under the provisions of this chapter, may be taken by any property
owner, including a tenant, or by any governmental officer, department, board or
bureau. Such application shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator, together
with a non-refundable fee of $100.00, and the Zoning Administrator shall
transmit the same, together with all the plans, specifications and other papers
pertaining to the application, to the Board.
   2.   An appeal to the Board may be taken by any property owner, including a
tenant, or by any governmental officer, department, board or bureau affected by
any ruling of the Zoning Administrator. Such appeal shall be taken within a
reasonable time, as prescribed by the rules of the Board, by filing with the
Zoning Administrator a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The
Zoning Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Board such notice of
appeal, together with all the plans and papers constituting the record upon
which the action appealed from was taken. A non-refundable fee of $100.00 shall
also accompany the appeal.
   3.   The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of an application
or of an appeal. It shall give at least 15 days’ notice of the time and place
of such hearing by insertion in a newspaper published in the community, and
shall also give notice delivered by first class mail at least five days before

person or by agent or by attorney. The Board shall decide the application or
appeal within a reasonable time.
   4.   Stay of Proceedings. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Zoning Administrator
certifies to the Board that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a
stay would in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator cause imminent peril to
life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than
by an order which may, on due cause shown, be granted by the Board on
application, after notice to the building inspector, or by a court of record.
29.03 POWER TO MAKE SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF MAP.
   The Board shall have the power to hear and decide, in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter, requests or applications for special exceptions or
for interpretation of the zoning map or for decisions upon other special
questions upon which the Board is authorized to pass. In addition to permitting
the special exceptions heretofore specified, the Board shall have authority to
permit the following:
   1.   Certain Industries in I-1 Districts. In determining whether certain
uses shall be located in an I-1 District, the Board shall give due regard to
the nature and condition of all adjacent uses and structures, and the
consistency therewith of the proposed use and development. Before authorizing a
use as a special exception, the Board shall determine whether the proposed
exception or use would be hazardous, harmful, noxious, offensive, or a nuisance
to the surrounding neighborhood by reason of noise, smoke, odor, vibration,
dust and dirt, cinders, noxious gases, glare and heat, fire and safety hazard,
sewage wastes and pollution, transportation and traffic, aesthetic and
psychological effects. The Board may utilize and give recognition to those
performance standards which are available in model codes or ordinances, or have
been developed by planning, manufacturing, health, architectural and
engineering research organizations, and can be applied to the proposed use to
assist it in reaching a fair and objective decision. Upon authorizing a special
use and/or exception, the Board may impose such requirements and conditions in
addition to those expressly stipulated in this report for the particular
special use and/or exception as the Board may deem necessary for the protection
of adjacent properties and public interest.
   2.   Interpretation of Map. Where the street or lot layout actually on the
ground or as recorded, differs from the street and lot lines indicated on the
zoning map, the Board, after notice to the owners of the property and after
public hearing, shall interpret the map in such a way as to carry out the
intent and purposes of this chapter for the particular section or district in
question.
29.04 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   It is the duty of the Board of Adjustment to review and comment on
conditional use permit applications under Section
165.26(5) of this Code of Ordinances. The application shall be accompanied by
maps, drawings or other documentation in support of the request. The granting
of a conditional use permit shall not exempt the applicant from compliance with
other relevant provisions of related ordinances.
   1.   Application. All applications shall be accompanied by maps, drawings,
statements or other documents as required by the Board. A non-refundable fee of
$150.00 shall be collected at the time of submittal as determined by the City.
   2.   Public Hearing. Prior to the approval, amending or denial of a
conditional use permit, a public hearing shall be held by the Board. Upon the
completion of said public hearing, the Board shall render a decision within 10
working days.
   3.   Determination. The Board or the Council on appeal shall have the
authority to impose conditions and safeguards as deemed necessary to protect
and enhance the health, safety and welfare of the surrounding area. The
authorization of conditional use permit shall not be made unless the evidence
presented is such to establish the following:
      A.   Such use will not, under the specific circumstances of the
particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety or general welfare of the
surrounding area, and the proposed use is necessary or desirable and provides a
service or facility that contributes to the general well-being of the
surrounding area.
      B.   Such use will comply with the regulations and conditions specified
in this chapter for such use. The Board shall itemize, describe or justify,
then have recorded and filed in writing, the conditions imposed on the use.
   4.   Expiration and Revocation. Any granted conditional use permit shall
become null and void within one year of the date of approval, if not exercised.
A conditional use permit shall be considered exercised when the use has been
established or when a building permit has been issued and substantial
construction accomplished. If such permit is abandoned or discontinued for a
period of one year, it may not be reestablished unless authorized by the Board
or Council on appeal. A conditional use permit may be revoked if the applicant
fails to comply with the imposed conditions.
   5.   Adjustments. An adjustment to an approved conditional use permit shall
be submitted to the Zoning Administrator accompanied by supporting information.
The Board shall review the adjustment and may grant, deny or amend such
adjustment and impose conditions deemed necessary.
29.05 ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW.
   The Board has the power to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by
the appellant that there is error in any order, requirement, decision, grant or
refusal made by the Zoning Administrator in the enforcement of the provisions
of this chapter.
   1.   Variances. The Board may authorize on appeal in specific cases such
variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public
interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the
spirit of this chapter shall be observed and substantial justice done, as
follows:
      A.   Where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of
a specific piece of property at the time of enactment of the Zoning
Regulations, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions, or other
extraordinary and exceptional situation or condition of such piece of property,
or of the use or development of property immediately adjoining the piece of
property in question, the literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter
would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties or exceptional
and undue hardship upon the owner of such property, unnecessary to carry out
the spirit and purpose of this chapter, the Board shall have the power to
authorize, upon appeal, a variance from such strict application, so as to
relieve such difficulties or hardships, and so that the spirit and purpose of
this chapter shall be observed and substantial justice done. In authorizing a
variance, the Board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location,
character and other features of the proposed building, structure or use as it
may deem advisable in the interest of the furtherance of the purposes of this
chapter. No such variance in the provisions or requirements of this chapter
shall be authorized by the Board unless the Board finds beyond reasonable doubt
that all of the following conditions exist:
         (1)   There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or
conditions applying to the property in question or to the intended use of the
property that do not apply generally to other properties or class of uses in
the same zoning district.
         (2)   Such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of
a substantial property right possessed by other properties in the same zoning
district and in the vicinity.
         (3)   The authorizing of such variance will not be of substantial
detriment to adjacent property and will not materially impair the purposes of
this chapter or the public interest.
      B.   No grant or variance shall be authorized unless the Board
specifically finds the condition or situation of the specific piece of property
for which the variance is sought is not of so typical or recurrent a nature as
to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation, under
an amendment of this chapter, for such conditions or situations.
      C.   The Board shall have no power to authorize a variance for the
establishment of a nonconforming use where none previously existed.
      D.   In considering a request for a variance from the regulations
concerning signs, the Board shall give consideration and arrive at a finding on
the following:
         (1)   Shape and area of lot in question.
         (2)   Bulk and floor area of the main building or structure.
         (3)   Setback of proposed sign from all property lines.
         (4)   Zoning and use of surrounding parcels.
         (5)   Unusual or exceptional topography.
         (6)   Compatibility with general intent of the zoning chapter to
encourage development without detracting from the use and enjoyment of
surrounding property.
   2.   Action of Board. In exercising its powers, the Board may, in conformity
with the provisions of the Code of Iowa and of this chapter, reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or
determination as, in the Board’s opinion, ought to be made, and to that end has
all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.
   3.   Judicial Review. All final administrative decisions of the Board of
Adjustment shall be subject to judicial review pursuant to the provisions of
Chapter 414, Code of Iowa, and all amendments and modifications thereof, and
the rules adopted pursuant thereto.

46.01 PURPOSE; FINDINGS.
   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public interest, welfare,
health, and safety within the City by prohibiting the service to and
consumption of controlled substances and/or alcoholic beverages by persons
under the age of 21 at premises located in the City. The City Council finds
that the occurrence of social gatherings at premises where controlled
substances and/or alcoholic beverages are served to or consumed by persons
under the age of 21 is harmful to such persons themselves and a threat to
public welfare, health and safety. The City Council further finds that persons
under the age of 21 obtain controlled substances and/or alcoholic beverages at
such gatherings and that persons who are in control of such premises know or
have reason to know of such service and/or consumption and will be more likely
to ensure that controlled substances and/or alcoholic beverages are neither
served or consumed by persons under the age of 21 at these gatherings. Based on
these findings, the City Council has deemed it necessary to enact the following
regulations in the City.

control of the premises where the event, gathering or party takes place; (ii)

47.02 Cigarettes and Tobacco  
 
47.01 CURFEW.
   The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote
the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and
specifically to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults
responsible for minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors
committed after the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences
and criminal activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.

reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that
responsible adult’s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful

conduct or whereabouts of the minor.

where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to

juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the person’s
parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but
not for longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or
magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
      E.   “Public place” includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys, and sidewalks dedicated to public use and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises, whether publicly or privately owned,
that are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited

knowingly to permit or to allow a minor to be in any public place in the City
within the time periods prohibited by this section unless the minor’s presence
falls within one of the above exceptions.
   5.   Enforcement Procedures.
      A.   Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in
the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driver’s
license, a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance,
use his or her best judgment in determining age.
      B.   Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody. Grounds for arrest are
that the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the person’s
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any nonsecured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into
custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.
      C.   Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into
custody, the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the
minor as soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible
for the minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at
such time as the court may direct.
      D.   Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minor’s parent, guardian or other person
legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the
law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative
of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person
who is known to the child.
   6.   Penalties.
      A.   Responsible Adult’s First Violation. In the case of a first
violation by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall, by certified mail,
send to the adult responsible for the minor, written notice of the violation
with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of
the curfew ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with
applicable penalties.
      B.   Responsible Adult’s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as
defined in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows
the minor to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a
municipal infraction.
      C.   Minor’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a
minor, the law enforcement officer shall give the minor a written warning,
which states that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of
the curfew ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with
applicable penalties, or, at the law enforcement officer’s discretion, may
issue the minor a citation for a first violation.
      D.   Minor’s Second Violation. For the minor’s second and subsequent
violations of any of the provisions of this section, the minor is guilty of a
municipal infraction.
47.02 CIGARETTES AND TOBACCO.
   It is unlawful for any person under 18 years of age to smoke, use, possess,
purchase, or attempt to purchase any tobacco, tobacco products, alternative
nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes. Possession of tobacco,
tobacco products, alternative nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes
by a person under 18 years of age shall not constitute a violation of this
section if said person possesses the tobacco, tobacco products, alternative
nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes as part of the person’s
employment and said person is employed by a person who holds a valid permit
under Chapter 453A of the Code of Iowa or who lawfully offers for sale or sells

violated any provision of the Traffic Code, such officer may:
   1.   Immediate Arrest. Immediately arrest such person and take such person
before a local magistrate; or
   2.   Issue Citation. Without arresting the person, prepare in quintuplicate
a combined traffic citation and complaint as adopted by the Iowa Commissioner
of Public Safety, or issue a uniform citation and complaint utilizing a State-
approved computerized device.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 805.6 & 321.485)
70.02 SCHEDULED VIOLATIONS.
   For violations of the Traffic Code that are designated by Section 805.8A of
the Code of Iowa to be scheduled violations, the scheduled fine for each of
those violations shall be as specified in Section 805.8A of the Code of Iowa.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 805.8 & 805.8A)

a fine shall be in the amount of $25.00 for all violations except improper use
of a persons with disabilities parking permit or as specified in each
subsection. The fine for improper use of a persons with disabilities parking
permit is $100.00. If such fine is not paid within thirty (30) days, it shall

number, and the license plate numbers for all such unpaid fines to the
Washington County Treasurer. The Treasurer will enter a “stop” on the
registered owner(s) in the Iowa DOT System and refuse to renew the registration
of any vehicle on which the individual is an owner, lessee, or primary operator
pursuant to the authority of Iowa Code Section 321.40 and 321.236. OR
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.236[1b] and 321L.4[2])

provided shall be attached to the vehicle in a conspicuous place.
70.05 PRESUMPTION IN REFERENCE TO ILLEGAL PARKING.
   In any proceeding charging a standing or parking violation, a prima facie
presumption that the registered owner was the person who parked or placed such
vehicle at the point where, and for the time during which, such violation
occurred shall be raised by proof that:
   1.   Described Vehicle. The particular vehicle described in the information
was parked in violation of the Traffic Code; and

shall take into custody an abandoned vehicle on public property and may take
into custody any abandoned vehicle on private property. The police authority
may employ its own personnel, equipment, and facilities or hire a private
entity, equipment, and facilities for the purpose of removing, preserving,
storing, or disposing of abandoned vehicles. A property owner or other person
in control of private property may employ a private entity that is a garage

custody the abandoned vehicle without a police authority’s initiative. If a
police authority employs a private entity to dispose of abandoned vehicles, the

vehicle in custody and upon payment of the costs of the notice. The notice
shall also state that the failure of the owner, lienholders or claimants to
exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property within the
time provided shall be deemed a waiver by the owner, lienholders and claimants
of all right, title, claim and interest in the vehicle or personal property and
that failure to reclaim the vehicle or personal property is deemed consent to
the sale of the vehicle at a public auction or disposal of the vehicle to a
demolisher and to disposal of the personal property by sale or destruction. If
the abandoned vehicle was taken into custody by a private entity without a
police authority’s initiative, the notice shall state that the private entity

   If it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identity and
addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders, notice by one
publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the
vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice
under Section 80.03. The published notice may contain multiple listings of
abandoned vehicles and personal property but shall be published within the same
time requirements and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed
notice in Section 80.03.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3b])
80.05 FEES FOR IMPOUNDMENT.
   The owner, lienholder, or claimant shall pay all towing and storage fees as
established by the storage facility, whereupon the vehicle shall be released.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3a])

not the motor vehicle should be sold for use upon the highways, and shall
dispose of the motor vehicle in accordance with State law.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[4])

whose title certificate is faulty, lost or destroyed, may dispose of such motor
vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without notification
procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more wheels or
other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable. The police
authority shall give the applicant a certificate of authority. The applicant
shall then apply to the County Treasurer for a junking certificate and shall
surrender the certificate of authority in lieu of the certificate of title.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.90[2e])
80.08 PROCEEDS FROM SALES.
   Proceeds from the sale of any abandoned vehicle shall be applied to the
expense of auction, cost of towing, preserving, storing, and notification
required, in accordance with State law. Any balance shall be held for the owner
of the motor vehicle or entitled lienholder for 90 days, and then shall be
deposited in the State Road Use Tax Fund. Where the sale of any vehicle fails
to realize the amount necessary to meet costs the police authority shall apply
for reimbursement from the Department of Transportation.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[4])
80.09 DUTIES OF DEMOLISHER.
   Any demolisher who purchases or otherwise acquires an abandoned motor
vehicle for junk shall junk, scrap, wreck, dismantle, or otherwise demolish

crossed or where there is any danger of undermining or settlement, cast iron
soil pipe or vitrified clay sewer pipe thoroughly encased in concrete shall be
required for such crossings. Such encasement shall extend at least six inches
on all sides of the pipe. The cast iron pipe or encased clay pipe shall rest on
firm, solid material at either end.
   13.   Preparation of Basement or Crawl Space. No connection for any
residence, business or other structure with any sanitary sewer shall be made
unless the basement floor is poured, or in the case of a building with a slab
or crawl space, unless the ground floor is installed with the area adjacent to
the foundation of such building cleared of debris and backfilled. The backfill
shall be well compacted and graded so that the drainage is away from the
foundation. Prior to the time the basement floor is poured, or the first floor
is installed in buildings without basements, the sewer shall be plugged and the
plug shall be sealed by the Superintendent. Any accumulation of water in any
excavation or basement during construction and prior to connection to the
sanitary sewer shall be removed by means other than draining into the sanitary
sewer.
96.06 INTERCEPTORS REQUIRED.
   Grease, oil, sludge and sand interceptors shall be provided by gas and
service stations, convenience stores, car washes, garages, and other facilities
when, in the opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper
handling of such wastes that contain grease in excessive amounts or any
flammable waste, sand or other harmful ingredients. Such interceptors shall not
be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. When required, such
interceptors shall be installed in accordance with the following:
   1.   Design and Location. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity
as specified in the State Plumbing Code, to be approved by the Superintendent,
and shall be located so as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and

with easily removable covers that shall be gastight and watertight.
   3.   Maintenance. All such interceptors shall be maintained by the owner at
the owner’s expense and shall be kept in continuously efficient operations at
all times.
96.07 SEWER TAP.
   Connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the
“Y” branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If no properly
located “Y” branch is available, a saddle “Y” shall be installed at the
location specified by the Superintendent. The public sewer shall be tapped with
a tapping machine and a saddle appropriate to the type of public sewer shall be
glued or attached with a gasket and stainless steel clamps to the sewer. At no
time shall a building sewer be constructed so as to enter a manhole unless
special written permission is received from the Superintendent and in
accordance with the Superintendent’s direction if such connection is approved.
96.08 INSPECTION REQUIRED.
   All connections with the sanitary sewer system before being covered shall be
inspected and approved, in writing, by the Superintendent. As soon as all pipe
work from the public sewer to inside the building has been completed, and

industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer. Storm water and all other
unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such sewers as are specifically
designated as combined sewers or storm sewers, or to a natural outlet approved
by the City. Industrial cooling water or unpolluted process waters may be
discharged on approval of the City, to a storm sewer, combined sewer, or
natural outlet if the person has obtained a NPDES permit from the State.
97.02 STORM SEWERS.
   The connection of storm water or groundwater drains into City storm sewers
may be permitted after receiving written approval from the City and is to be
done at the direction of the City and at no cost to the City. The applicant
shall notify the City to inspect the connection. The owner shall indemnify the
City from any loss or damage that may be directly or indirectly occasioned by
the installation of the connection to the storm sewer.
97.03 PROHIBITED DISCHARGES.
   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any of the following
described waters or wastes to any public sewers:
   1.   Any liquids, solids or gases which, by reason of their nature or
quantity, are or may be sufficient, either alone or by interaction with other
substances, to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the
treatment works or to the operation of the treatment works. At no time shall
two successive readings on an explosion hazard meter at the point of discharge
into the system (or at any point in the system) be more than five percent nor
any single reading over 10 percent of the Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) of the
meter. Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to, gasoline,
kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones,
aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates, bromates, carbides, hydrides and
sulfides and any other substances which the City, State or EPA has notified the
user is a fire hazard or a hazard to the system.
   2.   Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity,
either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to cause interference
with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or
animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the treatment works
or to exceed the limitation set forth in a National Categorical Pretreatment
Standard. Toxic pollutants include but are not limited to any pollutant
identified pursuant to Section 307(a) of the Act.
   3.   Any waters or wastes having a pH greater than 9.5, unless approved by
the Superintendent, or a pH lower than 5.5 or having any other corrosive
property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment, and
personnel of the sewage works.
   4.   Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the flow in
a sewer or other interference with the operation of the wastewater treatment
facilities, such as, but not limited to: grease, garbage with particles greater

gas, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining or processing of fuel or
lubricating oil, mud or glass grinding or polishing wastes.
   5.   Any substance which may cause the treatment works effluent or any other
product of the treatment works, such as residues, sludges or scums, to be
unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation
process. In no case shall a substance discharged to the treatment works cause
the treatment works to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal
criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under Section 405 of the Act; or
any criteria, guidelines or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal
developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the
Toxic Substances Control Act or State criteria applicable to the sludge
management method being used.
   6.   Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological
activity in the treatment works plant resulting in interference, but in no case
wastewater or vapor having a temperature higher than 65°C. (150°F.), unless
approved by the City; and in no case wastewater or vapor with a temperature at
the introduction into the treatment plant which exceeds 40°C. (104°F.).
   7.   Any water or waste containing fats, wax, grease, or oils, whether
emulsified or not, in excess of 100 milligrams per liter.
   8.   Water or wastes containing substances which may solidify or become
viscous at temperatures between 32°F. and 150°F. (0°C. and 65°C.), unless
approved by the City.

standards.
   10.   Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the treatment
process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning
solutions.
   11.   Any waters or wastes containing strong acid iron pickling wastes, or
concentrated plating solution whether neutralized or not, unless approved by
the City.
   12.   Any pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD5 , etc.)
released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which a user knows or
has reason to know will cause interference to the treatment works. In no case
shall a slug load have a flow rate or contain concentrations or quantities of
pollutants that exceed for any time period longer than 15 minutes more than
five times the average 24-hour concentration, quantities or flow during normal
operations.
   13.   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration
as may exceed limits established by the City in compliance with applicable
State or federal regulations.
   14.   Any noxious or malodorous gas or other substance which either singly
or by interaction with other wastes is capable of creating a public nuisance or
hazard to life or of preventing entry into sewers for their maintenance and
repair.
   15.   Any wastewater, which causes a hazard to human life or creates a
public nuisance.
   16.   Any wastewater, which will cause interference with the operation or
performance of the treatment, works.
   Any discharges listed above as requiring approval of the City shall be
evaluated based upon such factors as the quantities of subject wastes in
relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of
the sewers, nature of the sewage treatment process, capacity of the sewage
treatment plant, degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage treatment
plant, and other pertinent factors. When the City, in consultation with IDNR,
determines that a user is contributing to the treatment works, any of the above
enumerated substances in such amounts as to interfere with the operation of the
treatment works, adversely affect sludge or effluent quality, cause hazard to
human life, or create a public nuisance, the City shall: (i) advise the user of
the impact of the contribution; (ii) develop effluent limitations for such user
to correct the problem; and (iii) require a compliance schedule which will be
compatible with the City and IDNR requirements.
97.04 NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   Upon the promulgation of the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards for
a particular industrial subcategory, the National Standard, if more stringent
than limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that subcategory,
shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this chapter.
97.05 SPECIFIC POLLUTANT LIMITATIONS.
   No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following
30-day average limitations without having first obtained a Treatment Agreement

   State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case
where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations, or
those in this chapter.
97.07 EXCESSIVE DISCHARGE.
   No user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt
to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the National
Categorical Pretreatment Standards or in any other pollutant-specific
limitation developed by the City or State. (Comment: Dilution may be an
acceptable means of complying with some of the pH prohibitions.)
97.08 ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES.
   Each significant industrial user, or any other user as deemed necessary by
the City, shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
material or other substances regulated by this chapter. Facilities to prevent
accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained
at the owner’s or user’s own cost and expense. In the case of an accidental
discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and
notify the treatment works of the incident. The notification shall include
location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume and corrective
actions.
97.09 TREATMENT AGREEMENT.
   All significant industrial users proposing to connect to or to contribute to
the treatment works shall obtain a Treatment Agreement before connecting to or
contributing to the treatment works.
97.10 TREATMENT AGREEMENT MODIFICATIONS.
   After promulgation of a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, the
Treatment Agreement of users subject to such standards shall be revised to
require compliance with such standard within the time frame prescribed by such
standard. Where a user, subject to a National Categorical Pretreatment
Standard, has not previously submitted an application for a Treatment
Agreement, the user shall apply for a Treatment Agreement within the time
period identified in the Standard. The terms and conditions of the Treatment
Agreement may be subject to modification by the City during the term of the
Treatment Agreement as City, State or Federal limitations or requirements are
modified or if other just cause exists. The user shall be informed of any
proposed changes in said user’s Treatment Agreement at least 30 days prior to
the effective date of the change. Any changes or new conditions in the
Treatment Agreement shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.
97.11 TREATMENT AGREEMENT CONDITIONS.
   Treatment Agreements shall be expressly subject to all provisions of this
chapter and all other applicable regulations, user charges and fees established
by the City. Treatment Agreements may contain the following:
   1.   Limits on the average and maximum wastewater constituents and
characteristics;
   2.   Limits on average and maximum rate and time of discharge or
requirements for flow regulations and equalization;
   3.   Requirements for installation and maintenance of inspection and
sampling facilities;
   4.   Specifications for monitoring programs, which may include sampling
locations, frequency of sampling, number, types and standards for tests and
reporting schedule;
   5.   Compliance schedules;
   6.   Requirements for submission of technical reports or discharge reports;
   7.   Requirements for maintaining and retaining plant records relating to
wastewater discharge as specified by the City, and affording City access
thereto;
   8.   Requirements for notification of the City for any new introduction of
wastewater constituents or any substantial change in the volume or character of
the wastewater constituents being introduced into the wastewater treatment
system;
   9.   Requirements for notification of slug discharges or periodic cleanings;
and
   10.   Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the City to ensure
compliance with this chapter.
97.12 TREATMENT AGREEMENT TRANSFER.
   Treatment Agreements are issued to a specific user for a specific operation.
A Treatment Agreement shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new
owner, new user, different premises or a new or changed operation without the
approval of the City. Any succeeding owner or user shall also comply with the
terms and conditions of the existing agreement.
97.13 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   All significant industrial users shall be required to provide and operate at
their own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow
measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user’s premises, but the
City may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on
the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk
area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
vehicles. There will be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
facility and all sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring
facilities shall be provided in accordance with the City’s requirements and all
applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall
be completed within 90 days following written notification by the City.
97.14 TESTING METHODS.
   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the monitoring facility provided or upon suitable
samples taken at said monitoring facility. In the event that no special
monitoring facility has been required, the monitoring facility shall be
considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the
point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out
by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the
sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and
property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four
hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab
sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD5 and suspended
solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four hour composites of all outfalls,
whereas pH’s are determined from periodic grab samples.
97.15 PRETREATMENT.
   Users shall provide wastewater treatment as required to comply with this
chapter and shall achieve compliance with all National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards within the time limitations as specified. Any facilities required to
pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the City shall be provided,
operated and maintained continuously and in satisfactory and effective
operation at the user’s expense.
97.16 UNUSUAL DISCHARGES; SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS.
   No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the City and any industrial concern
whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by
the City for treatment, subject to payment therefore by the industrial concern.
Special arrangements shall not be allowed which will cause violation of
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or NPDES permit.
97.17 REVOCATION OF TREATMENT AGREEMENT. A user is subject to having a
Treatment Agreement revoked for any of the following conditions:
   1.   Failure of a user to report factually the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
   2.   Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater constituents and characteristics;
   3.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose of
inspection or monitoring; or
   4.   Violation of conditions of the permit.
97.18 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
   Whenever the City, in consultation of IDNR, finds that any user has violated
or is violating this chapter, Treatment Agreement or any prohibition,
limitation or requirement contained in the chapters of this Code of Ordinances
relating to the Sanitary Sewer System, the City may serve upon such person a
written notice stating: (i) the impact of the contribution; (ii) the effluent
limitations; and (iii) the required compliance schedule which shall be
developed in compliance with IDNR regulations. Within a specified period of the
date of the written notice, a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof
shall be submitted to the City by the user.
97.19 HARMFUL CONTRIBUTIONS.
   The City, in consultation with IDNR, may suspend wastewater treatment
service and/or the Treatment Agreement of a user when such suspension is
necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or
may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons or to the environment, causes interference to the treatment works or
causes the City to violate any condition of its NPDES permit. Any user notified
of a suspension of wastewater treatment service and/or its Treatment Agreement
shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure
of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the City shall
take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the treatment works or
endangerment to any individuals. The City shall reinstate the Treatment
Agreement and/or the wastewater treatment service upon payment to the City of
all costs of such disconnection and reconnection and upon proof of the
elimination of the non-complying discharge. A detailed written statement
submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the City
within 15 days after the date of occurrence.
97.20 SUMP PUMPS.
   1.   Definition and Method. No water from any roof, surface, ground, sump
pump, footing tile, swimming pool, or other natural precipitation shall be
discharged into the sanitary sewerage system. Dwellings and other buildings and
structures which require, because of the infiltration of water into basements,
crawl spaces and the like, a sump pump system to discharge excess water, shall
have a permanently installed discharge line which shall not at any time
discharge water into the sanitary sewerage system, except as provided herein. A
permanent installation is one which provides for year-round discharge
capability to either the outside of the dwelling, building or structure or is
connected to the City storm sewer. If there is no sub-drain available, the
surface discharge point shall be located no closer than five feet from the
curb, property line, or traveled portion of any street, except the drain hose
may not be laid across a sidewalk or in a driveway allowing the water to run
down or across a sidewalk. It shall consist of a rigid discharge line, without
valving or quick connections for altering the path of discharge, and if
connected to the City storm sewer line, shall include a check valve.
   2.   Inspection. Every person owning improved real estate that discharges
into the City’s sanitary sewer system shall allow an employee of the City to
inspect the buildings to confirm that there is no sump pump or other prohibited
discharge into the sanitary sewer system. Further, every person shall allow
said employee access to test by televised scoping or otherwise the sewer
service line. In lieu of having the City inspect the property, any person may
furnish a certificate from a plumber approved by the City certifying that said
person’s property is in compliance with this section. Any person refusing to
allow his or her property to be inspected or refusing to furnish a plumber’s
certificate within 14 days of the date City employees are denied admittance to
the property, shall immediately become subject to the surcharge hereinafter
provided for. Any owner of property found to violate this section shall make
the necessary changes to comply with this section and furnish proof of the
changes to the City within 45 days from the date the violation was identified.
   3.   Future Inspections. At any future time, if the City has reason to
suspect that an illegal connection may exist in a premise, the owner, by
written notice, shall comply with the provisions of this section.
   4.   Penalty. A violation of this section shall result in a municipal
infraction as outlined in
Chapter 4.

   There is hereby granted to Interstate Power and Light Company, hereinafter
referred to as the "Company," its successors and assigns, the right, privilege
and non-exclusive franchise for the term of twenty-five (25) years 1 from and
after the passage, adoption, approval and acceptance of this ordinance, to lay
down, maintain and operate the necessary pipes, mains and other conductors and
appliances in, along and under the streets, avenues, alleys and public places
in the City as now or hereafter constituted, for the purpose of distributing,
supplying and selling gas to said City and the residents thereof and to persons
and corporations beyond the limits thereof; also the right of eminent domain as
provided in Section 364.2 of the Code of Iowa. The term "gas" as used in this
franchise shall be construed to mean natural gas only.
 
Notes
1 EDITOR'S NOTE: Ordinance No. 1098, adopting a natural gas franchise for the
  City, was passed and adopted on January 7, 2020.
110.02 CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE.
   The mains and pipes of the Company must be so placed as not to interfere
unnecessarily with water pipes, drains, sewers and fire plugs which have been
or may hereafter be placed in any street, alley and public places in said City
nor unnecessarily interfere with the proper use of the same, including ordinary
drainage, or with the sewers, underground pipe and other property of the City.
The Company, its successors and assigns shall hold the City free and harmless
from all damages arising from the negligent acts or omissions of the Company in
the laying down, operation and maintenance of said natural gas distribution
system.
110.03 EXCAVATIONS.
   In making any excavations in any street, alley, or public place, Company,
its successors and assigns, shall protect the site while work is in progress by
guards, barriers or signals, shall not unnecessarily obstruct the use of the
streets, and shall back fill all openings in such manner as to prevent settling
or depressions in surface, pavement or sidewalk of such excavations with same
materials, restoring the condition as nearly as practical. The Company shall
not be required to restore or modify public right of way, sidewalks or other
areas in or adjacent to the Company project to a condition superior to its
immediate previously existing condition, unless said improvement is necessary
to meet a SUDAS (Statewide Urban Design and Specifications) standard, a
requirement of the Americans with Disabilities Act, or any other standard
mandated by state or federal law. If the City otherwise requests that the
Company restore or modify the public right of way, sidewalks or other areas on
a particular project to a condition superior to its immediate existing
condition, the Company will discuss such a request with the City and may
require the City to pay the incremental cost of such an improvement.
110.04 RELOCATION.
   The Company shall, at its cost, locate and relocate its existing facilities
or equipment in, on, over or under any public street or alley in the City in
such a manner as the City may at any time reasonably require for the purposes
of facilitating the construction, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of the
street or alley or any public improvement thereof, in or about any such street
or alley or reasonably promoting the efficient operation of any such
improvement. The Company and City will engage in good faith discussion to
establish a mutually agreeable date by which any relocation of the Company's
existing facilities can be completed. If the City requires the Company to
relocate facilities in the public right of way that have been relocated at
Company expense at the direction of the City during the previous five (5)
years, the Company may request the reasonable costs of such relocation, which
shall be paid by the City.
   If the City orders or requests the Company to relocate its existing
facilities or equipment for any reason other than as specified above, or as the
result of the initial request for a commercial, private or other non-public
development, the Company shall receive payment for the cost of such relocation
as a precondition to relocating its existing facilities or equipment.
   The City shall consider reasonable alternatives in designing its public
works projects so as not arbitrarily to cause the Company unreasonable
additional expense in exercising its authority under this section. The City
shall also provide a reasonable alternative location for the Company's
facilities as part of its relocation request. In the event that no reasonable
alternative location can be identified within the public right-of-way that
meets applicable code standards, including but not limited to 49 CFR §192.325,
and the Company work practices that implement those code standards, City and
Company shall work cooperatively to secure appropriate easements on private
property. The Company may request the reasonable costs of acquiring the private
easements, which shall be paid by the City.
   When the Company extends service to new service locations, such extensions
will be in accordance with and based upon the Company's extension policies and
tariffs which are then in effect.
110.05 ANNUAL MEETING.
   Company operations staff will, at the request of the City, attend an annual
meeting with the City to discuss annual and long-term construction planning for
the Company and City. This will not replace any periodic meetings needed on
specific projects and issues. In addition, the Company will provide advance
notice via electronic mail to the City of planned construction projects.
However, notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance notice is required for
Company's maintenance, upgrading and repair of existing facilities unless said
maintenance, upgrading or repair involves excavation of the City's street and
sidewalk infrastructure. Advance notice is not required in an emergency. While
the Company will make every effort to provide advance notice, failure to
provide such notice shall not be deemed a default under this chapter.
110.06 RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATION.
   Prior to the City abandoning or vacating any street, avenue, alley or public
ground where the Company has gas facilities, the City shall grant the Company a
utility easement for said facilities. If the City does not grant the Company a
utility easement for said facilities prior to abandoning or vacating a street,
avenue, alley or public place, the City shall at its cost and expense obtain
easements for existing Company facilities.
110.07 CONTINUOUS SERVICE.
   Said Company, its successors and assigns, shall throughout the term of the
franchise distribute to all consumers gas of good quality and shall furnish
uninterrupted service, except as interruptible service may be specifically
contracted for with consumers; provided, however, that any prevention of
service caused by fire, act of God or unavoidable event or accident shall not
be a breach of this condition if the Company resumes service as quickly as is
reasonably practical after the happening of the act causing the interruption.
110.08 FRANCHISE FEE.
   There is hereby imposed a franchise fee of zero percent (0%) upon the gross
revenue generated from sales of natural gas by the Company within the corporate
limits of the City. The Company shall begin collecting the franchise fee upon
receipt of written approval of the required tax rider tariff from the Iowa
Utilities Board.
   The amount of the franchise fee shall be shown separately on the utility
bill to each customer. The Company shall remit franchise fee receipts to the
City no more frequently than on or before the last business day of the month
following each calendar year quarter.
   The Company shall not, under any circumstances be required to return or
refund any franchise fees that have been collected from customers and remitted
to the City. In the event the Company is required to provide data or
information in defense of the City's imposition of franchise fees or the
Company is required to assist the City in identifying customers or calculating
any franchise fee refunds for groups of or individual customers the City shall
reimburse the Company for the expenses incurred by the Company to provide such
data or information.
110.09 INDEMNIFICATION.
   The Company shall indemnify and hold the City harmless at all times during
the term of this franchise from and against all claims for injury or damage to
persons or property caused by the Company's negligence in the construction,
erection, operation or maintenance of its facilities, or the negligence of its
contractors or its employees; provided however, that the Company shall not be
obligated to indemnify or hold the City harmless for any costs or damages
arising from the negligence of the City, its officers, employees or
contractors.
110.10 TERMINATION.
   If either party determines that there has been a default under this chapter,
the other party shall be given written notice of the same describing the
default in detail and the defaulting party shall be given a reasonable time to
respond to the written notice, which shall be at least thirty (30) days. The
failure of the Company to cure said default may result in the termination of
the franchise agreement by the City.
110.11 TERM OF FRANCHISE.

  was passed and adoped on January 7, 2020.
111.02 CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE.
   The poles, lines, wires, circuits, and other appliances shall be placed and

streets, alleys, and public places in said City nor unnecessarily interfere
with the proper use of the same, including ordinary drainage, or with the
sewers, underground pipe and other property of the City.
111.03 EXCAVATIONS.
   In making any excavations in any street, alley, or public place, Company,
its successors and assigns, shall protect the site while work is in progress by
guards, barriers or signals, shall not unnecessarily obstruct the use of the
streets, and shall back fill all openings in such manner as to prevent settling
or depressions in surface, pavement or sidewalk of such excavations with same
materials, restoring the condition as nearly as practical. The Company shall
not be required to restore or modify public right of way, sidewalks or other
areas in or adjacent to the Company project to a condition superior to its
immediate previously existing condition, unless said improvement is necessary
to meet a SUDAS (Statewide Urban Design and Specifications) standard, a
requirement of the Americans with Disabilities Act, or any other standard
mandated by state or federal law. If the City otherwise requests that the
Company restore or modify the public right of way, sidewalks or other areas on
a particular project to a condition superior to its immediate existing
condition, the Company will discuss such a request with the City and may
require the City to pay the incremental cost of such an improvement.
111.04 RELOCATION.
   The Company shall, at its cost, locate and relocate its existing facilities
or equipment in, on, over or under any public street or alley in the City in
such a manner as the City may at any time reasonably require for the purposes
of facilitating the construction, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of the
street or alley or any public improvement thereof, in or about any such street
or alley or reasonably promoting the efficient operation of any such
improvement. The Company and City will engage in good faith discussion to
establish a mutually agreeable date by which any relocation of the Company's
existing facilities can be completed. If the City requires the Company to
relocate facilities in the public right of way that have been relocated at
Company expense at the direction of the City during the previous five (5)
years, the Company may request the reasonable costs of such relocation, which
shall be paid by the City.
   If the City orders or requests the Company to relocate its existing
facilities or equipment for any reason other than as specified above, or as the
result of the initial request for a commercial, private or other non-public
development, the Company shall receive payment for the cost of such relocation
as a precondition to relocating its existing facilities or equipment.
   The City shall consider reasonable alternatives in designing its public
works projects so as not arbitrarily to cause the Company unreasonable
additional expense in exercising its authority under this section. The City
shall also provide a reasonable alternative location for the Company's
facilities as part of its relocation request. In the event that no reasonable
alternative location can be identified within the public right-of-way that
meets applicable code standards, including but not limited to NESC 320.b, and
the Company work practices that implement those code standards, City and
Company shall work cooperatively to secure appropriate easements on private
property. The Company may request the reasonable costs of acquiring the private
easements, which shall be paid by the City.

will be in accordance with and based upon the Company's extension policies and
tariffs which are then in effect.

Company's maintenance, upgrading and repair of existing facilities unless said
maintenance, upgrading or repair involves excavation of the City's street and
sidewalk infrastructure. Advance notice is not required in an emergency. While
the Company will make every effort to provide advance notice, failure to
provide such notice shall not be deemed a default under this chapter.

ground where the Company has electric facilities, the City shall grant the
Company a utility easement for said facilities. If the City does not grant the

a street, avenue, alley or public place, the City shall at its cost and expense
obtain easements for existing Company facilities.
111.07 PRUNING AND VEGETATION.
   The Company is authorized and empowered to prune or remove at Company
expense any tree extending into any street, alley or public grounds to maintain
electric reliability, safety, to restore utility service and to prevent limbs,
branches or trunks from interfering with the wires and facilities of the
Company. The pruning and removal of trees shall be performed in accordance with
Company's then current line clearance vegetation plan as filed and approved by
the Iowa Utilities Board, as well as all applicable codes and standards
referenced therein. The Company shall replace any healthy tree that the Company

not interfere with company facilities in the future.

information in defense of the City's imposition of franchise fees or the
Company is required to assist the City in identifying customers or calculating
any franchise fee refunds for groups of or individual customers the City shall
reimburse the Company for the expenses incurred by the Company to provide such
data or information.
111.11 INDEMNIFICATION.

the term of this franchise from and against all claims for injury or damage to
persons or property caused by the Company's negligence in the construction,

contractors or its employees; provided however, that the Company shall not be
obligated to indemnify or hold the City harmless for any costs or damages
arising from the negligence of the City, its officers, employees or

the other party shall be given written notice of the same describing the
default in detail and the defaulting party shall be given a reasonable time to

plan, in a format acceptable to the Building Official. The site plan should
include the location of existing improvements and features on the public

other overhead obstructions. Any public parking spots to be blocked during the
construction shall be noted, along with an indication of the frequency those
parking spots are expected to be unavailable. The contractor shall submit
engineering documentation to support the validity of any equipment erected on
site for the purpose of public safety or closures unless said equipment was

   3.   Maintenance of Sidewalk Access. Access to public sidewalks must be
maintained to the greatest extent possible throughout the construction process.
Contractors may be required to provide overhead protection to the sidewalk area
to allow for unimpeded public access. If no other alternative exists, any
sidewalk closures must be done in strict conformance with the guidelines of the
Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended, and other applicable guidelines.

written statement is required from all adjacent property owners who are giving
permission to allow the encroachment along their property.

proof of at least $1,000,000.00 of general liability insurance and the City of
Washington must be named as an additional insured and a certificate provided

      A.   Up to one week
      B.   Up to one month

      Permitted projects extending beyond the original duration may have the
permit extended by notification to the City of the need for such change and the
payment of the difference in fee amount to the next level on the fee schedule.
Extension of the permit period by two levels or more triggers the notification
provisions of Section
135.14(5). Reapplication must be made for projects extending beyond six months.
   10.   Revocation. The permit may be suspended or revoked by the Building
Official upon finding evidence that the permit holder has violated the

There shall be no refund of the permit fee.

         (1)   Fire Safety. The category of fire safety includes the building
safety parameters affecting the structural fire resistance, detection, alarm
and extinguishing features of a qualified historic building.
         (2)   Means of Egress. The category of means of egress includes those
building safety parameters of a qualified historic building affecting safe
evacuation.
         (3)   General Safety. The category of general safety includes all the
safety building parameters under fire safety and means of egress.
      B.   Seventeen Building Parameters. A qualified historic building shall
be evaluated using the 17 building safety parameters indicated in Table 1 of
this section.
TABLE 1
(1)  Number of stories
(2)  Building area
(3)  Building setback
(4)  Attic compartmentalization
(5)  Fire stopping
(6)  Mixed occupancies
(7)  Vertical openings
(8)  HVAC systems
(9)  Smoke detection
(10) Fire alarms
(11) Smoke control
(12) Exit capacity
(13) Dead ends
(14) Maximum travel distance
(15) Emergency power
(16) Elevator control
(17) Sprinklers
 
      C.   Determining Numerical Value. Each building safety parameter shall be
evaluated using the criteria specified under that particular building safety
parameter (Tables 2 through 18 of this section) in order to determine the
degree of life safety provided by the qualified historic building and the
numerical value assigned for the degree of life safety.
         (1)   Numerical values may not be interpolated and shall be listed
according to value and positive (+) or negative (-) sign.
         (2)   Numerical values may not be assigned to those spaces on the
summary sheet identified with “n/a.”
         (3)   Where a building parameter does not apply, a value of zero shall
be assigned.
      D.   Building Evaluation Form. After the numerical value has been
determined for each building safety parameter the same numerical value shall be
entered on the building evaluation form in Subsection 4 of this section under
each of the life safety categories titled, Fire Safety, Means of Egress, and
General Safety for each building parameter.
      E.   Total Building Safety Score. After each building parameter of the
building is evaluated, the numerical values shall be algebraically summed or
totaled according to value and sign for each column on the evaluation form in
Subsection 4 of this section for fire safety, means of egress and general
safety to determine a total building safety score.
         (1)   If the total building safety score under each column is equal to
or greater than zero, the qualified historic building is considered to be a
code complying building and may be used for the proposed use.
         (2)   If the total building safety score of any one of the columns
related to fire safety, means of egress or general safety is less than zero,
additional safety measures shall be provided to bring the total numerical score
of that column to a value which is equal to or greater than zero.
      F.   Filing of Building Evaluation Form. A copy of the building
evaluation form shall be submitted with the plans and specifications.
         (1)   Single Use. One building evaluation form shall be completed for
a qualified historic building containing a single use or a similar use within
the same occupancy classification or where an occupancy separation is not
provided.
         (2)   Mixed Uses. One building evaluation form for each use shall be
completed for a qualified historic building containing uses not within the same
occupancy classifications, separated by an occupancy separation.
   3.   Building Evaluation Procedures. When the building evaluation method is
used, the process specified in this section shall be used in its entirety. The
building evaluation method analyzes a qualified historic building in accordance
with the building safety parameters specified in this section and compares them
against the prevailing code to determine a numerical value of safety provided
in the qualified historic building.
      A.   Number of Stories.
         (1)   Class of Construction. The class of construction of the
qualified historic building shall be determined by comparing the actual
building elements to those specified in the prevailing code. Buildings with
different classes of construction shall be separated with a separation
specified in the prevailing code unless the lowest class of construction is
used as the basis for the evaluation.
         (2)   Allowable Number. The allowable number of stories for the class
of construction of the qualified historic building shall be determined in
accordance with the prevailing code and the class of construction or height
requirements or both as specified in the applicable occupancy chapters.
         (3)   Numerical Value. A single numerical value from Table 2 of this
section shall be determined and the numerical value and its sign, either
positive or negative, shall be entered on the evaluation form in Subsection 4
of this section under the safety parameter, number of stories, for fire safety,
means of egress and general safety.
TABLE 2 – Safety Parameter/Number of Stories Numerical Value
 
Each story above the maximum number of stories allowed -5
Complies with prevailing code                          0
Each story below the maximum number of stories         +5
(maximum value, +10)
 
      B.   Building Area.
         (1)   The allowable building area of a qualified historic building
shall be determined using the allowable area requirements for the class of
construction and use as specified in the prevailing code and the allowable area
requirements specified in the applicable occupancy chapter.
         (2)   If the qualified historic building has more stories than
permitted by the prevailing code, the maximum number of stories allowed for
that class of construction in the prevailing code shall be used to determine
the maximum allowable area requirements for the building.
         (3)   When the entire building is protected by an approved automatic
sprinkler system complying with the prevailing code, the allowable building
area may be increased as specified in the prevailing code.
         (4)   Where an assembly hall is located in a building with other uses,
the building shall comply with the class of construction requirements as
specified in the prevailing code.
         (5)   A single numerical value shall be determined from Table 3 of
this section and the numerical value and its sign, either positive or negative,
shall be entered on the evaluation form in Subsection 4 of this section under
the safety parameter, building area, for fire safety, means of egress and
general safety.
TABLE 3 – Building Area Numerical Value

160.02 STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
   1.   The Legislature of the State of Iowa has, in Chapter 414 of the Code of
Iowa, as amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to
secure safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
   2.   Findings of Fact.
      A.   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of
the community.
      B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by: (i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the flood plain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
   3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Paragraph 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
      A.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
      B.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
      C.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
      D.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   1.   Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter shall
apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City which are located within
the boundaries of the Flood Plain (Overlay) District as established in Section
160.05.
   2.   Rules for Interpretation of Flood Plain (Overlay) District. The
boundaries of the Flood Plain (Overlay) District areas shall be determined by
scaling distances on the official Flood Insurance Rate Map. When an
interpretation is needed as to the exact location of a boundary, the Zoning
Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The Zoning Board of
Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an
error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Zoning
Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   3.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no
structure shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without
full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
   4.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter
to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
   5.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
   6.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated Flood Plain (Overlay) District
areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not
create liability on the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for
any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   7.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.

160.05 ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOOD PLAIN (OVERLAY) DISTRICT.
   The areas within the jurisdiction of the City having special flood hazards
are hereby designated as a Flood Plain (Overlay) District and shall be subject
to the standards of the Flood Plain (Overlay) District (as well as those for
the underlying zoning district). The Flood Plain (Overlay) District boundaries
shall be as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Washington County
and Incorporated Areas, City of Washington, Panels 19183C0280B, 285B, 290B, and
295B, dated January 16, 2013.
160.06 STANDARDS FOR FLOOD PLAIN (OVERLAY) DISTRICT.
   All uses must be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and meet
the following applicable performance standards. Where base flood elevations and
floodway data have not been provided on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The
applicant will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources
with sufficient technical information to make such determination.
   1.   All Development. All development within the Flood Plain (Overlay)
District shall:
      A.   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
      B.   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
      C.   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
      D.   Obtain all other necessary permits from federal, state and local
governmental agencies including approval when required from the Iowa Department
of Natural Resources.
   2.   Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the base flood elevations. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
base flood elevations and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed subject to favorable
consideration by the Board of Adjustment, where existing topography, street
grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods
used must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various
forces and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential structures
located in areas that would become isolated due to flooding of surrounding
ground shall be provided with a means of access that will be passable by
wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this criterion shall not apply
where the Administrator determines there is sufficient flood warning time for
the protection of life and property. When estimating flood warning time,
consideration shall be given to the criteria listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa
Administrative Code.
   3.   Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be flood proofed to such a level. When
flood proofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State of
Iowa shall certify that the flood proofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and
other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the
base flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
   4.   All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
      A.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
         (1)   A minimum of two openings, with positioning on at least two
walls, having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
         (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
         (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
      Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access
and low damage potential storage.
      Where the distance between the floor and ceiling of the fully enclosed
area below the lowest floor is five feet or more, the applicant shall be
required to sign and record with the Washington County Record Non-Conversion
Agreement that ensures the lower enclosed area remains compliant with the
criteria outlined in this paragraph.
      New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or modified)

      A.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the structure
is a minimum of one foot above the 100-year flood level.
      B.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame
ties to ground anchors. Anchorage systems may include, but are not limited to,
use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors as required by the State
Building Code.
   6.   Utility and Sanitary Systems.
      A.   On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located or
designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
      B.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to

the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment facilities
(other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood protection
equal to or greater than one foot above the 100-year flood elevation.
      C.   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water
supply treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with
a level of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the 100-year
flood elevation.
      D.   Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
   7.   Storage of Materials and Equipment. Storage of equipment and materials
that are flammable, explosive or injurious to human, animal or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or:
(i) not subject to major flood damage and be anchored to prevent movement due
to flood waters; or (ii) readily removable from the area within the time
available after flood warning.
   8.   Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as
levees, flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the base
flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for
adequate interior drainage. In addition, structural flood control works shall
be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
   9.   Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must be
designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations must be
approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
   10.   Subdivisions. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and
subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the base flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50 lots
(whichever is less) shall include 100-year flood elevation data for those areas
located within the Flood Plain (Overlay) District.
   11.   Accessory Structures to Residential Uses.
      A.   Detached garages, sheds, and similar structures that are incidental
to a residential use are exempt from the base flood elevation requirements
where the following criteria are satisfied.
         (1)   The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential. Its size shall not exceed 600 square feet in size. Those portions of
the structure located less than one foot above the BFE must be constructed of
flood-resistant materials.
         (2)   The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage
potential purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure
shall not be used for human habitation.
         (3)   The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building
site so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.

heating equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above
the base flood elevation.
         (6)   The structure’s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of Subsection 4(A) of this section.
      Exemption from the 100-year flood elevation requirements for such a
structure may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of
the structure and its contents.
   12.   Recreational Vehicles.
      A.   Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of Subsection
5 of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built homes when
the following criteria are satisfied.
         (1)   The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less
than 180 consecutive days; and
         (2)   The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
      B.   Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than 180
consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements of
Subsection 5 of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built
homes.
   13.   Pipeline Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be
buried in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to
prevent rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
   14.   Maximum Damage Potential Uses. All new or substantially improved
maximum damage potential uses shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the elevation of the 500-year flood, or
together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a
level. When flood proofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in
the State of Iowa shall certify that the flood proofing methods used are
adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and
uplift forces and other factors associated with the base flood; and that the
structure, below the base flood elevation is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water. A record of the
certification indicating the specific elevation (in relation to North American
Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are flood proofed shall be
maintained by the Administrator. Where 0.2% chance flood elevation data has not
been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The applicant will be
responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient
technical information to make such determinations.
160.07 ESTABLISHMENT OF VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   1.   The Zoning Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in specific
cases such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary
hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.
      A.   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
      B.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      C.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance
coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
   2.   Factors upon Which the Decision of the Board of Adjustment Shall Be
Based. In passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
      A.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
      B.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
      C.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.

flood plain management program for the area.
      J.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      K.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood water expected at the site.
      L.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and bridges.
      M.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
chapter.
   3.   Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this
chapter. Such conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
      A.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
      B.   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
      C.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.

to achieving the purpose of this chapter.
      E.   Floodproofing measures.
160.08 NONCONFORMING USES.
   1.   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful
before the passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but
which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be
continued subject to the following conditions:
   A.   If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any future use
of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
   B.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
   2.   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless
it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
State or local health, sanitary, building or safety codes or regulations or the
cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
designation.

161.06 LANDSCAPING, PARKING AND ARCHITECTURAL REQUIREMENTS. 
   The requirements set forth in this section for landscaping, parking, and
architectural standards shall apply to any development or redevelopment as
contained in
161.11.
   1.   Landscaping Required. Any applicable development shall provide the
following minimum number and size of landscape plantings based on the minimum
required open space for the development. The following is the minimum
requirement of trees and shrubs, by number and size, and type of ground cover.
Street trees planted in public street right-of-way subject to approval by the
City shall not be counted toward fulfillment of the minimum site requirements
set forth below. Tree species to be used for landscaping shall be acceptable to
Chapter 151 of this Code of Ordinances. Existing trees and shrubs to be
retained on site may be counted toward fulfillment of the landscaping
requirements.
      A.   Minimum requirements at the time of planting – one tree per 50
linear feet of frontage. All trees shall be one and one-half to two-inch
caliper diameter. (Evergreen trees shall not be less than three feet in
height.)
      B.   Minimum requirements at the time of planting – six shrubs, or one
shrub per 2,500 square feet of open space, whichever is greater.
      C.   To reduce erosion all disturbed open space areas shall have ground
cover of grass or native vegetation which is installed as sod, or seeded,
fertilized and mulched.
      D.   Notwithstanding any of the above provisions, no parking space should
be farther than 60 feet from a tree. Tree islands must be six by eight by three
feet deep at minimum to provide enough space for tree and shrubs to grow.
   2.   Buffer Required. The following conditions shall require a buffer which
shall be a landscaped area, wall, or other structure intended to separate and
obstruct the view between two adjacent zoning districts, land uses or
properties:
      A.   Any other zoning district, other than an Agricultural A-1 District
that abuts any residential district shall require a buffer as described in this
section. The buffer shall be provided by the nonresidential use when adjoining
a residential district.
      B.   All Industrial districts that abut any other district shall provide
a buffer as required by this section.
      C.   Any storage area, garbage storage, junk storage or loading docks,
and loading areas, in any district shall be screened from public street view by
a buffer.
   3.   Buffers. Buffers required under the provisions of this section or
elsewhere in the Zoning Ordinance shall be accomplished by any one or approved
combination of the following methods:
      A.   Buffer Wall. A buffer wall or fence shall not be less than eight
feet in height and must be constructed of a permanent low maintenance material
such as concrete block, cinder block, brick, concrete, precast concrete, tile
block, chain link fence with slating or weather resistant wood approved by the
Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council.
      B.   Landscape Buffer. A landscape buffer shall not be less than 10 feet
in width, designed and landscaped with an earth berm and predominant plantings
of evergreen type trees, shrubs and plants starting at three feet in height and
have minimum six-foot mature height as to assure year around effectiveness;
height of berm a minimum of three feet with a 3:1 maximum slope and density and
height of plantings shall be adequate to serve as a solid and impenetrable
screen. A chain link fence may exist for security purposes, but is not
considered a part of the landscape screening to satisfy the intent of this
requirement.
   4.   Burden of Provision of Buffer. The burden of provision and selection of
the buffer shall be as follows:
      A.   Where two different zoning districts, requiring a buffer between
them, are already developed, the above requirement is not retroactive and a
buffer is not required. If a buffer is desired, it shall be provided by mutual
agreement between adjacent property owners. However, in the event of any or all
of the improved property is abandoned, destroyed, or demolished, for the
purpose of renewal or redevelopment, that portion of such property being
renewed or redeveloped, shall be considered vacant and subject to the
requirements herein.
      B.   Where one of two different zoning districts requiring a buffer
between them is partly developed, the developer of the vacant land shall assume
the burden, unless otherwise specified herein.
      C.   Where both zoning districts, requiring a buffer between them, are
vacant or undeveloped, the burden shall be assumed by the developer of the land
that is improved or developed, except for agricultural uses and unless
otherwise specified herein.
   5.   Waiver of Buffer Requirements. Where the line between two districts,
requiring a buffer, follows a street, right-of-way, railroad, stream, or other
similar barrier, the requirement for a buffer may be waived by the City Council
provided such waiver does not permit the exposure of undesirable
characteristics of land use to public view.
   6.   Surfacing Requirements. Driveway entrances must be of Portland cement
concrete for a minimum of 10 feet. Industrial zones are allowed to have
aggregate parking, loading areas, and access roadways. If outside parking,
outside storage, loading areas, and access roads are within 200 feet of any
other district except A-1, a durable and dustless surface paved with an
asphaltic or Portland cement concrete pavement must be used unless the Planning
and Zoning Commission recommends to the City Council the requirement be waived.
   7.   Off-Street Parking. Refer to Chapter
165.22 of this Code of Ordinances.
   8.   Parking Requirements for Accessible Parking for Persons with
Disabilities. Refer to Section
69.07 of this Code of Ordinances and Federal ADA guidelines.
   9.   Waiver of Requirements. The City Council reserves the right to waive or
modify to a lesser requirement any provisions or requirement of off-street
parking, outside storage, loading areas, and access roads contained in this
chapter, provided a report on such change is received from the Planning and
Zoning Commission or City Administrator, provided adequate area exists for
future expansion, and further provided said waiver or modification does not
adversely affect the intent of these regulations to adequately safeguard the
general public and surrounding property.
   10.   Architectural Standards. As part of the submittal of a site plan for
any development covered by this ordinance, architectural plans for buildings
shall be submitted for review and approval by the City Council after
recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission. Documentation to be
submitted shall include building elevations showing the building's design and a
description of structural and exterior materials to be used. The following
standards shall be considered by the City to review architectural plans:
      A.   Multiple-Family Dwellings in All Districts. The architecture of
multiple-family buildings shall be designed in a manner compatible with
adjoining residential uses in the neighborhood. Architectural design for
multiple-family buildings shall include exterior building materials, exterior
details and texture, treatment of windows and doors, and a variety in the wall
and roof design to lessen the plainness of appearance that can be
characteristic of large residential buildings. Adequate treatment or screening
of negative aspects of buildings (loading docks, loading areas, outside storage
areas, garbage dumpsters and HVAC mechanical units) from any public street and
adjoining properties shall be required. Buildings shall be designed or oriented
not to expose loading docks, or loading areas to the public.
      B.   Nonresidential Uses in the R Districts. Any building used for a
permitted nonresidential use in R Districts shall be designed and constructed
with architecture and use of materials compatible with the residential uses
within the neighborhood. Buildings located on a residential street in an R
District shall be residential in character. Adequate treatment or screening of
negative aspects of buildings (loading docks, loading areas, outside storage
areas, garbage dumpsters and HVAC mechanical units) from any public street and
adjoining properties shall be required. Buildings shall be designed or oriented
not to expose loading docks, or loading areas to the public. The architectural
design shall be approved by the City.
      C.   All Uses within the Central Business District. The Central Business
District is defined: E. Fifth Street south to E. Madison Street and N. Second
Avenue west to N. B Avenue. Architectural design and use of materials for the
construction of any building shall be approved by the City. Buildings within
the Central Business District shall have as a primary element of the building
exterior fascia glass (store front portion of the building), brick, concrete
panels (bulkheads below store front windows), textured concrete block,
architectural steel or stone panels, or cement fiber composite siding, with all
sides of any building built consistent in design and use of materials. No wood,
Masonite, visible asphaltic exterior wall or roof material, aluminum or steel
siding, non-architectural sheet metal, non-textured concrete block, stucco,
E.I.F.S. (Exterior Insulation and Finish System) or other similar materials
shall constitute a portion of any building except as a trim material, unless
the City Council after receiving a recommendation from the Planning and Zoning
Commission, shall determine said material when used as a primary element, does
not detract from the physical appearance of the building. Infill construction,
setbacks and store front design should follow National Main Street Center
Guidelines. It is recommended that the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards
for Rehabilitation be considered when remodeling a building in the Central
Business District. Adequate treatment or screening of negative aspects of
buildings (loading docks, loading areas, outside storage areas, garbage
dumpsters and HVAC mechanical units) from any public street and adjoining
properties shall be required. Buildings shall be designed not to expose loading
docks, nonresidential use overhead doors or loading areas to the public.
      D.   All Uses within Industrial Districts. Architectural design and use
of materials for construction of any building in the Industrial Districts shall
be reviewed as part of the site plan proposal and shall be approved by the
City. Loading areas, loading docks, storage areas, and garbage dumpsters shall
be located, screened or oriented to minimize their exposure to view from public
streets.
161.07   BUILDING PERMITS.  
   No building permit shall be issued for the construction of any structure
that is subject to the provisions of this chapter, until a site plan has been
submitted for review covering the land upon which said structure is to be
erected, and further, approved by City Council for such development in
accordance with this chapter. A partial building permit may be granted prior to
site plan approval at the recommendation of the City Engineer and the Zoning
Administrator.
161.08 FEES.  
   The City Council shall establish a schedule of fees, charges, and expenses
and a collection procedure for site plan approval and other matters pertaining
to this chapter. The schedule of fees shall be posted in the office of the City
Clerk, and may be altered or amended only by the City Council. Until all
applicable fees, charges, and expenses have been paid in full, no action shall
be taken on any application or appeal.
161.09 VALIDITY OF APPROVAL.
   A site plan shall become effective upon certification of approval by the
City Council.
   1.   The City Council approval of any site plan required by this chapter
shall remain valid for one year, after which time the site plan shall be deemed
null and void if the development has not been established or actual
construction commenced. A single one-year extension may be allowed with
approval of City Council upon recommendation of the Commission. For the purpose
of this chapter “actual construction” means that the permanent placement of
construction materials has started and is proceeding without undue delay.
Preparation of plans, securing financial arrangements, issuance of building
permits, letting of contracts, grading of property, or stockpiling of materials
on the site shall not constitute actual construction.
161.10 SITE PLAN AMENDMENT.  
   Any site plan may be amended in accordance with the standards and procedures
established herein, including payment of fees, provided that the Zoning
Administrator may waive such procedures for those minor changes hereinafter
listed. Such minor changes shall not be made unless the prior written approval

   19.   Lighting Illumination Requirements. The intent of these regulations is
to reduce the problems created by improperly designed and installed outdoor
lighting. It is intended to eliminate problems of glare, minimize light
trespass, and help reduce the energy and financial costs of outdoor lighting by
establishing regulations which limit the area that certain kinds of outdoor-
lighting fixtures can illuminate and by limiting the total allowable
illumination of lots located in the City of Washington. All business,
residential, and community driveway, sidewalk, and property luminaries should
be installed with the idea of being a “good neighbor,” with attempts to keep
unnecessary light from shining onto abutting properties and streets.
      A.   Exterior Lighting. All exterior lighting shall be installed and
operated in a manner so as to not unduly impact upon an adjoining property or
impair the safe operation of motor vehicles on public streets.
      B.   Glare. Glare from any operation and all lighting for the external
illumination of buildings or grounds shall be directed in a manner such that
direct or indirect illumination from the source of light shall not exceed two
foot-candles at property lines.

existing or contemplated street and lot layout make it impracticable to apply
the requirements of this chapter to the individual building units in such
project, the applying of such requirements to such project shall be done by the
Board of Adjustment in a manner that will ensure substantially the same
character of occupancy, maximum intensity of use, and minimum standard of open
spaces as permitted by this chapter in the district in which the proposed
project is to be located.
      B.   In no case shall the Board authorize a use or a building height
prohibited in the district in which the project is to be located, or a smaller
lot area per family than the minimum required under this chapter in such
district. Nor shall the Board authorize a building coverage exceeding that
which would be obtained were the same area to be developed by the customary
subdivision thereof into streets and lots in conformance with the Subdivision

minimum size requirements as specified in paragraph B of this section.
         (2)   The buildings are to be used only for residential purposes and
the customary accessory uses, such as private garages, storage spaces,
recreational and community activities.
         (3)   The average lot area per family or dwelling unit on the site,

percent of the lot area per family required in the district in which the
project is to be located.
         (4)   There is to be provided within the tract, or immediately
adjacent thereto, parking spaces in private garages or off-street parking areas
as specified in Section
165.22.
         (5)   There are to be provided, as a part of the project, adequate
recreation areas to serve the needs of the anticipated population to be housed
therein.
         (6)   Drives, access ways and parking areas are developed to a
standard equal to that required for public use.
         (7)   Such drives and access ways are protected by recorded deed
covenants assuring their availability to all residents of the project.
         (8)   The proposed project will constitute a residential environment
of a sustained desirability and stability; it will be in harmony with the
character of the surrounding neighborhood and ensure substantially the same
type of occupancy as obtained or may be expected to be obtained in said
neighborhood; it will result in intensity of land utilization no higher and
standards of open spaces at least as high as permitted or specified in this
chapter in the district in which the project is to be located.

   3.   Integrated Shopping Centers.
      A.   Shopping Centers Defined. For purposes of this section, shopping
centers are defined as follows:
         (1)   “Neighborhood shopping center” means a shopping center the
principal establishment of which is customarily a supermarket type food store.
         (2)   “Sub-community shopping center” means a shopping center the
principal establishment of which is customarily a variety store.
         (3)   “Community shopping center” means an area within which various
facilities and services, such as filling stations, restaurants, banks, fire or
police stations, clubs, etc., may be established.
      B.   Minimum Area. The owner of a tract of land located in any district
at or near where a proposed shopping center is shown on the adopted land use
plan shall submit to the Commission for its review a preliminary plan for the
use and development thereof for an integrated shopping center, provided that
said tract of land shall meet the following minimum area requirements:
         (1)   Neighborhood shopping center: not less than two acres.
         (2)   Sub-community or community shopping center: not less than 10
acres.
      C.   Applicant - Financial Ability. In accepting such plan for review,
the Commission shall be satisfied that the applicant is financially able to
carry out the proposed project, that construction will start within one year,
if a neighborhood shopping center, and two years, if a sub-community or
community shopping center, of the approval of the project and necessary zoning
district change, and will be completed within a reasonable time as determined
by the Commission.
      D.   Commission Findings. It then shall be the duty of the Commission to
investigate and ascertain whether the location, size and other characteristics
of the site, and the proposed plan comply with the following conditions.
         (1)   Need Must Be Demonstrated. Need for the proposed center at the
proposed location, to provide adequate shopping facilities to the surrounding
neighborhood, sub-community, or community or part thereof, as the case may be,
has been demonstrated by the applicant by means of market studies and such
other evidence as the Commission may require.
         (2)   Adequacy - Site. The proposed shopping center is adequate, but
not excessive, in size to provide adequate shopping or service facilities for
the population which reasonably may be expected to be served by the proposed
center.
         (3)   Traffic Congestion - Not to Be Created. The proposed shopping
center is at a location where traffic congestion does not exist at present on
the streets to be utilized for access to the proposed center, and where such
congestion will not likely be created by the proposed center; or where such
existing or possible future congestion will be obviated by presently projected
improvement of access thoroughfares or by demonstrable provisions in the plan
for proper entrances and exits, and by internal provisions for traffic and
parking.
         (4)   Thoroughfare Access Required. Any neighborhood shopping center
will abut and front a street designated on the official transportation plan as
an expressway or arterial thoroughfare; and any sub-community or community
shopping center shall abut and front on a street designated on said plan as an
expressway or arterial thoroughfare.
         (5)   Integrated Design. The plan provides for a shopping center
consisting of one or more groups of establishments in buildings of integrated
and harmonious design, together with adequate and properly arranged traffic and
parking facilities and landscaping. The project shall be arranged in an
attractive and efficient manner, convenient, pleasant and safe to use, and
fitting harmoniously into, and having no adverse effects upon, the adjoining or
surrounding properties.
      E.   Permitted Uses. The uses permitted in an integrated shopping center
shall be appropriate to the specific functions thereof. In the case of all
shopping centers, the allowable uses shall be those permitted in the B-
1 District; provided, however, no residential, heavy commercial or industrial
uses shall be permitted in any shopping center and only those uses shall be
authorized which are necessary or desirable to supply the surrounding
neighborhood, sub-community or community with goods or services. All uses
authorized in this manner shall be in harmony with the design of the center and
the environs thereof.
      F.   Standards Applicable. The following regulations shall apply to an
integrated shopping center.
         (1)   Building Height. No building shall exceed two and one-half
stories or 35 feet in height.
         (2)   Yards. No building shall be less than 50 feet distant from any
boundary of the tract or site on which the shopping center is located. The
center shall be permanently screened from all adjoining properties located in
any R District, and except for necessary entrances and exits, from all
properties located in any R District across the street and within 100 feet from
such center. The type and nature of such screening shall be determined by the
Commission.
         (3)   Tract Coverage. The ground area occupied by all the buildings
shall not exceed in the aggregate 25 percent of the total area of the tract or
site.
         (4)   Customer Parking Space. Notwithstanding any other requirements
of this chapter, there shall be provided at least two square feet of off-street
parking area, including driveways, for every square foot of total floor space,
not including storage space, in an integrated neighborhood shopping center; and
three square feet of off-street parking area for every square foot of total
space, not including storage space, in a sub-community or community shopping
center.
         (5)   Loading Space. Notwithstanding any other requirements of this
chapter, there shall be provided one off-street loading space for each 5,000
square feet or fraction thereof of aggregate floor space of all buildings in
the center. At least one-third of the space required shall be sufficient in
area and vertical clearance to accommodate trucks of the tractor-trailer type.
         (6)   Illumination of Accessways and Parking Areas. Accessways and
parking area shall be adequately lighted by shielding media lighting fixtures
which shall be so installed as to reflect light away from adjoining properties.
         (7)   Signs. Subject to the provisions of Section
165.21 and approval by the Commission, all signs within the center shall be
controlled by written agreement between the owners and tenants of the center,
or otherwise, with the view to preventing excessive advertising and promoting a
harmonious appearance to the center as a whole.
      G.   Final Development Plan. Upon determination by the Commission that
the proposed integrated shopping center as shown in the preliminary plan
appears to conform to the requirements herein and all other applicable
requirements of this chapter, the proponents shall prepare and submit a final
development plan, which plan shall incorporate any changes or modifications
required by the Commission, along with an application for change of zoning to
the appropriate business district classification.
      H.   Recommendations to Council. If the final development plan is found
to comply with the requirements herein and other applicable provisions of this
chapter, the Commission, after public hearing on both the development plan and
application for a zoning district change, shall submit said plan, its report
and recommendations to the Council.
      I.   Rezoning. The Council may modify the plan, consistent with the
intent and meaning of this chapter, and may rezone the property to a
classification permitting the proposed center, for development in substantial
conformity with the final plan, as approved by Commission.
      J.   Adjustments - Authorized by Commission. After the final development
plan has been approved by the Council and in the course of carrying out this
plan, adjustments or rearrangements of buildings, parking areas, loading areas,
entrances, height, or yards may be requested by the proponents, and provided
such requests conform to the standards established by the final development
plan and this chapter, such adjustments or rearrangements may be authorized by
the Commission.

“floor area” means the gross floor area used or intended to be used by tenants,
or for service to the public as customers, patrons or clients, but shall not
include areas used principally for nonpublic purposes, such as toilet or rest
rooms, utilities, or dressing rooms.
      D.   Hospital bassinets. In hospitals, bassinets shall not be counted as
beds.
      E.   Benches in place of public assembly. In stadiums, sports arenas,
churches and other places of public assembly in which patrons or spectators
occupy benches, pews, or other similar seating facilities, each 20 inches of
such seating facilities shall be counted as one seat for the purpose of
determining requirements for off-street parking facilities under this chapter.
   5.   Development Standards. Off-street accessory parking areas shall be of
usable shape, and shall be improved, in accordance with requirements of the
Council, with a durable and dustless surface and so graded and drained as to
dispose of all surface water accumulation within the area. Any lighting used to
illuminate such parking areas shall be so arranged as to reflect the light away
from adjoining premises in any R District.
   6.   Exceptions.
      A.   The Board of Adjustment may authorize on appeal a modification,
reduction or waiver of the foregoing requirements, if it should find that in
the particular case the peculiar nature of the use, or other exceptional
situation or condition would justify such modification, reduction or waiver.
      B.   The Commission, in consultation with other City departments and
agencies, shall make studies as found advisable of various areas in the City
for the purpose of determining the areas within which there is need for off-
street parking facilities to be provided by the municipality and to be financed
wholly, or in part, by a special assessment district or other means. Where such
need is found, the Commission shall report its recommendation for the
acquisition of such off-street parking facilities to the Council. Each report
shall include recommendations on the type, size, location and other pertinent
features of the proposed off-street parking facilities and the area they are
intended to serve.
165.23 SPECIAL PROVISIONS.

165.24 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS, EXCEPTIONS AND MODIFICATIONS.
   The requirements and regulations specified in this chapter are subject to
the additional requirements, exceptions, modifications and interpretations in
the following.
   1.   Height Limits. Height limitations stipulated elsewhere in this chapter
shall not apply to:
      A.   Barns, silos, or other farm buildings or structures on farms,
provided these are not less than 50 feet from every lot line; church spires,
belfries, cupolas and domes, monuments, water towers, fire and hose towers,
masts and aerials; and parapet walls extending not more than four feet above
the limiting height of the building. However, if, in the opinion of the
Building Inspector, such structures would adversely affect adjoining or
adjacent properties, such greater height shall not be authorized except by the
Board of Adjustment.
      B.   Places of public assembly such as churches, schools, and other
permitted public and semi-public buildings not to exceed six stories or 75
feet, provided that for each foot by which the height of such building exceeds
the maximum height otherwise permitted in the district, its side and rear yards
shall be increased in width or depth by an additional foot over the side and
rear yards required for the highest building otherwise permitted in the
district.
      C.   Bulkheads, conveyors, derricks, elevator penthouses, water tanks,
monitors and scenery lofts; to monuments, fire towers, hose towers, cooling
towers, grain elevators, gas holders or other structures, where the
manufacturing process requires a greater height. Where a permitted use requires
greater heights than specified, such may be authorized by the Board of
Adjustment.
      D.   Security fences in business and industrial districts.
   2.   Front Yard Exceptions and Modifications.
      A.   Front yard requirements do not apply to:
         (1)   Bay windows, awnings or balconies occupying in the aggregate not
more than one-third of the front wall; provided, that these projections come
entirely within planes drawn from either main corner of the front wall, making
an interior angle of 22.5 degrees in the horizontal plane with the front wall;
         (2)   Chimneys, flues, belt courses, leaders, sills, pilasters,
uncovered porches, plantings, or similar features not over three feet high
above the average finished grade and distant five feet from every lot line.
         (3)   Fences, provided that the same are at least 80 percent open
rather than of solid composition, are not in excess of four feet in height, and
do not otherwise obstruct the view of traffic in the case of corner lots.
         (4)   Decorative fences three feet or less in height.
         (5)   A fence not more than six feet in height, situated in a front
yard area along the side yard boundary line up to a point of 40 feet from the
center of a public right-of-way of 80 feet or less; in case of a right-of-way
larger than 80 feet, then the fence shall not project into the public right-of-
way. In case of a paved road surface wider than 31 feet, a fence over four feet
in height and not made of an 80 percent open material shall meet the minimum
front yard depth of the district in which it is located.
      B.   In all residential districts, there shall be a required minimum
front yard as stated in each individual residential zoning classification
district. However, in the case where lots within 200 feet on either side of a
lot of record are developed with a greater or lesser setback than required in
each individual zoning district, the front yard setback for this particular lot
shall be the average of the building setbacks for the lots of record within 200
feet on either side of said lot. The final determination of the setback shall
be computed by the Building and Zoning Administrator.
   3.   Side Yard Exceptions and Modifications.
      A.   Along any district boundary line, any abutting side yard on a lot in
the less restricted district shall have a least width equal to that required in
the more restrictive district. Where a lot in an I or B District abuts a lot in
an R District, the side yard shall be increased by three feet for each story
that the building proposed on such lot exceeds the height limit of the said R
District.
      B.   Side yards shall be increased in width by two inches for each foot
by which the length of the sidewall of the building, adjacent to the side yard,
exceeds 40 feet in any R-1 District, or 50 feet in any R-2 District.
      C.   Side yards may be reduced by three inches from the otherwise
required least width of each side yard for each foot by which a lot of record
at the time of enactment of this chapter is narrower than the lot width
specified for the district in which the lot is located, in the case of
buildings not higher than two and one-half stories, and in case the owner of
record does not own any adjoining property; provided, however—and irrespective
of the provisions of subparagraph F(1) of this subsection—that no side yard
shall be narrower at any point than three feet.
      D.   Side yards may be measured to the centerline of adjoining alleys.
But in no case shall a building or structure for which a side yard is required
be erected within six feet of such alley. However, fences may be located three
feet from an alley.
      E.   On a corner lot the least width of a side yard along the side street
lot line shall be equal to the required front yard along the side street. In
the case of a corner lot of record existing on May 21, 1973, the least width of
the yard abutting a side street may be reduced to 20 feet.
      F.   Structures or projections into side yards may be permitted as
follows: (i) walls not over five feet above the average natural grade; (ii)
fire escapes, three feet from side lot line; and (iii) bays and balconies not
more than three feet from the building, provided these projections are entirely
within planes drawn from either main corner of the side wall, making an
interior angle of 22.5 degrees in the horizontal plane with the side wall. The
sum of the lengths of such projection shall not exceed one-third of the length
of the wall of the main building.
         (1)   Chimneys, flues, belt courses, leaders, sills, pilasters and
lintels, ornamental features, cornices, eaves, gutters, and the like, into or
over a required side yard not more than one and one-half feet.
         (2)   Terraces, steps, uncovered porches, stoops, or similar features,
not higher than the elevation of the ground story of the building and distant
three feet from a side lot line.
   4.   Rear Yard Exceptions and Modifications.
      A.   Rear yards may be reduced by three inches from the required least
depth for each foot by which a lot (on January 15, 1973) is less than 100 feet
deep, in the case of a building not higher than two stories, and in case the
owner of record does not own adjoining property to the rear; provided, however,
that no required rear yard shall be less than 10 feet deep.
      B.   Rear yards may be measured to the centerline of adjoining alleys.
But in no case shall a building or structure be erected within six feet of such
an alley. However, fences may be located three feet from an alley.
      C.   Fences shall not be over six feet in height above the natural grade;
walls not over five feet above the natural grade; fire escapes, six feet; bays
and balconies, not more than three feet, provided these projections are
entirely within planes drawn from either main corner of the rear wall, making
an interior angle of 22.5 degrees in the horizontal plane with the rear wall.
The sum of the lengths of such projections shall not exceed one-half of the
width of the rear wall. Chimneys, flues, belt courses, leaders, pilasters,
lintels, ornamental features, cornices, eaves, gutters, and the like, into or
over a required rear yard not more than one and one-half feet.
   5.   Awnings and Canopies in Other Than Residential Districts. Awnings,
canopies and similar unenclosed coverings located in other than residential
districts shall not be subject to front yard requirements.
   6.   Exceptions to Building Permit Requirements. Except as specified in
paragraph A of this subsection, no building or structure regulated by this
chapter shall be erected, constructed, enlarged or altered unless a separate
permit for each such building or structure has first been obtained from the
Zoning Administrator.
      A.   Exempted Improvements. A building permit shall not be required for
any of the following activities:
         (1)   One-story detached accessory buildings used as tool and storage
sheds, playhouses or for similar purposes, provided the projected roof area
does not exceed 120 square feet.
         (2)   Fences not over three feet high.
         (3)   Platforms, walks and driveways not more than 30 inches above
grade.
         (4)   Window awnings supported by an exterior wall.
         (5)   Prefabricated swimming pools in which the walls are entirely
above grade and the capacity does not exceed 5,000 gallons.
      B.   Exemption Limitations. The aforementioned exemptions shall not be
construed as authorization for any work to be done in any manner in violation
of the provisions of these Zoning Regulations and of this Code of Ordinances.
Unless otherwise specified an exemption from building permit requirements is
not an exemption from plumbing permit requirements.
165.25 SPECIAL EVENTS.
   The City recognizes that in certain instances, some flexibility to allow
special events out of the confines of a building can be beneficial to business
interests, as well as the consumers and the City alike, provided such events
continue to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare. The
following special event applications may require a fee in an amount determined
by resolution of the City Council from time to time.
   1.   The City Clerk shall permit outdoor sales events for two events per
year for a maximum duration of seven days per event, subject to approval.
Outdoor sales events shall be defined as those sales events that incorporate
one or more 24-hour periods. Outdoor sales shall not create a burden on parking
and access facilities. Outdoor sales events shall maintain fire and emergency
access at all times.
   2.   Seasonal sales events shall be permitted for two events per year for a
maximum duration of 45 days per event subject to approval by the City Clerk,
excluding recurring events explicitly permitted by the City Council. Seasonal
sales events shall maintain fire and emergency access at all times. Seasonal
sales events shall be defined as those events that, due to the nature of the
product being sold or the time of year that such product is for sale, are best
accomplished out-of-doors.
   3.   Temporary site plans for events other than those mentioned above shall
be approved by the City Council. Such events shall require the appropriate
permits, including, but not limited to: noise, outdoor liquor license, and
temporary signs. Temporary site plans shall show that the event will not impact
the neighboring properties due to noise, congestion, lighting, or additional
factors. Temporary site plans shall be submitted on forms supplied by the City
Clerk.
165.26 ENFORCEMENT.
   1.   Duty to Enforce. It is the duty of the Zoning Administrator, with the
aid of other municipal departments, to enforce this chapter.
   2.   Zoning Certificates and Occupancy Permits.
      A.   Zoning Certificates. Except as hereinafter provided, no permit
pertaining to the use of land or buildings shall be issued by any officer,
department, or employee of the City unless the application for such permit has
been examined by the Zoning Administrator, indicating that the proposed
building or structure complies with all the provisions of this chapter. The
charge for a zoning certificate shall be the same as the building permit fee
which would be charged if a building permit were issued under Section
155.01 of this Code of Ordinances (a Building Permit under Section
155.01 is not required for one- and two-family dwellings). Where both a
building permit and a zoning certificate are required, there shall be no
additional charge for the zoning certificate. Any permit or certificate issued
in conflict with the provisions of this chapter shall be null and void. The
charge for a zoning certificate (building permit) shall be twice the amount
indicated herein if construction has begun prior to receipt of the application
by the Zoning Administrator. Each permit or approval issued shall expire after
365 days if no work is undertaken or such use or activity is not established,
unless an extension is granted by the Zoning Administrator prior to expiration.
      B.   Occupancy Permits. No building, or addition thereto, constructed
after the effective date of this chapter, and no addition to a previously
existing building shall be occupied, and no land, vacant on the effective date
of this chapter, shall be used for any purpose until an occupancy permit has
been issued by the Zoning Administrator. No change in a use, other than that of
a permitted use to another similar permitted use, shall be made until an
occupancy permit has been issued by the Zoning Administrator. Every occupancy
permit shall state that the use or occupancy complies with the provisions of
this chapter.
         (1)   Every application for a building permit shall be deemed to be an
application for an occupancy permit. Every application for an occupancy permit
for a new use of land where no building permit is required shall be made
directly to the Zoning Administrator.
         (2)   Every application for a permit shall be accompanied by plans in
duplicate and plot plan drawn to scale in ink or blueprint, showing the actual
shape and dimensions of the lot to be built upon, the exact location, size and
height of the building or structure to be erected or altered, the existing and
intended use of each building or part, the proposed number of families or
housekeeping units, and such other information with regard to the lot and
neighboring lots as may be necessary for the enforcement of this chapter. One
copy of such plans shall be signed and returned to the applicant when approved
by the Zoning Administrator together with such permit as may be granted.
         (3)   Prior to building construction, lot pins based on actual survey
shall be set and if disturbed by construction or grading shall be reset in
proper location. The requirement of a survey may be waived, however, where: (i)
the cost of the improvement is $3,000.00 or less; and (ii) the title holders of
record for each adjoining property have given written consent of the proposed
improvement without a survey; and (iii) based on the apparent location of the
boundary line, the improvement would not constitute an infraction of any zoning
requirement.
         (4)   No occupancy permit for a building, or portion thereof,
constructed after the effective date of this chapter, shall be issued until
construction has been completed and the premises inspected and certified by the
Zoning Administrator to be in conformity with the plans and specifications upon
which the zoning certificate was based. Pending the issuance of a regular
certificate, a temporary certificate may be issued to be valid for a period not
to exceed six months from its date during the completion of any addition or
during partial occupancy of the premises. Reasons in writing for refusal to
issue an occupancy permit must be forwarded to the applicant no later than 14
days after the request for an occupancy permit.
   3.   Penalties. Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or
refuses to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter shall, upon
conviction, be fined not more than $100.00 for each offense. Each day that a
violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.
   4.   Remedies. In case any building or structure is erected, constructed,
reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted or maintained, or any building,
structure or land is used in violation of the provisions of this chapter, the
City Attorney, in addition to other remedies under the Code of Iowa, is hereby
authorized to institute an action to enjoin, or any other appropriate action or
proceeding to prevent such erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration,
repair, conversion, maintenance or use.
   5.   Conditional Use. A conditional use permit shall be obtained for certain
uses which may be harmonious under special conditions and in specific locations
within a zone, but may not be allowed under the general conditions of the zone
as stated in this chapter. All conditional use permit applications shall be
submitted to the Board of Adjustment as per Section 29.04 of this Code of
Ordinances.
      A.   Application. All conditional use permit applications shall be
submitted to the Zoning Administrator. All applications shall be accompanied by
maps, drawings, statements or other documents as required by the Commission. A
non-refundable fee of $150.00 shall be collected at the time of submittal as
determined by the City.
      B.   Public Hearing. Prior to the approval, amending or denial of a
conditional use permit, a public hearing shall be held by the Commission. Upon
the completion of said public hearing, the Commission shall render a decision
within 10 working days.
      C.   Determination. The Commission or the Council on appeal shall have
the authority to impose conditions and safeguards as deemed necessary to
protect and enhance the health, safety and welfare of the surrounding area. The
authorization of conditional use permit shall not be made unless the evidence
presented is such to establish the following:
         (1)   Such use will not, under the specific circumstances of the
particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety or general welfare of the
surrounding area, and the proposed use is necessary or desirable and provides a
service or facility that contributes to the general well-being of the
surrounding area.
         (2)   Such use will comply with the regulations and conditions
specified in this chapter for such use.
      The Commission shall itemize, describe or justify, then have recorded and
filed in writing, the conditions imposed on the use.
      D.   Expiration and Revocation. Any granted conditional use permit shall
become null and void within one year of the date of approval, if not exercised.
A conditional use permit shall be considered exercised when the use has been
established or when a building permit has been issued and substantial
construction accomplished. If such permit is abandoned or discontinued for a
period of one year, it may not be reestablished unless authorized by the
Commission or Council on appeal. A conditional use permit may be revoked if the
applicant fails to comply with the imposed conditions.
      E.   Adjustments. An adjustment to an approved conditional use permit
shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator accompanied by supporting
information. The Commission shall review the adjustment and may grant, deny or
amend such adjustment and impose conditions deemed necessary.
165.27 DISTRICT CHANGES AND ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS.
   1.   Amendments. In accordance with the provisions of Chapter 414, Code of
Iowa, the Council may from time to time (following public hearing before the
Council, pursuant to statutory published notice) amend or change by ordinance
the number, shape, or area of districts established on the zoning map or the
regulations set forth in this chapter; but no such amendment or change shall
become effective unless the ordinance proposing such amendment or change shall
first be submitted to the Commission for approval, disapproval or suggestions,
and the Commission shall have been allowed a reasonable time, not less than 30
days, for consideration and report.
   2.   Hearing. Before submitting its recommendations and report to the
Council, the Commission shall hold a public hearing on the proposed amendment,
supplement or change. It shall give not less than four or more than 20 days’
notice of the time and place of such hearing by publication in a newspaper
published in the community and by mailing notices to all property owners
directly involved, contiguous to or directly across a street or alley from the
area proposed to be altered.
   3.   Application for Change. Any person desiring a change in zoning of
property may make application therefor, and in so doing shall accompany the
petition for such change with a fee in the amount of $150.00 toward the cost of
processing the application.
   4.   Notice. During the 20 days prior to the public hearing, the text or
copy of the text of such ordinance or petition, together with the maps or plans
or copies thereof shall be on file, for public examination, in the office of
the Commission and in the City Hall. No ordinance which differs from the
recommendation made by the Commission shall become effective unless passed by
not less than three-fourths of all members of the Council.
   5.   Written Protest. If a written protest against a proposed change in the
boundaries of a district signed and acknowledged by the owners of 20 percent or
more of the property within 200 feet of the property proposed to be altered is
filed with the Clerk at or before the public hearing, such amendment shall not
be passed or become effective except by the favorable vote of three-fourths of
all members of the Council.
   6.   Notifications. The failure to notify, as provided by this section,
shall not invalidate an ordinance, provided such failure was not intentional,
and the omission of the name of any owner or occupant of property who may, in
the opinion of the Commission, be affected by such amendment, supplement or
change, unless such omission is intentional, shall not invalidate any ordinance
passed hereunder, it being the intention of this section to provide so far as
may be for notice to the persons substantially interested in the proposed
change that an ordinance is pending before the Council, proposing to make a
change in zoning.
165.28 INTERPRETATION, PURPOSE AND CONFLICT.
   In interpreting and applying the provisions of this chapter, they shall be
held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public safety,
health, convenience, comfort, morals, prosperity and general welfare. It is not
intended by this chapter to interfere with or abrogate or annul any ordinance,
rules, regulations, or permits previously adopted or issued, and not in
conflict with any of the provisions of this chapter, or which shall be adopted
or issued pursuant to law relating to the use of buildings or premises and
likewise not in conflict with this chapter; nor is it intended by this chapter
to interfere with or abrogate or annul any easements, covenants or other
agreements between parties; provided, however, that where this chapter imposes
a greater restriction upon the use of buildings or premises or upon height of
buildings, or requires larger open spaces or larger lot areas than are imposed
or required by such ordinances, agreements, or covenants, the provisions of
this chapter shall control.
EDITOR’S NOTE
EDITOR’S NOTE
The following ordinances have been adopted amending the Official Zoning Map
described in Section
165.02 of this chapter and have not been included as a part of this Code of

166.02 AIRPORT ZONES AND AIRSPACE HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.
   In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there are hereby
created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying
beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces,
conical surfaces and expansion surfaces as they apply to the Washington
Municipal Airport. Such zones are shown on the Washington Municipal Airport
zoning map. An area located in more than one of the following zones is
considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation.
The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
   1.   Non-Precision Instrument Runway Approach Zone - (Approach 13/31). The
inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary
surfaces and is 75 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a
width of 16,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary
surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
   2.   Precision Instrument Runway Approach Zone - (Approach 18/36). The inner
edge of this approach coincides with the width of the primary surface and is
1,000 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of
16,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet from the primary surface.
Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
   3.   Transitional Zones - The transitional zones are the areas beneath the
transitional surfaces.
   4.   Horizontal Zone - The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs
of 10,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of 36/
18 and connecting all the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs.
The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.
   5.   Conical Zone - The conical zone is established as the area that
commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom
a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
   6.   Expansion Zone - This zone is established as an area for the general
expansion of the airport.
166.03 AIRPORT ZONE HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.
   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure shall be erected,
altered or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone created
by this chapter to a height in excess of the applicable height limit herein
established for such zone. Such applicable height limitations are hereby
established for each of the zones in question as follows:
   1.   Non-Precision Instrument Approach Zone - slopes 20 feet outward for
each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the
primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the
extended runway centerline.
   2.   Precision Instrument Runway Approach Zone - slopes 50 feet outward for
each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the
primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the
extended runway centerline; thence slopes upward 40 feet horizontally for each
foot vertically to an additional horizontal distance of 40,000 feet along the
extended runway centerline.
   3.   Transitional Zones - slopes seven feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
the approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport
elevation which is 753.5 feet above mean sea level. In addition to the
foregoing, there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for
each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the
approach surface, and extending to where they intersect the conical surface.
Where the precision instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical
zone, there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for each
foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach
surface, and extending a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured at 90-
degree angles to the extended runway centerline.
   4.   Horizontal Zone - established at 150 feet above the airport elevation
or at a height of 903.5 feet above mean sea level.
   5.   Conical Zone - slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at
the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the airport
elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation.
   6.   Expansion Zone - starts at 10 feet above the airport elevation
extending up to the adjoining zone.
166.04 PROHIBITIONS.
   1.   No structure shall exceed 150 feet above the established airport
elevation in the horizontal zone, as established by this chapter and as
depicted on the Washington Municipal Airport Height Airspace/Zoning Map.
   2.   No structure shall exceed or penetrate the conical surfaces, the
approach surfaces or the transitional surfaces as established by this chapter
and as depicted on the Washington Municipal Airport Airspace/Zoning Map.
   3.   No permanent structure shall be allowed in the expansion zone and no
trees or other vegetation will be allowed that will exceed or penetrate the
expansion zone surface as shown on the Municipal Airport/Zoning Map.
   4.   Generally, no structure shall be erected that raises the published
minimum descent altitude or the decision height for an instrument approach to
any runway, nor shall any structure be erected that causes the minimum
obstruction clearance altitude or minimum en route altitude to be increased on
any federal airway affecting the Washington Municipal Airport.
166.05 USE RESTRICTIONS.
   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no use may be made of
land or water within any zone established by this chapter in such a manner as
to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communications between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots
to distinguish between airport lights and others, results in glare in the eyes
of pilots using airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport,
create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with
the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
166.06 NONCONFORMING USES.  
   The regulations prescribed by this chapter shall not be construed to require
the removal, lowering or other changes or alteration of any structure or tree
not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of the ordinance
codified in this chapter, otherwise interfere with the continuance of
nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the
construction, alteration or intended use of any structure, the construction or
alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of such ordinance,
and is diligently prosecuted.
166.07 PERMITS.
   1.   Future Uses. Except as specifically provided in this subsection, no
material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected
or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone hereby
created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. Each
application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is
desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether
the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein
prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be
granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter
shall be granted unless a variance has been approved.
      A.   In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than
75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain,
land contour or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above
the height limits prescribed for such zones.
      B.   In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, no
permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of
vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would
extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zones.
      C.   In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond
the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree
or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except
when, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, such tree or
structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones.
      Nothing contained in any of the following exceptions shall be construed
as permitting or intending to permit any construction or alteration of any
structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits
established by this chapter.
   2.   Existing Uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a non-conforming use,
structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on
the effective date of this chapter or any amendments thereto or than it is when
the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, applications for
such a permit shall be granted.
   3.   Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed. Whenever it is determined
that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 60
percent torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be
granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height
limit or otherwise deviate from zoning regulations.
   4.   Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure, or permit the growth of any tree or use property not in accordance
with the regulations prescribed in this chapter may apply to the Board of
Adjustment for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance
shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation
Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation or air
navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such
variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or
enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship, and relief
granted will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard
to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with
the spirit of this chapter. Additionally, no application for variance to the
requirements of this chapter may be considered by the Board of Adjustment
unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the Washington Airport
Zoning Commission for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If
the Washington Airport Zoning Commission does not respond to the application
within 30 days after receipt, the Board of Adjustment may act on its own to
grant or deny said application.
   5.   Obstruction Marking and Lighting. Any permit or variance granted may,
if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter
and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the
owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate, and maintain,
at the owner’s expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary.
166.08 ENFORCEMENT.
   It shall be the duty of the Washington Airport Zoning Commission to
administer and enforce the regulations prescribed herein. Applications for
permits shall be made to the Washington City Zoning Administrator upon a form
published for that purpose. Applications for actions by the Board of Adjustment
shall be made to the Washington City Zoning Administrator.
166.09 APPEALS.
   1.   Any person aggrieved, or any taxpayer affected, by any decision of the
Washington Airport Zoning Commission made in the administration of this chapter
may appeal to the Board of Adjustment.
   2.   All appeals hereunder must be taken within a reasonable time as
provided by the rules of the Board of Adjustment, by filing with the Board of
Adjustment a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The Washington
Airport Zoning Commission shall forthwith transmit to the Board of Adjustment
all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was
taken.
   3.   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from unless the Washington Airport Zoning Commission certifies to the
Board of Adjustment, after the notice of appeal has been filed with it, that by
reason of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would in the opinion of
the Washington Airport Zoning Commission cause imminent peril to life to
property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by the order of
the Board of Adjustment on notice to the Washington Airport Zoning Commission
and on due cause shown.
   4.   The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for hearing
appeals, give public notice and due notice to the parties in interest, and
decided the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing, any party may
appear in person or by agent or by attorney.
   5.   The Board of Adjustment may, in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter, reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination appealed from and may make such order,
requirement, decision or determination as may be appropriate under the
circumstances.
166.10 JUDICIAL REVIEW.
   Any person aggrieved, or any taxpayer affected, by and decision of the Board
of Adjustment, may appeal as provided in Section 414.15 of the Code of Iowa.
166.11 PENALTIES.
   1.   The Council shall consider any circumstances brought to its attention,
which appears to demonstrate a noncompliance with any provision of this
chapter. A noncompliance with a provision of this chapter shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter. The Council may refer an alleged violation of this
chapter to the Washington City Attorney’s Office for prosecution only after the
person or persons responsible for the noncompliance have been given 20 days to
correct the violation. Notice advising said person of the violation shall be
certified by mail.
   2.   Each violation of this chapter or of any regulation, order or ruling
promulgated hereunder shall constitute a simple misdemeanor; and each day a
violation continues to exist shall constitute a separate offense.
166.12 CONFLICTING REGULATIONS.
   Where there exists a conflict between any of the regulations or limitations
prescribed in this chapter and any other regulations applicable to the same
area, whether the conflict be with respect to height of structures, the use of
land, or any other matter, the more stringent limitation or requirement shall
govern and prevail.

upon leaving office, all documents, records and other materials pertaining to
the office, including this Code of Ordinances.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 372.13[4])
NUMBERING OF ORDINANCES
AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
   It is recommended that a simple numerical sequence be used in assigning
ordinance numbers to ordinances as they are passed. For example, if the
ordinance adopting the Code of Ordinances is No. 163, we would suggest that the
first ordinance passed changing, adding to, or deleting from the Code be
assigned the number 164, the next ordinance be assigned the number 165, and so
on. We advise against using the Code of Ordinances numbering system for the
numbering of ordinances.
RETENTION OF AMENDING ORDINANCES
   Please note that two books should be maintained: (1) the Code of Ordinances;
and (2) an ordinance book. We will assist in the maintenance of the Code of
Ordinances book, per the Supplement Agreement, by revising and returning
appropriate pages for the Code of Ordinances book as required to accommodate
ordinances amending the Code. The City Clerk is responsible for maintaining the
ordinance book and must be sure that an original copy of each ordinance
adopted, bearing the signatures of the Mayor and Clerk, is inserted in the
ordinance book and preserved in a safe place.
SUPPLEMENT RECORD
   A record of all supplements prepared for the Code of Ordinances is provided
in the front of the Code. This record will indicate the number and date of the
ordinances adopting the original Code and of each subsequently adopted
ordinance which has been incorporated in the Code. For each supplemented
ordinance, the Supplement Record will list the ordinance number, date, topic,
and chapter or section number of the Code affected by the amending ordinance. A
periodic review of the Supplement Record and ordinances passed will assure that
all ordinances amending the Code have been incorporated therein.
DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPLEMENTS
   Supplements containing revised pages for insertion in each Code will be sent
to the Clerk. It is the responsibility of the Clerk to see that each person
having a Code of Ordinances receives each supplement so that each Code may be
properly updated to reflect action of the Council in amending the Code.
AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
   The Code of Ordinances contains most of the laws of the City as of the date
of its adoption and is continually subject to amendment to reflect changing
policies of the Council, mandates of the State, or decisions of the Courts.
Amendments to the Code of Ordinances can only be accomplished by the adoption
of an ordinance.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 380.2)
   The following forms of ordinances are recommended for making amendments to
the Code of Ordinances:
