8.03   PERIOD OF PARTIAL EXEMPTION.
The actual value added to industrial real estate by the new construction of

distribution centers is eligible to receive a partial exemption from taxation
for a period of five years. The exemption shall also apply to the acquisition
of or improvement to machinery and equipment assessed as real estate pursuant

Director of Revenue and shall contain information pertaining to the nature of
the improvement, its cost, and other information deemed necessary by the
Director of Revenue.
8.07   APPROVAL.
A person may submit a proposal to the City Council to receive prior approval
for eligibility for a tax exemption on new construction. If the City Council
resolves to consider such proposal, it shall publish notice and hold a public
hearing thereon. Thereafter, at least 30 days after such hearing, the City
Council, by ordinance, may give its prior approval of a tax exemption for new
construction if the new construction is in conformance with City zoning. Such
prior approval shall not entitle the owner to exemption from taxation until the
new construction has been completed and found to be qualified real estate.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 427B.4)
8.08   EXEMPTION REPEALED.
When in the opinion of the City Council continuation of the exemption granted

responsible person for all costs associated with the cleanup. If the bill for
those services is not paid within 30 days, the City Attorney shall proceed to

MINORS
 
46.01 Curfew                 46.03 Contributing to Delinquency
46.02 Cigarettes and Tobacco
 
46.01   CURFEW.
The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote the
public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and specifically
to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults responsible for
minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors committed after
the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences and criminal
activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.
   1.   Definitions. For use in this section, the following terms are defined:
      A.   “Emergency errand” means, but is not limited to, an errand relating
to a fire, a natural disaster, an automobile accident or any other situation
requiring immediate action to prevent serious illness, bodily injury, or loss
of life.
      B.   “Knowingly” means knowledge that a responsible adult should
reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that
responsible adult’s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful
or careless adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult
responsibility through an objective test. It is therefore no defense that an
adult responsible for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or
conduct or whereabouts of the minor.
      C.   “Minor” means any unemancipated person under the age of 18 years.
      D.   “Nonsecured custody” means custody in an unlocked multipurpose area,

or used as a secure detention area, and the person arrested is not physically
secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically
accompanied by a law enforcement officer or a person employed by the facility
where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to
providing nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate
juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the person’s
parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but
not for longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or
magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
      E.   “Public place” includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys, and sidewalks dedicated to public use and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises, whether publicly or privately owned,
that are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited
commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is
permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has
access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is
considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.
      F.   “Responsible adult” means a parent, guardian or other adult
specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have
custody or control of a minor.

any of the alleys, streets, or public places, or to be in places of business
and amusement, in the City between the hours of midnight and 5:00 a.m. of the
following day on days commencing on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday and between the hours of midnight and 5:00 a.m. on Friday and

   3.   Exceptions. The following are exceptions to the curfew:

following:

in which the minor is permitted by law to be engaged or, if traveling, within
one hour after the end or before the beginning of work;

meeting of an association for the advancement of economic, political, religious
or cultural matters, or for any other activity protected by the First Amendment
of the U.S. Constitution guarantees of free exercise of religion, freedom of
speech, freedom of assembly or, if traveling, within one hour after the end or
before the beginning of the activity.
      D.   The minor is on an emergency errand for a responsible adult;
      E.   The minor is engaged in interstate travel through the City
beginning, ending or passing through the City when such travel is by direct
route.
   4.   Responsibility of Adults. It is unlawful for any responsible adult
knowingly to permit or to allow a minor to be in any public place in the City
within the time periods prohibited by this section unless the minor’s presence
falls within one of the above exceptions.
   5.   Enforcement Procedures.
      A.   Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in
the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driver’s
license, a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance,
use his or her best judgment in determining age.
      B.   Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody. Grounds for arrest are
that the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the person’s
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any nonsecured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into
custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.
      C.   Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into
custody, the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the
minor as soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible
for the minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at
such time as the court may direct.
      D.   Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minor’s parent, guardian or other person
legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the
law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative
of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person
who is known to the child.
   6.   Penalties.
      A.   Responsible Adult’s First Violation. In the case of a first
violation by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall, by certified mail,
send to the adult responsible for the minor, written notice of the violation
with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of
the curfew ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with
applicable penalties.
      B.   Responsible Adult’s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as
defined in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows
the minor to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a
municipal infraction.
      C.   Minor’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a
minor, the law enforcement officer shall give the minor a written warning,
which states that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of
the curfew ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with
applicable penalties, or, at the law enforcement officer’s discretion, may
issue the minor a citation for a first violation.
      D.   Minor’s Second Violation. For the minor’s second and subsequent
violations of any of the provisions of this section, the minor is guilty of a
municipal infraction.

products, alternative nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes as part
of the person’s employment and said person is employed by a person who holds a
valid permit under Chapter 453A of the Code of Iowa or who lawfully offers for

  included in the Appendix of this Code of Ordinances. Caution is urged in the use
  of this administrative abatement procedure, particularly where cost of abatement
1 is more than minimal or where there is doubt as to whether or not a nuisance does
  in fact exist. If compliance is not secured following notice and hearings, we
  recommend you review the situation with your attorney before proceeding with
  abatement and assessment of costs. Your attorney may recommend proceedings in
  court under Chapter 657 of the Code of Iowa rather than this procedure.

the premises or in any parking lots or areas, including but not limited to
public rights-of-way, adjacent to the premises:

identities and addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders,
notice by one publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area
where the vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of
notice under Subsection 2 of this section. The published notice may contain

   5.   All service pipes must be laid at least five and one-half feet below
the surface of the ground. There shall be a curb stop in every service
connection to the main within the parking and near the sidewalk line and alley
within one foot of the alley line. The curb stop shall be of the style and

approved by the Superintendent.
   6.   The curb stop shall be covered by a two- and one-half-inch extension
stop box of the Minneapolis pattern extending upward so as to be flush with the
top of the ground. In placing the curb stop in position, care must be exercised
by the installer so as to prevent settlement of the same. There shall be a
brass ball valve installed inside the building prior to the water meter on
every service pipe.
90.09   TAPPING MAINS.
All taps into water mains shall be made by or under the direct supervision of
the Superintendent and in accordance with the following:
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 372.13[4])
   1.   Independent Services. No more than one house, building, or premises
shall be supplied from one tap unless special written permission is obtained
from the Superintendent and unless provision is made so that each house,
building, or premises may be shut off independently of the other.
   2.   Sizes and Location of Taps. All mains six inches or less in diameter
shall receive no larger than a three-fourths inch tap. All mains of over six

There shall be installed within the public right-of-way a main shut-off valve
on the water service pipe of a pattern approved by the Superintendent. The
shut-off valve shall be constructed to be visible and even with the pavement or

curb stop for each building or which otherwise do not conform to the
requirements in this chapter shall put in such curb stop or make such other
changes as necessary to conform to these requirements when so instructed by the

without interfering with service to the others.
90.13   INSPECTION AND APPROVAL.
All water service pipes and their connections to the water system must be
inspected and approved in writing by the Superintendent before they are
covered, and the Superintendent shall keep a record of such approvals. If the

proceed immediately to correct the work. Every person who uses or intends to
use the municipal water system shall permit the Superintendent to enter the
premises to inspect or make necessary alterations or repairs at all reasonable
hours and on proof of authority.
90.14   COMPLETION BY THE CITY.
Should any excavation be left open or only partly refilled for 24 hours after
the water service pipe is installed and connected with the water system, or
should the work be improperly done, the City shall have the right to finish or
correct the work, and the Council shall assess the costs to the property owner
or the plumber. If the plumber is assessed, the plumber must pay the costs
before receiving another permit. If the property owner is assessed, such
assessment may be collected with and in the same manner as general property
taxes.

All costs and expenses incident to the installation, connection, and
maintenance of the water service pipe from the main to the building served
shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the City from any loss
or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation or
maintenance of said water service pipe.
90.16   FAILURE TO MAINTAIN.
When any portion of the water service pipe that is the responsibility of the
property owner becomes defective or creates a nuisance, and the owner fails to
correct such nuisance, the City may do so and assess the costs thereof to the

drinking private water wells, other than monitoring wells used in connection
with soil and groundwater contamination, within the City limits of the City of
Sheldon.
   2.   Private Wells Prohibited. No person shall construct a private well
within the City limits after the effective date of the ordinance codified by
this section, and no private well shall be allowed in any contaminated area, as
determined by the City or the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. This
prohibition shall not apply to closed loop geothermal wells.
   3.   Registration of Pre-Existing Wells. Any person who owns property in the
City which has a water well as of the effective date of the ordinance codified
by this section, other than a monitoring well, shall register said well with
the City. There shall be no fee for the registration of a pre-existing well.
Registration shall include, but not be limited to, exact location, well
history, separation from public water supply, and vulnerability to
contaminants. Any pre-existing well located in a contaminated area shall be
plugged and sealed in accordance with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources
regulations at the owner’s cost. In addition, closed loop geothermal wells must
be registered with the City upon commencement of construction, the same as pre-
existing wells.

National Guard Armory, located at 920 Western Avenue, is prohibited.
90.21   REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW WELLS.
No wells may be constructed or drilled within the City limits without a permit.
Permits applications shall be obtained from and presented to the
Superintendent. The Superintendent shall present all applications to the
Council for consideration and grant or denial. The Superintendent shall make
recommendations to the Council regarding the grant or denial of any
application, but the final decision shall rest with the Council. In considering
the grant or denial of any application for construction or drilling of a well
within City limits, the Council shall consider whether the property is
furnished with pure and wholesome water, whether it is safe to construct or
drill a well on the premises, and other considerations which the Council deems
appropriate. If any person fails to comply with this section for more than 10
days after receiving written notice of the violation, the City may impose a
penalty and cause well abandonment to be performed and the expense to be
assessed as a special tax against the property. In addition, the Superintendent
may at any time revoke the permit for any violation of this Code of Ordinances
and may require that the work be stopped.

Any connection with a public sanitary sewer must be made under the direct
supervision of the Superintendent and in accordance with the following:
   1.   Old Building Sewers. Old building sewers may be used in connection with
new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test conducted by
the owner and observed by the Superintendent, to meet all requirements of this
chapter.
   2.   Separate Building Sewers. A separate and independent building sewer
shall be provided for every occupied building; except where one building stands
at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or
can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court,
yard, or driveway. In such cases the building sewer from the front building may
be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building
sewer.
   3.   Installation. The installation and connection of the building sewer to
the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the State Plumbing Code
and applicable rules and regulations of the City. All such connections shall be
made gastight and watertight. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and
materials must be approved by the Superintendent before installation.
   4.   Water Lines. When possible, building sewers should be laid at least 10
feet horizontally from a water service. The horizontal separation may be less,
provided the water service line is located at one side and at least 12 inches
above the top of the building sewer.
   5.   Size. Building sewers shall be sized for the peak expected sewage flow
from the building with a minimum building sewer size of four inches.
   6.   Alignment and Grade. All building sewers shall be laid to a straight
line to meet the following:

building at an elevation below the basement floor. The depth of cover above the
sewer shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost.
   8.   Sewage Lifts. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low
to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such
drain shall be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the
building sewer.
   9.   Pipe Specifications. Building sewer pipe shall be free from flaws,
splits, or breaks. Materials shall be as specified in the State Plumbing Code
except that the building sewer pipe, from the property line to the public
sewer, shall comply with the current edition of one of the following:
      A.   Clay sewer pipe – A.S.T.M. C-700 (extra strength).

Superintendent. Solvent-welded joints are not permitted.
   12.   Unstable Soil. No sewer connection shall be laid so that it is exposed
when crossing any watercourse. Where an old watercourse must of necessity be
crossed or where there is any danger of undermining or settlement, cast iron
soil pipe or vitrified clay sewer pipe thoroughly encased in concrete shall be
required for such crossings. Such encasement shall extend at least six inches
on all sides of the pipe. The cast iron pipe or encased clay pipe shall rest on
firm, solid material at either end.
   13.   Preparation of Basement or Crawl Space. No connection for any
residence, business or other structure with any sanitary sewer shall be made
unless the basement floor is poured, or in the case of a building with a slab
or crawl space, unless the ground floor is installed with the area adjacent to
the foundation of such building cleared of debris and backfilled. The backfill
shall be well compacted and graded so that the drainage is away from the
foundation. Prior to the time the basement floor is poured, or the first floor
is installed in buildings without basements, the sewer shall be plugged and the
plug shall be sealed by the Superintendent. Any accumulation of water in any
excavation or basement during construction and prior to connection to the
sanitary sewer shall be removed by means other than draining into the sanitary
sewer.
96.06   INTERCEPTORS REQUIRED.
Grease, oil, sludge, and sand interceptors shall be provided by gas and service
stations, convenience stores, car washes, garages, and other facilities when,
in the opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper
handling of such wastes that contain grease in excessive amounts or any
flammable waste, sand, or other harmful ingredients. Such interceptors shall
not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. When required,
such interceptors shall be installed in accordance with the following:
   1.   Design and Location. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity
as specified in the State Plumbing Code, to be approved by the Superintendent,

impervious material capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in
temperature. They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped
with easily removable covers that shall be gastight and watertight.
   3.   Maintenance. All such interceptors shall be maintained by the owner at
the owner’s expense and shall be kept in continuously efficient operations at
all times.
96.07   SEWER TAP.
Connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the “Y”
branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If no properly
located “Y” branch is available, a saddle “Y” shall be installed at the
location specified by the Superintendent. The public sewer shall be tapped with
a tapping machine and a saddle appropriate to the type of public sewer shall be
glued or attached with a gasket and stainless steel clamps to the sewer. At no
time shall a building sewer be constructed so as to enter a manhole unless
special written permission is received from the Superintendent and in
accordance with the Superintendent’s direction if such connection is approved.
96.08   INSPECTION REQUIRED.
All connections with the sanitary sewer system before being covered shall be
inspected and approved, in writing, by the Superintendent. As soon as all pipe
work from the public sewer to inside the building has been completed, and
before any backfilling is done, the Superintendent shall be notified and the
Superintendent shall inspect and test the work as to workmanship and material;
no sewer pipe laid underground shall be covered or trenches filled until after
the sewer has been so inspected and approved. If the Superintendent refuses to
approve the work, the plumber or owner must proceed immediately to correct the
work.

All costs and expenses incident to the installation, connection, and
maintenance of the building sewer from the main to the building served shall be
borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the City from any loss or damage
that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the
building sewer.
96.10   ABATEMENT OF VIOLATIONS.
Construction or maintenance of building sewer lines, whether located upon the
private property of any owner or in the public right-of-way, which construction
or maintenance is in violation of any of the requirements of this chapter,
shall be corrected, at the owner’s expense, within 30 days after date of
official notice from the Council of such violation. If not made within such
time, the Council shall, in addition to the other penalties herein provided,
have the right to finish and correct the work and assess the cost thereof to
the property owner. Such assessment shall be collected with and in the same

accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from
periodic grab samples.)

factors prescribed by federal law, including (i) whether the Company has
substantially complied with the material terms of the Franchise and with
applicable laws; (ii) the extent and quality of the Company’s video programming
service; (iii) whether the Company remains financially, legally, and
technically qualified to provide video service; and (iv) whether renewal of the
Franchise promotes the video-related community needs and interests.

  † EDITOR’S NOTE: Ordinance No. O17-3224, adopting a cable television franchise for
6 the City, was passed and adopted on January 4, 2017.
   
112.04   FRANCHISE FEE.
For the term of the Franchise, the Company shall pay to the City an annual
franchise fee equal to five percent of the Company’s annual gross revenues
derived from the operation of the System to provide multichannel video
programming services to subscribers within the corporate boundaries of the
City. For purposes of calculating the franchise fee, the Company’s gross
revenues shall be calculated as defined in Section 477A.1(9)(a) of the Code of
Iowa, as the same may be amended from time to time. The franchise fee shall be
payable quarterly at the Clerk’s office, or as otherwise agreed by the City and
the Company. Any franchise fees collected and paid under this section may be
credited to the City’s general fund and used for the City’s lawful general fund
purposes. The Company may identify the franchise fee collected and paid under
this section as a separate line item on the regular bill of each subscriber.
Upon reasonable request by the City, the Company shall provide the City with
its business records supporting its calculation of the franchise fee for any
identified period; provided that the Company shall not be required to maintain
such business records in excess of 24 months.
112.05   NONEXCLUSIVE FRANCHISE.
The Franchise is nonexclusive and shall in no way prevent the City from
granting or renewing any other cable television or video service franchise. If
the City grants or renews an additional cable television or video service
franchise, the material terms and conditions of the additional franchise shall
not provide a competitive preference or advantage to the franchisee under that
franchise.
112.06   CONSTRUCTION AND INSTALLATION.
The Company shall construct, install, maintain, operate, repair, replace, and
remove the System in a manner consistent with accepted technical and
engineering standards and in accordance with all applicable safety rules and
regulations. All facilities and equipment comprising the System and located in
the public rights-of-way shall be located so as to cause minimum interference
with the proper use of the public rights-of-way and to cause minimum
interference with the rights or reasonable convenience of property owners who
adjoin any public right-of-way. In case of any facilities or equipment causing
interference with the public right-of-way, the Company shall, at its own cost
and expense and in a commercially reasonable manner, modify, remove, or
relocate such facilities or equipment. In the event that at any time during the
term of the Franchise the City lawfully elects to alter or change any street,
alley, or other public right-of-way, the Company shall, if necessary and upon
reasonable notice from the City, modify, remove, or relocate any facilities or
equipment at its own cost and expense and in a commercially reasonable manner.
The Company shall have the authority, at its own cost and expense and in a
commercially reasonable manner, to trim trees upon and overhanging the public
rights-of-way so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in
contact with the facilities and equipment of the Company. In case of any
disturbance or damage to a public right-of-way, the Company shall, at its own
cost and expense and in a commercially reasonable manner approved by the City,
replace and restore such right-of-way to as good a condition as before the
Company’s activities were commenced. In the event that the Company does not
timely comply with its obligations under this section, the City may perform the
work and recover its actual, verified cost from the Company. At the request of
the City, the Company shall provide to the City Engineer or applicable City
department accurate maps of the System, including the location of all
facilities and equipment in the public rights-of-way.
In those areas of the service area where all of the transmission or
distribution facilities of the respective utilities providing telephone
communications and electric services are underground, the Company shall
likewise construct, operate, and maintain all of its transmission and
distribution facilities underground, provided that such facilities are actually
capable of receiving the System’s signal quality. In those areas where
utilities are both aerial and underground, the Company shall have the
discretion of placing its cable as aerial or underground. If at such time other
utilities transfer aerial systems to underground placement, the Company shall
make provisions to do likewise. At no time, unless with the City’s consent or
under emergency circumstances, will the Company allow its facilities to lay on
ground for more than its initial construction period.
112.07   SERVICE EXTENSIONS.
The Company shall provide service to residents on a nondiscriminatory basis,
and shall not deny access to video service to any resident or neighborhood on
the basis of income. The Company shall serve all residents of the City, except
to the extent that population density, adverse terrain, or other factors render
providing service commercially impracticable or technically infeasible. In the
event the requirements of this section are not met, extensions of service shall
be required only on a basis which is commercially reasonable. Nothing in the
preceding shall prohibit the Company from offering video service in any area
not meeting the preceding density requirements on terms acceptable to the
Company.
112.08   OWNERSHIP AND REMOVAL.
The System shall be and remain the exclusive property of the Company at all
times and for all purposes. Any costs, expenses, taxes, or other assessments
arising from, or related to, the construction, installation, maintenance,
operation, repair, replacement, and removal of the System shall be the sole
responsibility of the Company. Upon expiration or termination of the Franchise
in accordance with this chapter, the Company shall, at its own cost and expense
and within a commercially reasonable time under the circumstances, remove all
facilities and equipment comprising the System and restore the public rights-
of-way to as good a condition as before the Company’s activities were
commenced.
112.09   LEGAL COMPLIANCE.
The rights and obligations of the Company under the Franchise are subject at
all times to compliance with Iowa and federal law and all applicable
requirements, specifications, rules, and orders of the Federal Communications
Commission (the “FCC”). Any condition or provision of this chapter that is
inconsistent with Iowa or federal law or applicable FCC regulations shall be
deemed preempted and superseded.
112.10   SCOPE OF REGULATION.
Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted or construed to impose any
requirement that has the purpose or effect of prohibiting, limiting,
restricting, or conditioning the provision of telecommunications services or
other communications or information services by the Company or any of its
affiliates.
112.11   POLICE POWER.
The Company shall at all times during the term of the Franchise be subject to
all lawful exercise of the City’s police power. The City reserves the right to
adopt from time to time such ordinances as may be necessary to exercise the
City’s police power as it may relate to the Franchise. In the case of emergency
or disaster, the Company shall, upon request by the City, make available its
facilities for the City to provide emergency information and instructions. An
emergency override shall be instituted via telephone access overriding all
channels in the System. The Company shall provide explicit instructions in
writing to the Mayor, City Manager, and Chief of Police for such an event. The
City agrees that such an emergency override system shall not be used as a
general paging or messaging service. The City shall hold the Company harmless
from any claims arising from the use or dissemination or content of the
information or instructions including, but not limited to, reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs.
112.12   FORCE MAJEURE.
The Company shall not be liable for any delay or failure in performance of any
part of its obligations under this chapter from any cause beyond its control
and without its fault or negligence, including acts of God, acts of civil or
military authority, government regulations, adverse judicial proceedings,
embargoes, epidemics, war, terrorist acts, riots, insurrections, fires,
explosions, earthquakes, nuclear accidents, floods, strikes, power blackouts,
major environmental disturbances, unusually severe weather conditions,
inability to secure products or services of other person or transportation
facilities, or acts or omissions of transportation common carriers.
112.13   ASSIGNMENT OR TRANSFER.
The Company shall not assign or transfer any right granted under this chapter
to any other individual or entity without the prior written consent of the
City, provided that such prior written consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed if the proposed assignee or transferee agrees in writing to
assume the Company’s obligations as franchisee, including compliance with the
terms and conditions of this chapter. Notwithstanding the preceding or anything
in this chapter to the contrary, no restrictions or special rights with respect
to assignment or transfer of the Franchise or the System shall apply to
transfers from the Company to any affiliate directly or indirectly controlling,
controlled by, or under common control with the Company.† 7

112.14   REPORTING REQUIREMENTS; ACCESS TO RECORDS.
Upon reasonable request by the City, the Company shall provide the City annual
reports or equivalent reports or information as identified in Section 114.03 of
this Code of Ordinances, if and to the extent that such reports are applicable
to the Company’s operation of the System within the City. Upon reasonable
request by the City, the City may review the Company’s books and records
pertaining to the Franchise, during normal business hours and on a non-
disruptive basis, as are reasonably necessary to monitor the Company’s
compliance with the terms of this Franchise.
112.15   CONFIDENTIALITY.
The City shall keep confidential all information and data pertaining to the
Company or its business and customers of a confidential or proprietary nature,
and shall not disclose any such information to any other person, firm, or
entity (except to a governmental or regulatory body in response to a subpoena)
and shall use such information only for purposes within the scope of the City’s
authority under this chapter. The City agrees that any confidential and
proprietary information received pursuant to this chapter shall be disclosed
only to those employees and other persons who have a proper need for its use.
Upon expiration or termination of the Franchise, the City shall, at the
direction of the Company, return or destroy all confidential or proprietary
information provided by the Company along with any and all copies of such
information. The obligations of the City under this section shall survive the
expiration or termination of the Franchise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company acknowledges that the obligations of the City under this section are
subject to compliance with applicable open meeting or public records laws of
the State of Iowa. The City shall not be liable for any disclosure required to
be made in compliance with applicable open meeting or public records laws,
provided such disclosure is made in good faith and in consultation with, and
reliance upon, the advice of the City’s legal counsel, and provided that prior
written notice of the required disclosure is provided to the Company and its
legal counsel.
112.16   THIRD PARTY LIABILITY.
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to create civil liability by one party
for actions, omissions, or negligence of the other party, or of the other
party’s agents, employees, officers, or assigns. This chapter shall not be
interpreted or construed to provide any third parties (including, but not
limited to the Company’s customer) with any remedy, claim, liability,
reimbursement, cause of action, or any other right as against the Company or
the City. Each of the Company and the City shall bear responsibility for its
own actions, omissions, and negligence. Without limiting the preceding, the
Company shall hold the City harmless from any claim, liability, or damage
arising from, or caused by, the Company’s activities under the Franchise.
112.17   SERVICE TO PUBLIC BUILDINGS.
The Company shall provide without charge, three outlets of full service
(excluding premium channels) to the City’s office buildings, fire stations,
police stations, public library, Crossroads Pavilion, and all public and
private school buildings, at their request. The outlets of cable service shall
not be used to sell services in or throughout such buildings and shall be for
the viewing and use of its employees and not for general public audiences.
Users of such service shall hold the Company harmless from any and all
liability or claims arising out of their use of such outlets, including but not
limited to, those arising from copyright liability.
112.18   PUBLIC, EDUCATIONAL, AND GOVERNMENT ACCESS.
During the term of the franchise, the Company will ensure that the system has
the capacity to afford the City a channel to be used for public, educational,
and government access. During those times that the channel is not being used by
the City, the Company may use said channel for commercial or non-commercial
programming use as the Company deems necessary. During the term of the
Franchise, the Company shall carry the Iowa Public Television channel.
112.19   RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL.
If at any time during the term of this Franchise, or upon any expiration or
termination hereof, the Company elects to abandon multichannel video
programming services and terminate use of the System, and is not using the
facilities or any upgraded facilities to provide other communications services
to customers, the City, at its election and upon the tender of payment as
herein provided to the Company, shall have the right to purchase and take over
System in its entirety. Upon the exercise of this option by the City and its
service of an official notice of such action upon the Company together with the
payment of the purchase price as provided herein, the Company shall immediately
transfer to the City possession and title to all facilities and property, real
and personal, of the CATV business, free from any and all liens and
encumbrances which the City does not agree to assume in lieu of some portion of
the purchase price as determined herein; and the Company shall execute such
warranty deed or other instruments of conveyance to the City as shall be
necessary for this purpose. The purchase price to be paid by the City to the
Company upon the exercise of the option as herein provided shall be determined
as the fair market value of the business and underlying System as an ongoing
business and operation of the Company, as determined by three appraisers
chosen, one by the City, one by the Company, and the remaining appraiser to be
chosen by the two as designated by the City and the Company. Such appraisers
shall be chosen from experts within the cable television industry and shall
possess the expertise and qualifications necessary to make these determinations
and evaluations in order to be qualified as an appraiser. The fair market value
of the system shall not include, and the City shall not be entitled to receive
anything for, the evaluation of any right or privilege appertaining to it under
this Franchise. For the avoidance of doubt, the City’s right of first refusal
under this section shall not be triggered by any assignment or transfer of this
Franchise in accordance with Section 112.13, provided that the assignee or
transferee will continue to use the System to provide multichannel video
programming services or other communications services to customers following
the assignment or transfer.

CABLE TELEVISION RATES
 
113.01 Initial Review of Basic Cable Rates 113.04 Notice of Rate Change in Non-
                                           regulated Tiers and Services
113.02 Decision                            113.05 Cable Operator Information
113.03 Review of Request for Increase in
Basic Cable Rates
 
113.01   INITIAL REVIEW OF BASIC CABLE RATES.
   1.   Notice. Upon certification of the City by the FCC, the City shall
immediately notify any Cable Operator that may obtain a cable television
franchise, by certified mail, return receipt requested, that the City intends
to regulate subscriber rates charged for the basic service tier and associated
equipment as authorized by the Cable Act of 1992.
   2.   Cable Operator Response. Within 30 days of receiving notice from the
City, a Cable Operator shall file with the City its current rates for the basic
service tier and associated equipment and any supporting material concerning
the reasonableness of its rates.
   3.   Rate Regulation Proceedings and Public Hearing. Any rate regulation
proceedings conducted under this chapter shall provide a reasonable opportunity
for consideration of the views of any interested party, including but not
limited to the City or its designee, the Cable Operator, subscribers, and
residents of the franchise area. In addition to all other provisions required
by the laws of the State and the City for such proceedings, and in order to
provide for such opportunity for consideration of the views of any interested
party, the City shall take the following actions:
      A.   The City shall publish in a local newspaper, post in a public
building, and mail, by certified mail, to the Cable Operator a public notice of
the intent to conduct a public proceeding on basic service tier rates or
charges for equipment to receive such basic service tier, as defined by the
FCC.
      B.   The public notice shall state, among other things, that cable
television rates are subject to municipal review and explain the nature of the
rate review in question; that any interested party has a right to participate
in the proceeding; that public views may be submitted in the proceedings,
explaining how they are to be submitted and the deadline for submitting any
such views; that a decision concerning the reasonableness of the cable
television rates in question will be governed by the rules and regulations of
the FCC and that the decision of the City is subject to review by the FCC.
      C.   The City shall conduct a public proceeding to determine whether or
not the rates or proposed rate increase are reasonable. The Council may
delegate the responsibility to conduct the proceedings to any duly qualified
and eligible person. If the Council or its designee cannot determine the
reasonableness of a proposed rate increase within the time period permitted by
the FCC rules and regulations, it may postpone the effective date of the
proposed rates for an additional period of time as permitted by the FCC rules
and regulations and issue any other necessary or appropriate order and give
public notice accordingly.
113.02   DECISION.
   1.   By Formal Resolution. After completion of its review of the Cable
Operator’s proposed rates, the Council shall adopt its decision by formal
resolution. The decision shall include one of the following:
      A.   If the proposal is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard or is
justified by a cost-of-service analysis, the Council shall approve the initial
base cable rates proposed by the Cable Operator; or
      B.   If the proposal is not within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard and
the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates, the
Council shall establish initial basic cable rates that are within the FCC’s
reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service analysis.
   2.   Rollbacks and Refunds. If the Council determines that the initial basic
cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or that the Cable
Operator’s cost-of-service justifies lower rates, the Council may order the
rates reduced in accordance with the benchmark analysis or cost-of-service
showing, as applicable. In addition, the Council may order the Cable Operator
to pay to subscribers refunds of the excessive portion of the rates with
interest (computed at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue
Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments), retroactive to September
1, 1993. The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in
accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the Council’s decision
resolution.
   3.   Statement of Reasons for Decision and Public Notice. If rates proposed
by a Cable Operator are disapproved in whole or in part, or if there were
objections made by other parties to the proposed rates, the resolution must
state the reasons for the decision and the Council must give public notice of
its decision.
   4.   Appeal. The Council’s decision concerning rates for the basic service
tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with
applicable federal regulations.
113.03   REVIEW OF REQUEST FOR INCREASE IN BASIC CABLE RATES.
A Cable Operator in the City who wishes to increase the rates for the basic
service tier or associated equipment shall file a request with the City and
notify all subscribers at least 30 days before the Cable Operator desires the
increase to take effect. This notice may not be given more often than annually
and not until at least one year after the determination of the initial basic
cable rates. The Council shall administer and enforce all proceedings as
permitted under the Rules and Regulations of the FCC concerning cable rate
regulations as they currently read and hereafter may be amended, which are
herewith incorporated by reference.
113.04   NOTICE OF RATE CHANGE IN NON-REGULATED TIERS AND SERVICES.
With regard to the cable programming service tier, as defined by the
Communications Act of 1984, as amended, and the FCC rules and regulations, and
over which the City is not empowered to exercise rate regulation, the Cable
Operator shall give notice to the City of any change in rates for the cable
programming service tier or tiers, any change in the charge for equipment
required to receive the tier or tiers, and any changes in the nature of the
services provided, including the program services included in the tier or
tiers. Said notice shall be provided within five business days after the change
becomes effective.
113.05   CABLE OPERATOR INFORMATION.
   1.   City May Require. In those cases when the Cable Operator has submitted
initial rates or proposed an increase that exceeds the reasonable rate
standard, the Council may require the Cable Operator to produce information in
addition to that submitted, including proprietary information, if needed to
make a rate determination. In these cases, a Cable Operator may request the
information be kept confidential in accordance with this section. In cases
where initial or proposed rates comply with the reasonable rate standard, the
Council may request additional information only in order to document that the
Cable Operator’s rates are in accord with the standard.
   2.   Request for Confidentiality. A Cable Operator submitting information to
the Council may request in writing that the information not be made routinely
available for public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and
cover all of the information and all copies of the information to which it
applies. If feasible, the information to which the request applies shall be
physically separated from any information to which the request does not apply.
If this is not feasible, the portion of the information to which the request
applies shall be identified. Each request shall contain a statement of the
reasons for withholding inspection and a statement of the facts upon which
those reasons are based. Casual requests which do not comply with the
requirements of this subsection shall not be considered.
   3.   Council Action. Requests which comply with the requirements of
Subsection 2 will be acted upon by the Council. The Council will grant the
request if the Cable Operator presents by a preponderance of the evidence a
case for nondisclosure consistent with applicable federal regulations. If the
request is granted, the ruling will be placed in a public file in lieu of the
information withheld from public inspection. If the request does not present a
case for nondisclosure and the Council denies the request, the Council shall
take one of the following actions:
      A.   If the information has been submitted voluntarily without any
direction from the City, the Cable Operator may request that the City return
the information without considering it. Ordinarily, the City will comply with
this request. Only in the unusual instance that the public interest so requires
will the information be made available for public inspection.
      B.   If the information was required by the Council to be submitted, the
information will be made available for public inspection.
   4.   Appeal. If the Council denies the request for confidentiality, the
Cable Operator may seek review of that decision from the FCC within five
working days of the Council’s decision and the release of the information will
be stayed pending review.

driveways onto the traveled way of a street or alley so as to obstruct gutters,
or impede the passage of vehicles upon the street or alley or to create a
hazardous condition therein; except where, in the cleaning of large commercial
drives in the Business District it is absolutely necessary to move the snow
onto the street or alley temporarily, such accumulation shall be removed
promptly by the property owner or agent. Arrangements for the prompt removal of
such accumulations shall be made prior to moving the snow.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[2])
135.13   DRIVEWAYS AND PARKING AREAS.

a parking area into the right-of-way, permission must first be obtained from
the City. Further, Iowa Statewide Urban Design Specifications (SUDAS) shall be
followed unless an exception is granted by the City. In the event repairs are
needed at any time with respect to culverts, it shall be the responsibility of
the property owner to make such repairs, and, in the event the owner fails to
do so, the City shall have the right to make the repairs. If the property owner
fails to reimburse the City for the cost of said repairs, the cost shall be
certified to the County Treasurer and specially assessed against the property
as by law provided.

authority to grant an encroachment, and the City Council cannot grant a
variance to the Sheldon Zoning and Subdivision ordinances unless said
ordinances are amended prior, per the established process.
136.14   OPENINGS AND ENCLOSURES.
It is unlawful for a person to:
   1.   Stairs and Railings. Construct or build a stairway or passageway to any

136.20   VARIANCES AND DEFERMENT.
Sidewalk deferrals may be granted if it is deemed the existence of the sidewalk
would not substantially contribute to the public welfare, safety, convenience,
and enjoyment of the public and the land use and development patterns are such
that the sidewalk, if built, would not create a benefit.
   1.   Written Request. Any property owner or agent thereof may make a written
request to the Zoning Board of Adjustment for a variance or deferment of
sidewalk construction. A fee for an application for a variance or deferment is
set by resolution, payable when application is made. Such application must be
made within 60 days from notice to property owners.
   2.   All requests for variances and deferment shall be submitted to the
Zoning Board of Adjustment for final determination.
   3.   The Zoning Board of Adjustment will use and follow the standards,
listed below, to assist in making their determination on whether or not to
grant a variance or deferral:
      A.   Sidewalk deferrals may be granted if it is deemed the existence of
the sidewalk would not substantially contribute to the welfare, safety,
convenience, and enjoyment of the public and the land use and development
patterns are such that the sidewalk, if built, would not create a benefit.
      B.   Rationale for considering deferrals:
         (1)   Vacant lot owners shall install sidewalks if no new home
construction has taken place within the last two years in that development.
(This would exclude those with more than two consecutive vacant lots or part of
new construction/building permits.) Exempted is ground owned by the City of
Sheldon or the Sheldon Chamber and Development Corporation (SCDC).
         (2)   Abut property zoned or not zoned, and used, for agricultural,
commercial storage or industrial purposes on both sides of the street or
already has sidewalks installed.
         (3)   Does not contribute to a continuing pattern of sidewalk
construction.
         (4)   Does not contribute to the public’s convenient access to
property currently developed.
         (5)   Encourage pedestrian traffic where it is unsafe.
         (6)   If it is not deemed feasible by a certified civil engineer to
construct a sidewalk due to the conditions, grade, etc. of the property.
         (7)   Cul-de-sac properties.
         (8)   Properties adjacent to frontage roads.
      C.   Deferments.
         (1)   Deferments existing at the time of the adoption of these rules
shall expire.
         (2)   Deferments shall be considered on an individual basis and shall
be granted, continued, or terminated for specific reasons on their own merits,
consistent with land use and development patterns of other properties in the
area.
         (3)   The time limit and conditions under which deferments will be
terminated shall be stated at the time the deferment is granted or renewed.
         (4)   Deferments shall be terminated when the facts, circumstances and
conditions on which they were based no longer exist.
         (5)   Deferments that have been granted on an “indefinite” basis shall
be reviewed no sooner than two years after originally granted and then no more
frequently than every two years, unless the facts, circumstances and conditions
change.
   4.   In requests for variances or deferment or other matters brought before
the Zoning Board of Adjustment, the Board of Adjustment shall inform, in
writing, all parties involved of its decisions and the reasons therefor.
   5.   Variances and deferment regarding reconstruction or construction of
sidewalks shall be granted only by resolution of the Council. Variances may be
granted upon request in specific cases in which such variance will not be
contrary to the public interest and the spirit of this chapter shall be still
observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done.
Deferment of up to five years for construction or reconstruction completion
dates may be granted where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement
of the provisions of this chapter will in individual cases result in
practicable difficulty or unnecessary hardship.

140.01   STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND INTENT.
The following policies and procedures shall serve as a guide in the removal and
control of snow and ice on the streets, alleys, public parking lots, and City-
owned sidewalks in the City by the Street Department with assistance by other
departments. A procedures manual shall be updated annually in October, and more
frequently if conditions dictate. The streets, alleys, public parking lots, and
sidewalks shall be kept clean of ice and snow for the safety of motorists and
pedestrians. However, cost effective control and removal operations shall be
used at all times. The concept of reasonableness shall guide snow and ice
removal efforts. Under certain circumstances, emergency situations, budgetary
concerns, personnel problems, and the unpredictability of weather conditions in
Northwest Iowa, these policies may have to be superseded when conditions
warrant.
140.02   STATEMENT OF GENERAL POLICY.
The overall budgetary and planning goal for the City’s snow and ice removal
efforts is to plan for the worst, hope for the best, and budget for an average
snowfall and use contingency funds if the City has a severe winter. Each storm
has individual characteristics and must be dealt with accordingly. The portion
of the streets, alleys, and public parking lots improved for travel will have
upon their surfaces snow and ice in a compacted condition. These conditions may
be continuous, or they may be more concentrated on hills, intersections, and
sheltered areas. The snow removed from intersections will be piled in its
corners in piles of unequal height. The line of sight, sight distance, or
visibility of motorists and pedestrians approaching these intersections may be
greatly reduced or impaired. Motorists shall drive their vehicles during these
conditions with additional caution and watchfulness and are advised to reduce
their speed below that legally permitted or advised under normal conditions.
During these conditions, no additional warning or regulatory signs will be
placed to warn of impaired sight distances, visibility at intersections, road
blockages, one-lane conditions, or that the road surface is slick or slippery,
or what the advised speed should be.
140.03   USE OF CHEMICALS AND ABRASIVES.
The policy of the department is to not use pure salt for the melting of ice or
hard-packed snow. A mixture of 91 percent sand or chips, six percent salt and
three percent calcium chloride are used as an abrasive to help remove ice and
hard-packed snow and as a driving aid during slippery conditions. It is not a
policy of the department to place sand or salt upon streets that are slick or
slippery due to the formation of frost.
140.04   EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE.
The primary equipment available to remove snow and ice will be supplied by the
Street Department. Equipment and manpower may be supplied by other City
departments if needs dictate. During normal snow removal operations, four truck
plows, two end loaders, one motor grader, one four-wheel-drive jeep with plow,
and two sanding trucks are available. All truck-mounted snowplows have quick
attachments and can be mounted in five minutes. The sanding units consist of
two V-box type spreaders. During a major snow event, private contractors’
equipment may be placed in service.
140.05   MANPOWER.
The primary manpower for snow removal shall be supplied by the City street
department. The basic crew consists of the Public Works Director, one blower
operator, and five operators. During major snow events, personnel from other
City departments may assist with snow removal efforts.
140.06   SNOW ROUTES.
A system of unmarked snow routes has been established for effective snow
removal. The snow routes provide service to within three blocks of most
residential properties; and direct access to nursing homes, medical facilities,
community protection facilities, businesses, and Village Northwest Unlimited.
The procedures manual shall contain snow route information. (See also Section
69.15)
140.07   MONITORING AND NOTIFICATION OF ICE AND SNOW EVENTS.
Weather reports shall be continuously monitored by the Police Department and
Public Works Director when inclement weather is approaching. The Police Chief,
Public Works Director, and City Manager shall keep each other informed of
anticipated snow events, including timing and intensity of the event. The
primary responsibility shall rest with the Public Works Director. During night-
time, weekends, and holidays, the Police Department shall monitor weather
reports and road conditions and shall notify the Public Works Director when
action is needed by the street department. During normal weekday operations,
the Police Department shall notify the Public Works Director when action may be
needed by the Street Department. (See also Section 69.14)
140.08   SANDING PROCEDURES.
Sand shall be used sparingly and only when application will produce a positive
result. All streets, including the snow routes, will only have dangerous
intersections and other hazard areas sanded. Sand will generally be used when
the temperatures are 20? and rising. Sand may be applied below 20? if the sun
is shining and melting will take place. It is not the policy of the City to
obtain a bare pavement condition through the use of sand and chemicals.
140.09   SNOW REMOVAL PROCEDURES.
Snow removal efforts shall be made on a priority system as follows:
   1.   Emergency Snow Routes. Snowfalls two inches or more — service shall
begin at approximately 2:00 a.m. or as conditions dictate.
   2.   Residential Streets. Cleared within 12 to 48 hours of end of snow
event. Snowfalls of less than two inches will not be cleared unless drifting is
occurring.
   3.   Residential Alleys. Cleared after all streets have been cleared.
   4.   Commercial Alleys. Cleared within 12 to 48 hours after end of snow
event.
   5.   Public Parking Lots. Cleared within 12 to 48 hours after end of snow
event depending on severity of occurrence.
   6.   Central Business District Street Parking. Removed within 12 to 48 hours
after end of snow event depending on severity of occurrence.
   7.   City-Owned Sidewalks. Cleared within 24 hours after end of snow event.
140.10   TOWING ILLEGALLY PARKED VEHICLES.
Vehicles parked on the streets during a snow removal event may be ticketed or
towed away pursuant to the provisions of Chapters 69 and 70. The Police
Department shall contact the street department and coordinate ticketing and
towing operations relative to the snow removal effort.
140.11   BOUNDARY STREET JURISDICTION; RESPONSIBILITY.
The City will not be responsible for any snow removal operations outside of the
municipal boundaries. City-owned or -maintained facilities outside the
corporate boundaries, Washington Avenue from the north City limits to its
intersection with HWY 60, and certain portions of Western Avenue are exempted
from the foregoing prohibition. By mutual agreement, O’Brien County secondary
road personnel have the responsibility for snow removal on the following
sections of roads within the City limits:
   1.   16th Street from Washington Avenue to east City limits.
   2.   Washington Avenue from 16th Street to south City limits.
   3.   Country Club Road from north City limits to HWY 18.
   4.   Country Club Road from East 9th Street to south City limits.
Responsibility for snow removal on HWY 18 and HWY 60 within the corporate
limits of the City is that of the Iowa Department of Transportation.
140.12   RESPONSIBILITY FOR PRIVATE SIDEWALKS.
All sidewalks adjacent to private property are the responsibility of the
property owner. All complaint calls shall be routed to the Public Works
Director for complaint follow-up and Code enforcement. The property owners’
responsibilities are set forth in Chapter 136 of this Code of Ordinances. The
City lacks sufficient manpower to clear sidewalks, so every effort must be made
by private property owners to clear their sidewalks of ice and snow. (See also
Section 136.03)
140.13   PRIVATE DRIVEWAYS.
City snowplows will not clear private driveways. It is the responsibility of
the property owner or occupant to remove the snow placed in driveways by City
plows. Snow from a private driveway may not be placed upon or pushed across a
City street. (See also Section 135.12)
140.14   PLOWING PRIVATE PROPERTY.
It is strictly forbidden for a City plow to clear snow or ice from private
property unless it must be done to allow emergency vehicles access to private
property for ambulance, fire, or police calls. However, the City may from time-
to-time contract to provide snow and ice removal services to certain qualified
private entities. Such contracts shall be exempt from the above provision.
140.15   MAILBOXES.
Every attempt will be made by the snowplow operators to clean snow adjacent to
mailboxes to allow rural-type mail delivery. The snow will only be cleared,
however, from curb line to curb line. The adjacent property owner is
responsible for any other snow cleaning and to assure the mailbox is properly
installed to withstand snow clearing efforts by the City. The City will not
replace mailboxes damaged by snow removal efforts.

160.02   STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSE.
   1.   The Legislature of the State of Iowa has, in Chapter 414 of the Code of
Iowa, as amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to
secure safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
   2.   Findings of Fact.
      A.   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community.
      B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by: (i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
      C.   This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
   3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Subsection 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
      A.   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows
so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
      B.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
      C.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
      D.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
      E.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   1.   Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter shall
apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City which are located within

19141C0137C, and 19141C0141C, dated December 17, 2020, which were prepared as
part of the Flood Insurance Study for O’Brien County, and the Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) for Sioux County and Incorporated Areas, Panel 1909060003B,
dated May 1, 2011, which was prepared as part of the Flood Insurance Study for
Sioux County, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be the Official
Floodplain Zoning Map. The O’Brien County and Sioux County Flood Insurance
Studies are hereby adopted by reference and is made a part of this chapter for
the purpose of administering floodplain management regulations.
   3.   Rules for Interpretation of Floodplain (Overlay) District. The
boundaries of the Floodplain (Overlay) District areas shall be determined by
scaling distances on the official Flood Insurance Rate Map. When an
interpretation is needed as to the exact location of a boundary, the Zoning
Officer shall make the necessary interpretation. The Board of Adjustment shall
hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any
requirement, decision, or determination made by the Zoning Administrator in the
enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   4.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used, and no
structure shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered,
without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
   5.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
   6.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
   7.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated Floodplain (Overlay) District areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create
liability on the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
   8.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.

160.05   ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOODPLAIN (OVERLAY) DISTRICT.
The special flood hazard areas within the jurisdiction of this chapter are
hereby divided into the following districts:
Floodplain (Overlay) District – those areas identified as Zone A on the
Official Floodplain Zoning Map.
The boundaries shall be as shown on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map. Within
these districts, all uses not allowed as Permitted Uses are prohibited unless a
variance to the terms of this chapter is granted after due consideration by the
Board of Adjustment.
160.06   STANDARDS FOR FLOODPLAIN (OVERLAY) DISTRICT.
All uses must be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and meet the
following applicable performance standards. Where base flood elevations and
floodway data have not been provided on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The
applicant will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources
with sufficient technical information to make such determination.
   1.   All Development. All development within the Floodplain (Overlay)
District shall:
      A.   Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
      B.   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
      C.   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
      D.   Obtain all other necessary permits from federal, State, and local
governmental agencies including approval when required from the Iowa Department
of Natural Resources.
   2.   Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the base flood elevations. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
base flood elevations and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed subject to favorable
consideration by the Board of Adjustment, where existing topography, street
grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods
used must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various
forces and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential structures
located in areas that would become isolated due to flooding of surrounding
ground shall be provided with a means of access that will be passable by
wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this criterion shall not apply
where the Administrator determines there is sufficient flood warning time for
the protection of life and property. When estimating flood warning time,
consideration shall be given to the criteria listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa
Administrative Code.
   3.   Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be flood proofed to such a level. When
flood proofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State of
Iowa shall certify that the flood proofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and
other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the
base flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are flood proofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
   4.   All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
      A.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
         (1)   A minimum of two openings, with positioning on at least two
walls, having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
         (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one-foot
above grade.
         (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access and
low damage potential storage. Where the distance between the floor and ceiling
of the fully enclosed area below the lowest floor is five feet or more, the
applicant shall be required to sign and record with the O’Brien County Recorder
a Non-Conversion Agreement that ensures the lower enclosed area remains
compliant with the criteria outlined in this paragraph.
      B.   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
      C.   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment and
other service facilities (including ductwork) elevated or flood-proofed to a
minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation.
   5.   Factory-Built Homes.
      A.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the structure
is a minimum of one foot above the base flood level.
      B.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame
ties to ground anchors. Anchorage systems may include, but are not limited to,
use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors as required by the State
Building Code.
   6.   Utility and Sanitary Systems.
      A.   On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located or
designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
      B.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system as well as
the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment facilities
(other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood protection
equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood elevation.
      C.   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water
supply treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with
a level of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood
elevation.
      D.   Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
   7.   Storage of Materials and Equipment. Storage of equipment and materials
that are flammable, explosive, or injurious to human, animal or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or:
(i) not subject to major flood damage and be anchored to prevent movement due
to flood waters; or (ii) readily removable from the area within the time
available after flood warning.
   8.   Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as
levees, flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the base
flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for
adequate interior drainage. In addition, structural flood control works shall
be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
   9.   Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must be
designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations must be
approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
   10.   Subdivisions. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and
subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the base flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50 lots
(whichever is less) shall include base flood elevation data for those areas
located within the Floodplain (Overlay) District.
   11.   Accessory Structures to Residential Uses. Detached garages, sheds, and
similar structures that are incidental to a residential use are exempt from the
base flood elevation requirements where the following criteria are satisfied.
      A.   The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage potential.
Its size shall not exceed 600 square feet in size. Those portions of the
structure located less than one foot above the BFE must be constructed of
flood-resistant materials.

purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure shall not
be used for human habitation.
      C.   The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building site
so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
      D.   The structure shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement.
      E.   The structure's service facilities such as electrical and heating
equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above the base
flood elevation.
      F.   The structure’s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of Subsection 4(A) of this section.
Exemption from the base flood elevation requirements for such a structure may
result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of the structure
and its contents.
   12.   Recreational Vehicles.
      A.   Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of Subsection
5 of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built homes when
the following criteria are satisfied.
         (1)   The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less
than 180 consecutive days; and
         (2)   The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
      B.   Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than 180
consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements of
Subsection 5 of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built
homes.
   13.   Pipeline Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be
buried in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to
prevent rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
   14.   Maximum Damage Potential Development. All new or substantially
improved maximum damage potential development shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated a minimum of one foot above the elevation of the
500-year flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be
floodproofed to such a level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional
engineer registered in the State shall certify that the floodproofing methods
used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact
and uplift forces and other factors associated with the 0.2 percent chance
flood; and that the structure, below the 0.2 percent chance flood elevation is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water. A
record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in relation to
North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are floodproofed
shall be maintained by the Administrator. Where 0.2 percent chance flood
elevation data has not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The
applicant will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources
with sufficient technical information to make such determinations.
160.07   ESTABLISHMENT OF VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   1.   The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in specific cases
such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances
granted must meet the following applicable standards.
      A.   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
      B.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      C.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance
coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
   2.   Factors upon Which the Decision of the Board of Adjustment Shall Be
Based. In passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
      A.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
      B.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
      C.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
      D.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      E.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the City.
      F.   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
      G.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
      H.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
      I.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for the area.
      J.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      K.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood water expected at the site.
      L.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
      M.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
chapter.
   3.   Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this
chapter. Such conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
      A.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
      B.   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
      C.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
      D.   Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this chapter.
      E.   Floodproofing measures.
160.08   NONCONFORMING USES.
   1.   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful
before the passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but
which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be
continued subject to the following conditions:
      A.   If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any future
use of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
      B.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
   2.   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless
it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
State or local health, sanitary, building, or safety codes or regulations or
the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
designation.
160.09   PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
the requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this
chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction
thereof be fined not more than $500.00. Nothing herein contained shall prevent
the City from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy violation.
160.10   AMENDMENTS.
The regulations and standards set forth in this chapter may from time to time
be amended, supplemented, changed, or repealed. No amendment, supplement,
change, or modification shall be undertaken without prior approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
