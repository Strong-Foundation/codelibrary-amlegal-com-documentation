Â 
10.01 PURPOSE.
Â Â Â This chapter establishes procedures to be followed in the designation of
revitalization areas in accord with Chapter 404 of the Code of Iowa, including
the incorporation by reference of all previous revitalization areas established
within the corporate limits of the City.
10.02 INTENT.
Â Â Â It is the intent of this chapter, through the establishment of
revitalization areas, to provide financial incentives where there is a
demonstrated need and resulting community benefits for the redevelopment of
property by providing tax exemptions for all qualified improvements in areas
meeting the requirements of this chapter.
10.03 ELIGIBILITY OF AREAS FOR REVITALIZATION.
Â Â Â The City Council may designate revitalization areas within the City only if
those areas comply with the provisions of Chapter 404.1 of the Code of Iowa or
successor provisions as follows:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â An area in which there is a predominance of buildings or improvements,
whether residential or nonresidential, which by reason of dilapidation,
deterioration, obsolescence, inadequate provision for ventilation, light, air,
sanitation or open spaces, high density of population and overcrowding, the
existing of conditions which endanger life or property by fire and other causes
or a combination of such factors, is conducive to ill health, transmission of
disease, infant mortality, juvenile delinquency or crime, and which is
detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â An area which by reason of the presence of a substantial number of
deteriorated or deteriorating structures, predominance of defective or
inadequate street layout, incompatible land use relationships, faulty lot
layout in relation to size, adequacy, accessibility or usefulness, unsanitary
or unsafe conditions, deterioration of site or other improvements, diversity of
ownership, tax or special assessment delinquency exceeding the actual value of
the land, defective or unusual conditions of title, or the existence of
conditions which endanger life or property by fire and other causes, or a
combination of such factors, substantially impairs or arrests the sound growth
of a municipality, retards the provision of housing accommodations or
constitutes an economic or social liability and is a menace to the public
health, safety or welfare in its present condition and use.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â An area in which there is a predominance of buildings or improvements
which by reason of age, history, architecture or significance should be
preserved or restored to productive use.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â An area which is appropriate as an economic development area as defined
in Chapter 403.17 of the Code of Iowa.
10.04 CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATION OF URBAN REVITALIZATION AREAS.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â In addition to meeting the eligibility requirements as outlined under
Section
10.03 of this chapter, owners of property requesting establishment of a
revitalization area must provide the following information and demonstrate:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The economic and/or other community benefits resulting from the
proposed improvements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Community need for the proposed improvements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The developers need for financial assistance provided through tax
abatement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Estimated value of the proposed improvement.
Such information shall be supplied in writing at the time a request to
establish a revitalization area is made. Following submission of this
information, the Council shall hold a public hearing on any such proposal to
consider the above noted information and receive citizen input. If the Council
finds that the proposal meets the criteria as herein outlined and otherwise
determines that the project is in the best interests of the community,
authorization to proceed with preparation of the revitalization documents as
provided for under Section
10.05 may be granted by resolution.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The Council may on their own motion authorize establishment of area-
wide revitalization projects providing said area meets the eligibility
requirements outlined in Section
10.03.
10.05 CONDITIONS AND PROCEDURES.
Â Â Â All conditions and procedures outlined in Chapter 404.2 1 through 6 of the
Code of Iowa will be followed in the establishment of revitalization areas.
10.06 DESIGNATION OF REVITALIZATION AREAS.
Â Â Â Following completion of all requirements outlined in Chapter 404 of the Code
of Iowa and all requirements of this chapter, the Council may enact an
ordinance approving the revitalization area and establishing the effective date
of the area through an amendment of this section of this chapter by adding
divisions to the following listing of revitalization areas.
10.07 BASIS OF TAX EXEMPTION.
Â Â Â All qualified real estate shall be eligible to receive an exemption from
taxation as provided for in Section 404.3 of the Code of Iowa and as stipulated
in the urban revitalization area plan in effect for each project.
10.08 OTHER PROVISIONS.
Â Â Â This chapter incorporates all other provisions of the Code of Iowa as
provided for in Chapters 404.5, 404.6, and 404.7.
10.09 TIME FRAME.
Â Â Â The area shall be eligible for tax abatement under the revitalization plan
for the next four years starting from the date of the adoption of the
ordinance. If in the opinion of the Council, the desired level of
revitalization has been attained or economic conditions are such that the
continuation of the exemption granted would cease to be of benefit to the City,
the Council may repeal the ordinance establishing the revitalization area,
pursuant to Section 404.7 of the Code of Iowa. In the event the ordinance is
repealed, all existing exemptions shall continue until their expiration.
10.10 EXEMPTIONS.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â All commercial and industrial real estate is eligible to receive a
partial exemption from taxation on the assessed value added by the
improvements. The exemption is for a period of five years. The amount of the
partial exemption is equal to a percent of the assessed value added by the
improvements, determined as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â For the first year, 75 percent.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â For the second year, 65 percent.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â For the third year, 55 percent.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â For the fourth year, 45 percent.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â For the fifth year, 35 percent.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â All qualified real estate assessed as residential property is eligible
to receive a 100 percent exemption for taxation on the first $75,000.00 of
assessed value added by the improvements. The exemption is for a period of five
years.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â To be considered eligible for the full period of exemption from
taxation set forth within Subsections 1 and 2 above an Application for
Exemption from taxation must be received by the City within one year following
the date on which the property is considered 100% complete and taxed as being
100% complete by the Jones County Assessor. Applications filed more than one
year after said determination and taxation remain eligible for the remaining
exemption period. (For example, an Application for Exemption filed 18 months
after the Assessorâ€™s determination would be eligible for four years of
abatement. In the case of commercial or industrial property the exemption would
be for years two through five, the first year of eligible abatement dropping
off.)
(Subsection 3 - Ord. 749 - Sep. 21 Supp.)
10.11 OTHER SOURCES OF REVITALIZATION FUNDS.
Â Â Â At this time, there are no federal grants or loans for improvements in the
area other than those of conventional lending institutions at normal market
rates. However, it is not the intention of the City to prohibit the use of
other appropriate federal or State revitalization or incentive programs within
the area. The City may, in the future, apply for assistance through the
Community Development Block Grant Program.
10.12 ELIGIBLE IMPROVEMENTS.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Eligible property improvements, as used in this plan, include
rehabilitation and additions to any existing residential, commercial and
industrial structures located within the area. In addition, new construction on
vacant land or on land with existing structures is also eligible for tax
abatement.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Assessed value added by improvements, as used in this plan, means the
assessed value added as of the first year for which the exemption was received.
In order to be eligible for tax abatement, the increase in assessed value of
the property must be at least 10 percent.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â An applicant whose project is receiving either direct or indirect
benefits, which are financed through a City sponsored tax increment financing
program, shall not be eligible for tax abatement under the revitalization
program unless otherwise determined by the Council.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â All improvements, in order to be considered eligible, must be completed
in conformance with all applicable regulations of the City and must be
completed during the time the area is designated as a revitalization district.

36.03 CLEANUP REQUIRED.
Â Â Â Whenever a hazardous condition is created by the deposit, injection,

ground waters, the responsible person shall cause the condition to be remedied
by a cleanup, as defined in the preceding section, as rapidly as feasible to an

accomplishing the cleanup and stating that the City will proceed to procure
cleanup services and bill the responsible person for all costs associated with
the cleanup if the cleanup is not accomplished within the deadline. In the
event that it is determined that immediate cleanup is necessary as a result of
the present danger to the public health, safety and welfare, then no notice
shall be required and the City may proceed to procure the cleanup and bill the
responsible person for all costs associated with the cleanup. If the bill for
those services is not paid within 30 days, the City Attorney shall proceed to
obtain payment by all legal means. If the cost of the cleanup is beyond the

of a hazardous substance shall notify the State Department of Natural Resources
and the Police Department of the occurrence of a hazardous condition as soon as

46.02 Cigarettes and Tobacco 46.04 Minors in Bars
Â 
46.01 CURFEW.
Â Â Â The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote
the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and
specifically to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults
responsible for minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors
committed after the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences
and criminal activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Definitions. For use in this section, the following terms are defined:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â "Emergency errand" means, but is not limited to, an errand relating
to a fire, a natural disaster, an automobile accident or any other situation
requiring immediate action to prevent serious illness, bodily injury, or loss
of life.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â "Knowingly" means knowledge that a responsible adult should
reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that
responsible adult's custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful
or careless adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult
responsibility through an objective test. It is therefore no defense that an
adult responsible for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or
conduct or whereabouts of the minor.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â "Minor" means any unemancipated person under the age of 18 years.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â "Nonsecured custody" means custody in an unlocked multipurpose area,

or used as a secure detention area, and the person arrested is not physically
secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically
accompanied by a law enforcement officer or a person employed by the facility
where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to
providing nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate
juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the person's
parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but
not for longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or
magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â "Public place" includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys, and sidewalks dedicated to public use and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises, whether publicly or privately owned,
that are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited
commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is
permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has
access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is
considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.

specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have
custody or control of a minor.

Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Exceptions. The following are exceptions to the curfew:

Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The minor is on the sidewalk or property where the minor resides or
on either side of the place where the minor resides and the adult responsible
for the minor has given permission for the minor to be there.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The minor is present at or is traveling between home and one of the
following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Minor's place of employment in a business, trade or occupation
in which the minor is permitted by law to be engaged or, if traveling, within
one hour after the end or before the beginning of work;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Minor's place of religious activity or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of the religious activity;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Governmental or political activity or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of the activity;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â School activity or, if traveling, within one hour after the end

of the U.S. Constitution guarantees of free exercise of religion, freedom of
speech, freedom of assembly or, if traveling, within one hour after the end or

within the time periods prohibited by this section unless the minor's presence
falls within one of the above exceptions.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Enforcement Procedures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in
the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driver's
license, a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance,
use his or her best judgment in determining age.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody. Grounds for arrest are
that the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the person's
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any nonsecured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into
custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into
custody, the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the
minor as soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible
for the minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at
such time as the court may direct.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minor's parent, guardian or other person
legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the
law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative
of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person
who is known to the child.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Penalties.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Responsible Adult's First Violation. In the case of a first
violation by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall, by certified mail,
send to the adult responsible for the minor, written notice of the violation
with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of
the curfew ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with
applicable penalties.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Responsible Adult's Second Violation. Any responsible adult as
defined in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows
the minor to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a
municipal infraction.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Minor's First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a
minor, the law enforcement officer shall give the minor a written warning,
which states that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of
the curfew ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with

  by the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.
56.02 KEEPING OF DANGEROUS ANIMALS PROHIBITED.

act as a temporary custodian for such animal, or keep, shelter or harbor such
animal for any purpose or in any capacity within the City.

the City, the Mayor or peace officer shall order the person named in the
complaint to safely remove such animal from the City or destroy the animal
within three days of the receipt of such an order. Such order shall be
contained in a notice to remove the dangerous or vicious animal, which notice
shall be given in writing to the person keeping, sheltering, or harboring the
dangerous animal or vicious animal, and shall be served personally or by
certified mail. Such order and notice to remove the dangerous animal or vicious
animal shall not be required where such animal has previously caused serious
physical harm or death to any person, in which case the Mayor or peace officer

seizure and impoundment are not possible without risk of serious physical harm
or death to any person.

Mayor or peace officer may be appealed to the Council. In order to appeal such
order, written notice of appeal must be filed with the Clerk within three days

simple misdemeanor.
56.05 PIT BULLS PROHIBITED.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â It is unlawful for any person to own, possess, keep, exercise control
over, maintain, harbor, transport, or sell within the City any pit bull.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Exceptions. The prohibition in Subsection 1 of this section shall not
apply in the following enumerated circumstances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The Administrative Official or a properly authorized agent may
temporarily harbor and transport any pit bull for purposes of enforcing the
provisions of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Any non-profit animal welfare organization lawfully operating an
animal shelter in the City may temporarily hold any pit bull that it has
received or otherwise recovered.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â A person may temporarily transport into and hold in the City a pit
bull only for the purpose of showing such pit bull in a place of public
exhibition, contest or show sponsored by a bona fide dog club association or
similar organization, where the event sponsor provides sufficient evidence of a
valid liability insurance policy for the event, providing $1,000,000.00 in
liability coverage to the members of the attending public and the City.
However, the sponsor of the exhibition, contest, or show must receive written
permission from the Administrative Official, must obtain any other permits or
licenses required by City ordinance, and must provide protective measures
adequate to prevent pit bulls from escaping or injuring the public. The person
who transports and holds a pit bull for showing shall, at all times when the
pit bull is being transported within the City to and from the place of
exhibition, contest, or show, keep the pit bull confined in a secure temporary
enclosure, as defined in Section 56.01 of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Except as provided in Paragraph C above, the owner of a pit bull may
temporarily transport a pit bull continuously through the City, only if such
pit bull is being transported either from a point outside the City directly to
a destination outside the City, or between a point outside the City to an
airport, train station or bus station within the City. During such
interjurisdictional transportation, the owner may only stop in the City where
such stoppage is necessary and solely related to the continuing ability of the
owner to continue said transportation, including (but not limited to) the
refueling or repair of a motor vehicle. The pit bull must be maintained at all
times inside a secure temporary enclosure, as defined in Section 56.01, which
may include inside of the passenger compartment of a private motor vehicle,
with all accessible windows closed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The owner of any pit bull which received certification or other
formal recognition as an emotional support animal from a licensed medical (M.D.
or D.O.) or mental health professional on or before November 19, 2018, the date
on which the third reading of the ordinance codified in this section was passed
shall be allowed to keep such pit bull within the City consistent with the
following terms and conditions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The pit bull when not in a secure temporary enclosure as defined
in Section 56.01 and outside any residence shall at all times be on a leash of
no greater than six feet in length measured from one end of the leash to the
other when said leash is laid out flat. Leashes that may be extended to greater
lengths, even if maintained at six feet, shall not be permitted due to the risk
that said leash may suffer a malfunction and unintentionally extend to a
greater length. Any person put in control of a pit bull under this exception on
a leash must be physically capable of controlling, managing, and restraining as
necessary said pit bull. In the event said person loses control the
Administrative Official may make a finding that the pit bull was at large and
take appropriate action hereunder.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If the pit bull is moved to a home outside the City limits the
pit bull may not return at a later day to the City limits.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â If a pit bull is determined to have bitten any person,
documented or not, whether in the household of the owner and whether or not
within the City limits, the exception granted herein shall end and the pit bull
shall be removed from the community permanently within seven days of the owner
being given notice of the required removal by the Administrative Official.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â This exception is for the current pit bull owned by the owner
and shall not apply to any replacement pit bull or additional pit bull. No
additional or replacement pit bull will be allowed as an exception to the pit
bull ban.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â If at any time the pit bull for which this exception is granted
is found or allowed to be at large in the community the owner shall be cited
and subject to fines and/or other monetary penalties. If the pit bull is found
to be at large a second time the exception granted herein shall end and the pit
bull shall be removed from the City limits permanently within seven days of the
second occurrence of the animal being at large.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â The owner must provide proof that they have insurance coverage
for the pit bull in the minimum amount of $500,000.00 per covered occurrence
and must provide it to the City Clerk's office on an annual basis. Any lapse in
coverage shall result in the end of the exception made herein and the pit bull
must then be removed from the City limits permanently within seven days' notice
from the Administrative Official.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â The pit bull must be spayed or neutered at owner's expense with
proof provided to the City Clerk's office unless a licensed veterinarian states
in writing that a pit bull is unfit to undergo the required surgical procedure
because of an extreme health condition of the animal. Such extreme health
condition shall include, but not be limited to: severe cardiovascular
compromise, bleeding disorder, respiratory disease and hepatic disease. The old
age of an animal shall not, of itself, constitute an extreme health condition
for purposes of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The Police Chief is authorized to immediately impound any pit bull
found in the City which does not fall within the exceptions or meet the
requirements listed in Subsection 2 above. The owner shall be assessed all fees
associated with the impoundment. Any owner so impacted shall be given appeal
rights substantially consistent with the following Paragraph G.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â When the Police Chief has impounded any pit bull dog pursuant to
this section, and the owner of such dog disputes the classification of such dog
as a pit bull, the owner may request that the City collect a DNA sample to be
used for genetic testing purposes. While waiting for genetic testing results,
the owner shall continue to follow all requirements set out within Subsection 2
above. If the genetic/DNA results indicate any percentage of pit bull the owner
will be directed to remove the animal from the City limits within seven days.
The owner may request a hearing by the filing of a petition, same to be filed
no later than seven days after their receipt of genetic testing results from
the Administrative Official. The petition shall be filed with the Police Chief.
Such petition shall include the name and address, including mailing address, of
the petitioner. The Police Chief will then issue a notice of hearing date by
mailing a copy to the petitioner's address no later than seven days prior to
the scheduled hearing date. The hearing will be held before a panel of at least
three City Council members and the Police Chief. Any evidence the petitioner
wishes to be considered shall be submitted under oath or on affirmation either
in writing or orally at the hearing. The panel shall make a final determination
whether the dog is a pit bull as defined in Section
56.01. Such final determination shall be considered a final order of the City
subject to judicial review pursuant to the applicable rules of legal procedure.
The procedures in this paragraph shall not apply and the owner is not entitled
to such a hearing with respect to any dog which was impounded as the immediate
result of an attack or bite as defined in this chapter. In those instances, the
dog shall be handled and the procedures governed by the provisions for dogs
involved in a bite or attack. If a hearing is not requested and the animal is
not removed from the City, the Police Chief may see to the removal of the
animal by impoundment and shall assess all fees related thereto to the owner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â If the dog is found not to be a pit bull, the dog shall be released
to the owner, if not having been allowed to remain in the owner's possession
during DNA testing. If the dog is found to be a pit bull, it shall be
immediately removed from the City limits, and in no case later than seven days
and the owner shall reimburse the City for all costs associated with DNA
testing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â I.Â Â Â A DNA test will not be required and impoundment not made under the
following circumstances:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The owner voluntarily executes a waiver to an administrative
hearing on the classification of the dog as a pit bull, pursuant to Paragraph F
above.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The owner produces credible evidence that the pit bull is to be
permanently taken out of the City, maintained at a specified lawful location,
and the pit bull will not return to the City illegally.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Where the owner or owner's immediate family has committed a
prior violation of this section, or the pit bull had been previously identified
as a pit bull and/or impounded and released pursuant to this subsection, the
following provisions shall apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The owner shall pay a non-refundable payment of $250.00 for
the costs of the administrative review of this matter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The owner shall submit a petition in writing only, and any
factual claims shall be supported by sworn affidavits of witnesses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The pit bull may be released only where the owner is able to
prove by clear and convincing evidence that the presence of the pit bull was
either legal, due to circumstances that amount to a lawful exemption as listed
in Subsection 2 above, or the pit bull's presence in the City was not due to a
voluntary act or the failure of the owner to take reasonable efforts to prevent
the violation, such as the fact the pit bull was stolen or taken without legal
authority by a known party.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The negligence or recklessness of the owner or the owner's
agent, in causing or allowing the violation of this section, will not amount to
sufficient cause for the pit bull's release.

into custody any abandoned vehicle on private property. The police authority

vehicle in custody and upon payment of the costs of the notice. The notice
shall also state that the failure of the owner, lienholders or claimants to
exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property within the
time provided shall be deemed a waiver by the owner, lienholders and claimants
of all right, title, claim and interest in the vehicle or personal property and
that failure to reclaim the vehicle or personal property is deemed consent to
the sale of the vehicle at a public auction or disposal of the vehicle to a
demolisher and to disposal of the personal property by sale or destruction. If
the abandoned vehicle was taken into custody by a private entity without a
police authority's initiative, the notice shall state that the private entity

property. A court in any case in law or equity shall not recognize any right,

publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the
vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice
under Section 80.03. The published notice may contain multiple listings of
abandoned vehicles and personal property but shall be published within the same
time requirements and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed
notice in Section 80.03.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3b])
80.05 EXTENSION OF TIME.
Â Â Â The owner, lienholders or claimants may, by written request delivered to the
police authority or private entity prior to the expiration of the 10-day
reclaiming period, obtain an additional five days within which the motor
vehicle or personal property may be reclaimed.

garages, shall be established by such facility.

any abandoned motor vehicle, or any person being the owner of a motor vehicle
whose title certificate is faulty, lost or destroyed, may dispose of such motor
vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without notification
procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more wheels or
other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable. The police
authority shall give the applicant a certificate of authority. The applicant
shall then apply to the County Treasurer for a junking certificate and shall
surrender the certificate of authority in lieu of the certificate of title.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.90[2e])
80.09 PROCEEDS FROM SALES.
Â Â Â Proceeds from the sale of any abandoned vehicle shall be applied to the
expense of auction, cost of towing, preserving, storing, and notification
required, in accordance with State law. Any balance shall be held for the owner
of the motor vehicle or entitled lienholder for 90 days, and then shall be
deposited in the State Road Use Tax Fund. Where the sale of any vehicle fails
to realize the amount necessary to meet costs the police authority shall apply
for reimbursement from the Department of Transportation.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[4])

CHAPTER 91
WATER METERS
Â 
91.01 Purpose            91.05 Fire Sprinkler Systems; Exception
91.02 Water Use Metered  91.06 Location of Meters
91.03 Estimated Readings 91.07 Meter Setting
91.04 Construction Use   91.08 Right of Entry
Â 
91.01 PURPOSE.
Â Â Â The purpose of this chapter is to encourage the conservation of water and
facilitate the equitable distribution of charges for water service among
customers.
91.02 WATER USE METERED.
Â Â Â All water furnished customers shall be measured through meters installed,
maintained and renewed by and at the expense of the customer. The City shall
determine the size and type of water meter to be used. All water sold by the
City shall be measured by meters furnished by the City and paid for by the
owner, and said water meters shall remain the property of the City at all
times. The plans related to the installation of any and all water meters shall
be subject to prior approval of the City's Superintendent. For water not being
returned to the City's sanitary sewer system due to its use within and/or as
part of an in-ground lawn watering/sprinkling system or for purposes of filling
an outdoor pool that is not equipped with drains connected to the City sewer
system, property owners will have the option of a second water meter, said
meter to be installed at the expense of the property owner. The property owner
shall also pay the current rate for water consumed through this separate meter
as outlined in Section 92.02 of this Code of Ordinances, but shall not be
billed for the sewer usage as outlined in Section 99.01 of this Code of
Ordinances. A second meter, once installed and operational, shall be subject to
the minimum monthly water bill each and every month regardless of use, and if
sought to be disconnected by the owner, would not be subject to reconnection
for a period of at least 12 months from the date of disconnection. In the event
a meter is uninstalled it shall be returned to the City and a subsequent
installation will require that a new meter be purchased by the property owner.
The property owner shall make a written request of the City for approval by the
Superintendent prior to the installation of said second meter. The
Superintendent shall ensure that the manner in which the second meter is being
installed is not subject to use for any purpose other than the permitted
purposes of an in-ground lawn watering/sprinkling system or outdoor pool.
91.03 ESTIMATED READINGS.
Â Â Â Where a meter has ceased to register or meter reading could not be obtained,
the quantity of water consumed for billing purposes will be based upon an
average of the prior six months' consumption, and the conditions of water
service prevailing during the period in which the meter failed to register.
91.04 CONSTRUCTION USE.
Â Â Â Water for building or construction purposes will be furnished by meter
measurement, only after suitable deposit has been made, the minimum deposit
being $10.00 and the amount determined by the City depending upon the size of
the construction work contemplated. All water for building or construction
purposes, as set forth in the permit, must pass through one and the same meter.
Water so supplied shall be discharged through a hose or pipe directly upon
material to be wet, or into a barrel or other container, and in no case upon
the ground or into or through a ditch or trench, and all use of water by other
than the applicant or use of water for any purpose or upon any premises not so
stated or described in the application must be prevented by the applicant, or
water service may be discontinued without notice. The City may require a
suitable backflow preventer if deemed necessary to ensure compliance with the
provisions of this Code of Ordinances.
91.05 FIRE SPRINKLER SYSTEMS; EXCEPTION.
Â Â Â Fire sprinkler systems may be connected to water mains by direct connection
without meters under the direct supervision of the Superintendent. No other
open, unmetered connection shall be incorporated in the system, and there shall
be no valves except a main control valve at the entrance to the building which

Â Â Â Except as hereinafter provided, private wells and water systems shall not be
maintained by any individual or property owner, nor shall any new wells be
established within the City limits. Private wells and water systems shall be
allowed only if one or more of the following conditions are established by the
applicant to the satisfaction of the City:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Existing Well. The well or water system was in existence prior to April
26, 1989, and duly registered with the City, which registration specified the
location of the well, by address and legal description, the name and address of
the property owner of the well, the name and address of all individuals using
the well, and the address and legal description of all properties serviced by
the well.

Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Undue Hardship. If the property owner or individual applying for a
private well permit can show that denying the permit and not allowing the
private well or water system will cause the individual or property owner undue
hardship. Undue hardship in this case means that the particular tract of land
is so topographically situated that connection to the City water main system
would be unfeasible and that the particular conditions causing the
unfeasibility of the connection are in no way caused or contributed to by the
property owner or permit applicant. The Council shall rule on all questions of
undue hardship and their decision shall be final.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Shallow Well. A shallow well, sometimes known as a "sand point," may be
authorized by the Council upon the applicant's entering into an agreement or
covenant, running with the land, with the City that such shallow well shall not
be connected to any part of the municipal water system.
93.02 PERMIT FOR NEW WELL.
Â Â Â All individuals who desire to construct or maintain a new private well or
water system within the City must first make application to the Clerk for a
private well permit. The Council shall establish the contents of the permit
application by resolution. No permit for a new well or water system shall be
granted unless one or more of the required conditions under Section 93.01 are
established and the well meets all applicable City, County, State and federal
rules, regulations and laws.
93.03 ANNUAL RENEWAL OF PERMIT.
Â Â Â Every well, including existing wells and future wells, shall be tested
annually, and results of the tests filed with the Clerk. An individual well
owner may cause to have a sample of the well water taken to the nearest
authorized testing agency for testing, and a copy of such test results shall be
filed with the Clerk. Every well shall be tested annually during the month of
September of each year, and the test results shall be filed with the Clerk on
or before the first day of October of each year. If a well owner fails to
comply with this annual test requirement, the Clerk shall send a notice to the
well owner at the last known address, advising the well owner no annual test
results have been filed with the Clerk. The notice shall further specify that
if the well owner does not properly test the well and file the test results
with the Clerk within 60 days after the date of mailing of the notice, the City
shall declare the well abandoned, and the owner shall forthwith terminate use
of the well as required under Section 93.08 of this chapter. In the event a
well owner has timely filed the annual test results with the Clerk or timely
filed test results after notice and the test results show compliance with all
applicable health and safety standards as required by appropriate City, County,
State and Federal rules, regulations and laws, the Clerk shall renew the
original permit for an additional one-year period.
93.04 NONRENEWAL OF ANNUAL PERMIT.
Â Â Â In the event a well owner receives annual test results that indicate lack of
compliance with appropriate City, County, State and federal rules, regulations
and laws, the well owner shall immediately advise the City of the test results
and immediately correct the problems and bring the well up to applicable
standards. The well owner shall have an additional 90 days after October 1 of
each year to correct any problems shown by the annual test. If applicable
standards cannot be met or if the problems are not timely corrected, no renewal
permit shall be issued and the well owner shall forthwith terminate use of the
well as required under Section
93.08.
93.05 REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
Â Â Â If at any time it is determined that a private well or water system does not
meet applicable City, County, State or federal rules, regulations or laws, the
permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall automatically terminate without
further notice to the well owner. The well owner shall have 90 days to correct
the problems so that applicable standards are met. In the event applicable
standards cannot be met, the well shall be abandoned and the well owner shall
forthwith terminate use of the well as required by Section 93.08. In the event
a private well or water system is not used for any consecutive nine-month
period of time, then at the expiration of the current private well permit
period, the permit shall not be renewed unless the well owner shows good cause
for the non-use and all provisions of this chapter for a new well are complied
with.
93.06 HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS; RIGHT OF INSPECTION.
Â Â Â All private wells and private water systems for which permits are granted
pursuant to this chapter shall meet all applicable City, County, State and
federal rules, regulations and laws. All permit holders, as a condition of
receiving a permit, grant to the City the right to enter the well owner's
property solely to inspect and test any private well and water system
maintained upon the permit holder's property. In the event the private well or
water system so inspected and tested by the City does not meet applicable
standards, the City shall notify the well owner in writing of the failure to
meet applicable standards. The well owner shall have 90 days from the date of
mailing the notice to correct the problems. If the owner fails to timely
correct the problems, the permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall
terminate without further notice to the well owner, and the well owner shall
forthwith terminate use of the well as required under Section
93.08. In the event a private well or water system cannot be brought up to
applicable standards in the time period allowed herein, and the well owner is
not otherwise connected to the City's water system, the well owner shall
connect to the City water system within 180 days in accordance with this Code
of Ordinances.
93.07 PERMIT FEES.

for an existing well.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Annual Renewal Permit. There is no fee for each annual renewal permit,
provided the well owner does the test at the owner's own expense. In the event
a well owner fails to have the well tested as required pursuant to this chapter
and the City makes the test, the costs of testing shall be charged to the well
owner, and the well owner shall pay an annual permit fee of $10.00.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Permit Fees for New Wells. Any person desiring to install a new well or
water system shall make application to the Clerk for a permit, and prior to
start of construction shall pay the following permit fees:

made on the water and the water supply is potable.
All permit fees shall be paid to the Clerk at the time the application is
filed. In the event the permit is not granted, the application fee shall be
returned to the applicant.
93.08 TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT.

to failure to comply with applicable standards, the well owner's connection to
the City water system, or other reasons, the well owner or property owner shall
cut off the service mains to the well and the well abandoned in such manner as

of a building sewer shall be performed in accordance with the provisions of the
State Plumbing Code and the provisions of Chapter 135 of this Code of
Ordinances.
96.05 CONNECTION REQUIREMENTS.
Â Â Â Any connection with a public sanitary sewer must be made under the direct
supervision of the Superintendent and in accordance with the following:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Old Building Sewers. Old building sewers may be used in connection with
new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test conducted by
the owner and observed by the Superintendent, to meet all requirements of this
chapter.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Separate Building Sewers. A separate and independent building sewer
shall be provided for every occupied building; except where one building stands
at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or
can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court,
yard, or driveway. In such cases the building sewer from the front building may
be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building
sewer.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Installation. The installation and connection of the building sewer to
the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the State Plumbing Code
and applicable rules and regulations of the City. All such connections shall be
made gastight and watertight. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and
materials must be approved by the Superintendent before installation.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Water Lines. When possible, building sewers should be laid at least 10
feet horizontally from a water service. The horizontal separation may be less,
provided the water service line is located at one side and at least 12 inches
above the top of the building sewer.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Size. Building sewers shall be sized for the peak expected sewage flow
from the building with a minimum building sewer size of four inches.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Alignment and Grade. All building sewers shall be laid to a straight
line to meet the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Recommended grade at one-fourth inch per foot.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Minimum grade of one-eighth inch per foot.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Minimum velocity of two feet per second with the sewer half full.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Any deviation in alignment or grade shall be made only with the
written approval of the Superintendent and shall be made only with approved
fittings.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Depth. Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the
building at an elevation below the basement floor. The depth of cover above the
sewer shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Sewage Lifts. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low
to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such
drain shall be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the
building sewer.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Pipe Specifications. Building sewer pipe shall be free from flaws,
splits, or breaks. Materials shall be as specified in the State Plumbing Code
except that the building sewer pipe, from the property line to the public
sewer, shall comply with the current edition of one of the following:

Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Bearing Walls. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within
three feet of any bearing wall that might thereby be weakened.
Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â Jointing. Fittings, type of joint and jointing material shall be
compatible with the type of pipe used, subject to the approval of the
Superintendent. Solvent-welded joints are not permitted.
Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â Unstable Soil. No sewer connection shall be laid so that it is exposed
when crossing any watercourse. Where an old watercourse must of necessity be
crossed or where there is any danger of undermining or settlement, cast iron
soil pipe or vitrified clay sewer pipe thoroughly encased in concrete shall be
required for such crossings. Such encasement shall extend at least six inches
on all sides of the pipe. The cast iron pipe or encased clay pipe shall rest on
firm, solid material at either end.
Â Â Â 13.Â Â Â Preparation of Basement or Crawl Space. No connection for any
residence, business or other structure with any sanitary sewer shall be made
unless the basement floor is poured, or in the case of a building with a slab
or crawl space, unless the ground floor is installed with the area adjacent to
the foundation of such building cleared of debris and backfilled. The backfill
shall be well compacted and graded so that the drainage is away from the
foundation. Prior to the time the basement floor is poured, or the first floor
is installed in buildings without basements, the sewer shall be plugged and the
plug shall be sealed by the Superintendent. Any accumulation of water in any
excavation or basement during construction and prior to connection to the
sanitary sewer shall be removed by means other than draining into the sanitary
sewer.
96.06 INTERCEPTORS REQUIRED.
Â Â Â Grease, oil, sludge and sand interceptors shall be provided by gas and
service stations, convenience stores, car washes, garages, and other facilities
when, in the opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper
handling of such wastes that contain grease in excessive amounts or any
flammable waste, sand or other harmful ingredients. Such interceptors shall not
be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. When required, such
interceptors shall be installed in accordance with the following:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Design and Location. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity
as specified in the State Plumbing Code, to be approved by the Superintendent,
and shall be located so as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Construction Standards. The interceptors shall be constructed of
impervious material capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in
temperature. They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped
with easily removable covers that shall be gastight and watertight.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Maintenance. All such interceptors shall be maintained by the owner at
the owner's expense and shall be kept in continuously efficient operations at
all times.
96.07 SEWER TAP.
Â Â Â Connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the
"Y" branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If no properly
located "Y" branch is available, a saddle "Y" shall be installed at the
location specified by the Superintendent. The public sewer shall be tapped with
a tapping machine and a saddle appropriate to the type of public sewer shall be
glued or attached with a gasket and stainless steel clamps to the sewer. At no
time shall a building sewer be constructed so as to enter a manhole unless
special written permission is received from the Superintendent and in
accordance with the Superintendent's direction if such connection is approved.
96.08 INSPECTION REQUIRED.
Â Â Â All connections with the sanitary sewer system before being covered shall be
inspected and approved, in writing, by the Superintendent. As soon as all pipe
work from the public sewer to inside the building has been completed, and
before any backfilling is done, the Superintendent shall be notified and the
Superintendent shall inspect and test the work as to workmanship and material;
no sewer pipe laid underground shall be covered or trenches filled until after
the sewer has been so inspected and approved. If the Superintendent refuses to
approve the work, the plumber or owner must proceed immediately to correct the
work.
96.09 PROPERTY OWNER'S RESPONSIBILITY.
Â Â Â All costs and expenses incident to the installation, connection, and
maintenance of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall

Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner's
expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
97.08 TESTING OF WASTES.
Â Â Â All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH's are determined from
periodic grab samples).

Â 
100.01 PURPOSE.
Â Â Â The purpose of this chapter is to establish a Storm Water Drainage Utility
and provide a means of funding the construction, operation and maintenance of
storm water management facilities including, but not limited to, detention and
retention basins, storm water sewers, inlets, ditches and drains, and cleaning
of streets. The Council finds that the construction, operation and maintenance
of the City's storm and surface water drainage system should be funded through
charging users of property which may connect or discharge directly, or
indirectly, into the storm and surface water drainage system.
100.02 DEFINITIONS.
Â Â Â For use in this chapter, unless the context specifically indicates
otherwise, the following terms are defined:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â "Connection" means the physical act or process of tapping a public
storm water sewer or drainage line, or joining onto an existing side sewer, for
the purpose of connecting private impervious surface or other storm and surface
water sources or systems to the public storm and surface water system. It also
includes the creation or maintenance of impervious surfaces that cause or may
cause an increase in the quantity or decrease in quality, or both, from the
natural state of storm water runoff, and which drains, directly or indirectly,
to the storm and surface water drainage system.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â "Storm and surface water drainage system" means any combination of
publicly owned storm and surface water quantity and quality facilities, pumping
or lift facilities, storm and secondary drain pipes and culverts, open
channels, creeks and ditches, force mains, laterals, manholes, catch basins and
inlets, including the grates and covers associated therewith, detention and
retention facilities, laboratory facilities and equipment, and any other
publicly owned facilities for the collection, conveyance, treatment and
disposal of storm and surface water within the City, to which sanitary sewage
flows are not intentionally admitted.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â "Unit" means each household, place of commerce, education, government,
religion, or industry, whether in a single building on a single lot, or in a
multiple-use building on a single lot or multiple lot complex. Each unit shall
be charged individually, but where the complex is billed under one combined
service account, the recipient of that bill shall be deemed the user and
receive the total combined storm water drainage system district charge for that
complex.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â "User" means any person who uses property that maintains connection to,
discharges to, or otherwise receives services from the City for storm water
management. The occupant of occupied property is deemed the user. But where a
complex is billed under one combined service account, the recipient of that
bill shall be deemed the user and receive the total combined storm water
drainage system district charge for that complex. If the property is not
occupied, the person who has the right to occupy it shall be deemed the user.
If it is not possible, after reasonable inquiry, to determine the rightful
occupant of the occupied property, the owners, individually or severally, shall
be deemed to be the users.
100.03 DRAINAGE UTILITY ESTABLISHED.

recently amended, the entire territorial limits of the City are hereby declared
to fall within the jurisdiction of the Storm Water Drainage Utility for the
purpose of establishing, imposing, adjusting and providing for the collection
of rates for the operation and maintenance of storm water management
facilities. The entire City, as increased from time to time by annexation,
shall constitute the area covered by this Storm Water Drainage Utility.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84[5])
100.04 RATES.
Â Â Â Each user shall pay for storm and surface water drainage service provided by
the City. The rates for the operation and maintenance of the storm water
management facilities shall be collected by imposing a monthly rate on each
â€œunit.â€ The rates/charges shall be billed as part of the userâ€™s combined
service account. (Combined service account meaning a customer service account
for the provision of two or more utility services.) The City may adopt rules,
charges, rates, and fees for the use of the Cityâ€™s storm and surface water
system, and for services provided by the City related thereto. Such rules may
include delinquency fees, interest charges and/or penalties. Such charges and
fees shall be just and equitable based upon the actual costs of operation,
maintenance, acquisition, extension and replacement of the Cityâ€™s Storm Water
Management Facilities/Storm and Surface Water Drainage System(s), the costs of
bond repayment, regulation, administration, and the services of the City. The
rates in effect from November 1, 2021 billing on, for the foregoing functions
shall be collected by imposing a monthly rate of three dollar ($3.00) on every
residential â€œunit,â€ and four dollars and fifty cents ($4.50) on every other,
non-residential â€œunit.â€
(Ord. 748 - Sep. 21 Supp.)

Â Â Â Except as provided for in Section 92.07 of this Code of Ordinances, the
owner of the premises served and any lessee or tenant thereof shall be jointly
and severally liable for charges for the operation and maintenance of the storm
water management facilities. Any such charges remaining unpaid and delinquent
shall constitute a lien upon the property or premises served and shall be
certified by the Clerk to the County Treasurer for collection in the same
manner as property taxes.
100.07 USE OF GENERATED REVENUES.
Â Â Â The City shall hold all funds generated from the enactment of this chapter
in one fund to be used for the construction and/or maintenance of municipal
storm water management systems and/or as matching funds for storm water
management projects within the community, subject to the following:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The City shall have an application available for interested persons/
entities to apply for matching funds from the storm water revenues.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â All applications shall be considered by the Council for approval by
resolution of the Council.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Matching funds shall not exceed 50 percent of the storm water
management component of any proposed project.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The City, at its discretion, may require that the applicant for

Â 
110.01 FRANCHISE GRANTED.
Â Â Â The City hereby grants a nonexclusive franchise to Aquila, Inc, d/b/a Aquila
Networks, a Delaware corporation (hereinafter called "Grantee"), its lessees,
successors and assigns. Grantee is hereby granted the right, privilege,
franchise, permission and authority to lay, construct, install, maintain,
operate and extend in, along, over or across the present and future streets,
alleys, avenues, bridges, public rights-of-way and public places as are now
within the present or future limits of the City, a natural gas distribution
system and all facilities necessary for the purpose of supplying natural gas or
processed gas for all purposes to the inhabitants of the City and consumers in
the vicinity thereof, and for the distribution of natural gas from or through
the City to points beyond the limits thereof. Such facilities shall include,
but not be limited to, all mains, services, pipes, conduits and appliances
necessary or convenient for transmitting, transporting, distributing and
supplying natural gas for all purposes for which it may be used, and to do all
other things necessary and proper in providing natural gas service to the
inhabitants of the City and in carrying on such business.
110.02 TERM.
Â Â Â The rights and privileges granted by this chapter shall remain in effect for
a period of 25 years from the effective date hereof. â€  Five years from the date
of enactment of the ordinance codified herein and every 10 years thereafter
until the end of the term as defined in this section, the City, through its
Clerk, shall notify Grantee in writing at least 180 days before the expiration
of the initial term, that the City desires not to renew the franchise, and such
notice shall specify the City's reasons.
Â 
Notes
â€â€  EDITOR'S NOTE: Ordinance No. 570, adopting a natural gas franchise for the
  City, was passed and adopted on May 3, 2004.
110.03 GOVERNING RULES AND REGULATIONS.
Â Â Â The franchise is granted subject to all conditions, limitations and
immunities now provided for, or as hereafter amended, and applicable to the
operations of a public utility, by State or federal law. The rates to be
charged by Grantee for service within the present or future corporate limits of
the City and the rules and regulations regarding the character, quality and
standards of service to be furnished by Grantee shall be under the jurisdiction
and control of such regulatory body or bodies as may, from time to time, be
vested by law with authority and jurisdiction over the rates, regulations and
quality and standards of service to be supplied by Grantee. Provided however,
should any judicial, regulatory or legislative body, having proper
jurisdiction, take any action that precludes Grantee from recovering from its
customers any cost associated with services provided hereunder, then Grantee
and the City shall renegotiate the terms of this chapter in accordance with the
action taken, so as to allow Grantee to be made whole economically. In
determining the rights and duties of the Grantee, the terms of this chapter
shall take precedence over any conflicting terms or requirements contained in
any other ordinance enacted by the City. If an energy supplier is unable to
furnish an adequate supply of energy due to an emergency, an order or decision
of a public regulatory body, or other acts beyond the control of the Grantee,
then the Grantee shall have the right and authority to adopt reasonable rules
and regulations limiting, curtailing or allocating extensions of service or
supply of energy to any customers or prospective customers, and withholding the
supply of energy to new customers, provided that such rules and regulations
shall be uniform as applied to each class of customers or prospective
customers, and shall be non-discriminatory as between communities receiving
service from the Grantee.
110.04 FRANCHISE FEE.
Â Â Â In exchange for the franchise granted herein, Grantee shall collect from its
customers, but not from the City, located within the corporate limits of the
City, and pay to the City an amount equal to three percent of gross receipts
derived from the sale, distribution or transportation of natural gas delivered
within the present or future limits of the City. Gross receipts as used herein
are revenues received from the sale, distribution or transportation of natural
gas, after adjustment for the net write-off of uncollectible accounts and
corrections of bills theretofore rendered. The amount paid by Grantee shall be
in lieu of, and Grantee shall be exempt from, all other occupation, license,
excise or right-of-way permit fees or taxes which the City may impose for the
rights and privileges herein granted or for the privilege of doing business
within the City, and in the event any such fee, charge, license, tax or
assessment shall be imposed by the City, the payment to be made in accordance
with the provisions of this section shall be reduced in an amount equal to the
annual burden of such fee, charge, license, tax or assessment imposed upon the
Grantee. Ad valorem property taxes imposed generally upon all real and personal
property within the City shall not be deemed to affect the obligation of the
Grantee under this section. Any consideration hereunder shall be reported and
paid to the City by Grantee on a monthly basis. Such payment shall be made not
more than 30 days following the close of the period for which payment is due.
Initial and final payments shall be prorated for the portion of the period at
the beginning and end of the term of the franchise. Grantee shall list the
local franchise fee collected from customers as a separate item on bills for
utility service issued to customers. If at any time the Iowa Utility Board, or
other authority having proper jurisdiction, prohibits such recovery, then
Grantee will no longer be obligated to collect and pay the franchise fee herein
contemplated. In addition, a Grantee may discount or reduce the franchise fee
payable for natural gas delivered to a specific customer of Grantee when it is
required to reduce the franchise fee to retain the business of that customer.
Modification or reduction of the franchise fee should occur if the franchise
fee would cause the customer to cease purchase or transportation deliveries of
natural gas from the Grantee by installing equipment to access natural gas
supply not subject to the City's franchise fee. The City shall provide copies
of annexation ordinances to Grantee on a timely basis to ensure appropriate
franchise fee collection from customers within the corporate limits of the
City. The City shall have access to and the right to examine during normal
business hours, those of Grantee's books, receipts, files, records and
documents that are necessary to verify the correctness of payments due
hereunder. If it is determined that a mistake was made in the payment of any
franchise fee required hereunder, such mistake shall be corrected promptly upon
discovery, such that any under-payment by Grantee shall be paid within 30 days
of the recalculation and any over-payment by Grantee shall be discounted from
the next payment due.
110.05 CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF COMPANY FACILITIES.
Â Â Â Any pavements, sidewalks or curbing taken up and any and all excavations
made shall be done in such a manner as to cause only such inconvenience to the
inhabitants of the City and to the general public as is reasonably necessary;
and repairs and replacements shall be made promptly by Grantee, leaving such
properties in as good a condition as existed immediately prior to excavation.
Grantee agrees that for the term of this grant, it will use its best efforts to
maintain facilities and equipment sufficient to meet the current and future
energy requirements of the City, its inhabitants and industries. While
maintaining its facilities and equipment, Grantee shall obtain permits as
required by ordinance, except that in emergency situations, Grantee shall take
immediate unilateral actions as it determines are necessary to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare; in which case, Grantee shall notify the
City as soon as reasonably possible. The City will give Grantee reasonable
notice of plans for street improvements where paving or resurfacing of a
permanent nature is involved that affect Grantee's facilities. The notice shall
contain the nature and character of the improvements, the rights-of-way upon
which the improvements are to be made, the extent of the improvements and the
time when the City will start the work, and, if more than one right-of-way is
involved, the order in which this work is to proceed. The notice shall be given
to the Grantee a sufficient length of time, considering seasonable working
conditions, in advance of the actual commencement of the work to permit the
Grantee to make any additions, alterations, or repairs to its facilities.
110.06 EXTENSION OF COMPANY FACILITIES.
Â Â Â Upon receipt and acceptance of a valid application for service, Grantee
shall, subject to its own economic feasibility criteria, make reasonable
extensions of its distribution facilities to serve customers located within the
current or future corporate limits of the City.
110.07 RELOCATION OF COMPANY FACILITIES.
Â Â Â If the City elects to change the grade of or otherwise alter any street,
alley, avenue, bridge, public right-of-way or public place for a public
purpose, Grantee, upon reasonable notice from the City, shall remove and
relocate its facilities or equipment situated in the public rights-of-way, if
such removal is necessary to prevent interference and not merely for the
convenience of the City, at the cost and expense of Grantee. If the City orders
or requests Grantee to relocate its facilities or equipment for the primary
benefit of a commercial or private project, or as a result of the initial
request of a commercial or private developer or other non-public entity, and
such removal is necessary to prevent interference and not merely for the
convenience of the City or other right-of-way user, Grantee shall receive
payment for the cost of such relocation as a precondition to relocating its
facilities or equipment. The City shall consider reasonable alternatives in
designing its public works projects so as not arbitrarily to cause Grantee
unreasonable additional expense in exercising its authority under this section.
The City shall also provide a reasonable alternative location for Grantee's
facilities. The City shall give Grantee written notice of vacating of a public
right-of-way. Vacating of a public right-of-way shall not deprive the Grantee
of its right to operate and maintain existing facilities, until the reasonable
cost of relocating the same are first paid to the Grantee. Any person or
corporation desiring to move a building or other structure along, or to make
any unusual use of any street, alley, avenue, bridge, public right-of-way or
public place which shall interfere with the facilities or equipment of the
Grantee, shall first give notice to the City and the Grantee and pay a sum
sufficient to cover the expense and damage incident to the moving of Grantee's
facilities and equipment.
110.08 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
Â Â Â The City acknowledges that certain information it might request pursuant to
the franchise may be of a proprietary and confidential nature. If Grantee
requests that any information provided by Grantee to the City be kept
confidential due to such proprietary or commercial value, the City and its
employees, agents and representatives shall maintain the confidentiality of
that information, to the extent allowed by law. If the City is requested or
required by legal or administrative process to disclose any such confidential
information, the City shall promptly notify Grantee of such request or
requirement so that Grantee may seek an appropriate protective order or other
relief. The City shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the
confidentiality of Grantee's confidential information is maintained.
110.09 FORCE MAJEURE.
Â Â Â It shall not be a breach or default under the franchise if either party
fails to perform its obligations hereunder due to Force Majeure. Force Majeure
includes, but is not limited to, the following:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Physical events such as acts of God, landslides, lightning,
earthquakes, fires, freezing, storms, floods, washouts, explosions, breakage or
accident or necessity of repairs to machinery, equipment or distribution or
transmission lines;
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Acts of others such as strikes, work-force stoppages, riots, sabotage,
insurrections or wars;
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Governmental actions such as necessity for compliance with any court
order, law, statute, ordinance, executive order, or regulation promulgated by a
governmental authority having jurisdiction; and any other causes, whether of
the kind herein enumerated or otherwise not reasonably within the control of
the affected party to prevent or overcome.
Each party shall make reasonable efforts to avoid Force Majeure and to resolve
such event as promptly as reasonably possible once it occurs in order to resume
performance; provided, however, this provision shall not obligate a party to
settle any labor strike.
110.10 HOLD HARMLESS.
Â Â Â Grantee, during the term of the franchise, agrees to save harmless the City
from and against all claims, demands, losses and expenses arising directly out
of the negligence of Grantee, its employees or agents, in the constructing,
operating, and maintaining of distribution and transmission facilities or
appliances of Grantee; provided, however, Grantee need not save harmless the
City from claims, demands, losses and expenses arising out of the negligence of
the City, its employees or agents.
110.11 NON-WAIVER.
Â Â Â Any waiver of any obligation or default under the franchise shall not be
construed as a waiver of any future defaults, whether of like or different
character.

Â Â Â The Building Official is responsible for the enforcement of this chapter.
145.02 GENERAL DEFINITION OF UNSAFE.
Â Â Â All buildings or structures that are structurally unsafe or not provided
with adequate egress, or that constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise
dangerous to human life, or that in relation to existing use constitute a
hazard to safety or health, or public welfare, by reason of inadequate
maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, or abandonment, are, for the purpose
of this chapter, unsafe buildings. All such unsafe buildings are hereby
declared to be public nuisances and shall be abated by repair, rehabilitation,
demolition, or removal in accordance with the procedure specified in this
chapter.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 657A.1 & 364.12[3a])
145.03 UNSAFE BUILDING. "Unsafe building" means any structure or mobile home
meeting any or all of the following criteria:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Various Inadequacies. Whenever the building or structure, or any
portion thereof, because of: (i) dilapidation, deterioration, or decay; (ii)
faulty construction; (iii) the removal, movement, or instability of any portion
of the ground necessary for the purpose of supporting such building; (iv) the
deterioration, decay, or inadequacy of its foundation; or (v) any other cause,
is likely to partially or completely collapse.

or any portion thereof, is manifestly unsafe for the purpose for which it is
being used.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Inadequate Maintenance. Whenever a building or structure, used or
intended to be used for dwelling purposes, because of dilapidation, decay,
damage, faulty construction, or otherwise, is determined by any health officer
to be unsanitary, unfit for human habitation or in such condition that it is
likely to cause sickness or disease.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Fire Hazard. Whenever any building or structure, because of dilapidated
condition, deterioration, damage, or other cause, is determined by the Fire
Marshal or Fire Chief to be a fire hazard.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Abandoned. Whenever any portion of a building or structure remains on a
site after the demolition or destruction of the building or structure or
whenever any building or structure is abandoned for a period in excess of six
months so as to constitute such building or portion thereof an attractive
nuisance or hazard to the public.
145.04 NOTICE TO OWNER.
Â Â Â The enforcement officer shall examine or cause to be examined every building
or structure or portion thereof reported as dangerous or damaged and, if such
is found to be an unsafe building as defined in this chapter, the enforcement
officer shall give to the owner of such building or structure written notice
stating the defects thereof. This notice may require the owner or person in
charge of the building or premises, within 48 hours or such reasonable time as
the circumstances require, to commence either the required repairs or
improvements or demolition and removal of the building or structure or portions
thereof, and all such work shall be completed within 90 days from date of
notice, unless otherwise stipulated by the enforcement officer. If necessary,
such notice shall also require the building, structure, or portion thereof to
be vacated forthwith and not reoccupied until the required repairs and
improvements are completed, inspected, and approved by the enforcement officer.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[3h])
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Notice Served. Such notice shall be served by sending by certified mail
to the owner of record, according to Section 364.12[3h] of the Code of Iowa, if
the owner is found within the City limits. If the owner is not found within the
City limits, such service may be made upon the owner by registered mail or
certified mail. The designated period within which said owner or person in
charge is required to comply with the order of the enforcement officer shall
begin as of the date the owner receives such notice.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Hearing. Such notice shall also advise the owner that he or she may
request a hearing before the Council on the notice by filing a written request
for hearing within the time provided in the notice.
145.05 CONDUCT OF HEARING.

or repairs are completed. Such notice shall not be removed without written
permission of the enforcement officer and no person shall enter the building
except for the purpose of making the required repairs or of demolishing the
building.
145.07 RIGHT TO DEMOLISH; MUNICIPAL INFRACTION.
Â Â Â In case the owner fails, neglects, or refuses to comply with the notice to
repair, rehabilitate, or to demolish and remove the building or structure or
portion thereof, the Council may order the owner of the building prosecuted as
a violator of the provisions of this chapter and may order the enforcement
officer to proceed with the work specified in such notice. A statement of the
cost of such work shall be transmitted to the Council. As an alternative to
this action, the City may utilize the municipal infraction process to abate the
nuisance.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[3h])
145.08 COSTS.
Â Â Â Costs incurred under Section 145.07 shall be paid out of the City treasury.

160.02 STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 414, Code of Iowa,
as amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure
safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Findings of Fact.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by: (i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Paragraph 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows
so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter shall
apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City shown on the Official

prepared as part of the Flood Insurance Study for Jones County, are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be the Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The
Jones County Flood Insurance Study is hereby adopted by reference and is made a
part of this chapter for the purpose of administering floodplain management
regulations. The flood profiles and all explanatory material contained with the
Flood Insurance Study are also declared to be a part of this chapter.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Rules for Interpretation of District Boundaries. The boundaries of the
zoning district areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the Official
Floodplain Zoning Map. When an interpretation is needed as to the exact
location of a boundary, the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it
is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no
structure shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered,
without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provision of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with
this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.

or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated Floodplain (Overlay) District areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create
liability on the part of the City, or any officer or employee thereof, for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or on any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.

Â Â Â The Board of Adjustment, hereinafter referred to as the Board, shall hear
and decide: (i) appeals; and (ii) requests for variances to the provisions of
this chapter, and shall take any other action which is required of the Board.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Appeals. Where it is alleged there is any error in any order,
requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in
the enforcement of this chapter, the aggrieved party may appeal such action.
The notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board and with the official from
whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason for the
appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to the Board
all the documents constituting the record upon which the action appealed from
was taken.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Variance. The Board may authorize upon request in specific cases such
variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances
granted must meet the following applicable standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for structures than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance
coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Hearings and Decisions of the Board.

for a variance, the Board shall hold a public hearing. The Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the hearing and give public notice thereof, as well as due
notice to parties in interest. At the hearing, any party may appear in person
or by agent or attorney and present written or oral evidence. The Board may
require the appellant or applicant to provide such information as is reasonably
deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or evaluation of
a professional engineer or other expert person or agency, including the
Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal or
variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an appeal, the Board may, so
long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter,
reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in
writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision.
In granting a variance, the Board shall consider such factors as contained in
this section and all other relevant sections of this chapter and may prescribe
such conditions as contained in Subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board Shall Be Based. In
passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all relevant
factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:

Title
Â 
165.01 TITLE.
Â Â Â This chapter shall be known as and may be referred to and cited as the
"Zoning Ordinance of the City of Monticello, Iowa."
165.02 PURPOSE AND NATURE.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The purpose of this chapter is to implement the powers in Chapter 414
of the Code of Iowa by which a city is empowered to regulate and restrict the
height, number of stories, and size of buildings and other structures, the
percentage of lot that may be occupied, the size of yards, courts, and other
open spaces, the density of population, and the location and use of building
structures, and land for trade, industry, residence, or other purposes for the
purpose of promoting health, safety, morals, or the general welfare of the
community or for the purpose of preserving historically significant areas of
the community.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The nature of the power granted to the City Council by this chapter is
as follows: the Council may divide the City into districts, including an
historical preservation district, of such number, shape, and area as may be
deemed best suited to carry out the purposes of this chapter; and within such
districts it may regulate and restrict the erection, construction,
reconstruction, alteration, repair, or use of buildings structures, or land.
All such regulations and restrictions shall be uniform for each class or kind
of buildings throughout each district, but the regulation in one district may
differ from this in other districts.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The regulations shall be made in accordance with a comprehensive plan
and designed to preserve the availability of agricultural land; to consider the
protection of soil from wind and water erosion; to encourage efficient urban
development patterns, to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety
from fire, flood, panic, and other dangers; to promote health and the general
welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of
land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to promote the conservation
of energy resources; to promote reasonable access to solar energy; and to
facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewage, schools,
parks, and other public requirements. However, provisions of this section
relating to the objectives of energy conservation and access to solar energy do
not void any zoning regulations existing on July 1, 1981, or require zoning in
a city that did not have zoning prior to July 1, 1981.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Such regulations shall be made with reasonable consideration, among
other things, as to the character of the area of the district and the peculiar
suitability of such area for particular uses, and with a view to conserving the
value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout
such city.
165.03 AMENDMENTS TO REGULATIONS AND DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The Council may by ordinance provide that the regulations and
restrictions and the boundaries of the districts shall be from time to time
amended, supplemented, or changed.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Provisions for Amendment. An amendment to the Zoning Ordinance may be
accomplished by petition, by direction of the Council or by the initiative of
the Zoning Commission.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Petition for Change or Amendment. Whenever the owners of 50 percent or
more of the area of the lots in any district or part thereof desire any
amendment, supplement, or change in any of the provisions of this chapter
applicable to such area, they may file a petition with the City Administrator
or City Clerk requesting the City Council to make such amendment, supplement,
or change. Such petition shall be accompanied by the proposed amendment,
supplement, or change together with boundaries of the said area and the names
and addresses of all the owners on record in the office of the County Recorder
of Jones County, Iowa, of lots therein; and such petition shall immediately be
transmitted to the Zoning Commission for an investigation and report.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Directed to Zoning Commission. The City Council may by resolution
direct that the Zoning Commission study and make recommendations regarding
proposed amendments to the Zoning Ordinance which resolution containing the
proposed amendment shall be transmitted to the Zoning Commission.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Zoning Commission Amendments. The Zoning Commission may by resolution
propose an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and proceed to make
recommendations regarding the proposed amendment to the City Council.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Action by Zoning Commission. The Zoning Commission upon receipt of a
petition for amendment or a resolution of the Council, or upon passing its own
resolution shall investigate and recommend to the City Council whether any
amendment, supplement or change should be made to the City Zoning regulations
and ordinances.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Filing Fee. A petition for change or amendment to the zoning district
boundaries shall be accompanied by a filing fee of $50.00. The fee shall be
deposited in the General Fund of the City. Denial of the requested change shall
not cause the fee to be refunded to the petitioner.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Public Hearing. After receipt of the Zoning Commission recommendation,
the Council shall consider the amendment, supplement, supplement or change at a
public hearing during a regular scheduled Council meeting open to the public.
Notice of this hearing shall be provided by publication in the official
newspaper at least once not less than seven days and not more than 20 days
prior to the Council's consideration of the amendment, supplement, or change.
Said public hearing shall not take place sooner than the first regularly
scheduled Council meeting after notice is published.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Conditions. The Council may impose additional conditions on a property
owner that are in addition to existing regulations if the additional conditions
have been agreed to in writing by the property owner before the public hearing
required under this section or any adjournment of the hearing. The conditions
must be reasonable and imposed to satisfy public needs that are directly caused
by the requested change.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Additional Notice. The City may, at its discretion, provide additional
notice by regular mail to property owners subject to the amendment, and to
record owners of property within 200 feet of the exterior boundaries of
property subject to the amendment.
Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â Protest, Change or Amendment. A protest against any proposed
amendment, supplement, or change may be filed with the City Clerk prior to the
public hearing considering the amendment, supplement, or change. The protests
must be written and if signed by the owners of 20 percent or more of the area
of lots included in the proposed change or repeal, or by the owners of 20
percent or more of the property which is located within 200 feet of the
exterior boundaries of the property for which the change or repeal is proposed,
then the change or repeal shall not become effective except by the favorable
vote of at least three-fourths of all the members of the Council.
Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â Renewal of Petition. Whenever a petition requesting an amendment,
supplement, or change of any regulations described in this chapter has been
denied by the City Council, such petition cannot be received for one year
thereafter, unless it is signed by at least 50 percent of the property owners
who previously objected to the changes; this provision, however, shall not
prevent the City Council from acting on its own initiative in any case or at
any time provided in this chapter.
Â Â Â 13.Â Â Â Notice Provisions. For the purpose of this chapter, notice of the
Planning and Zoning Commission hearings and the City Council meetings,
regarding amendments, supplements, and changes to zoning properties shall
include the following information: the date, time, and place of the hearing;
the proposed amendment; and a statement that a written protest to the amendment
may be presented at the meeting and that the proposed change shall not become
law unless passed by three-fourths vote of all members of the Council if the
protest is signed by owners of 20 percent or more of the area of lots within
200 feet of the exterior boundaries of the property for which the change is
proposed. The notice must also state that the Council may impose reasonable
restrictions are presented in writing at the hearing before the Council.

165.09 RULES FOR INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
Â Â Â Where uncertainty exists with respect to the precise location of any of the
aforesaid districts shown on the Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Boundaries shown as following or approximately following streets,
highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow the centerlines of such
streets, highways, or alleys.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Boundaries shown as following or approximately following platted lot
lines or other property lines shall be construed to follow said boundary lines.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Boundaries shown as following or approximately following railroad lines
shall be construed to lie midway between the main tracks of such railroad
lines, unless the railroad abuts a street or alley right-of-way. The boundary
then follows the centerline of the street or alley right-of-way.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Boundaries shown as following or approximately following the center
lines of streams, rivers, or other continuously flowing water courses shall be
construed as following the channel center line of such water courses taken at a
mean low water mark.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Boundaries shown as following or closely following the City limits
shall be construed as following such City limit lines.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated
in Subsections 1 through 5 shall be so construed. Distances not specifically
indicated on the Official Zoning Map shall be determined by the scale of the
map.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at
variance with those shown on the Official Zoning Map, or in other circumstances
not covered by the Subdivision regulations in Chapter 170 of this Code of
Ordinances, the Board of Adjustment shall interpret the district boundaries.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Whenever any street, alley, or other public easement is vacated, the
district classification of the property to which the vacated portions of land
accrue shall become the classifications of the vacated land.
165.10 ANNEXED TERRITORY.
Â Â Â All territory which may hereafter be annexed to the City shall be classed
automatically as being in an A-1 Agricultural District until such
classification shall have been changed by amendment of this chapter except as
provided in Subsection 2.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Extra-territorial Limits. The applicability of these regulations and
all of its amendments are hereby extended to a point occurring two miles beyond
the corporate limits of the City as they may from time to time be amended.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Zoning Classification. All new territory brought into the City's two-
mile extra-territorial limits due to annexations to the City shall be classed
automatically as A-1 until adoption of the of the extra-territorial zoning map
by the City. All of the real estate described above in Subsection 1 hereby
given a classification of A-1. Zoning restrictions of said zone shall apply to
all land which shall limit such land usage to agricultural and horticultural
purposes and any other non-commercial or non-industrial usage. Provided
further, nothing herein contained shall prohibit any future development within
the said two-mile areas subject to the following limitations and restrictions.
Existing uses not allowed in the designated district shall be considered
nonconforming uses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Development shall comply with the requirements of the zone
designated on the City's extra-territorial Future Land Use Map. If a proposed
use does not comply with the designated zoning standards, the owner shall
request that the Planning and Zoning Commission approve their land use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Any such future construction as contemplated herein shall be in
compliance with all of the laws of the State and all of the ordinances of the
City, specifically including any ordinances regulating or pertaining to health,
sanitation, or safety now in effect or hereinafter to be enacted.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Accessory Buildings. Structures, and uses customarily incidental to any
of the above uses shall be allowed, provided, however, that the said accessory
buildings and structures shall have and maintain the same depth and widths with
regard to front yard, side yard, and rear yard as the principal dwelling or
building are required to have under these regulations and other ordinances of
the City.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Manufactured Homes. No manufactured homes, or manufactured home parks
shall be installed or constructed except in strict conformity with the
regulations of the City pertaining to manufactured homes and mobile home parks.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Front Yards. The minimum front yard depth of any lot abutting on a
County, State or federal street, road or highway shall be 30 feet, measured
from the right-of-way line of such street, road, or highway. If no right-of-way
width is dedicated for a roadway, a minimum right-of-way width of 66 feet shall
be assumed.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Exemptions. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to apply to
land, farm houses, farm buildings, farm out buildings, and other buildings,
structures, or erections which are primarily adapted by reason of nature or
area, for use for agricultural purposes, while being so used, provided that the
area comprises of 35 contiguous acres or more which is used for agricultural
purposes and the growing and production of all agricultural products thereon.
The regulations contained in the said zoning code, if any, shall, however,
relate to and have effect upon any structures, dams, obstructions, deposits, or
evacuations in or on the Floodplains of any river or stream in the area
described above.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Right of Hearing. Property owners affected by the zoning regulations,
and its amendments, shall have the same right of hearing, protest, and appeal
as owners of property affected thereby within the corporate limits of the City.
165.11 ZONING AFFECTS EVERY STRUCTURE.
Â Â Â Except as hereinafter provided, no building, structure, or land shall be
erected, constructed, reconstructed, occupied, moved, altered, or required,
except in conformity with the regulations herein specified for the class of
District in which it is located.
165.12 MINIMUM STREET FRONTAGE, LOT OF RECORD, NUMBER OF BUILDINGS ON LOT AND
LOTS UNSERVED BY SEWER OR WATER.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Lot of Record. In any Residential District on a lot of record at the
time of enactment of this Zoning Ordinance, a single-family dwelling may be
established regardless of size of the lot, provided all other requirements of
this Zoning Ordinance are complied with. However, where two or more vacant and
contiguous substandard recorded lots are held in common ownership, they shall
be combined into zoning lots and shall thereafter be maintained in common
ownership and shall be so joined and developed for the purpose of forming an
effective and conforming zoning lot. For the purpose of this section, the
razing of a building on a substandard lot shall constitute the formation of a
vacant lot.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Lots Unserved by Sewer and/or Water. In any residential district where
neither public water supply or public sanitary sewer are reasonably available,
one single dwelling may be constructed, provided the otherwise specified lot
area and width requirements shall be a minimum of one acre.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Minimum Street Frontage. No lot shall be created, after May 25, 2011,
unless it abuts at least 40 feet on a public street or an approved drive.
165.13 ACCESSORY BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES, AND USES.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Time of Construction. No accessory building or structure shall be
constructed on any lot more than one year prior to the time of construction of
the principal building to which it is an accessory.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Percentage of Yard Occupied. No single or combination of detached
accessory buildings, or other accessory structure(s) shall, when combined,
occupy more than 30 percent of the area of the respective yard in which they
are located.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Restrictions on Front Yard and Corner Lot Side Yard. Accessory
structures in the front yard and/or corner lot side yard are limited to
driveways, sidewalks, patios, planting beds/boxes, or similar features not
exceeding 30 inches in height, except fences in accordance with Section
165.23, handrails, or mailboxes installed in accordance with U.S. Postal
Service regulations. For those lots/parcels located in subdivisions, additions,
or plats approved before June 24, 1996, a covered or uncovered porch or deck
may be allowed to exist within the setback area so long as it remains at least
12 feet away from the right-of-way, does not extend into the side yard, and is
not wider than the width of the front foundation of the home. If the proposed
porch or deck meets those criteria, a permit may be issued for the construction
thereof.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Height of Accessory Buildings/Structures. Detached accessory buildings
and structures shall not exceed, under any circumstance, 25 feet in height. Any
accessory building/structure shall meet the following property line setbacks,
same being dependent upon the height of said building/structure and whether or
not the accessory building/structure is located adjacent to an alley right-of-
way.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Buildings/structures less than 15 feet in height shall be subject to
a three-foot side and rear yard setback unless located adjacent to an alleyway
right-of-way in which case the setback shall be five feet from the alleyway
right-of-way.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Buildings/structures between 15 feet and 20 feet in height shall be
subject to a five-foot side and rear yard setback.

subject to a 10-foot side and rear yard setback.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Location on Lot. No accessory building or structure shall be erected in
any front yard or corner lot side yard unless compliant with Subsection 3,
above. If an accessory building or structure is erected in a side yard, it must
be erected in such a fashion that it meets all setbacks as if it were attached
to the primary structure.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Swimming Pool Fences. No public or private swimming pool shall be
erected unless the same be entirely enclosed by buildings, fences, or walls not
less than four nor more than eight feet in height and of such construction that
a child may not reach the pool from the street or from any adjacent property
without opening a door or gate or scaling a wall or fence. Holes or openings in
the fence shall be four inches or less in least diameter. Such fences or walls
shall be equipped with self-latching gates or doors. All doors from houses and
garages to pool area must also be self-closing and self-latching.

165.14 MORE THAN ONE PRINCIPAL STRUCTURE ON LOT.
Â Â Â In any District other than A1, R1, or R2, more than one principal structure,
housing a permitted principal use, may be erected on a single lot provided that
the area, yard, and other requirements shall be met for each structure as
though it were on an individual lot.
165.15 REQUIRED YARD CANNOT BE REDUCED OR USED BY ANOTHER BUILDING.
Â Â Â No lot, yard, court, parking area, or other open space shall be so reduced
in area or dimension as to make any such area or dimension less than the
minimum required by this Ordinance, and if already less than the minimum
required it shall not be further reduced. No required open space provided
around any building or structure shall be included as part of any open space
required for another building or structure.
165.16 CONVERSION OF DWELLINGS.
Â Â Â The conversion of any building or structure into a dwelling or the
conversion of any dwelling so as to accommodate an increased number of dwelling
units or families, shall be permitted only within a district in which a new
building for similar occupancy would be permitted under the ordinance, and only
when the resulting occupancy will comply with the requirements governing new
construction in such district with respect to minimum setbacks, lot size, lot
area per dwelling unit, dimensions of yards and other open spaces, and off-
street parking. Each conversion shall be subject also to such further
requirements as may be specified hereinafter within the article applying to
such district.
165.17 YARD AND PARKING SPACE RESTRICTION.
Â Â Â No part of yard, or other open space, or off-street parking or loading space

grades of the intersecting streets shall be erected, placed, or maintained
within the triangular area formed by the right-of-way lines at such corner and
a straight line joining the right-of-way lines at points which are 25 feet
distant from the intersection of the right-of-way lines, and measured along the
right-of-way lines.
165.19 ESSENTIAL SERVICES.
Â Â Â Essential services shall be permitted as authorized and regulated by law and
other ordinances of the community, it being the intention hereof to exempt such
essential services from the application of this chapter.
165.20 VALIDITY OF EXISTING BUILDING PERMITS.
Â Â Â Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the overall layout,
plans, construction, size, or designated uses of any development, building,
structure, or part thereof, for which the official approvals and required
building permits have been granted before the enactment of this zoning
ordinance, the construction of which, conforming with such plans, shall have
been started prior to the effective date of the ordinance and the completion
thereof carried on in a normal manner within the subsequent six-month period,
and not discontinued until completion, except for reasons beyond the builder's
control.
165.21 HEIGHT EXCEPTIONS.
Â Â Â The height limitations contained herein do not apply to spires, belfries,
cupolas, chimneys, antennas, water tanks, ventilators, elevator housing, to

Linden Street, a street that is not heavily travelled, may elect to erect a
fence of up to six feet in height if the fence is set back off the right-of-way
by at least five feet.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Fences or landscape features such as sculpture or walls that abut or
have alley right-of-way frontage must be set back five feet from the adjacent

165.28 TEMPORARY USE EXCEPTIONS.
Â Â Â The following uses may be permitted by a Temporary Use Exception Permit,

of the application by the City Council.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Carnival, circus.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Festivals.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â In determining whether a temporary use exception permit shall be

morals, of area residents, and adverse impact on land used, possibility of
traffic congestion, harm to public roads, erosion of adjacent property, and
threat to any source of water supply. Conditions and restrictions as determined
necessary to protect the public health, safety, morals, and comfort may be
attached to the permit.
165.29 BULK REQUIREMENTS.
Â Â Â All new buildings shall conform to the building regulations established
herein for the district in which each building shall be located. Further, no
existing building shall be enlarged, reconstructed, structurally altered,
converted, or relocated in such a manner as to conflict or to further conflict
with the bulk regulations of this ordinance for the district in which such
buildings shall be located. Minimum bulk requirements are listed in Tables 1
and 2, subject to the following:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Table 1. The minimum front yard, side yard and rear yard requirements
for premises that are zoned A-1, R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-4, as contained in Table
1, shall pertain to subdivisions, additions, or plats approved on or after June
24, 1996, for said zoning district uses.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Table 2. The minimum front yard, side yard and rear yard requirements
for premises that are zoned A-1, R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-4, as contained in Table
2, shall pertain to subdivisions, additions, or plats approved before June 24,
1996, for said zoning district uses. Construction within a premises shall be
allowed to extend into the 25 feet front yard setback equal to the distance of
the adjacent property that extends the least amount into the setback. For
example, if the home to the north of the subject property is set back 15 feet
and the home to the south of the subject property is set back 20 feet, the
subject property may extend into the setback by 5 feet, maintaining a 20 feet
setback. However, the only construction that may extend into the setback
pursuant to this provision is an open non-enclosed porch or deck. All other
zoning districts shall refer to Table 1 for bulk requirements. Table 2 shall
apply to lots in subdivisions, additions, or plats approved before June 24,
1996, even if said lots have been increased in size by the acquisition and
addition of adjoining property to said lot.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Exception from Application of Bulk Requirement. In the event of the
submission of a building permit application that does not fully comply with all
provisions of the applicable bulk permits set out in Table 1 or Table 2, as
applicable, the Zoning Administrator and the Public Works Director shall have
the power to approve the building permit after application of the following
steps and procedures:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The Zoning Administrator and Public Works Director shall jointly
determine that the approval of the requested building permit would not
adversely affect any adjoining property owner, not be inconsistent with the
most recent City Comprehensive Plan, and not otherwise negatively impact the
City and/or its infrastructure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In performing this analysis the Zoning Administrator and/or the
Public Works Director shall inform all adjacent property owners of the
requested permit and obtain their position, for or against the proposed
construction in writing, signed by at least one owner of each adjacent
property, and shall take into account their position. An adjacent property
shall include each and every property that physically abuts the property of
concern as well as any and all properties lying across any easement and/or
roadway, whether private or public.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If there is no opposition to the proposed construction from adjacent
property owners the Zoning Administrator and Public Works Director shall have
the power to grant the building permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â In the event the Zoning Administrator and Public Works Director
determine it appropriate to grant the building permit in the face of any
adjacent property owner objection, the approval of the permit shall then be
submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission for consideration and
recommendation to the Council for consideration and approval or denial of same.
Absent eventual City Council approval, the earlier approval by the Zoning
Administrator and Public Works Director shall have no effect.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â In no event shall the denial of a building permit application by the
Zoning Administrator and Public Works Director pursuant to the terms set forth
within this provision of the Code of Ordinances result in an appeal and/or
further consideration by the Planning and Zoning Board and/or the City Council.
In the event of a denial by the Zoning Administrator and Public Works Director,
the applicant shall then be required to submit a request for a variance or
special use exception to the Board of Adjustment according to the terms and
provisions set forth elsewhere in the Code of Ordinances, or comply with the
terms of the bulk requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The approval of a permit under the circumstances contemplated herein
shall be in writing and shall set out the facts and reasoning/analysis of the
Zoning Administrator and Public Works Director considered in making their
decision, and shall be signed by both parties. In the event of a vacancy in
either the position of Zoning Administrator or Public Works Director, the Mayor
shall replace the missing party in the consideration of a request subject to
the terms of this provision.

no building shall be hereafter erected, constructed, reconstructed, or altered,
except for one or more of the following uses:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Agriculture, nurseries, and truck gardens, each of which shall be
limited to the propagation and cultivation of plants, provided no retail or

Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Churches and synagogues.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Any manufactured or modular homes that are placed in a residential
zoning district will be required to be installed to the same standards of a
site-built home, including, but not limited to, a permanent foundation system,
set-back, and minimum square footage which would apply to a site-built, single-
family dwelling on the same lot, and shall require that the home is assessed
and taxed as a site-built dwelling. Any home, site-built or other, will be
required to have a minimum width of 20 feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Family day care homes, day care centers, pre-school centers, nursery
schools, child play care centers, child education centers, child experiment
stations, or child development institutions, under the following regulations:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â No more than six children not related to the operator shall be
kept.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Such uses shall be permitted only if the rear yard in which the
home would operate meets the minimum requirements of this section and is
enclosed with a suitable fence.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Such uses are located in the dwelling used by the operator as
his or her private residence.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â No assistant other than a member of the family household is
employed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â No advertising or identification sign shall be placed on the

Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Group homes for mentally or physically handicapped, under the
following restrictions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Any such group home shall not be located within a 1,000 foot
radius of another such group home in any specific single-family dwelling
neighborhood. An affidavit signed by the owner/operator certifying that the
home will be in compliance of this regulation will be filed with the building
permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The exterior appearance of the home and property shall be in
reasonable conformance with the general neighborhood standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Home occupations which are compatible with the residential character
of the neighborhood will be permitted, however, in order to promote peace,
quiet, and freedom from excessive noise, excessive traffic, nuisance, fire
hazard, and other possible effects of commercial uses being conducted in
residential areas, all home occupations must meet the following restrictions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A home occupation shall be incidental to the use of a dwelling
unit for residential uses. No person shall be directly involved with or work in
the home occupation unless the dwelling unit is that person's primary
residence. If the home occupation employs persons to work at other locations,
the dwelling unit shall not be used as an assembly point for any employees who
may work at sites outside the dwelling. No more than one person who does not
make the primary residence their home may work at the In-home occupation
location.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â No alteration of the residential appearance of the premises
shall be made, including the creation of a separate entrance to the dwelling or
utilization of an existing entrance exclusively for the business.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â No more than 20 percent of the total floor area of the primary
structure, including the floor area of any attached, or authorized detached
garage, shall be devoted to the use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The use shall be conducted entirely within the principal
structure, including any attached garage or authorized detached garage, and no
stock in trade shall be displayed or visible outside, or stored outside the
structure, nor shall any raw materials, tools, appliances, or waste products be
stored outside of the structure. Home Occupations may not be conducted in or
otherwise utilize a detached garage or accessory structure unless the detached
garage is the only garage for the primary residence. The purpose of this
restriction is to avoid and/or prevent the construction or use of a detached
accessory building for purposes of a business operation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â In the event a home occupation utilizes any portion of a garage,
the use of said garage shall not result in vehicles not being able to be stored
inside said garage by 6:00 p.m. on each and every day. A garage commonly
defined as a single stall garage shall be able to hold one car, a garage
commonly defined as a two car garage shall be able to hold two cars, etc. The
determination as to whether an attached garage is a single, two car, or
greater, garage shall be made at the sole discretion of the City Council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Signs may be used for identification or advertisement of the
home occupation, but such signs must be located within four feet of the front
surface of the primary structure, measured from the front of the structure to
the furthest edge of said sign, may not be larger than four square feet, each
side, and may not be illuminated.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â The sale of stocks of merchandise, supplies, or products may not
be conducted on the premises except for the sale of such items that were
previously ordered by telephone or at a sales party or if the sale of said
items is ancillary to the primary service offered by the home occupation. The
direct sales of products off display shelves or racks is not allowed, but a
person may pick up an order placed earlier as described above or buy a product
related to the service they have received.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â The use shall not generate traffic in volumes greater than would
normally be expected in a residential neighborhood. For purposes of this
section, the normal volume of traffic generated by a single family dwelling
shall be defined as 12 vehicle trips to and/or from the dwelling unit per 24-
hour period. The use shall not use commercial or business vehicles to deliver
finished products from the dwelling unit. All parking necessarily generated by
the use shall be off the street.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â The use shall not produce noise, obnoxious odors, vibrations,
glare, fumes, or electrical interference detectable to normal sensory
perception outside the structure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â No toxic, explosive, flammable, combustible, corrosive,
radioactive, or other restricted materials may be used or stored on the site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â All persons desiring to have a home occupation must first
submit an application, on a form provided by the City, to the City Clerk's
Office detailing how the dwelling will be used or altered to accommodate the
home occupation with an application fee of $25.00. A copy of the in-home
occupation's Iowa sales tax permit shall be attached to the application unless
the in-home occupation is exempt from collecting sales tax under the laws and
regulations of the State of Iowa in which event the applicant shall provide
evidence of the exemption. Applications and fees, if applicable, shall be
submitted and a permit granted prior to the commencement of the in-home
occupation. The City will issue or deny an application within two weeks of the
receipt of the application. Permits shall be renewed every two years. A fee in
the amount of $10.00 will be assessed with every renewal application. The City
shall be permitted access to any in-home occupation upon reasonable request to
inspect the premises for compliance with this and any other applicable City
ordinance. Denial of a request for access shall be grounds for the suspension
or revocation of an in-home occupation permit. If an in-home occupation is
found to be in violation of these rules it may be immediately ordered to cease
operations, any signage immediately ordered to be taken down, and civil
penalties pursued in the discretion of the City. The City Council may modify
the application and/or renewal fee by resolution.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (12)Â Â Â The production/construction of handmade craft items at a
residential property shall not require the receipt of an in-home occupation
permit under this chapter, unless the property owner wishes to utilize a yard
sign to notify the public of the availability of said craft items for sale,
which would be subject to Subparagraph (6) of these provisions, or if the
activity creates a notable increase in traffic to the property, which shall in
no case exceed the traffic permitted by Subparagraph (8) hereof. Whether or not
a permit is deemed to be necessary, the display of craft items on a residential
property shall be limited to no more than three items at any one given time
which must be displayed within five feet of the home's foundation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (13)Â Â Â Businesses operated wholly within a residence, and accessory
building where permitted, that do not display a sign, on the home or in the
yard of the property, that in any way advertises the existence of the business
to the public, and where there is little to no traffic to the property that is
directly associated with the business, are exempt from the application and
permitting process set out herein. Those exempt businesses shall, however, be
subject to and required to follow all other terms of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (14)Â Â Â The City Administrator shall have the authority to determine
whether or not a property owner shall be required to hold a permit and/or is
otherwise in compliance with the terms of this chapter. An aggrieved property
owner may request a review of the Administrator's decision with the City
Council.
Any home occupation which does not comply with the above restrictions shall be
brought into compliance within 30 days of the notice of the deficiency. It is
unlawful to fail to comply with the above restrictions after notice.
Â Â Â Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Public police and fire stations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Public administrative buildings.

curriculum equivalent to that of a public elementary or high school, and
institutions of higher learning including gymnasiums, stadiums, and dormitories
if located on the campus. Before any building or structure shall be hereafter
constructed on a campus of an institution of higher learning, a development
plan of the campus shall be submitted to the Commission, and after a public
hearing, such Commission shall report its recommendations to the Council. If
the Council shall approve the development plan by ordinance, such plan shall be
filed with the permanent records of the City. The development plan shall show
existing and future building, parking areas, streets and drives, athletic
facilities, and other features which may affect surrounding property or the
public interest. The Zoning Administrator shall determine, or cause to be

commercial area shall serve a similar function as a general commercial area.
Highway commercial areas may be large, may tend to expand across streets, and
may be created in small incremental additions. Individual commercial centers
and uses within highway commercial areas should be tied together by prominent
common features such as a tree type, roofing material and style, and
architectural theme. A highway commercial area should range in size from five
to 50 acres. Highway commercial areas should be located at the intersection of
either two arterial or major collector streets. Primary access should not be
taken off local residential streets.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â All exterior storage areas shall be enclosed by a permanent
screen at least eight feet in height above the ground surface of the storage
area. Required screening shall be constructed in such a manner and with such
materials as may be approved by the Commission. In the event that an eight-foot
screen is inadequate to screen such an area, the Commission may require
additional screening in such a manner and of such materials as may be
reasonably necessary to adequately screen such from public view. However, in no
event shall the screen exceed 12 feet in height, except for landscape
materials. In no event shall the stored or stacked materials or finished
products exceed the height of the required screening. The required screening
shall have an opacity of at least 80 percent year around, and if landscaping is
used, the 80 percent opacity shall be achieved within four full growing
seasons. When a solid wall, or any solid fence is used for screening,
ornamental landscaping shall be placed between the fence and the adjacent
property lines.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Exterior storage areas shall have a permanently dust-free
surface.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â No exterior storage of materials or finished products on
property subject to this section is permitted except pursuant to and in
compliance with a screening plan approved by the Commission. Said plan shall
state location of buildings, proposed storage areas and proposed screening,
setback dimensions from property lines, elevations of proposed screening
including building materials; and shall state colors, height, and any other
information the Commission may require.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The required screening shall be maintained in good order and not
allowed to exist in a state of disrepair or death. If wood fencing is used, it
shall be durable in nature or treated to prevent rapid deterioration. Failure
to maintain the required screening shall be considered a violation of this
chapter.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Storm Water Standards. Storm water standards will be as outlined in

specifically provided for in the foregoing enumeration, such as parking space
as the Zoning Administrator shall determine necessary, considering all the
parking-generating factors involved, but not less than five spaces.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Mixed Uses. In mixed uses, the parking facilities required shall be the
sum of the requirements for the various individual uses, computed separately in
accordance with this section. Parking facilities for one use shall not be
considered as providing the required parking facilities for any other use.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Location of Facilities. Except as otherwise provided in this section,
off-street automobile parking facilities required by this section may be
located either on the premises of the parking generator or within 500 feet.

Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Improvement of Parking Areas. All open parking areas shall have:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Grades or Drainage. Parking areas shall be designed to assure
positive drainage, but shall not exceed a slope of 10 percent, provided that

parking spaces may be designed to a slope of up to 15 percent, if accompanied
by appropriate landing grades and vertical curves at points of transition.
Storm drainage control and facilities shall be designed to satisfy requirements
should the City Engineer identify a storm drainage problem.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Access: Approaches, Driveways, and Parking Areas. All driveway
approaches, driveways, and required parking areas associated with all newly

following provisions and exceptions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Residential Drives shall have a minimum width of 12 feet at the

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â All approaches, driveways, and parking areas that are
constructed of permanent dust free pavement, which shall be deemed to include
Portland concrete cement, asphalt, and sealcoat, at the approval of this
chapter shall be maintained as permanent dust free pavement as must all
extensions and additions thereto unless said approach, driveway, and/or parking
area is permanently abandoned and returned to green space or utilized for a new
legally permitted structure or structure addition. With regard to approaches,
they may only be paved with Portland concrete cement, not asphalt of sealcoat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Industrial zoned properties shall not be required to install
permanent dust free pavement on, over, and/or across loading areas, outside

commercial, and industrial structures that exist at the passage of this Code of
Ordinances shall be considered grandfathered and not required to comply with
the above requirements. The intent of this provision is to grandfather existing
approaches, driveways, and parking areas, not to grandfather property. New
approaches, driveways, and parking areas, including the extension of existing
approaches, driveways, and parking areas, to existing properties would be
required to comply with the pavement requirements set forth previously herein
for new properties. The Council may require paved approaches as part of any
street repair or reconstruction project.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Curb islands or wheel stops may be installed for drainage

family dwellings in Districts R-1 and R-2 shall not be required to comply with
the provisions of Subparagraphs A, B(9) and C of this subsection.
165.42 NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â General. A nonconforming building or structure existing at the time of
adoption of this Ordinance may be continued, maintained, and repaired, except
as otherwise provided in this section. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent
the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition any part of any building or
structure declared unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public
safety, upon order of such official. Within the Districts established by this
chapter, or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures,
buildings, and uses of land which were lawful before this chapter was passed or
amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the
terms of this chapter or future amendments.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to
continue until they are removed or abandoned, but not to encourage their
survival. It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall
not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding
other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same District.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building
on which construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of the Zoning Ordinance and upon which substantial
improvements have been made.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Any use in existence at the time of adoption of this Zoning
Ordinance which was not an authorized nonconforming use under the previous
zoning ordinance shall not be authorized to continue as a non-conforming use
pursuant to this chapter, or amendments thereto.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Alteration or Enlargement of Building and Structures. A nonconforming
building or structure shall not be added to or enlarged in any manner, whether
said additions or enlargements are attached or detached, if said building or
structure is located partially outside the boundaries of the owner's property
unless said building or structure including additions and enlargements, is made
to conform to all the regulations of the District in which it is located.
However, if said building or structure is conforming as to its use, but
nonconforming as to yard, height, off-street parking or other requirement of
the Code, and said building or structure is located wholly within the bounds of
owner's property, said building or structure may, notwithstanding the
provisions of
165.42(1)(A), be enlarged or added to provided that the enlargement or addition
complies with the yard, height, and off-street parking and/or other
requirements of the Code, of the District in which said building or structure
is located, 165.42(1)(A) being interpreted to allow enlargements or additions
to nonconforming structures so long as said enlargements or additions, if
looked at independently from the nonconforming structure, meet yard, height,
and off-street parking and/or other requirements of the Code, of the District
in which said building or structure is located. No nonconforming building or
structure shall be moved in whole or in part to another location on the lot
unless every portion of said building or structure is made to conform to all of
the regulations of the District in which it is located. No nonconforming
building or structure shall be moved in whole or in part to another location on
the lot unless every portion of said building or structure is made to conform
to all of the regulations of the District in which it is located.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Building Vacancy. A building or structure or portion thereof, which is
nonconforming as to use, which is or hereafter becomes vacant and remains
unoccupied for a continuous period of six months shall not thereafter be
occupied except by a use which conforms to the use regulations of the District
in which is located.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Destruction of Nonconforming Building or Structure. Any nonconforming
building or structure which has been damaged by fire, flood, explosions,
earthquake, war, riot, or any other act of God, may be reconstructed and used
as before if it can be done within 12 months of such calamity, unless damaged
more than 50 percent of fair market value, as determined by the Board of
Adjustment, at the time of the damage, in which case reconstruction shall be in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Nonconforming Use of Structures. No existing structure devoted to a use
not permitted by this chapter in the District in which it is located shall be
enlarged, extended, reconstructed, or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the District in which it is
located. If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, building, and premises may be changed to another nonconforming use
of the same or a more restricted classification. Pre-existing uses or
structures which are or become nuisances shall be subject to the powers of the
City to abate nuisance. Any use which has been permitted as a conditional use
or variance shall be considered a nonconforming use.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Nonconforming Mobile Homes. No nonconforming mobile home may be
replaced with another mobile home.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Swimming Pool Fences. The lawful use of a swimming pool existing at the
effective date of this chapter may be continued, provided that 12 months after
the effective date of this chapter all nonconforming pools shall conform to
Section
165.13(5).
165.43 NONCONFORMING USE OF LAND.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â General. No existing nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased,
moved, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Cessation of Use. If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any
reason for a period of more than one year, any subsequent use of such land
shall conform to the regulation specified by this chapter for the district in
which such land is located, subject to the following exception.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any nonconforming use of land, that would be an allowable use under
the A-1 zoning classification identified elsewhere in this ordinance, that
ceases, for any reason, for a period of at least 10 consecutive years shall,
thereafter, conform to the regulation specified by this ordinance for the
district in which such land is located. Landowners to whom this exception
applies shall be allowed up to four head of livestock per acre taking into
account the available ground cover.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The above exception shall only be applicable to landowners with at
least 10 contiguous acres of non-conforming A-1 use land located within the
City limits. Any parcel of ground less than 10 acres shall be subject to
Subsection 2 of this section and the exception set forth in Paragraph A shall
not apply.

Map fixing the several districts, accompanying and made a part of this chapter,
where the street layout actually on the ground varies from the street layout on
the aforementioned Zoning District Map.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Waive or reduce the parking and loading requirements in any of
the districts whenever the character use of the building is such as to make
unnecessary the full provision of parking or loading facilities, or where such
regulations would impose an unreasonable hardship upon the use of the lot, as
contrasted with merely granting and advantage or a convenience.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The Board shall have the authority to grant the following
variances:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Permit a variance from the yard requirements of any district
where there are unusual and practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in
the carrying out of these provisions due to an irregular shape of the lot,
topographical or other conditions, provided such variance will not seriously
affect any adjoining property or the general welfare.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Authorize upon appeal, whenever a property owner can show that
a strict application of the terms of this chapter relating to the use,
construction or alterations or buildings or structures or the use of land will
impose upon him unusual and practical difficulties or particular hardship, such
variances from the strict application of the terms of this chapter as are in
harmony with its general purpose and intent, but only when the Board is
satisfied that a granting of such variance will not merely serve as a
convenience to the applicant but will alleviate some demonstrable and unusual
hardship or difficulty so great as to warrant a variation from the regulations
as established by this section, and at the same time, the surrounding property
will be properly protected.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Grant or deny an application for a conditional use. In
considering all appeals and all proposed exceptions to this Ordinance the Board
shall, before making any exceptions from the section in a specific case, first
determine that the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood
heights, that it will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to
adjacent property or unreasonably increase the congestion in public streets, or
increase the danger of fire or endanger the public safety, or unreasonably
diminish or impair established property values within the surrounding area, or
welfare of the inhabitants of the City. The concurring vote of four members of
the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or
determination of the Zoning Administrator, or to decide in favor of the
applicant any matter upon which it is authorized by this chapter to render a
decision. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to give or grant to the
Board the power or authority to alter or change the Zoning Ordinance or the
Zoning District Map, except as specifically provided for herein, such power and
authority being reserved to the City Council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Variances from Floodplain Regulations. The Board of Adjustment may
authorize upon request in specific cases such variances from the terms of the
floodplain regulations that will not be contrary to the public interest, where
owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the floodplain regulations
will result in unnecessary hardship.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good
and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance
would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a
determination that the granting of the variance will not result in increased
flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public
expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or
conflict with existing local codes or ordinances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the 100-year flood would result.
Consideration of the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based
upon the assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for
similarly situated lands.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this section, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance
coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval
of the Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal, conditional
use or variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an appeal, the Board
may, so long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this
section, reverse or affirm wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in
writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision.
In granting a conditional use or variance, the Board shall consider such
factors as contained in this section and all other relevant sections of this
section and may prescribe such conditions as contained in Paragraph (4) below.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â In passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall
consider all relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights
or velocities caused by encroachments.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the
ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary
conditions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â The importance of the service provided by the proposed
facility to the City.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â The availability of alternate locations not subject to
flooding for the proposed use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â h.Â Â Â The compatibility of the proposed use with existing
development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â i.Â Â Â The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for the area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â j.Â Â Â The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â k.Â Â Â The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â l.Â Â Â The cost of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer,
gas, electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and bridges.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â m.Â Â Â Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Upon consideration of the factors listed above, the Board of
Adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems
necessary to further the purpose of this section. Such conditions may include,
but not necessarily be limited to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Limitation on periods of use and operation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed
restrictions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Floodproofing measures designed to be consistent with the
flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities,
durations, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors
associated with the regulatory flood. The Board of Adjustment shall require
that the applicant submit a plan or document certified by a registered
professional engineer that the floodproofing measures are consistent with the
regulatory flood protection elevation and associated flood factors for the
particular area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Notice. The Board shall make no finding except in a specific case
and after public hearing conducted by the Board. A notice of the time and place
of such public hearing or action shall be published in a publication of general
circulation in the City at least four days but not more than 20 days before the
date of the hearing or other official action. Such notice shall contain the
address or location of the property for which the variation or other ruling by
the Board is sought, as well as a brief description of the nature of the
appeal.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Petition for Certiorari. Any person or persons jointly or severally
aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Adjustment under the provisions of
this chapter, or any taxpayer, or any officer, department, board, or bureau of
the municipality, may present to a court of record a petition duly verified,
setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying
the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court
within 30 days after the filing of the decision in the office of the Board.
Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Writ Restraining Order. Upon the presentation of such petition, the
court may allow a writ of certiorari directed to the Board of Adjustment to
review such decision of the Board of Adjustment and shall prescribe therein the
time within which a return thereto must be made and served upon the realtor's
attorney, which shall not be less than 10 days and may be extended by the
court. The allowance of the writ shall not stay proceedings upon the decision
appealed from, but court may, on application, on notice to the Board and on due
cause shown, grant a restraining order.
Â Â Â Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Return. The Board of Adjustment shall not be required to return the
original papers acted upon by it, but it shall be sufficient to return sworn
copies thereof or of such portions thereof as may be called for by such writ.
The return shall concisely set forth such other facts as may be pertinent and
material to show the grounds of the decision appealed from and shall be
verified.
Â Â Â Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Conditional Uses. Requests for Conditional Uses shall be submitted
to the Administrator, who shall forward such to the Board of Adjustment for
consideration. Such requests shall include information ordinarily submitted
with applications as well as any additional information deemed necessary by the
Board of Adjustment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Further Requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The Board of Adjustment shall make a finding that the reasons
set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance, and that the
variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of
the land, building, or structure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The Board of Adjustment shall further make a finding that the
granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of this chapter, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise
detrimental to the public welfare.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter.
Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this
chapter and punishable under Section
165.47.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Under no circumstances shall the Board of Adjustment grant a
variance to allow for use not permissible under the terms of this chapter in
the District involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the
terms of this chapter in the District.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â If a variance is sought to permit building within four feet of a
property line, the request must be accompanied by a survey prepared by a
surveyor registered to practice in the State of Iowa. No portion of a structure
may extend (overhang) the property line.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Appeals. Any person or persons, or any board, taxpayer, department,
board or bureau of the City aggrieved by any decision of the Board of
Adjustment may seek review by a court of record of such decision, in the manner
provided by the laws of the State and particularly by the Code of Iowa.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Use Exception and Other Powers of the Board.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Purpose. The development and administration of this chapter is based
upon the division of the City into Zoning Districts, within which Districts the
use of land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures
in relation to the land are substantially uniform. Certain uses which have
unique characteristics or do not fall within the allowed uses for the various
Zoning Districts may be considered for use exceptions provided consideration of
public issues and impacts on neighboring land is considered. Such use
exceptions fall into two categories:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public
interest.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Private uses of an unusual nature that may or may not impact
neighboring property or public facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A use exception may not be utilized to circumvent the rezoning of
property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Initiation of Use Exceptions. Any person having a freehold interest
in land, a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, or a
contractual interest which may become a freehold interest of an exclusive
possessory interest, either of which is specifically enforceable, may file an
application to use such land for one or more of the special exceptions provided
for in this chapter in the Zoning District in which the land is located.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Application for Special Exception. An application for a special
exception shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator on a form as the Zoning
Administrator shall prescribe. The application shall be accompanied by such
plans and/or date prescribed by the Board of Adjustment and shall include a
statement indicating the section of this chapter under which the special
exception is sought and stating the grounds on which it is requested.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Hearing on Application. Upon receipt in proper form of the
application and statement for a use exception, the Board of Adjustment shall
hold at least one public hearing on the proposed special exception. Notice of
time and place of such hearing shall be published not less than seven days or
more than 20 days before that date of the public hearing in a newspaper of
general circulation in the City and shall be given by ordinary mail to all
property owners within 200 feet. Before an appeal is filed with the Board of
Adjustment, the appellant shall pay to the City the sum of $50.00 to cover
administration costs of said appeal plus publishing costs.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Authorization. For each application for a special exception the
Zoning Administrator shall prepare and file with the Board of Adjustment
finding and recommendations, including the recommended stipulations of
additional conditions and guarantees that are deemed necessary for the
protection of the public interest.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Standards. No special exception shall be granted by the Board of
Adjustment unless such Board shall find:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the special
exception will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety,
morals, comfort, or general welfare.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The special exception will not be injurious to the use and
enjoyment of other property already permitted, nor substantially diminish and
impair property values within the neighborhood.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The establishment of special exceptions will not impede the
normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for
uses permitted in the District.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary
facilities have been or are being provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress
and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â The special exception shall, in all other respects, conform to
the applicable regulations of the District in which it is located, except as
such regulations may, in each instance, be modified by the Board of Adjustment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Conditions and Guarantees. Prior to the granting of any special use,
the Board of Adjustment shall stipulate such conditions and restrictions upon
the establishment, location, construction, maintenance, and operation of the
special exception as is deemed necessary for the protection of the public
interest and to secure compliance with the standards and requirements specified
in Subsection (G) above. In all cases in which special exceptions are granted,
the Board of Adjustment shall require such evidence and guarantees as it may
deem necessary as proof that the conditions stipulated in connection therewith
are being and will be complied with.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Denial and Revocation of Special Exception.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Denial of Special Exception. No application for a special exception
that has been denied wholly or in part by the Board of Adjustment shall be
resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of denial, except on the
grounds of new evidence or proof of change of conditions found to be valid by
the Board of Adjustment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Revocation of a Special Exception. In any case where special
exception has not been established within one year after the date of granting
thereof, then, without further action by the Board of Adjustment the use on
review or authorization shall be null and void.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Other Powers of the Board of Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment is
hereby vested with the following additional authority and jurisdiction:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Interpretation of District Map. Where the application of the rules
for interpretation of District boundaries contained in Section 165.09 leaves a
reasonable doubt to the boundary between two Zoning Districts, the Board of
Adjustment, after notice to the owners of the property and after public
hearing, shall interpret the Map in such a way as to carry out the intent and
purpose of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Temporary Uses and Permits. The Board of Adjustment may issue a
permit for the temporary use of a building or premises in any District for a
purpose or use that does not conform to the regulations prescribed by this
chapter, provided that such use be of a true temporary nature and does not
involve the erection of substantial buildings. Such permit shall be granted in
the form of a temporary and revocable permit for not more than a 12-month
period, subject to such conditions as will safeguard the public health, safety,
convenience, and general welfare.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Exercise the powers and duties of the Airport Board of Adjustment

Â Â Â It is unlawful for a person to keep livestock within the City, except in
compliance with this chapter.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the keeping of domestic
chickens (members of the subspecies of Gallus gallus domesticus) shall be
permitted on single-family residences and zero-lot line duplexes (where each
unit owner owns a separate and distinct portion of the lot), so long as such
keeping is in strict compliance with this subsection and all other applicable
City ordinances unless, despite compliance with the following, the presence of
any particular chickens endangers the health, safety, peace, quiet, comfort,
enjoyment of, or otherwise becomes a public nuisance to nearby residents or
occupants or places of business. Property owners of properties that are not
zoned or utilized as single-family residences or zero-lot line duplexes may be
permitted to keep domestic chickens as outlined within the body of this chapter

the right, in their sole discretion, to deny any such application or to impose
such additional restrictions and guidelines deemed appropriate.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â No person shall keep chickens inside a single family dwelling unit,
multi-family dwelling units, rental units, or other approved structures.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â A tenant must obtain the landlord's written permission to keep
chickens, which shall be submitted as part of the application for a permit.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Chickens must be confined in a coop or fowl house not less than 18
inches in height or, in the alternative, within a fenced pen area. Chickens

times unless removed for a temporary time for cleaning or for the safety of the
chicken. Chickens must be housed in the coop from dusk until dawn.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â The coop, the fowl house, or the fenced pen area shall be located in
the rear yard (as defined in Section
165.06) only, must be of such a design to be reasonably expected to prevent
entry by dogs, cats, or other animals, shall be completely enclosed (except
fenced pen area), shall be well maintained, and shall be well drained so there
is no accumulation of moisture.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The materials used in making a coop or fowl house (stationary or
mobile) shall be uniform for each element of the structure such that the walls
are made of the same material, the roof has the same shingles or other
covering, and any windows or openings are constructed using the same materials.

and double-bagged in plastic bags or, in the alternative, used as fertilizer on
the same property or, with the owner's permission, on other property within the
City, so long as the droppings and body excretions are spread and incorporated
into the soil within 24 hours.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Odors from chickens, chicken manure, or other chicken related
substances shall not be perceptible beyond the boundaries of the permitted
tract of land. Noise from chickens shall not disturb persons on adjoining
properties or beyond based on an objective or reasonable person standard.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â All chicken feed shall be stored in rodent-proof containers.
Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â No more than six chickens shall be kept or maintained per property,
absent special approval of the City Council.
Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â All chickens shall have wings clipped so as to eliminate the
possibility of flight from the permittee's property.
Â Â Â 13.Â Â Â All such chickens must be hens; no roosters are permitted.
Â Â Â 14.Â Â Â All chickens covered by a permit shall be banded in accordance with
procedures and requirements established by the City.
Â Â Â 15.Â Â Â The City shall not be liable for injury or death of chickens caused by
dogs, cats, or other animals, domestic or wild. Further, injury or death of a
chicken caused by an animal is not, in and of itself, sufficient grounds for
the City to determine that the animal is a vicious animal pursuant to
Chapter 56 of this Code of Ordinances. Any dead chicken, not caused by
slaughtering, shall be disposed of immediately upon discovery in a manner so as
not to cause a nuisance pursuant to
Chapter 50 of this Code of Ordinances.
Â Â Â 16.Â Â Â Any slaughter of chickens not regulated by State law or otherwise
forbidden or regulated shall be done only in a humane and sanitary manner and
shall not be done open to the view of any public area or adjacent property
owned by another.
Â Â Â 17.Â Â Â No person shall keep any chickens unless they possess a City permit
issued by the City Clerk.
Â Â Â 18.Â Â Â The City Clerk shall provide an application form upon request, which
shall include consent forms for landlords and owners of adjacent properties.
Â Â Â 19.Â Â Â The fees and associated costs shall be set by resolution.
Â Â Â 20.Â Â Â Permits will be granted for one year valid from January 1 through
December 31. Permits may be purchased at any time during the year but will be
valid only through December 31. Bands will be issued during the permitting
process. The permittee shall place and keep leg bands on all of his chickens
showing the permit number.
Â Â Â 21.Â Â Â The applicant shall successfully complete an approved class in raising
chickens in an urban setting prior to being issued a permit. The permitting
officer shall maintain a current list of such approved classes.
Â Â Â 22.Â Â Â Each chicken shall be banded at all times.
Â Â Â 23.Â Â Â By the granting of the permit to raise chickens and the application
thereof, the permittee authorizes that the City or its agents have the right to
go onto permittee's property any time and without prior notice for the limited
purpose of inspection of the premises to ensure that all applicable conditions
have been met.
Â Â Â 24.Â Â Â Within 30 days after the expiration of any permit, the permittee shall
apply for and secure a renewal of the permit in the manner provided for in this
chapter. Failure to renew a permit within the time herein provided shall result
in a delinquent fee, in addition to the regular permit fee, as set by the
Council. All applicants shall be furnished with permit rules and regulations at
the time the application is made. Permit rules and regulations shall be
approved by resolution of the Council.
Â Â Â 25.Â Â Â The permit is a limited license for the activity, and no vested zoning
rights arise from the permit being issued.
Â Â Â 26.Â Â Â The permit does not run with the land. Private restrictions on the use
of the property shall remain enforceable and shall supersede the permit. The
private restrictions include, but are not limited to, deed restrictions,
condominium restrictions, neighborhood association bylaws, covenants and
restrictions, and rental agreements. A permit issued to a person whose property
is subject to private restrictions that prohibit keeping of chickens is void.
Â Â Â 27.Â Â Â In the event that an applicant or permittee does not fully and
strictly comply with the requirements of this section, the application may be
denied or the permit may be revoked. If an application is denied or a permit is
revoked, the applicant or permittee shall be so informed in writing and also
informed of the right to appeal said decision.
Â Â Â 28.Â Â Â In any instance where the City Clerk has denied, revoked, suspended,
or not renewed a permit, the applicant or permit holder may appeal the Clerk's
decision to the City Administrator within 10 business days of receipt by the
applicant or holder of the permit of the notice of the decision. The applicant
or holder of the permit will be given an opportunity for a hearing. The
decision of the City Administrator or any decision by the Clerk that is not
appealed in accordance to this chapter shall be deemed final action.
Â Â Â 29.Â Â Â When an application for a permit is denied or when a permit is
revoked:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The applicant may not re-apply for a new permit for a period of one
year from the date of the denial or revocation unless the denial or revocation
is due to administrative reasons only, as determined by the City Clerk.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Any chickens shall be removed immediately.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Any coop, fowl house, fencing or other structures shall be removed
within 10 days of the date of the permit being denied or revoked.
Â Â Â 30.Â Â Â An owner or possessor of animals on property that is newly annexed has
90 days from the date of annexation to bring the property into compliance
required by this section.
Â Â Â 31.Â Â Â Any property owner possessing chickens in violation of this chapter
prior to the date the same became effective, which is an illegal nonconforming
use, shall have 30 days to meet all requirements of this section and all other
applicable provisions of this Code of Ordinances.
Â Â Â 32.Â Â Â A violation of this subsection is a simple misdemeanor or a municipal
infraction, as provided in
Chapter 4 of this Code of Ordinances.

170.04 PROCEDURE.
Â Â Â In obtaining final approval of a proposed subdivision by the Commission and
the Council, the subdivider shall submit a preliminary plat and developer's
agreement in accordance with requirements hereinafter set forth and install
improvements or provide a performance bond; provided, however, in the case of
industrial subdivisions, the procedure and time for installing improvements
shall be hereinafter specified.
170.05 REQUIREMENTS OF PRELIMINARY PLAT.
Â Â Â The subdivider shall prepare a preliminary plat in accordance with the most
recently approved preliminary plat requirement checklist located at the City
Clerk's office.
170.06 SUBMISSION OF PRELIMINARY PLAT.
Â Â Â The subdivider shall prepare a preliminary plat in accordance with the
provisions of Section 170.05 and shall file with the Clerk an application for
the tentative approval of the plat. The application shall include:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Forms and Fees. Submittal of a preliminary plat must be accompanied by
a preliminary plat checklist form pursuant to 170.05 of this Code of
Ordinances. Fees for the review of a preliminary platted subdivision will be
$50.00 per subdivision, plus an additional $20.00 per lot within said
subdivision. These fees will be due with the submittal of a subdivision
preliminary plat to an engineer appointed by the City for the review of any
plat.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Number of Plats. The subdivider shall submit preliminary plats in the
manner and quantity as directed by the Zoning Administrator.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Time of Submission. The preliminary plat shall be presented to the
Clerk for date stamping at least 15 days proper to the regular meeting of the
Commission. In the event the 15 day timeframe is not met the Commission meeting
date may be reset with any additional City expenses related thereto being
assessed against the developer or developer's agent.
170.07 REFERRAL OF PRELIMINARY PLAT.
Â Â Â The developer's engineer of record is required to submit an electronic copy
of the signed preliminary plat to the City Administrator at least 14 days
before a Commission meeting.
170.08 ACTION BY THE ENGINEER.
Â Â Â The City Engineer shall carefully examine said preliminary plat as to its
compliance with the laws and regulations of the City, the existing street
system and good engineering practices, and shall within 10 days submit the
findings to the Commission, together with the copy of the plat received.
170.09 ACTION BY THE COMMISSION ON PRELIMINARY PLAT.
Â Â Â The Commission shall, upon receiving the report of the City Engineer, as
soon as possible, but not more than 30 days thereafter, consider said report,
negotiate with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the kind and
extent of improvement to be made by the subdivider, and pass upon the
preliminary plat as originally submitted or modified. It shall then set forth
its recommendations in writing, whether of approval, modification, or
disapproval.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â In the event that substantial changes or modifications are made by the
Commission or disapproval of the plat, it shall give its reasons therefor and
it may request and cause the revised preliminary plat to be resubmitted in the
same manner as the original plat.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If approved, the Commission shall express its approval as "conditional
approval" and state the conditions of such approval, if any.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The action of the Commission shall be noted on three copies of the
preliminary plat, referenced and attached to any conditions determined. One
copy shall be returned to the subdivider and the other copies retained by the
Commission.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The conditional approval by the Commission shall not constitute final
acceptance of the addition or subdivision by the City but an authorization to
proceed with preparation of the final plat.
170.10 ACTION BY THE COUNCIL ON PRELIMINARY PLAT.
Â Â Â By the second regular meeting after approval of the preliminary plat by the
Commission or lapse of 30 days, the Council shall, by resolution, conditionally
approve or disapprove the plat. Preliminary plats may be referred back to the
Commission for further review and the Clerk shall notify the subdivider of such
action. The conditional approval by the Council shall not constitute final
acceptance of the addition or subdivision by the City, but shall be an
authorization to proceed with preparation of the final plat.
170.11 FINAL PLAT.
Â Â Â The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as
approved, and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that
portion of the approved preliminary plat which the subdivider proposes to
record and develop at the time, provided, however, that such portion conforms
to all requirements of these regulations.
170.12 REFERRAL OF FINAL PLAT.
Â Â Â The subdivider shall, within 12 months of the conditional approval of the
preliminary plat by the Commission, prepare and file 20 copies of the final
plat and other required documents with the Clerk as hereinafter set forth, and
upon failure to do so within the time specified, the conditional approval of
the preliminary plat shall be null and void unless an extension of time is
applied for and granted by the Commission. Upon receipt of the final plat and
other required documents, the Clerk shall transmit three copies of the final
plat to the Commission for its recommendations and approval.
170.13 REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINAL PLAT.
Â Â Â The subdivider shall prepare a final plat in accordance with the most
recently approved final plat requirement checklist located at the City Clerk's
office. A final plat cannot be approved until all infrastructure improvements
have been installed.
170.14 FINAL PLAT ATTACHMENTS.
Â Â Â The final plat shall have the following attached to it:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A correct description of the subdivision land.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â A statement by the proprietors and their spouses, if any, that the plat
is prepared with their free consent and in accordance with their desire, signed
and acknowledged before an officer authorized to take the acknowledgments of
deeds. The statement by the proprietors may also include a dedication to the
public of all lands within the plat that are designated for streets, alleys,
parks, open areas, school property, or other public use, if the dedication is
approved by the Council.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 354.11[1a])
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â A statement from the mortgage holders or lienholders, if any, that the
plat is prepared with their free consent and in accordance with their desire,
signed and acknowledged before an officer authorized to take the acknowledgment
of deeds. An affidavit and bond as provided for in Section 354.12 of the Code
of Iowa may be recorded in lieu of the consent of the mortgage or lienholder.
When a mortgage or lienholder consents to the subdivision, a release of
mortgage or lien shall be recorded for any areas conveyed to the City or
dedicated to the public.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 354.11[1b])
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â An opinion by an attorney-at-law who has examined the abstract of title
of the land being platted. The opinion shall state the names of the proprietors
and holders of mortgages, liens or other encumbrances on the land being platted
and shall note the encumbrances, along with any bonds securing the
encumbrances. Utility easements shall not be construed to be encumbrances for

170.17 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
Â Â Â The following general requirements shall be followed by all subdividers:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Relation to Existing Streets.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all
streets shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets,
to topographic conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their
appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such
streets.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either provide for
the continuation or appropriate projection of existing collector streets in
surrounding areas or conform to a plat for the neighborhood approved by the
Council to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions
made continuance or conformance to existing streets impracticable.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Acreage Subdivisions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where the plat submitted covers only a part of the subdivider's
plat, a sketch of the prospective future system of the unsubmitted part shall
be furnished and the street system of the part submitted shall be considered in
the light of adjustments in connection with the street system of the part not
submitted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where the parcel is subdivided into larger tracts than for building
lots such parcels shall be divided so as to allow for the opening of major
streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent minor streets.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Subdivisions showing unplatted strips or private streets controlling
access to public ways will not receive approval.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Local Streets.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Local streets shall be so planned as to discourage through traffic.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Cul-de-sac streets are permitted where topography and other
conditions justify their use. Such streets shall not be longer than 500 feet
and shall terminate with a turnaround, having an outside roadway diameter of at
least 80 feet and a street property line diameter of at least 100 feet. The
right-of-way width of the straight portion of such streets shall be a minimum
of 60 feet. The property line at the intersection of the turnaround and the
straight portion of the street shall be rounded at a radius of not less than 20
feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â In an industrial subdivision non-connecting streets to lots for
which a building permit can reasonably be anticipated to be issued within 12
months are permitted; however, upon sale of all lots in the industrial
subdivision, all streets shall comply with all provisions of this chapter.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Frontage Streets.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
arterial street, the Commission may require marginal access streets, reverse
frontage with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the
rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other treatment
as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to
afford separation of through and local traffic.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way
or limited access highway right-of-way, the Commission may require a street
approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way at a distance
suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes
in residential districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in
appropriate districts. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard
for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Half Streets. Half streets shall be prohibited except where essential
to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of these regulations, and where the Commission finds it will be
practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining
property is subdivided. Wherever a half street is adjacent to a tract to be
subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Street Geometrics.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be
avoided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse
curves on arterial and collector streets.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one
point by more than 10 degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius
adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than 200 feet for minor and
collector streets, and of such greater radii as the Commission shall determine
for special cases.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Street and Alley Widths. Right-of-way widths shall be as shown in
the City's master plan, but in no event less than 60 feet.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Intersections.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Insofar as is practical, acute angles between streets at their
intersection are to be avoided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible
at right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at less than 60
degrees.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a
radius of 10 feet, or of a greater radius where the Commission may deem it
necessary. The Commission may permit comparable cutoffs or chords in place of
rounded corners.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Street Names. Streets that are in alignment with others already
existing and named shall bear the name of the existing streets. The proposed
names of new streets shall not duplicate or sound similar to existing street
names. Street names shall be subject to the approval of the Commission.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Street Grades. Street grades, wherever feasible, shall not exceed five
percent, with due allowance for reasonable vertical curves. No street grade
shall be less than one-half of one percent.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Alleys.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts,
except that the Commission may waive this requirement where other definite and
assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading,
unloading and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The width of an alley shall be 20 feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided,
but where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit safe
vehicular movement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable,
shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead end, as
determined by the Commission.
Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â Blocks.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No block in a non-industrial subdivision may be more than 1,320 feet
or less than 500 feet in length between the centerlines of intersecting
streets, except where, in the opinion of the Commission, conditions justify a
departure from these limits.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â No block in an industrial subdivision shall be more than 2,640 feet
in length between the centerlines of intersecting streets, except where, in the
opinion of the Commission, conditions justify departure from these limits.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â In blocks over 700 feet in length, the Commission may require at or
near the middle of the block a public way or easement of not less than 10 feet
in width for use by pedestrians and/or as an easement for public utilities.
Â Â Â 12.Â Â Â Lots.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation shall be
appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development
and use contemplated.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Minimum lot dimensions and sizes shall conform to the requirements
of the Zoning Ordinance, provided:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Residential lots where not served by public sewer shall not be
less than 80 feet wide or less than 42,580 square feet in area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for
commercial and industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-
street parking facilities required by the type of use and development
contemplated.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Corner lots for residential use shall have an extra 10 feet of
width to permit appropriate building setback from and orientation to both
streets.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The subdividing of the land shall be such as to provide, by means of
a public street, each lot with satisfactory access to an existing public
street.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except
where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic
arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. A
planting screen easement of at least 10 feet and across which there shall be no
right of access, shall be provided along the line of lots abutting such a
traffic artery or other disadvantageous use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles to straight
street lines or radial to curved street lines.
Â Â Â 13.Â Â Â Building Lines. Building lines conforming with zoning standards shall
be shown on all lots within the platted area. Where the subdivided area is not
under zoning control, the Commission may require building lines in accordance
with the needs of each subdivision.
Â Â Â 14.Â Â Â Easements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lines shall be
provided for utilities where necessary and shall be at least 10 feet wide.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where a subdivision is traversed by a water course, drainage way,
channel or stream, there shall be provided a storm water easement or drainage
right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of such water course, and
further width for construction, or both, as will be adequate for the purpose.
Â Â Â 15.Â Â Â Plat Markers. Markers shall be placed at all block corners, angle
points, points of curves in streets, and at intermediate points as shall be
required by the City Engineer. The markers shall be of such material, size and
length as may be approved by the City Engineer.
170.18 IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.
Â Â Â The subdivider shall install and construct all improvements required by this
chapter. All required improvements shall be installed and constructed in
accordance with the specifications and under the supervision of the Council and
to its satisfaction.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Streets and Alleys. All streets and alleys within the platted area
which are dedicated for public use shall be brought to the grade approved by
the Council after receiving the report and recommendations of the City
Engineer.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Roadways. All residential subdivision roadways and industrial
subdivision roadways shall be surfaced with a minimum thickness of six inches
of rock or gravel, and shall be a minimum of 28 feet in width back of curb to
back of curb. The subdivider shall pay the expense of bringing the street to
grade and preparing the subgrade satisfactory to the City, including compaction
in all fill areas to 95 percent standard Proctor density and the entire cost of
any gravel or rock road shall be at the expense of the developer. The Council
may require a seal coat, asphaltic or six inches of Portland cement concrete
streets at the time the plat of the subdivision is submitted for Council
approval. The City may pay the same percentage of the cost of the installation
of a concrete or asphaltic street as the City is contributing for the then
current concrete paving being installed in established parts of the City;
however, the subdivider shall obtain the percentage of the City's contribution
in resolution form from the Council prior to the installation of said street.
The City shall share only in the expense of the street portion of the hard-
surfaced roadway and not for the expense of installing curb and gutter, even
though integral curb and gutter are required. Manufacturing and commercially
zoned subdivisions may require a greater road width and a greater thickness in
asphaltic or concrete surfacing, which shall be set by the Council on
recommendation of the City Engineer and the installation of roadways in
industrial areas shall be at the developer's own expense. The Council may at
the time of the plat approval, require subdivider to accept the subsequent
street assessments, without objection, when streets are hard-surfaced and the
same shall be binding on subsequent purchasers or owners of any part of land
being platted.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Curb and Gutter. Curb and gutter shall be required on all streets in
non-industrial subdivisions. Curb and gutter shall be required in industrial
subdivisions at such time as roadways are improved with asphaltic or six inches
of Portland cement concrete streets or such greater thickness in asphaltic or
concrete surfacing as may be required by the Council pursuant to Subsection 2
of this section. All curb and gutter shall be constructed to the grade approved
by the Council after receiving the report and recommendations of the City
Engineer.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Sidewalks. Sidewalks may be required by the Council if they are
considered necessary for the general welfare and safety of the community.
Sidewalks shall be constructed to the grade approved by the Council after
receiving the report and recommendations of the City Engineer and shall consist
of four inches of Portland cement concrete with the width to be determined by
the Council.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Water Lines. Where a public water main is reasonably accessible, the
subdivider of a non-industrial subdivision shall connect with such water main
and provide a water connection for each lot with service pipe installed to the
property line in accordance with the Standard Utilities Specifications for
Sanitary Sewer and Water Main Installation, Procedure and Supervision. Where a
public water main is reasonably accessible in an industrial subdivision, the
subdivider, prior to or contemporaneously with approval of a building permit
for improvements on an industrial subdivision lot, shall connect with such
water main and provide a water connection for each lot with service pipe
installed to the property line in accordance with the Standard Utilities
Specifications for Sanitary Sewer and Water Main Installation, Procedure and
Supervision.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Sewers.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where a public sanitary sewer is reasonably accessible, the
subdivider shall connect or provide for the connection with such sanitary sewer
and shall provide within the subdivision the sanitary sewer system required to
make the sewer accessible to each lot in the subdivision. The subdivider in an
industrial subdivision shall provide sanitary sewers to each industrial
subdivision lot prior to or contemporaneously with approval of a building
permit for improvements on an industrial subdivision lot. Sanitary sewers shall
be stubbed into each lot. Sewer systems shall be approved by the Council and
the Jones County Sanitarian and the construction subject to the supervision of
the City Engineer and the cost of inspection shall be borne by the subdivider
as a cost of the project.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where sanitary sewers are not available, other facilities, as
approved by the Council and the Jones County Sanitarian, must be provided for
the adequate disposal of sanitary wastes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Adequate provisions shall be made for the disposal of storm waters,
subject to the approval of the Council and to the supervision of the City
Engineer.
170.19 INSPECTION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Â Â Â The subdivider shall notify the City Engineer or Clerk before the
construction of each street improvement in order to facilitate the inspection
of the required improvements to ascertain that said improvements are
constructed in accordance with the approved plans, profiles and specifications.
Such notification shall be at least 24 hours in advance of the time said
improvement is installed. It is the responsibility of the subdivider to assure
that the required improvements are constructed in accordance with the standards
and specifications of each improvement. The subdivider's professional engineers
shall inspect each improvement and certify its compliance with City standards
and codes before the City Engineer recommends its acceptance by the Council.
The approving of any improvement shall not constitute acceptance of the
dedication of same by the City. Council approval by resolution is required to
effect acceptance of an improvement.
170.20 BACKFILLING REQUIREMENT.
Â Â Â All water, sewer and utility trenching shall be backfilled and compacted in
accordance with Standard Utilities Specifications for Sanitary Sewer and Water
Main Installation, Procedure, and Supervision.
170.21 TESTING.
Â Â Â Sanitary sewers for non-industrial subdivisions shall not be accepted until
the City Engineer has certified that the entire system for the subdivision has
been properly tested and has met or surpassed the minimum standards as set
forth in the Code of Ordinances. Sanitary sewers for industrial subdivisions
shall not be accepted until the City Engineer has certified that the part of
the sanitary sewer required to be installed has been properly tested and has
met or surpassed the minimum standards as set forth in this Code of Ordinances.
170.22 COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Â Â Â Before the Council will approve the final plat, all of the foregoing
improvements shall be constructed and accepted by formal resolution of the
Council. Before passage of said resolution of acceptance, the City Engineer
shall report that said improvements meet all City specifications and ordinances
or other City requirements, and the agreements between subdivider and the City.
170.23 PERFORMANCE BOND.
Â Â Â The completion requirement may be waived in whole or in part if the
subdivider will post a performance bond with the Council guaranteeing that
improvements not completed will be constructed within a period of one year from
final acceptance of the plat; but final acceptance of the plat will not
constitute final acceptance by the City of any improvements to be constructed.
Improvements will be accepted only after their construction has been completed,
and no public funds will be expended in the subdivision until such improvements
have been completed and accepted by the City.
170.24 VARIANCES.
Â Â Â Where in the case of a particular proposed subdivision, it can be shown that
strict compliance with the requirements of this chapter would result in
extraordinary hardship to the subdivider because of unusual topography or other
conditions, the Council may vary, modify or waive the requirements so that
substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured. Provided,
however, such variance, modification or waiver will not have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of this chapter. In no case shall any
variance or modification be more than minimum easing of the requirements and in
no instance shall it be in conflict with any zoning ordinance and such
variances and waivers may be granted only by the affirmative vote of three-
fourths of the members of the Council.
170.25 CHAIN SUBDIVIDING.
Â Â Â No more than two building permits for each separate tract existing as of
February 21, 1977, shall be issued unless the tract has been platted in
accordance with this chapter; except that this provision shall not limit the
number of building permits that may be issued for accessory buildings as
defined by the Zoning Ordinance or additions or improvements to a main or
accessory building already legally located upon said tract.
170.26 CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.
Â Â Â Any regulations or provisions of this chapter may be changed and amended
from time to time by the Council, provided however, that such changes or
amendments shall not become effective until after a public hearing has been
held, public notice of which shall have been published at least once, not less
than four or more than 20 days before the date of the hearing.

175.01 INTENT.
Â Â Â The Monticello Regional Airport Overlay Zone is established pursuant to the
authority conferred by the State of Iowa in Section 329.3 of the Code of Iowa.
It is hereby found that incompatible land uses and densities within the airport
boundary and the areas immediately surrounding the airport may conflict with
the best interests of the Monticello Regional Airport and the residents of the
City of Monticello and Jones County; that an obstruction has the potential for
endangering the lives and property of users of the Monticello Regional Airport
and property or occupants of land in its vicinity; that an obstruction may
affect existing and future instrument approach minimums of the Monticello
Regional Airport; and that an obstruction may reduce the size of areas
available for the landing, takeoff, and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending
to destroy or impair the utility of the Monticello Regional Airport and the
public investment therein. Accordingly, it is declared:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The facilitation of proper and logical land uses within the vicinity of
the airport and the prevention of incompatible land uses in this area are
critical to the successful development of the airport.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The creation or establishment of an obstruction has the potential of
being a public nuisance and may injure the region served by the Monticello
Regional Airport.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â It is necessary in the interest of the public health, safety, and
general welfare that the creation or establishment of obstructions that are a
hazard to air navigation be prevented.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The prevention of incompatible land uses, densities, and obstructions
should be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the
police power without compensation.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â The airport owner will take appropriate action, including the adoption
of zoning laws, to the extent reasonable, to restrict the use of land adjacent
to or in the immediate vicinity of the airport to activities and purposes
compatible with normal airport operations, including landing and takeoff of
aircraft.
It is further declared that the prevention of the creation or establishment of
hazards to air navigation, the elimination, removal, alteration or mitigation
of hazards to air navigation, or marking and lighting of obstructions are
public purposes for which a political subdivision may raise and expend public
funds and acquire land or interests in land.
175.02 PURPOSE.
Â Â Â The Monticello Regional Airport Overlay District is established in order to:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Prevent the establishment of air space obstructions in public airport
approaches and surrounding areas.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Minimize potential dangers from, and conflicts with, the use of
aircraft at the Monticello Regional Airport.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Protect the Monticello Regional Airport from encroaching incompatible
uses and densities.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Address Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 77 and all other
applicable federal and State laws regulating hazards to air navigation.

175.04 AIRPORT ZONES.
Â Â Â In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there are hereby
created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying
beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces, and
conical surfaces as they apply to Monticello Regional Airport. Such zones are
shown on the Monticello Regional Airport Zoning Map, prepared by the City, and
is made a part hereof. An area located in more than one of the following zones
is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive standard. The
various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Approach Surface Zone. The approach surface begins 200 feet from the
hard surfaced threshold where the runway is and coincides with the threshold
where the runway surface is turf.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Inner Approach Surface. The inner portion of the approach surface is
extending out from the runway end to where the Part 77 Subpart C approach
surface reaches a 100-foot height above the ground elevation.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Precision Instrument Runway Approach Zone. The inner edge of this
approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet
wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at
a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline
is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Runway Protection Zone (RPZ). An area off the runway end to enhance the
protection of people and property on the ground.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Runway Visual Approach Zone. The inner edge of this approach zone
coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 250 feet wide. The
approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet at a
horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is
the continuation of the centerline of Runway 27.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Runway Non-Precision Instrument Approach Zone. The inner edge of this
approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet
wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 2,000 feet at a
horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is
the continuation of the centerline of the Runways 9 and 15.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Runway with a Visibility Minimum as Low as Three-Fourths Mile Non-
Precision Instrument Approach Zone. The inner edge of this approach zone
coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The
approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 4,000 feet at a
horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is
the continuation of the centerline of Runway 33.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Transitional Zones. The transitional zones are the areas beneath the
transitional surfaces.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Horizontal Zone. The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of
5,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each
runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs.
The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Conical Zone. The conical zone is established as the area that
commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom
a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
175.05 AIRPORT ZONE HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.
Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure shall be erected,
altered, or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone
created by this chapter to a height in excess of the applicable height limit
herein established for such zone. Such applicable height limitations are hereby
established for each of the zones in question as follows:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Runway Visual Approach Zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot
upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface
and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the extended
centerline for Runway 27.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Runway Non-Precision Instrument Approach Zone. Slopes 20 feet outward
for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the
primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the
extended centerlines for Runways 9 and 15.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Runway with a Visibility Minimum as Low as Three-Fourths Mile Non-
Precision Instrument Approach Zone. Slopes 34 feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended centerline
for Runway 33.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Transitional Zones. Slope seven feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
the approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport
elevation which is 1,230 feet above mean sea level. In addition to the
foregoing, there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for
each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the
approach surface, and extending to where they intersect the conical surface.
Where the precision instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical
zone, there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for each
foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach
surface, and extending a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured at 90
degree angles to the extended runway centerline.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Horizontal Zone. Established at 150 feet above the airport elevation or
at a height of 982 feet above mean sea level.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Conical Zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at
the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the airport
elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation.
175.06 USE RESTRICTIONS.
Â Â Â Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no use may be made of
land or water within any zone established by this chapter in such a manner as
to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to
distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of
pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport,
create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with
the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Runway Protection Zone. Runway protection zone is a trapezoidal area
"off the end of the runway threshold established to enhance the protection of
people and property on the ground" in the event an aircraft lands or crashes
beyond the runway end. Runway protection zones underlie a portion of the
approach closest to the airport. Compatible land use within the RPZ is
generally restricted to such land uses as agricultural, golf course, and
similar uses that do not involve congregations of people or construction of
buildings or other improvements that may be obstructions. The following land
use criteria apply within the RPZ:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â While it is desirable to clear all objects from the RPZ, some uses
are permitted, provided they do not attract wildlife, are outside the Runway
OFA, and do not interfere with navigational aids. Golf courses (but not club
houses) and agricultural operations (other than forestry or livestock farms)
are expressly permitted under this provision. Automobile parking facilities,
although discouraged, may be permitted, provided the parking facilities and any
associated appurtenances, in addition to meeting all of the preceding
conditions, are located outside of the object free area extension.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Land uses prohibited from the RPZ are: residences and places of
public assembly. Churches, schools, hospitals, office buildings, shopping
centers, and other uses with similar concentrations of persons typify places of
public assembly.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Inner Approach Surface. Compatible land use within the inner approach
surface is generally restricted to such land uses as agricultural, golf course,
and similar uses that do not involve congregations of people or construction of
buildings or other improvements that may be obstructions.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Building Restriction Line. No structures, other than those approved by
the Federal Aviation Administration and the Monticello Regional Airport Board,
and which conform to the underlying zoning designation, shall be constructed
within the building restriction line (BRL).
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Exemption For Airport Operations. Use restrictions shall not apply to
necessary and incidental airport operations.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Regardless of any other provisions of this chapter, no use may be made
of land or water within the Airport Overlay District in such a manner as to do
any of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communication between the airport and aircraft.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Imitate airport lights.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Create bird strike hazards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Otherwise endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff, or
maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
175.07 NONCONFORMING USES.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Regulations Not Retroactive. The regulations prescribed in this chapter
shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or
alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the
effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, or otherwise
interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein
shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of
any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the
effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter and is diligently
pursued.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Marking and Lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this
section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby
required to permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon of such
markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Manager of the
Monticello Regional Airport to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the
vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers
and lights shall be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the
Monticello Regional Airport. Any permit granted may be conditioned to require
the owner of the structure in question to install, operate and maintain, at the
owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Alteration or Change of Nonconforming Use. No permit shall be granted
that would allow a nonconforming use or structure to become a greater hazard to
air navigation than it was on the effective date of the ordinance codified in
this chapter or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a
permit is made.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed. Whenever the Monticello
Regional Airport Board determines that a nonconforming structure has been
abandoned or more than 80 percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or
decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure to exceed
the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
175.08 VARIANCES.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure,
or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance with the
regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply to the Airport Board of
Adjustment for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance
shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation
Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air
navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such
variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or
enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief
granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard
to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with
the spirit of this chapter. Additionally, no application for variance to the
requirements of this chapter may be considered by the Airport Board of
Adjustment unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the
Monticello Regional Airport Board for advice as to the aeronautical effects of
the variance. If the Monticello Regional Airport Board does not respond to the
application within 90 days after receipt, the Airport Board of Adjustment may
act on its own to grant or deny said application. In addition, all applications
for height variance within the airport zones shall be accompanied by Federal
Aviation Administration Form 7460-1, which has been completed by the applicant
and processed by the FAA regional office.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable
to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and be reasonable in the
circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or
tree in question to install, operate, and maintain, at the owner's expense,
such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the Airport
Board of Adjustment, this condition may be modified to require the owner to
permit the Monticello Regional Airport Board at its own expense, to install,
operate, and maintain the necessary markings and lights.
175.09 CONFLICTING REGULATIONS.
Â Â Â Where there exists a conflict between any of the regulations or limitations
prescribed in this chapter and any other regulations applicable to the same
area, whether the conflict be with respect to the height of structures or
trees, and the use of land, or any other matter, the more stringent limitation
or requirements shall govern and prevail.
175.10 PERMITS/VARIANCE.
Â Â Â Except as specifically provided in Subsections 1, 2, and 3 hereunder, no
material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected
or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone hereby
created unless a permit or variance therefore shall have been applied for and
granted. Each application for a permit or variance shall indicate the purpose
for which the permit or variance is desired, with sufficient particularity to
permit or variance to be determined whether the resulting use, structure, or
tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination
is in the affirmative, the permit or variance shall be granted. No permit or
variance for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter shall be
granted unless a variance or permit has been approved in accordance with
Section
175.08 of this chapter.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical
zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 100 feet
of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land
contour, or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the
height limits prescribed for such zones.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but beyond the
inner approach surface, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure
less than 100 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree
or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach
zones.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the
Building Restriction Line, no permit shall be required for any tree or
structure less than 100 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when
such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic
features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition
zones.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Any conditions that the Federal Aviation Administration attaches to the
approval recommendation shall be adopted and administered by Monticello
Regional Airport Board.
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as
permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any
structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits
established by this chapter except as set forth in Section
175.05.
175.11 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY.

176.12 PLACEMENT OF FACILITIES AND RELATED LEASE FEES.
Â Â Â The placement and maintenance of communication towers, antennas, and
facilities on City-owned sites, such as water towers and parks, will be allowed
when the following additional requirement are met:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Water Tower or Reservoir Sites. The City's water tower and reservoir
represent a large public investment in water pressure stabilization and peak
capacity reserves. Therefore, its protection is of prime importance. As access
to the City's water storage system increases, so does potential for
contamination of the public water supply. For these reasons, the placement of
communication towers or antennas on water towers or reservoir sites will be
allowed only when the following requirements are met:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The applicant must have written approval from the City each time
access to the facility is desired. This will minimize the risk of contamination
to the water supply.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â There is sufficient room on the structure and/or the grounds to
accommodate the applicant's facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The presence of the facility will not increase the water tower or
reservoir maintenance cost to the City.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The presence of the facility will not be harmful to the health or
safety of workers maintaining the water tower or reservoir.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Parks. The presence of certain communications towers, antennas or
facilities represents a potential conflict with the purpose of certain City-
owned parks and recreational facilities. The tower shall be prohibited in
designated conservation areas. Communications towers and antennas will be
considered only the following parks after the recommendation of the Park Board
and approval of the City Council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Public parks of sufficient scale and character that are adjacent to
an existing commercial or industrial use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Commercial recreational areas and major ball fields.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Park maintenance facilities.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Fees. Fees for placing communications towers, antennas and/or
facilities on public property shall be set by City Council resolution.
176.13 ABANDONMENT.
Â Â Â In the event the use of any communications tower has been discontinued for a
period of 180 consecutive days, the tower shall be deemed to be abandoned.
Determination of the date of abandonment shall be made by the City
Administrator, who shall have the right to request documentation and/or
affidavits from the communications tower owner or operator regarding the issue
of tower usage. One hundred eighty-one days from the date of abandonment,
without reactivating or upon completion of dismantling or removal, any special
exception and/or variance approval for the tower shall automatically expire.
Upon abandonment, the owner or operator of the tower shall have an additional
90 days within which to either reactivate the use of the tower or transfer the
tower to another owner/operator who makes actual use of the tower within 90
days or to dismantle and remove the tower.
176.14 TERMINATION.
Â Â Â The City Council may terminate any lease if it is determined that any one of
the following conditions exist:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A potential use of a higher priority cannot find another adequate
location and the potential use would be incompatible with the existing use.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â A user's frequency broadcast unreasonably interferes with other uses of
higher priority, regardless of whether or not this interference was adequately
predicted in the technical analysis.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â A user violates any of the standards in this chapter or the conditions
or terms of the City' Lease Agreement.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Before taking action, the City will provide notice to the user of the
intended termination and the reasons for it and provide an opportunity for a
hearing before the City Council regarding the proposed action. This procedure
need not be followed in emergency situations.
176.15 NEW TECHNOLOGIES.
Â Â Â During the term of any lease, if technological advancements are made in the
telecommunications field which will provide the communications tower owner/
operator the opportunity to be more effective, efficient and economical through
the use of a substance or material other than those for which the lease was
originally made, the holder of the lease may petition the City Council, which,
with such requirements and limitations as it deems necessary to protect public
health, safety and welfare, may allow the use of such substances under the
terms and conditions of the lease.
176.16 HOME RULE.
Â Â Â This chapter is intended to be and shall be construed as consistent with the
reservation of local authority contained in the 25th Amendment to the Iowa
Constitution granting cities home rule powers. To such end, any limitations on
the power of the City contained herein is to be strictly construed, and the
City reserves to itself the right to exercise all the power and authority to
regulate and control its local affairs, and all ordinances and regulations of
the City shall be enforced against the holders of any lease.

maintenance bond should be 100 percent of the total street improvement cost.
177.03 SITE PLAN AND ARCHITECTURAL REQUIREMENTS.
Â Â Â It is the intent and purpose of this section to establish a procedure which
will enable the City to review certain proposed improvements to property within
specified zoning districts of the City to ensure compliance with all applicable
zoning, subdivision and design standard regulations. Site plans will be
required whenever any person proposes to place a structure or parking area
(greater than four parking spaces) for which a building permit is required,
except for one- and two-family dwellings. The City Council, with consultation
from the Planning and Zoning Commission, shall adopt an official site plan
checklist, which will be available in the Zoning Administrator's and City
Clerk's office for any interested party to review. A professional engineer (PE)
will be required to engineer a site plan for review by an engineer appointed by
the City.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Open Space, Landscaping, Parking, Site Plan and Architectural
Requirements. The requirements set forth in this section for open spaces,
landscaping, parking and architectural standards shall apply to any development
or redevelopment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Open Space Required. On each lot, except for one- and two-family
dwellings, there shall be provided open space equal to at least the minimum
required in the Zoning Ordinance for each district. Said open space shall be
unencumbered with any structure, or off-street parking or roadways and drives,
and shall be landscaped and maintained with grass, trees and shrubbery. When
the entire lot is not developed, the open space requirement shall be based in
proportion to the area of the improved portion of the lot. Each principal
structure of an apartment or office complex on same site shall be separated
from any other principal structure in the complex by an open space of not less
than 16 feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Landscaping Required. Any development, except one- and two-family
dwellings, shall provide the following minimum number and size of landscape
plantings based on the minimum required open space for the development. The
following is the minimum requirement of trees and shrubs, by number and size,
and type of ground cover. Street trees planted in public street right-of-way
subject to approval by the City shall not be counted toward fulfillment of the
minimum site requirements set forth below. Plant species to be used for
landscaping shall be acceptable to the City that are not considered a nuisance
or undesirable species, such as trees with thorns, cottonwood or cotton-bearing
poplars, elm trees prone to Dutch elm disease, box elder, and silver maple.
Existing trees and shrubs to be retained on site may be counted toward
fulfillment of the landscaping requirements. Specific types of trees may be
requested by the City, in order to create a theme, or more uniform appearance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Minimum Requirements at the Time of Planting. Two trees minimum
or one tree of the following size per 1,500 square feet of open space,
whichever is greater:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 40 percentÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 12-inch - 2-inch caliper diameter
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â BalanceÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1-inch - 1Â½-inch caliper diameter
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Evergreen trees shall not be less than six feet in height.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Minimum Requirements at the Time of Planting. Six shrubs, or one
shrub per 5,000 square feet of open space, whichever is greater.
To reduce erosion, all disturbed open space areas shall have ground cover of
grass or native vegetation that is installed as sod, or seeded, fertilized and
mulched.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Buffer Required. The following conditions shall require a buffer
which shall be a landscaped area, wall, or other structure intended to separate
and obstruct the view between two adjacent zoning districts, land uses or
properties:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Any R-3 District, all C Districts, and all M Districts which
abut any R-1, R-2 or R-4 Districts shall require a buffer as described in this
section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All M Districts which abut any R-3 and all C Districts shall
provide a buffer as required by this section; however, if the use proposed
within the M District is a use permitted in the adjoining district, the
requirement of a buffer may be waived by the City Council after a
recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Any lot for a single family or two family or row dwelling in any
Zoning District having both its front and rear lot lines abutting a public
thoroughfare (a double frontage lot) shall be buffered with a landscape buffer
adjoining the thoroughfare from which no access is planned or permitted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Any storage area, garbage storage, junk storage or loading
docks, and loading areas, in any District shall be screened from public street
view by a buffer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Buffers. Buffers required under the provisions of this section
or elsewhere in the zoning ordinance shall be accomplished by any one or
approved combination of the following methods:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Buffer Wall. A buffer wall shall not be less than six feet in
height; constructed of a permanent low maintenance material such as concrete
block, cinder block, brick, concrete, precast concrete, tile block, etc.; the
permanent low-maintenance wall shall be designed by an architect or engineer
for both structural adequacy and aesthetic quality; weather resistant wood may
be used as a substitute material if designed with adequate structural integrity
and permanency and approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City
Council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Landscape Buffer. A landscape buffer shall not be less than 25
feet in width, designed and landscaped with earth berm and predominant
plantings of evergreen type trees, shrubs and plants so as to assure year
around effectiveness; height of berm and density and height of plantings shall
be adequate to serve as a solid and unpenetrable screen. A vinyl coated chain
link fence may exist for security purposes, but is not considered a part of the
landscape screening to satisfy the intent of this requirement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Burden of Provision of Buffer. The burden of provision and
selection of the buffer shall be as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Where two different Zoning Districts, requiring a buffer
between them, are developed, the above requirement is not retroactive and a
buffer is not required. If a buffer is desired, it shall be provided by mutual
agreement between property owners. However, in the event that any or all of the
improved property is abandoned, destroyed or demolished, for the purpose of
renewal or redevelopment, that portion of such property being renewed or
redeveloped, shall be considered vacant and subject to the requirements herein.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Where one of two different Zoning Districts requiring a buffer
between them is partly developed, the developer of the vacant land shall assume
the burden, unless otherwise specified herein.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Where both Zoning Districts, requiring a buffer between them,
are vacant or undeveloped, the burden shall be assumed by the developer of the
land that is improved or developed first, except for agricultural uses and
unless otherwise specified herein.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Waiver of Buffer Requirements. Where the line between two
districts, requiring a buffer, follows a street, right-of-way, railroad,
stream, or other similar barrier, the requirement for a buffer may be waived by
the City Council, provided such waiver does not permit the exposure of
undesirable characteristics of land use to public view.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Surfacing Requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â All approaches, driveways, off-street parking and loading areas,
and access roadways where applicable, required to be paved with a permanent
dust free pavement by the zoning classification of the property and rules
related thereto set forth subsequently herein, shall be shown as being paved
within the site plan and other areas intended to be surfaced with other than
permanent dust free pavement shall also be shown. But for exceptions noted
within the specific zoning classification chapters, if any exceptions exist,
the off street parking of automobiles, vans, campers, trucks, trailers,
tractors, recreational vehicles, boats, construction equipment, and any other
mobile vehicles equipped for street and highway travel shall be on a permanent
dust free pavement as required herein and not parked or stored within the
landscaped open space area of the front yard between the building and public
street right-of-way.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All off-street parking areas and associated driveways, access
roadways and frontage roads, except driveways for single-family residences,
shall be constructed with permanent, integrally attached six-inch high curbing
or curbing of alternate height acceptable to the City (prefabricated portable
curb stops shall not be considered an acceptable alternate), and shall be so
graded and drained as to dispose of all surface water accumulation within the
area; and shall be so arranged and marked as to provide for orderly and safe
loading or unloading and parking and storage of self-propelled vehicles. The
curbing requirements may be waived if it is determined that surface drainage
can be adequately handled by other means.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The minimum thickness of pavement of the parking area shall be
as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Portland cement concrete shall have a minimum thickness of
five inches and the subgrade shall have a minimum subgrade modulus (k) of 150.
Additional thickness of Portland cement concrete may be utilized to create an
equivalent subgrade modules if the existing subgrade modulus is less than 150.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Asphaltic cement concrete shall have a minimum thickness of
five and one-half inches and the subgrade shall have a minimum CBR of five.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Additional thickness of asphaltic cement concrete may be
utilized to create an equivalent CBR if the existing CBR is less than five.
Pavement shall be designed in accordance with the Asphalt Institute's Thickness
Design Manual (MS-1).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Material utilized in the subgrade shall be well drained and
not susceptible to frost boils. The part of the parking utilized for driveways
and access roadways, shall be specifically designed to accommodate the type and
load bearing capacity of traffic anticipated.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Driveways for individual single family detached or attached
townhouse style residences on private property shall be Portland cement
concrete or asphaltic cement concrete with minimum thickness of five inches and
five and one-half inches, respectively, with a sufficiently compacted and well-
drained subgrade base and not greater than 18 feet in width of the right-of-way
(ROW).
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Landscaping, Screening and Open Space Requirements. It is desired
that all parking areas be aesthetically improved to reduce obtrusive
characteristics which are inherent to their use. Therefore, wherever practical
and except for single- and two-family detached and townhouse style residential
parking in driveways, parking areas shall be effectively screened from general
public view and contain shade trees within parking islands where multiple
aisles of parking exist. Not less than five percent of the interior parking
area shall be landscaped within parking islands as required by the Monticello
Zoning Ordinance (Chapter 165 of this Code of Ordinances).
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Off-Street Parking Access to Public Streets and Internal Traffic
Circulation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Off-street parking or loading facilities shall be designed so as
to permit entrance and exit by forward movement of the vehicle for all uses,
except single-family detached or row dwellings which shall be permitted
backward movement from a driveway. The backing or backward movement of vehicles
from a driveway, off-street parking or loading area onto a major thoroughfare,
including all thoroughfares designated as arterial streets or major collector
streets on the major streets plan shall be prohibited for all uses. Driveway
approach returns shall not extend beyond the side lot line as extended, unless
such driveway is of joint usage by the adjoining lots, and driveway approaches
at roadway not greater than 24 feet for single-family detached and townhouse
residential dwellings, and 37 feet for multi-family, nonresidential uses and
multiple building complexes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The number of ingress/egress access points to public streets
from off-street parking areas shall be in accordance with the Linn Regional
Planning Area Design Standards Manual (1998) and located to limit vehicular
conflicts, provide acceptable location of driveway accesses to public streets,
preserve proper traffic safety and, where possible, not impair movement of
vehicular traffic on public streets. The permitted number of ingress/egress
driveway approaches to public streets for an off-street parking lot shall be
dependent upon the projected future average daily traffic (ADT) for the public
street and, as possible, public street accesses shall be located in alignment
with driveway approaches gaining access to the same public street from property
on the opposite side of the street. The design of off-street parking and
loading facilities shall provide traffic circulation for the internal forward
movement of traffic within the parking lot, so designed, as not to impair
vehicular movement on public streets, or backing of vehicles from an off-street
parking or loading area to a public street.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Persons with Disabilities Parking Requirements. Provision of parking
spaces for persons with disabilities within off-street parking areas shall be
in accordance with applicable federal, State and local regulations, properly
identified with signage and provided with accessible ramps and walks in
accordance with federal and State regulations, and comply with the following

any of the Zoning Districts and for any of the uses except one- and two-family
dwellings, architectural plans for buildings shall be submitted for review and
approval by the City Council after recommendation from the Planning and Zoning
Commission. Documentation to be submitted shall include building elevations
showing the building's design and a description of structural and exterior
materials to be used, on all sides. The following standards shall be used by
the City to review architectural plans:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â All Zoning Districts (Including R-1 and R-2): Adequate
treatment or screening of negative aspects of buildings (loading docks, loading
areas, outside storage areas, garbage dumpsters and HVAC mechanical units) from
any public street and adjoining properties shall be required. Buildings shall
be designed or oriented not to expose loading docks, or loading areas to the
public.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Multiple-Family Dwellings in all Districts: Shall be designed
and constructed in a manner that is compatible with the adjoining residential
uses in the neighborhood. Multiple-family buildings with single plane walls
and/or boxy in appearance, shall not be considered acceptable unless the use of
exterior materials such as brick provides the elements necessary to enhance the
building's physical appearance and eliminate any plainness of appearance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Nonresidential Uses in R Districts: Any building used for a
permitted nonresidential use in an R District shall be designed and constructed
with architecture and use of materials compatible with the residential uses
within the neighborhood. Buildings located on a residential street in an R
District shall be residential in character, and exterior materials shall be
wood, brick, stone or vinyl siding.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â All Uses Within Any C District: Buildings within any C
District shall be designed, having as a primary element of the building
exterior: fascia glass, brick, concrete panels, textured concrete block,
architectural steel, or stone panels with all sides of any building built
consistent in design and use of materials. No wood, Masonite, visible asphaltic
exterior wall or roof material, aluminum or steel siding, non-architectural
sheet metal, non-textured concrete block, stucco or other similar materials
shall constitute a portion of any building except as a trim material, unless
the City Council, after receiving a recommendation from the Planning and Zoning
Commission, shall determine said material when used as a primary element, does
not distract from the physical appearance of the building. The architectural
design and use of materials for the construction shall be reviewed as part of
any site plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â All Uses Within the M-District: While it is not the purpose of
this section to dictate, specify, or restrict the use of building materials and
structural elements, the use of appropriate exterior materials to enhance the
appearance of a building is encouraged by the City. The exclusive use of sheet
metal as an exterior building material shall not be considered acceptable for
any facade facing public streets. The exterior material of the building's front
elevation shall be comprised of brick, concrete panels, textured concrete
block, architectural steel or stone panels, or other similar material. The
architectural design and use of materials for the construction shall be
reviewed as part of any site plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Review Guidelines. When reviewing a site plan, the Planning and
Zoning Commission and City Council shall consider the following guidelines. In
no case may these guidelines be used to attempt to replace or override the
requirements of the Monticello Zoning Ordinance. As used herein, "multiple-
family architectural design" means exterior building materials, exterior
details and texture, treatment of windows and doors, and a variety in the wall
and roof design to lessen the plainness of appearance which can be
characteristic of large residential buildings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Compatibility. Neighboring buildings should fit well together
in appearance of architectural style, materials, scale, and color, as viewed
from the street scape. This criterion shall not mean that all buildings must
look alike.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Harmony. The development shall be aesthetically pleasing from
the combination of architectural design, landscape elements, miscellaneous
structures, and the design of movement of vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Landscape Elements. The various elements of nature,
topography, buildings and other man-made objects viewed in relation to one
another.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Miscellaneous Structures. Structures, other than buildings,
visible from public ways. Examples are: monuments, antennas, sheds, shelters,
fences, and walls, transformers, drive-up facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Scale. The relationship of the size of elements to one another
and to the human figure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Screening. Structures and/or plantings that conceal an area
from view from a public way.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â Street Furniture: Man-made objects other than buildings that
are part of the streetscape. Examples are; benches, litter containers, planting
containers, sculptures vending machines and newspaper dispensers.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â h.Â Â Â Streetscape: The scene from the public street or way composed
of natural and man-made elements, including buildings, paving, plantings,
street furniture, street lamps and miscellaneous structures.

excavation shall be limited to actual needs for installation of the pipeline
and appurtenances, based on the allowable trench widths and any other controls
imposed in connection with the work. Removal operations shall be coordinated
effectively with the excavation and installation operations as will cause the
least practical disruption of traffic or inconvenience to the public. The
debris resulting from removals shall become the property of the contractor and
shall be disposed of by the contractor. Removal debris shall not be deposited
at locations that will block access to fire hydrants, private driveways, or
other essential service areas, nor obstruct surface drainage. Removal and final
disposal of debris shall be accomplished as a single operation wherever
possible and, in any event, the debris shall be removed from the site before
starting the excavating operations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Removal of concrete or bituminous structures shall be by methods
producing clean-cut breakage to pre-scored lines as will preserve the remaining
structure without damage. Removal equipment shall not be operated in a manner
that will cause damage to the remaining or adjoining property. Where not
removed to an existing joint, concrete structures shall be sawed along the
break lines to a minimum depth of one-third of the structure depth.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Any reusable materials generated during the work, such as
aggregate, sod, topsoil, shall be segregated from other waste materials and be
stockpiled so as to maintain suitability and permit proper reuse.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The use of drop weight equipment for breaking pavement will be
allowed to the extent that the contractor shall assume full responsibility for
any damages caused thereby. The pavement breaking operation shall not be
allowed to become a nuisance to the public or a source of damage to underground
or adjacent structures. The City reserves the right to order discontinuance of
drop weight breaking operations at any time.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Temporary Service Measures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â While any open excavations are maintained, the contractor shall
have available a supply of steel plates suitable for temporary bridging of open
trench sections where either vehicular or pedestrian traffic must be
maintained. Use of the plates shall be as directed or approved by the City
Superintendent and where installed they shall be secured against possible
displacement and be replaced with the permanent structure as soon as possible.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Contractor shall not be permitted to maintain at any than a open
trench greater than 500 feet in length.
Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Excavation and Preparation of Trench.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Excavating operations shall proceed only so far in advance of
pipe laying as will satisfy the needs for coordination of work and permit
advance verification of unobstructed line and grade as planned. Where
interference with existing structures is possible or in any way indicated, and
where necessary to establish elevation or direction for connections to in-place
structures, the excavating shall be done at those locations in advance of the
main operation so actual conditions will be exposed in sufficient time to make
adjustments without resorting to extra work or unnecessary delay.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All installations shall be accomplished by open trench
construction except for short tunnel sections approved by the City Engineer and
with the exception that boring and jacking or tunnel construction methods shall
be employed where so specifically required by the specifications.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The excavating operations shall be conducted so as to carefully
expose all in-place underground structures without damage. Wherever the
excavation extends under or approaches so close to an existing structure as to
endanger it in any way, precautions and protective measures shall be taken as
necessary to preserve the structure and provide temporary support. Hand methods
of excavating shall be utilized to probe for and expose such critical or
hazardous installations as gas pipe and power or communication cables.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The City Engineer shall be notified of any need for blasting to
remove materials which cannot be broken up mechanically, and there shall be no
blasting operations conducted until the City Engineer's approval has been
secured. Blasting will be allowed only when proper precautions are taken to
protect life and property, and then shall be restricted as the City Engineer
directs. The contractor shall assume full responsibility for any damages caused
by blasting, regardless of the requirements for notification and approval. The
contractor shall secure any required permits for blasting and shall conduct
blasting operations in conformance with all applicable State and local laws,
regulations and ordinances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Excavated materials will be classified for payment only to the
extent that the removal of materials by the City Engineer as rock will be paid
for separately from other unclassified materials, either as a separate contract
item or extra work item when no bid price is applicable. All other materials
encountered in the excavations, with the exception of items classified for
payment as structure removals, will be considered as unclassified excavation
and unless otherwise specified in the specifications, no additional
compensation shall be provided for their removal. Unclassified materials shall
include muck, rubble, wood debris, and boulder stone, masonry or concrete
fragments less than one cubic yard in volume, together with other miscellaneous
matter that can be removed effectively with power operated excavators without
resorting to drilling and blasting.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Rock excavation shall be defined to include all hard, solid rock
in ledge formation, bedded deposits and unstratified masses; all natural
conglomerate deposits so firmly cemented as to present all the characteristics
of solid rock; and any boulder stone, masonry or concrete fragments exceeding
one cubic yard in volume. Materials such as shale, hard pan, soft or
disintegrated rock which can be dislodged with a hand pick or removed with a
power operated excavator will not be classified as rock excavation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Excavated materials will be classified for reuse as being either
suitable or unsuitable for backfill or other specified use, subject to
selective controls. All suitable materials shall be reserved for backfill to
the extent needed, and any surplus remaining shall be utilized for other
construction on the project as may be specified or ordered by the City
Engineer. To the extent practicable, granular materials and topsoil shall be
segregated from other materials during the excavating and stockpiling
operations so as to permit best use of the available materials at the time of
backfilling.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â All excavated materials reserved for backfill or other use on
the project shall be stored at locations approved by the City Engineer that
will cause a minimum of inconvenience to public travel, adjacent properties,
and other special interests. The material shall not be deposited so close to
the edges of the excavations as would create hazardous conditions, nor shall
any material be placed so as to block the access to emergency services. All
materials considered unsuitable by the City Engineer, for any use on the
project, shall be immediately removed from the project and be disposed of as
arranged for by the contractor.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â Trench excavating shall be to a depth that will permit
preparation of the foundation as specified and installation of the pipeline and
appurtenances at the prescribed line and grade, except where alterations are
specifically authorized. Trench widths shall be sufficient to permit the pipe
to be laid and joined properly and the backfill to be placed and compacted as
specified. Extra width shall be provided as necessary to permit convenient
placement of sheeting and shoring and to accommodate placement of
appurtenances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â Excavations shall be extended below the bottom of structure as
necessary to accommodate any required granular foundation material. When rock
or unstable foundation materials are encountered at the established grade,
additional materials shall be removed as specified or ordered by the City
Engineer to produce an acceptable foundation. Unless otherwise indicated or
directed, rock shall be removed to an elevation at least six inches below the
bottom surface of the pipe barrel and below the lowest projection of joint
hubs. All excavations below grade shall be to a minimum width equal to the
outside pipe diameter plus two feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â Rock shall be removed to such additional horizontal dimensions
as will provide a minimum clearance of six inches on all sides of appurtenant
structures such as valves, housings, access structures, etc.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (12)Â Â Â Where no other grade controls are indicated or established for
the pipeline, the excavating and foundation preparations shall be such as to
provide a minimum cover over the top of the pipe as specified. Trench widths
shall allow for at least six inches of clearance on each side of the joint
hubs. The maximum allowable width of the trench at the top of pipe level shall
be the outside diameter of the pipe plus two feet, subject to the
considerations for alternate pipe loading set forth below. The width of the
trench at the ground surface shall be held to a minimum to prevent unnecessary
destruction of the surface structures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (13)Â Â Â If the trench is excavated to a greater width than that
authorized, the City Engineer may direct the contractor to provide a higher
class of bedding and/or a higher strength pipe than that required by the
specifications.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (14)Â Â Â All excavations shall be sheeted, shored, and braced as will
meet all requirements of the applicable safety codes and regulations; comply
with any specific requirements of the contract; and prevent disturbance or
settlement of adjacent surfaces, foundations, structures, utilities, and other
properties. Any damage to the work under contract or to adjacent structures or
property caused by settlement, water or earth pressures, slides, cave-ins, or
other causes due to failure or lack of sheeting, shoring, or bracing or through
negligence or fault of the contractor in any manner shall be repaired at the
contractor's expense and without delay.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (15)Â Â Â Where conditions warrant extreme care, the specifications may
require special precautions to protect life or property, or the City Engineer
may order the installation of sheet piling of the interlocking type or direct
that other safety measures be taken as deemed necessary. Failure of the City
Engineer to order correction of improper or inadequate sheeting, shoring, or
bracing shall not relieve the contractor's responsibilities for protection of
life, property, and the work.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (16)Â Â Â The contractor shall assume full responsibility for proper and
adequate placement of sheeting, shoring, and bracing, wherever and to such
depths that soil stability may dictate the need for support to prevent
displacement. Bracing shall be so arranged as to provide ample working space
and so as not to place stress or strain on the in-place structures to any
extent that may cause damage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (17)Â Â Â Sheeting, shoring and bracing materials shall be removed only
when and in such manner as will assure adequate protection of the in-place
structures and prevent displacement of supported grounds. Sheeting and bracing
shall be left in place only as required by the specifications or ordered by the
City Engineer. Otherwise, sheeting and bracing may be removed as the
backfilling reaches the level of respective support. Wherever sheeting and
bracing is left in place, the upper portions shall be cut and removed to an
elevation of three feet or more below the established surface grade.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (18)Â Â Â All costs of furnishing, placing and removing sheeting,
shoring, and bracing materials, including the value of materials left in place
as required by the contract, shall be included in the prices bid for pipe
installation and will not be compensated for separately. When any sheeting,
shoring, or bracing materials are left in place by written order of the City
Engineer, in the absence of specific requirements of the contract to do so,
payment will be made for those materials as an extra work item, including waste
material resulting from upper cut-off requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (19)Â Â Â Foundation preparations shall be conducted as necessary to
produce a stable foundation and provide continuous and uniform pipe bearing
between bell holes. The initial excavating or backfilling operations shall
produce a subgrade level slightly above finished grade as will permit hand
shaping to finished grade by trimming of high spots and without the need for
filling of low spots to grade. Final subgrade preparations shall be such as to
produce a finished grade at the centerline of the pipe that is within 0.03-foot
of a straight line between pipe joints and to provide bell hole excavation at
each joint as will permit proper joining of pipe and fittings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (20)Â Â Â In excavations made below grade to remove rock or unstable
materials, the backfilling to grade shall be made with available suitable
materials unless placement of granular foundation or bedding material is
specified and provided for or is ordered by the City Engineer as an extra work
item. Placement of the backfill shall be in relatively uniform layers not
exceeding eight inches in loose thickness. Each layer of backfill shall be
compacted thoroughly, by hand or by means of approved mechanical compaction
equipment, as will produce uniform pipe support throughout the full pipe length
and facilitate proper shaping of the pipe bed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (21)Â Â Â Where the foundation soil is found to consist of materials that
the City Engineer considers to be so unstable as to preclude removal and
replacement to a reasonable depth to achieve solid support, a suitable
foundation shall be constructed as the City Engineer directs in the absence of
special requirements therefor in the specifications. The contractor may be
required to furnish and drive piping and construct concrete or timber bearing
supports or other work as may be provided for in an extra work order.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (22)Â Â Â Care shall be taken during final subgrade shaping to prevent
any over excavation. Should any low spots develop, they shall only be filled
with approved material, which shall have optimum moisture content and be
compacted thoroughly without additional compensation to the contractor. The
finished subgrade shall be maintained free of water and shall not be disturbed
during pipe lowering operations except as necessary to remove pipe slings. The
discharge of trench dewatering pumps shall be directed to natural drainage
channels or storm water drains. Draining trench water into sanitary sewers or
combined sewers will not be permitted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (23)Â Â Â The contractor shall install and operate a dewatering system of
wells or points to maintain pipe trenches free of water wherever necessary or
as directed by the City Engineer to meet the intent of these specifications.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (24)Â Â Â If examination by the City Engineer reveals that the need for
placement of foundation aggregate was caused by the contractor's manipulation
of the soils in the presence of excessive moisture or lack of proper
dewatering, the cost of the corrective measures shall be borne by the
contractor.
Â Â Â Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Installation of Pipe and Fittings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Proper and adequate implements, tools, and facilities shall be
provided and used by the contractor for the safe and convenient prosecution of
the work. During the process of unloading, all pipe and accessories shall be
inspected by the contractor for damage. The contractor shall notify the City
Engineer of all material found to have cracks, flaws or other defects. The City
Engineer shall inspect the damaged material and have the right to reject any
materials found to be unsatisfactory. The contractor shall promptly remove all
rejected material from the site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All materials shall be handled carefully, as will prevent damage
to protective coatings, linings, and joint fittings; preclude contamination of
interior areas; and avoid jolting contact, dropping, or dumping.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â While suspended and before being lowered into laying position,
each pipe section and appurtenant unit shall be inspected by the contractor to
detect damage or unsound conditions that may need corrective action or be cause
for rejection. The contractor shall inform the City Engineer of any defects
discovered and the City Engineer will prescribe the required corrective actions
or order rejection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Immediately before placement, the joint surfaces of each pipe
section and fitting shall be inspected for the presence of foreign matter,
coating blisters, rough edges or projections, and any imperfections so detected
shall be corrected by cleaning, trimming, or repair as needed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Trench excavation and bedding preparations shall proceed ahead
of pipe placement as will permit proper placement and joining of the pipe and
fittings at the prescribed grade and alignment without unnecessary hindrance.
All foreign matter or dirt shall be removed from the inside of the pipe and
fittings before they are lowered into position in the trench, and they shall be
kept clean by approved means during and after laying. The water main materials
shall be carefully lowered into laying position by the use of suitable
restraining devices. Under no circumstances shall the pipe be dropped or dumped
into the trench.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â At the time of pipe placement, the bedding conditions shall be
such as to provide uniform and continuous-support for the pipe between bell
holes. Bell holes shall be excavated as necessary to make the joint
connections, but they shall be no larger than would be adequate to support the
pipe throughout its length. No pipe material shall be laid in water nor when
the trench or bedding conditions are otherwise unsuitable or improper.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â When placement or handling precautions prove inadequate, in the
City Engineer's opinion, the contractor shall provide and install suitable
plugs or caps effectively closing the open ends of each pipe section before it
is lowered into laying position, and they shall remain so covered until removal
is necessary for connection of an adjoining unit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â As each length of bell and spigot pipe is placed in laying
position, the spigot end shall be centered in the bell and the pipe forced home
and brought to correct line and grade. The pipe shall be secured in place with
approved backfill material, which shall be thoroughly compacted by tamping
around the pipe to a height of at least 12 inches above its top. Acceptable
tamping techniques include hand tamping and use of hand operated mechanical
tamping devices.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â At all times when pipe laying is not in progress, including noon
hour and overnight periods, all open ends of the pipe line shall be closed by
watertight plugs or other means approved by the City Engineer. If water is
present in the trench, the seals shall remain in-place until the trench is
pumped completely dry.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â When connecting to existing stubs, the contractor shall take
every precaution necessary to prevent dirt or debris from entering the existing
lines. All necessary work to make the connection shall be done at no additional
compensation, except where noted otherwise.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â The cutting of pipe for inserting valves, fittings, or closure
pieces shall be done in a neat and workmanlike manner without damage to the
pipe and so as to leave a smooth square-cut end. Pipe shall be cut with
approved mechanical cutters. The electric-arc cutting method, using carbon or
steel rod, will be approved for use on larger size ductile or gray pipe where
mechanical cutters are not available. Flame cutting will not be allowed under
any conditions. All rough edges shall be removed from the cut ends of pipe and,
where rubber gasket joints are used, the outer edge shall be rounded or beveled
by grinding or filing to produce a smooth fit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (12)Â Â Â Wherever it is necessary to deflect ductile or gray iron pipe
from a straight line either in the vertical or horizontal plane, to avoid
obstructions, plumb stems, or produce a long radius curve when permitted, the
amount of deflection allowed at each joint shall not exceed the allowable
limits for maintaining a satisfactory joint seal as given in AWWA C-600 for
mechanical joints and push-on joints. The maximum angular deflection at any
joint for other pipe materials and joints shall not exceed the manufacturer's
recommendations. If the specified alignment requires angular deflections
greater than recommended or allowed, the contractor shall provide appropriate
bends or shorter pipes such that the maximum angular deflection is not
exceeded.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (13)Â Â Â Connection and assembly of joints shall be accomplished during
the setting, aligning, and fitting operations, in accordance with the
provisions of Section 1.2.C.3, to the extent that the jointing requirements
will permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (14)Â Â Â All plugs, caps, tees, bends, and other thrust points shall be
provided with reaction backing, or movement shall be prevented by attachment of
suitable restraining devices, in accordance with the requirements of the
specifications.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (15)Â Â Â In the absence of other specified requirements for reaction
backing or restraining devices, the following provisions shall apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â All horizontal bends exceeding 20 degrees deflection, and all
caps, plugs, and branch tees shall be provided with concrete buttress blocking.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â All vertical bends exceeding 20 degrees deflection shall be
provided with concrete buttress blocking at the low points and with metal tie
rod or strapping restraints at the high points.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (16)Â Â Â Offset bends made with standard offset fittings need not be
strapped or buttressed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (17)Â Â Â Hardwood blocking shall only be used as temporary reaction
backing until acceptable permanent reaction blocking or restraining devices
have been installed. Blocking shall be nominal two timber having an area
equivalent to at least four times the area of the surface of the cap or plug it
restrains.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (18)Â Â Â Concrete buttresses shall be poured against firm, undisturbed
ground and shall be formed in such a way that the joints will be kept free of
concrete and remain accessible for repairs. The concrete mix used in buttress
construction shall meet the requirements for Grade B of Iowa DOT Specification
2403. Buttress dimensions shall be a minimum of 12 inches in thickness, and the
minimum area, in square feet shall be as follows:
Pipe Size Tee or Plug 1/4 Bend 1/8 Bend 1/32 Bend and 1/16 Bend
Pipe Size Tee or Plug 1/4 Bend 1/8 Bend 1/32 Bend and 1/16 Bend
6"        2.9         3.1      1.6      0.8

24"       33.6        48.5     26.1     13.3
Â 
Contractors are instructed to size concrete buttress blocking on fittings and
dead ends where the blocking must withstand the pressure of larger main line
fittings equipped with reducers, for the larger sized main line thrust and not
for smaller fitting size only. This is of particular importance on tees and
crosses where the main size is reduced on the run from large to small size by
use of reducers.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (19)Â Â Â All metal parts of tie rod or strap type restraints shall be
galvanized or coated with other approved asphaltic type rustproofing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (20)Â Â Â All necessary fittings, bands, tie rods, nuts, and washers, and
all labor and excavation required for installation of reaction restraints shall
be furnished at the contractor's expense with no direct compensation provided
therefor.
Â Â Â Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Placement of Insulation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Rigid insulation board shall be placed within the pipe
encasement zone, six inches above the pipe. Prior to placement of the
insulation, encasement material shall be compacted until there is no further
visual evidence of increased consolidation or the density of the compacted
layer conforms to the density requirements specified in the special provisions,
then leveled and lightly scarified to a depth of one-half inch. Encasement zone
material placed below the insulation shall be free of rock or stone fragments
measuring one and one-half inches or greater.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Insulation boards shall be placed on the scarified material with
the long dimension parallel to the centerline of the pipe. Boards placed in a
single layer shall be overlapped at least six inches on all sides to eliminate
continuous joints for the full depth of the insulation. If two or more layers
of insulation boards are used, each layer shall be placed to cover the joints
of the layer immediately below with an overlap of at least six inches.
Â Â Â Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Connection and Assembly of Joints.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Where rubber gasketed joints are specified, care shall be taken
during the laying and setting of piping materials to insure that the units
being joined have the same nominal dimension of the spigot outside diameter and
the socket inside diameter. A special adaptor shall be provided to make the
connection when variations in nominal dimension might cause unsatisfactory
joint sealing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Immediately before making the connection, the inside of the bell
or socket and the outer surface of the spigot ends shall be thoroughly cleaned
to remove oil, grit, excess coating, and other foreign matter. Insertion of
spigot ends into the socket or bell ends shall be accomplished in a manner that
will assure proper centering and insertion to full depth. The joint seal and
securing requirements shall be as prescribed below for the applicable pipe and
joint type.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Ductile Iron Pipe Joints - Push-On Joints. The circular rubber
gasket shall be kept in a warm, flexible condition at all times, and for
purposes of placement shall be flexed inward and inserted in the gasket recess
of the bell socket. A thin film of approved gasket lubricant shall be applied
to either the inside surface of the gasket or the outside surface of the spigot
end, or to both. Care shall be taken while inserting the spigot end to prevent
introduction of contaminants. The joint shall be completed by forcing the
spigot end to the bottom of the socket by the use of suitable pry-bar or jack
type equipment. Spigot ends which do not have depth marks shall be marked
before assembly to insure full insertion. Field cut pipe shall be filed or
ground at the spigot edge to resemble the manufacturer's fabricated detailing.
The use of the bucket on the excavation equipment to force the pipe into the
socket shall not be permitted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Ductile Iron Pipe Joints - Mechanical Joints.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The last eight inches of the outside spigot surface and the
inside bell surface of each pipe and appurtenance joint shall be painted with a
soap solution, after being thoroughly cleaned. The gland shall then be slipped
on the spigot end with the lip extension toward the socket or bell end. The
rubber gasket shall be kept in a warm, flexible condition at all times, and for
purposes of placement shall be painted with soap solution and be placed on the
spigot end with the thick edge toward the gland. Approved lubricant provided by
the pipe manufacturer may be used in lieu of the soap solution.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â After the spigot end is inserted into the socket to full depth
and centered, the gasket shall be pressed into place within the bell evenly
around the entire joint. After the gland is positioned behind the gasket, all
bolts shall be installed and the nuts tightened alternately to the specified
torque, such as to produce equal pressure on all parts of the gland.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Unless otherwise specified, the bolts shall be tightened by
means of a suitable torque-limiting wrench to within a foot-pound range of: 45
to 60 for 5/8-inch bolts; 75 to 90 for 3/4-inch bolts; 85 to 100 for 1-inch
bolts; and 105 to 120 for 1-1/4-inch bolts. After tightening, all exposed parts
of the bolts and nuts shall be completely coated with an approved asphaltic
type rust preventive material.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Polyvinyl Chloride Pipe Joints. The circular rubber gasket shall
be bonded to the inner wall of the gasket recess of the bell socket.
Installation of pipe spigot into the bell socket shall conform to the
requirements for ductile iron push-on joints.
Â Â Â Â Â Â L.Â Â Â Tracer Wire.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Ten gauge solid tracer wire shall be laid in the pipe envelope
during installation of pipe.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Tracer wire shall be day lighted at each fire hydrant by using a
two-inch vertical PVC pipe with cap installed against the side of the hydrant
barrel. Wire shall be folded over, inserted in pipe, and have two-foot excess
at each location.
Â Â Â Â Â Â M.Â Â Â Water Service Installations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Water service facilities consisting of tap service lines and
branch service lines, complete with all required appurtenances, shall be
installed as required by in the specifications, in accordance with all
pertinent requirements for main line installations together with the provisions
hereof.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to keep an
accurate record of the location, depth and size of each service connection and
other pertinent data such as the location of curb stops and pipe endings. Tap
locations shall be recorded in reference to survey line stationing. Curb stops
shall be tied to definable land marks such as building corners, lot corner
markers, etc. Pipe terminals at the property line shall be marked on the ground
surface with a suitable wood timber four by four inch, six to eight feet long
driven vertically into the ground at least four feet, with the top two feet
painted blue. Approved record keeping forms will be furnished by the City
Engineer and the completed records shall be submitted by the contractor upon

if installed, at the contractor's option. However, testing of service pipes may
be completed as a separate operation from main testing, and if so, the test
pressure shall be 100 p.s.i. Service pipe testing, if done separately, shall be
done with the corporation stop open.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Leakage Test.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â After satisfactory completion of the pressure test, a leakage
test shall be performed on each valved section of water main to determine the
quantity of water that must be supplied into the section to maintain a test
pressure of 150 pounds per square inch, after the air in the pipeline has been
expelled and the pipe has been filled with water.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â After filling the pipe with water and expelling all air in the
line, the specified pressure shall be applied in the same manner as prescribed
for the pressure test, and sufficient water shall be measured and supplied into
the pipe section to maintain the pressure for a test duration of two hours.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Each pipe section tested will be accepted if the leakage does
not exceed the quantity determined by the formula given below.

NOTE: Granular foundation, bedding and encasement material provided for plastic
pipe and fittings shall meet the requirements of ASTM 2321, Class I, II or III
materials or the requirements provided above if the City Engineer authorizes
such substitution.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Granular Material Use Designations. Granular materials provided
for foundation, bedding, encasement, or backfill use as required by the
specifications, either as part of the pipe item work unit or as a separate
contract item, shall be classified as to use in accordance with the following:
Â 
Material Use Designation Zone Designation
                         Â 
                         Placed below the bottom of pipe grade as replacement
Granular Foundation      for unsuitable or unstable soils, to achieve better
                         foundation support.
                         Placed below the pipe mid-point, prior to pipe
Granular Bedding         installation, to facilitate proper shaping and to
                         achieve uniform pipe support.
                         Placed below an elevation one foot above the top of
Granular Encasement      pipe, after pipe installation, for protection of the
                         pipe and to assure proper filling of voids or thorough
                         consolidation of backfill.
                         Placed below the surface base course, if any, as the
Granular Backfill        second stage of backfill, to minimize trench
                         settlement and provide support for surface
                         improvements.
Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â In each case above, unless otherwise indicated, the lower limits
of any particular zone shall be the top surface of the next lower course as
constructed. The upper limits of each zone are established to define variable
needs for material gradation and compaction or void content, taking into
consideration the sequence of construction and other conditions. The material
use and zone designations described above shall only serve to fulfill the
objectives and shall not be construed to restrict the use of any particular
material in other zones where the gradation requirements are met.
Â Â Â Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Insulation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Main insulation shall be extruded rigid board material having a
thermal conductivity of 0.23 BTU/hour square foot/degree Fahrenheit/per inch
thickness, maximum, at 40ÂºF mean, a comprehensive strength of 35 psi minimum,
and water absorption of 0.25 percent by volume maximum.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Unless otherwise approved, board dimensions shall measure eight
feet long, two or four feet wide, and one or one and one-half inches thick.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Construction Requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Maintenance of Traffic.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Whenever work interferes with the flow of traffic along a
roadway, the contractor shall provide for traffic control and signing and
public safety in accordance with the provisions of the Iowa DOT Specifications
2528, and the Special Provisions. Neither road closures nor detours shall be
permitted unless specified in the special provisions or authorized by the City
Engineer. Where road closures or detours are permitted by the City Engineer,
the City Engineer shall determine the appropriate agencies, boards, or
departments the contractor must notify prior to taking the action and the
proper advance notice to be provided to each body.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Compliance with this requirement shall not be construed to
relieve the contractor from the responsibility of notifying agencies or
institutions whose services may be predicated upon a roadway being opened to
traffic or whose services would be hindered if a roadway is closed to traffic.
Such agencies or institutions shall include, but not be limited to, the Police
Department, the Fire Department, municipal bus service, school bus service, and
ambulance service. The contractor shall keep the required agencies informed of
changing traffic patterns and detour situations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Establishing Line and Grade.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â In locations where the sewer is in direct conflict with existing
water main and water services the water main and water services shall be
lowered to provide at least 18 inches of vertical distance between the top of
the water main or service and the bottom of the sanitary sewer or relocated in
accordance with plans.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The contractor shall be solely responsible for the correct
transfer of the primary line and grade to all working points and for
construction of the work to the prescribed lines and grades as established by
the City Engineer. Following construction of a work shaft on tunnel
installations, the line and grade shall be transferred down the shaft and be
projected into and throughout the length of each tunnel heading.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Protection of Surface Structures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â All surface structures and features located outside the
permissible excavation limits for underground installations, together with
those within the construction areas which are indicated in the plans as being
saved, shall be properly protected against damage and shall not be disturbed or
removed without approval of the City Engineer. Within the construction limits,
as required, the removal of improvements such as paving, curbing, walks, turf,
etc., shall be subject to acceptable replacement after completion of
underground work, with all expense of removal and replacement being borne by
the contractor.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Obstructions such as street signs, guard posts, small culverts,
and other items of prefabricated construction may be temporarily removed during
construction provided that essential service is maintained in a relocated
setting as approved by the City Engineer and that nonessential items are
properly stored for the duration of construction. Upon completion of the
underground work, all such items shall be replaced in their proper setting at
the sole expense of the contractor.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â In the event of damage to any surface improvements, either
privately or publicly owned, in the absence of construction necessity, the
contractor will be required to replace or repair the damaged property to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer/Wastewater Superintendent and without cost to
the owner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Interference of Underground Structures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â When any underground structure interferes with the planned
placement of the pipeline or appurtenances to such an extent that alterations
in the work are necessary to eliminate the conflict or avoid endangering
effects on either the existing or proposed facilities, the contractor shall
immediately notify the City Engineer and the owner of the affected structure.
When any existing facilities are endangered by the contractor's operations, the
contractor shall cease work at the site and take such precautions as may be
necessary to protect the in-place structures until a decision is made as to how
the conflict will be resolved.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Without specific authorization from the City Engineer, no
essential utility service shall be disrupted, nor shall any change be made in
either the existing structures or the planned installations to overcome the
interference. Alterations in existing facilities will be allowed only to the
extent that service will not be curtailed unavoidably and then only when the
encroachment or relocation will satisfy all applicable regulations and
conditions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Removal of Surface Improvements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Removal of surface improvements in connection with trench
excavation shall be limited to actual needs for installation of the pipeline
and appurtenances, based on the allowable trench widths and any other controls
imposed in connection with the work. Removal operations shall be coordinated
effectively with the excavation and installation operations as will cause the
least practical disruption of traffic or inconvenience to the public. The
debris resulting from removals shall become the property of the contractor and
shall be disposed of by the contractor. Removal debris shall not be deposited
at locations that will block access to fire hydrants, private driveways, or
other essential service areas, nor obstruct surface drainage. Removal and final
disposal of debris shall be accomplished as a single operation wherever
possible and, in any event, the debris shall be removed from the site before
starting the excavating operations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Removal of concrete or bituminous structures shall be by methods
producing clean-cut breakage to pre-scored lines as will preserve the remaining
structure without damage. Removal equipment shall not be operated in a manner
that will cause damage to the remaining structure or adjoining property. Where
not removed to an existing joint, concrete structures shall be sawed along the
break lines to a minimum depth of one-third of the structure depth.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Any reusable materials generated during the work, such as
aggregate, sod, or topsoil, shall be segregated from other waste materials and
be stockpiled so as to maintain suitability and permit proper reuse.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The use of drop weight equipment for breaking pavement will be
allowed to the extent that the contractor shall assume full responsibility for
any damages caused thereby. The pavement breaking operations shall not be
allowed to become a nuisance to the public or a source of damage to underground
or adjacent structures. The City reserves the right to order discontinuance of
drop weight breaking operations at any time.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Temporary Service Measures. While any open excavations are
maintained, the contractor shall have available a supply of steel plates
suitable for temporary bridging of open trench sections where either vehicular
or pedestrian traffic must be maintained. Use of the plates shall be as
directed or approved by the City Engineer and where installed they shall be
secured against possible displacement and be replaced with the permanent
structure as soon as possible.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Excavation and Preparation of Trench.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Excavating operations shall proceed only so far in advance of
pipe laying as will satisfy the needs for coordination of work and permit
advance verification of unobstructed line and grade as planned. Where
interference with existing structures is possible or in any way indicated, and
where necessary to establish elevation or direction for connections to in-place
structures, the excavating shall be done at those locations in advance of the
main operation so actual conditions will be exposed in sufficient time to make
adjustments without resorting to extra work or unnecessary delay.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All installations shall be accomplished by open trench
construction except for short tunnel sections approved by the City Engineer and
with the exception that boring and jacking or tunnel construction methods shall
be employed where so specifically required by the specifications.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The excavating operations shall be conducted so as to carefully
expose all in-place underground structures without damage. Wherever the
excavation extends under or approaches so close to an existing structure as to
endanger it in any way, precautions and protective measures shall be taken as
necessary to preserve the structure and provide temporary support. Hand methods
of excavating shall be utilized to probe for and expose such critical or
hazardous installations as gas pipe and power or communication cables.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The City Engineer shall be notified of any need for blasting to
remove materials which cannot be broken up mechanically, and there shall be no
blasting operations conducted until the City Engineer's approval has been
secured. Blasting will be allowed only when proper precautions are taken to
protect life and property, and then shall be restricted as the City Engineer
directs. The contractor shall assume full responsibility for any damages caused
by blasting, regardless of the requirements for notification and approval. The
contractor shall secure any required permits for blasting and shall conduct
blasting operations in conformance with all applicable State and local laws,
regulations and ordinances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Excavated materials will be classified for payment only to the
extent that the removal of materials classified by the City Engineer as rock
will be paid for separately from other unclassified materials, either as a
separate contract item or as an extra work item when no bid price is
applicable. All other materials encountered in the excavations, with the
exception of items classified for payment as structure removals, will be
considered as unclassified excavation, and unless otherwise specified in the
specifications, no additional compensation shall be provided for their removal.
Unclassified materials shall include muck, rubble, wood debris, and boulder
stone, masonry or concrete fragments less than one cubic yard in volume,
together with other miscellaneous matter that can be removed effectively with
power operated excavators without resorting to drilling and blasting.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Rock excavation shall be defined to include all hard, solid rock
in ledge formation, bedded deposits and unstratified masses; all natural
conglomerate deposits so firmly cemented as to present all the characteristics
of solid rock; and any boulder stone, masonry or concrete fragments exceeding
one cubic yard in volume. Materials such as shale, hard pan, soft or
disintegrated rock which can be dislodged with a hand pick or removed with a
power operated excavator will not be classified as rock excavation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Excavated materials will be classified for reuse as being either
suitable or unsuitable for backfill or other specified use, subject to
selective controls. All suitable materials shall be reserved for backfill to
the extent needed, and any surplus remaining shall be utilized for other
construction on the project as may be specified or ordered by the City
Engineer. To the extent practicable, granular materials and topsoil shall be
segregated from other materials during the excavating and stockpiling
operations so as to permit best use of the available materials at the time of
backfilling.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â All excavated materials reserved for backfill or other use on
the project shall be stored at locations approved by the City Engineer that
will cause a minimum of inconvenience to public travel, adjacent properties,
and other special interests. The material shall not be deposited so close to
the edges of the excavations as would create hazardous conditions, nor shall
any material be placed so as to block the access to emergency services. All
materials considered unsuitable by the City Engineer, for any use on the
project, shall be immediately removed from the project and be disposed of as
arranged by the contractor.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â Trench excavating shall be to a depth that will permit
preparation of the foundation as specified and installation of the pipeline and
appurtenances at the prescribed line and grade, except where alterations are
specifically authorized. Trench widths shall be sufficient to permit the pipe
to be laid and joined properly and the backfill to be placed and compacted as
specified. Extra width shall be provided as necessary to permit convenient
placement of sheeting and shoring and to accommodate placement of
appurtenances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â Excavations shall be extended below the bottom of structure as
necessary to accommodate any required granular foundation material. When rock
or unstable foundation materials are encountered at the established grade,
additional materials shall be removed as specified or ordered by the City
Engineer to produce an acceptable foundation. Unless otherwise indicated or
directed, rock shall be removed to an elevation at least six inches below the
bottom surface of the pipe barrel and below the lowest projection of joint
hubs. All excavations below grade shall be to a minimum width equal to the
outside pipe diameter plus two feet. Rock shall be removed to such additional
horizontal dimensions as will provide a minimum clearance of six inches on all
sides of appurtenant structures such as valves, housings, access structures,
etc.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â Where no other grade controls are indicated or established for
the pipeline, the excavating and foundation preparations shall be such as to
provide a minimum cover over the top of the pipe as specified. Trench widths
shall allow for at least six inches of clearance on each side of the joint
hubs. The maximum allowable width of the trench at the top of pipe level shall
be the outside diameter of the pipe plus two feet, subject to the
considerations for alternate pipe loading set forth below. The width of the
trench at the ground surface shall be held to a minimum to prevent unnecessary
destruction of the surface structures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (12)Â Â Â If the trench is excavated to a greater width than that
authorized, the City Engineer may direct the contractor to provide a higher
class of bedding and/or a higher strength pipe than that required by the
specifications.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (13)Â Â Â All excavations shall be sheeted, shored, and braced as will
meet all requirements of the applicable safety codes and regulations; comply
with any specific requirements of the contract; and prevent disturbance or
settlement of adjacent surfaces, foundations, structures, utilities, and other
properties. Any damage to the work under contract or to adjacent structures or
property caused by settlement, water or earth pressures, slides, cave-ins, or
other causes due to failure or lack of sheeting, shoring, or bracing or through
negligence or fault of the contractor in any manner shall be repaired at the
contractor's expense and without delay.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (14)Â Â Â Where conditions warrant extreme care, the specifications may
require special precautions to protect life or property, or the City Engineer
may order the installation of sheet piling of the interlocking type or direct
that other safety measures be taken as deemed necessary. Failure of the City
Engineer to order correction of improper or inadequate sheeting, shoring, or
bracing shall not relieve the contractor's responsibilities for protection of
life, property, and the work.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (15)Â Â Â The contractor shall assume full responsibility for proper and
adequate placement of sheeting, shoring, and bracing, wherever and to such
depths that soil stability may dictate the need for support to prevent
displacement. Bracing shall be so arranged as to provide ample working space
and so as not to place stress or strain on the in-place structures to any
extent that may cause damage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (16)Â Â Â Sheeting, shoring and bracing materials shall be removed only
when and in such manner as will assure adequate protection of the in-place
structures and prevent displacement of supported grounds. Sheeting and bracing
shall be left in place only as required by the specifications or ordered by the
City Engineer. Otherwise, sheeting and bracing may be removed as the
backfilling reaches the level of respective support. Wherever sheeting and
bracing is left in place, the upper portions shall be cut and removed to an
elevation of three feet or more below the established surface grade.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (17)Â Â Â Foundation preparations shall be conducted as necessary to
produce a stable foundation and provide continuous and uniform pipe bearing
between bell holes. The initial excavating or backfilling operations shall
produce a subgrade level slightly above finished grade as will permit hand
shaping to finished grade by trimming of high spots and without the need for
filling of low spots to grade. Final subgrade preparations shall be such as to
produce a finished grade at the centerline of the pipe that is within 0.03-foot
of a straight line between pipe joints and to provide bell hole excavation at
each joint as will permit proper joining of pipe and fittings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (18)Â Â Â In excavations made below grade to remove rock or unstable
materials, the backfilling to grade shall be made with available suitable
materials unless placement of granular foundation or bedding material is
specified and provided for or is ordered by the City Engineer as an extra work
item. Placement of the backfill shall be in relatively uniform layers not
exceeding eight inches in loose thickness. Each layer of backfill shall be
compacted thoroughly, by means of approved mechanical compaction equipment, as
will produce uniform pipe support throughout the full pipe length and
facilitate proper shaping of the pipe bed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (19)Â Â Â Where the foundation soil is found to consist of materials that
the City Engineer considers to be so unstable as to preclude removal and
replacement to a reasonable depth to achieve solid support, a suitable
foundation shall be constructed as the City Engineer directs in the absence of
special requirements therefor in the specifications.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (20)Â Â Â Care shall be taken during final subgrade shaping to prevent
any over-excavation. Should any low spots develop, they shall only be filled
with approved material, which shall have optimum moisture content and be
compacted thoroughly, without additional compensation provided to the
contractor. The finished subgrade shall be maintained free of water and shall
not be disturbed during pipe lowering operations except as necessary to remove
pipe slings. The discharge of trench dewatering pumps shall be directed to
natural drainage channels or storm water drains. Draining trench water into
sanitary sewers or combined sewers will not be permitted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (21)Â Â Â The contractor shall install and operate a dewatering system of
wells or points to maintain pipe trenches free of water wherever necessary or
as directed by the City Engineer to meet the intent of these specifications.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (22)Â Â Â If examination by the City Engineer reveals that the need for
placement of foundation aggregates was caused by the contractor's manipulation
of the soils in the presence of excessive moisture or lack of proper
dewatering, the cost of the corrective measures shall be borne by the
contractor.
Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Installation of Pipe and Fittings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Proper and adequate implements, tools, and facilities shall be
provided and used by the contractor for the safe and convenient prosecution of
the work. During the process of unloading, all pipe and accessories shall be
inspected by the contractor for damage. The contractor shall notify the City
Engineer of all material found to have cracks, flaws or other defects. The City
Engineer shall inspect the damaged materials and have the right to reject any
materials found to be unsatisfactory. The contractor shall promptly remove all
rejected material from the site. All materials shall be handled carefully, as
will prevent damage to protective coatings, linings, and joint fillings;
preclude contamination of interior areas; and avoid jolting contact, dropping,
or dumping.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All work and materials are subject to tests by the owner at such
frequency as may be determined by the City Engineer. Such tests shall be paid
for by the owner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â While suspended and before being lowered into laying position,
each pipe section and appurtenant unit shall be inspected by the contractor to
detect damage or unsound conditions that may need corrective action or be cause
for rejection. The contractor shall inform the City Engineer of any defects
discovered and the City Engineer will prescribe the required corrective actions
or order rejection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Immediately before placement, the joint surfaces of each pipe
section and fitting shall be inspected for the presence of foreign matter,
coating blisters, rough edges or projections, and any imperfections so detected
shall be corrected by cleaning, trimming, or repair as needed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Trench excavation and bedding preparations shall proceed ahead
of pipe placement as will permit proper laying and joining of the units at the
prescribed grade and alignment without unnecessary deviation or hindrance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â All foreign matter or dirt shall be removed from the inside of
the pipe and fittings before they are lowered into position in the trench and
they shall be kept clean by approved means during and after laying. The sewer
materials shall be carefully lowered into laying position by the use of
suitable restraining devices. Under no circumstances shall the pipe be dropped
into the trench.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â At the time of pipe placement, the bedding conditions shall be
such as to provide uniform and continuous support for the pipe between bell
holes. Bell holes shall be excavated as necessary to make the joint
connections, but they shall be no larger than would be adequate to support the
pipe throughout its length. No pipe material shall be laid in water nor when
the trench or bedding conditions are otherwise unsuitable or improper.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â When placement or handling precautions prove inadequate, in the
City Engineer's opinion, the contractor shall provide and install suitable
plugs or caps effectively closing the open ends of each pipe section before it
is lowered into laying position, and they shall remain so covered until removal
is necessary for connection of an adjoining unit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â Unless otherwise permitted by the City Engineer, bell and spigot
pipe shall be laid with the bell ends facing upgrade and the laying shall start
on the downgrade end and proceed upgrade. As each length of bell and spigot
pipe is placed in laying position, the spigot end shall be centered in the bell
and the pipe forced home and brought to correct line and grade. The pipe shall
be secured in place with approved backfill material, which shall be thoroughly
compacted by tamping around the pipe to a height of at least 12 inches above
the top with hand operated mechanical tamping devices or by hand. The joint
areas shall remain exposed and precautions shall be taken to prevent the soil
from entering the joint space, until the joint seal is effected. Backfill in
the bell area shall be left loose.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â Connection of pipe to existing lines or previously constructed
manholes or catch basins shall be accomplished as shown in the plans or as
otherwise approved by the City Engineer. Where necessary to make satisfactory
closure or produce the required curvature, grade or alignment deflections at
joints shall not exceed that which will assure tight joints and comply with any
limitations recommended by the pipe manufacturer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â Entrance of foreign matter into pipeline openings shall be
prevented at all times to the extent that suitable plugs or covering can be

be bulkheaded by approved methods prior to backfilling. Unless otherwise
specified or approved, all openings of 24 inches in diameter or less shall be
closed off with prefabricated plugs or caps and all openings larger than 24
inches in diameter shall be closed off with masonry bulkheads.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (16)Â Â Â Prefabricated plugs and caps shall be of the same material as
the pipe material, or an approved alternate material, and they shall be
installed with watertight seal as required for the pipeline joints. Masonry
bulkheads shall be constructed with clay or concrete brick to a wall thickness
of eight inches.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (17)Â Â Â Bulkheads installed for temporary service during construction
may be constructed with two-inch timber planking securely fastened together and
adequately braced, as an alternate to the masonry construction.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (18)Â Â Â Liners directed by the City Engineer. Rigid insulation board
shall be placed within the pipe encasement zone, six inches above the pipe.
Prior to placement of the insulation, encasement material shall be compacted
until there is no further visual evidence of increased consolidation or the

or firmly compacted foundation material which shall be trimmed to proper
elevation. The bottom riser section shall be set in fresh concrete or mortar
and all other riser section joints of the tongue and groove design shall be
sealed with rubber gaskets.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Wherever special designs so require or permit, and as otherwise
may be approved by the City Engineer, a precast concrete base may be used or
the structure may be constructed with solid sewer brick or block units or with
cast-in-place concrete. Any combination of cast-in-place concrete and brick or
block mortar construction will be allowed and may be required where it is
impossible to complete the construction with standard precast manhole sections.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â All annular wall space surrounding the in-place storm sewer
pipes shall be completely filled with mortar or concrete, and the inside bottom
of each manhole and catch basin shall be shaped with fresh concrete to form
free flow through invert troughs as directed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Sanitary sewer main lines shall not be connected to a manhole at
an elevation more than 24 inches above the invert of the outgoing sewer. Where
the difference is greater than 24 inches, the connections shall be made by
means of an outside drop connection in accordance with the detailed drawings in

the manhole base.
Â Â Â Â Â Â L.Â Â Â Reconnecting Existing Facilities. Disposition of abandoned
facilities and reconnection of existing facilities shall be as provided for in
the specifications.
Â Â Â Â Â Â M.Â Â Â Sanitary Sewer Leakage Testing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â All sanitary sewer lines, including service connections, shall
be substantially watertight and shall be tested for excessive leakage upon
completion and before connections are made to the service by others. Each test
section of the sewer shall be subjected to exfiltration testing, either by
hydrostatic or air test method as described below and at the contractor's
option. The requirements set forth for maximum leakage shall be met as a
condition for acceptance of the sewer section represented by the test.
Referenced in Chapter 12, Iowa Department of Natural Resources Standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If the ground water level is greater than three feet above the
invert elevation of the upper manhole and the City Engineer so approves,
infiltration testing may be allowed in lieu of the exfiltration testing, in
which case the allowable leakage shall be the same as would be allowed for the
Hydrostatic Test.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â All testing shall be performed by the contractor, and the
contractor shall furnish all necessary equipment and materials, including plugs
and standpipes as required.
Â Â Â Â Â Â N.Â Â Â Air Test Method.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The sewer pipe section under test shall be clean at the time of
testing but the pipe may be wetted. Pneumatic balls shall be used to plug the
pipe ends at manholes. Low pressure air shall be introduced into the plugged
line until the internal air pressure reaches 4.0 psi greater than the average
back pressure of any ground water pressure that may submerge the pipe. At least
two minutes shall be allowed for the air temperature to stabilize before
readings are taken and the timing started. During this time the contractor
shall check all plugs with soap solution to detect plug leakage. If plugs are
found to leak, air shall be bled off, the plugs shall be retightened, and the
air shall be reintroduced into the line.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The sewer section under test will be accepted as having passed
the air leakage test if it does not lose air at a rate to cause the pressure to
drop from 3.6 to 3.0 psi in less time than one-half minute per inch in diameter
of the pipe tested.
Â Â Â Â Â Â O.Â Â Â Hydrostatic Test Method.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â After bulkheading the test section, the pipe shall be subjected
to a hydrostatic pressure produced by a head of water at a depth of three feet
above the invert elevation of the sewer at the manhole of the test section. In
areas where ground water exists, this head of water shall be three feet above
the existing water table.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The water head shall be maintained for a period of one hour
during which time it will be presumed that full absorption of the pipe body has
taken place, and thereafter for an extended period of one hour the water head
shall be maintained as the test period. During the one-hour test period, the
measured water loss within the test section, including service stubs, shall not
exceed the Maximum Allowable Loss (in Gallons Per Hour per 100 Feet of Pipe)
given below for the applicable Main Sewer Diameter.
Main Sewer Diameter (In Inches) Maximum Allowable Loss* (In Gallons Per Hour
                                Per 100 Feet)

Â 
If measurements indicate exfiltration within a test action section is not
greater than the allowable maximum, the section will be accepted as passing the
test.
Â Â Â Â Â Â P.Â Â Â Test Failure and Remedy.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â In the event of test failure on any test section, testing shall
be continued until all leakage has been detected and corrected to meet the
requirements. All repair work shall be subject to approval of the City
Engineer. Introduction of sealant substances by means of the test water will
not be permitted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Unsatisfactory repairs or test results may result in an order to
remove and replace pipe as the City Engineer considers necessary for test
conformance. All repair and replacement work shall be at the contractor's
expense.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Q.Â Â Â Pipeline Backfilling Operations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â All pipeline excavations shall be backfilled to restore
preexisting conditions as the minimum requirement, and fulfill all
supplementary requirements indicated in the specifications. The backfilling
operations shall be started as soon as conditions will permit on each section
of pipeline, so as to provide continuity in subsequent operations and restore
normal public service as soon as practicable on a section-by-section basis. All
operations shall be pursued diligently, with proper and adequate equipment, as
will assure acceptable results.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Backfill shall be of suitable material removed from excavation
except where other suitable material is specified. Debris, frozen materials,
large clods or stones, organic matter, or other unstable materials shall not be
used for backfill within two feet of the top of the pipe. A backfill shall be
placed in such a manner as not to disturb the alignment of the pipe.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Within the pipe bedding and encasement zones described as that
portion of the trench which is below an elevation one foot above the top of the
pipe, the materials placed shall be limited in particle size to one and one-
half inches maximum in the case of pipe of 12 inches in diameter or less and to
two inches maximum in the case of larger pipe. Above these zones, the placement
of material containing stones, boulders, chunks, etc. greater than eight inches
in any dimension shall not be allowed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Backfill materials shall be carefully placed in uniform loose
thickness layers of eight inches spread over the full width and length of the
trench section to provide simultaneous support on both sides of the pipeline.
Granular backfill may be placed in 12-inch layers above an elevation one foot
above the top of the pipe, and with the provision that, by authority and at the
discretion of the City Engineer in consideration of the demonstrated capability
of special type vibrating compactors, the stated maximums may be increased.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Each layer of backfill material shall be compacted effectively,
by approved mechanical or hand methods, until there is no further visual
evidence of increased consolidation or the density of the compacted layer
conforms to the density requirements specified in the specifications.
Compaction of the in-place layer shall be completed acceptably before placing
material for a succeeding layer thereon. The manner of placement, compaction
equipment and procedure effectiveness shall be subject to approval of the City
Engineer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â All surplus waste materials remaining after completion of the
backfilling operations shall be disposed of in an acceptable manner within 24
hours after completing the backfill work on each particular pipeline section.
Disposal at any location within the project limits shall be as specified, or as
approved by the City Engineer; otherwise, disposal shall be accomplished
outside the project limits at the contractor's discretion. The backfilling and
surplus or waste disposal operations shall be a part of the work required under
the pipeline installation items, not as work that may be delayed until final
cleanup.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Until expiration of the guarantee period, the contractor shall
assume full responsibility and expense for all backfill settlement and shall
refill and restore the work as directed to maintain an acceptable surface
condition, regardless of location.
Â Â Â Â Â Â R.Â Â Â Restoration of Surface Improvements. Wherever any surface
improvements such as pavement, curbing, pedestrian walks, fencing, or turfing
have been removed, damaged or otherwise disturbed by the contractor's
operations, they shall be repaired or replaced to the City Engineer's
satisfaction, as will restore the improvement equal or better to the
preexisting condition. Each item of restoration work shall be done as soon as
practicable after completion of installation and backfilling operations on each
section of pipeline.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Turf restoration shall be accomplished by sod placement except
where seeding is specifically allowed or required.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Topsoil shall be placed to a minimum depth of four (4) inches
under all sodding and in all areas seeded. The topsoil material used shall be
light friable loam containing a liberal amount of humus and shall be free of
heavy clay, course sand, stones, plants, roots, sticks and other foreign
matter. Topsoil meeting these requirements shall be selected from the excavated
materials to the extent available and needed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â All turf establishment work shall be done in substantial
compliance with the provisions of Iowa DOT Specification 2575. Seed shall be
Mixture No. 5 of Iowa DOT Specification 2601, unless otherwise directed or
approved.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The in-place pavement structure (including base aggregates)
shall be restored in kind and depth as previously existed, using base
aggregates salvaged from the excavated materials to the extent available and
needed, and with new materials being provided for reconstruction of the
concrete or bituminous surface courses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Reconstruction of aggregate base courses and concrete or
bituminous surface courses shall be in substantial compliance with all
applicable Iowa DOT Specifications pertaining to the item being restored. The
materials used shall be comparable to those used in the in-place structure, and
the workmanship and finished quality shall be equal or better to that of new
construction to the fullest extent obtainable in consideration of operational
restrictions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Existing concrete and bituminous surfaces at the trench wall
shall be sawed or cut with a cutting wheel to form a neat edge in a straight
line before surfaces are to be restored. Sawing or cutting may be accomplished
as a part of the removal or prior to restoration at the option of the
contractor. However, all surface edges will be inspected prior to restoration.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Wherever any curbing, curb and gutter sections, pedestrian
walks, fencing, driveway surfacing, or other improvements are removed or in any
way damaged, or undermined, they shall be restored to original condition by
repair or replacement as the City Engineer considers necessary. Replacement of
old materials will be acceptable only to the extent that existing quality can
be fully achieved, such as in the case of fencing. Otherwise new materials
shall be provided and placed as the City Engineer directs. Workmanship and
finished quality shall be equal to that of new construction, where new
materials are used, to the extent obtainable in consideration of operational
restrictions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â A proper foundation shall be prepared before reconstructing
concrete or bituminous improvements. Unless otherwise directed, granular
material shall be placed to a depth of at least four inches under all concrete
and bituminous items.
Â Â Â Â Â Â S.Â Â Â Maintenance and Final Cleanup.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â All subgrade surfaces shall be maintained acceptably until the
start of surfacing construction or restoration work, and until the work has
been finally accepted. Additional materials shall be provided and placed as
needed to compensate for trench settlement and to serve as temporary
construction pending completion of the final surface improvements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Final disposal of debris, waste materials, and other remains or
consequences of construction, shall be accomplished intermittently as new
construction items are completed and shall not be left to await final
completion of all work. Cleanup operations shall be considered as being a part
of the work covered under the contract items involved and only that work which
cannot be accomplished at any early time shall be considered as final cleanup
work not attributable to a specific contract item.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Maintenance of sodded and seeded areas shall include adequate
watering for plant growth and the replacement of any dead or damaged sod as may
be required for acceptance of the work.
Â Â Â Â Â Â T.Â Â Â Deflection Test.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Deflection tests shall be performed on all flexible pipe. The
test shall be conducted after the sewer trench has been backfilled to the
desired finished grade and has been in place for 30 days.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The deflection test shall be performed by pulling a rigid ball
or pointed mandrel through the pipe without the aid of mechanical pulling
devices. The ball or mandrel shall have a minimum diameter equal to 95 percent
of the actual inside diameter of the pipe. The maximum allowable deflection
shall not exceed five percent of the pipe's internal diameter. The time of the
test, method of testing, and the equipment to be used for the test shall be
subject to the approval of the City Engineer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Test Failure and Remedy. In the event of test failure on any
test section, the section shall be replaced, with all repair work subject to
approval of the City Engineer. The replaced section shall be retested for
leakage and deflection in conformance with the specifications contained herein.
All repairs, replacement, and retesting shall be at the contractor's expense.
Â Â Â Â Â Â U.Â Â Â Televising. Sewer line televising may be required by the City
Engineer, at the cost of the contractor, if visual inspection, leakage testing,
or deflection testing indicate the sewer has not been constructed in accordance
with these specifications and the requirements of the specifications.
177.06 PRIVATE STREETS.
Â Â Â Private streets shall be permitted under those circumstances where the City
Council finds that the use of the property served by the private street is
unique when compared to other properties in the community served by City
streets or where the lay of the land makes the installation of a private street
a better or more feasible solution than the installation of a City street.
Whether or not a private street shall be allowed shall first be considered by
the Planning and Zoning Board followed by City Council consideration. If a
private street is permitted it shall be constructed according to the following
specifications:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The private streets shall be constructed of Portland cement concrete or
asphaltic concrete and shall be designed with adequate strength to accommodate
design loadings and shall include curb and gutter, which may be designed as a
"drive-over" curb.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â When off-street guest parking is not provided, private streets shall be
at least 28 feet in width.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â When off-street guest parking is provided, private streets shall be at
least 24 feet in width if the private street serves more than four dwelling
units. If four or less dwelling units are served the minimum private street
width shall be 20 feet.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Cul-de-sac private streets shall not exceed 750 feet in length and
shall be provided with an outside roadway diameter of not less than 76 feet.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Intersecting private streets shall have centerlines as nearly straight
as possible. Jogs with centerline effects of more than five feet shall not be
permitted.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Intersections of private streets at angles less than 60 degrees shall
not be permitted.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â If an intersection occurs at an angle other than a right angle, it
shall be rounded with a curve at a radius acceptable to the City Engineer.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â The grade of a private street should be within the following ranges
unless it is determined by the City Engineer that falling within the grades is
not feasible, and in that event the grade shall be as determined by the City
Engineer:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Maximum: 10 percent.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Minimum: five-tenths of one percent.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â All private streets entering a public street must meet at a right angle
and be perpendicular to the public street for a minimum distance of 50 feet
without intersection of private streets. The intersecting private street right-
of-way with the public street right-of-way shall be rounded with radii of not
less than 30 feet.
Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Structures built on private streets shall be required to meet all
requirements of Section 165.29 of the Code of Ordinances, with the exception of

Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â Condominiums and one-family row dwellings located on a private street
shall be set out within a plat and shall provide for a 30-foot front yard
setback, measured from the closest edge of the pavement, and 30-foot rear yard
setbacks. An uncovered deck or patio may extend into the rear yard setback by
up to 10 feet, or 33 percent of the rear yard, whichever is less. Said
dwellings shall also be set off of any City street to which the private street
enters by at least 40 feet.

Â 
180.01 TITLE, PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
Â Â Â This chapter, providing for the administration and enforcement of sign
regulations, shall be known and may be cited and referred to as the Signage
Ordinance of the City of Monticello, Iowa. The purpose of this chapter is to
permit such signs as will not, by reason of their size, location, construction
or manner of display, endanger life and limb, confuse or mislead traffic,
obstruct vision necessary for traffic safety, or otherwise endanger the public
morals, health and safety; and further, to regulate such permitted signs in a
way to promote development that is not detrimental to the property values and
aesthetics of the City. No sign shall be erected or maintained in the City's
jurisdiction, except those specifically allowed by this chapter.
180.02 JURISDICTION.
Â Â Â The lawful use of a sign existing at the time of the enactment of the Zoning
Ordinance may be continued, as a permitted nonconforming use, although such use
may not conform to the regulations herein for a period of five years or until
there has been a change in the businesses operating at said location, whichever
occurs first. Said nonconforming sign may not be altered, improved, converted,
enlarged, moved, or structurally altered without conforming to these
regulations.
Â Â Â In cases of nonconforming pole signs in the C-2 zoning district, the City
Council may approve an extension for an additional specific period of time, but
not more than five (5) years, provided:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The City has not previously provided the property owner notice that the
sign needs to be removed;
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If there is a change in business, the new business will remain similar
to or the same as the prior use of the property (e.g. restaurant, gas station,
etc.);
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The business owner is leasing, renting or otherwise does not have
specific rights or control over the nonconforming pole sign, except for
changing the panels;
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The sign will be removed or modified to meet the sign ordinance
requirements prior to the expiration of the extension. If not, the City has the
right to declare the nonconforming sign an abandoned sign and cause its removal
pursuant to Chapter 180.28.
(Section 180.02 - Ord. 743 - Sep. 21 Supp.)
180.03 PROHIBITED SIGNS AND CONDITIONS.
Â Â Â The following signs shall not be permitted, erected, or maintained on any
property within the City, unless authorized elsewhere within these regulations.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Illuminated message boards or signs with changeable copy, whether
mounted or located within or without a structure, where more than one color is
involved. Any existing signage meeting this definition may continue in use so
long as same is used for the existing business.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Arrow or flashing arrow signage and/or changeable copy or signs
sometimes described as outdoor reader board marquee style signage with
changeable text letters and numbers unless the sign was originally designed to
be, and is in fact, permanently affixed to concrete footings or suitable
concrete pad as part of a permitted monument sign.
180.04 DESIGN STANDARDS.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â No sign face shall extend horizontally beyond the supporting structure
a distance greater than 12 inches.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Electric Signs. All electric signs shall be manufactured and
professionally designed to meet UL specifications, and a copy of the sign plans
and appropriate certifications may be demanded by the City prior to the
issuance of a sign construction permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Electric signs shall be watertight, with service holes to provide
access to each compartment with fitted waterproof covers.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Wind Pressure and Dead Load Requirements. All signs and sign structures
shall be designed and constructed to withstand appropriate wind pressure and
receive appropriate dead loads. The City may require appropriate certification
from the applicant, who shall provide certification from a qualified architect
and/or engineer that the proposed sign has been designed to withstand
appropriate wind pressure and dead loads.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Clearance from Electric Lines. A clearance of not less than six feet
horizontally and 12 feet vertically shall be maintained between any sign and
any overhead electrical transmission line.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Number of Faces. No sign shall have more than two faces unless pre-
approved by the City Council after consideration by the Planning and Zoning
Commission. Sign faces shall be parallel, unless otherwise permitted.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Lighting of Signs. A constant level of light must be maintained,
provided that this shall not be construed to prohibit use of an automatic
dimmer to reduce garish effects at night. Lighting, other than internal
lighting, must be approved by the Council. The use of bare light bulbs will not
be approved.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Emissions Prohibited. No sign shall emit audible sound, noticeable
odor, smoke or other visible matter.
Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Obstruction of Fire Exits, Light or Ventilation. No sign shall be
permitted to obstruct or interfere in any way with the free use of any door,
window, fire escape, nor obstruct or impair operation of any opening required
for light or ventilation.
Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Traffic Hazards. It is illegal for any sign to interfere with, obstruct
the view of, or be of such design which may be confused with any authorized
traffic sign, signal, or device.
180.05 MONUMENT SIGNS.
Â Â Â Businesses that wish to install signage, not attached to the building
structure, shall install a monument sign consistent with the conditions set
forth herein unless pre-approved for the installation of a pole sign consistent
with the provisions of this chapter. All letters, figures, characters or
representations in cut-out or irregular form maintained in conjunction with,
attached to, or superimposed on a monument sign shall be safely and securely
built to or attached to the sign structure and shall comply with all other
applicable requirements of this chapter.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Sign Bases. All sign bases shall be designed and constructed of
materials that are similar to those used on the principal building, not
including vinyl, wood, cement board, or aluminum, steel or similar types of
siding. Sign bases shall be dominated with materials of permanency and strength
and shall be compatible with other structures and signs in the development
where possible. Bare, visible steel posts, columns, or similar materials are
not permitted. In the event the building is not constructed of a stone or brick
material, the sign base shall be constructed of brick, stone, or split faced
block or other material approved in advance by the City Council.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Number of Signs. One sign shall be permitted on each lot of record;
provided however, if the frontage of such lot measured in a straight line along
such street exceeds 500 feet, then two such signs shall be permitted. A minimum
distance of 250 feet shall separate the two permitted monument signs. In the
event a property owner desires an additional number of signs, they must present
a plan to the Planning and Zoning Commission for review and presentation to the
City Council for approval.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Setback Requirement. The minimum setback from any right-of-way required
for monument signs shall be five feet unless a lesser setback is approved in
advance by the City Council. All signs shall have a side setback not less than
the height of the sign.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Sign Area. The total area of a sign shall be the actual square footage
of one sign face. Double-face signs may be permitted with the maximum square
footage permitted on each side. The maximum sign area of a monument sign shall
not exceed 36 square feet; provided, however, the maximum sign area may be
increased one square foot for each additional one foot of setback over the
minimum required setback to a maximum sign area of 100 square feet. If a
monument sign includes a permitted illuminated message board/signs with
changeable copy, the dimensions of the message board shall not count towards
the maximum signage size limitations set forth herein, however, the message
board dimensions cannot exceed the maximum size allowed for the signage.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Height. The maximum height of a monument sign, including permitted
message board, shall be 15 feet, including the distance between the sign face
and the base; provided, however, the maximum height may be increased one foot
for each additional three feet of setback over the minimum required setback to
a maximum sign height of 30 feet. Where the street is substantially higher or
lower than the proposed sign location, the City Administrator may allow for
additional sign height. "Substantially" is defined, in this case, as a change
in vertical distance greater than five feet. If the City Administrator finds
that additional sign height should not be permitted, the request may then be
taken to the Planning and Zoning Commission for consideration and
recommendation to the City Council.
Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The vertical distance between the sign face and the base shall not be
greater than 36 inches.
Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â In the event that the sign is supported by two poles, encased in
appropriate materials of permanency and strength as set forth previously
herein, the sign shall be located between the encased poles with the encased
poles extending at least the full height of the sign. A monument sign may be
installed atop an appropriate brick, stone, or split faced block base as
opposed to between two so encased poles.
180.06 POLE SIGNAGE.
Â Â Â Pole signage may be permitted in the C-1 and C-3 Zoning Districts after a
review of a signage proposal or plan submitted by the property or business
owner to the Planning and Zoning Commission for consideration and
recommendation to the City Council. Thereafter, the City Council shall consider
the request in light of the Planning and Zoning Commission recommendation.
Factors to be considered by the Commission and the City Council shall include
but not be limited to the following:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Requested signage height, and appropriateness or necessity of said
signage height considering the location and type of business.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Other options that would meet the needs of the business.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Whether some type of sheathing or covering of the pole can be
accomplished to soften or improve the look of what would otherwise be a bare
pole.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Impact proposed signage may have on adjacent or nearby businesses or
homes.
Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â General appropriateness of signage to area proposed to be erected.

setback of greater than 250 feet, two square feet of sign area may be erected
per lineal foot of building frontage to a maximum sign area of 200 square feet.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Number of Signs. On buildings setback less than or equal to 250 feet,
one building sign shall be permitted. On buildings setback further than 250
feet, two building signs shall be permitted, provided total sign area shall not
exceed that permitted above. In the case of a building on a comer lot, or with
one side facing a parking lot utilized by the tenants of the building, one
building sign per public street or parking lot frontage may be permitted,
regardless of setback. In no case shall a building with one tenant display more

Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Sign Area. For multiple tenant buildings, it is preferable that tenants
erect one joint (shared) sign. Each tenant shall be allowed up to 36 square
feet on a monument sign or 50 square feet on a building sign. In no case,
however, shall the allowable square footage of all joint (shared) building
mounted tenant signage be greater than one and one-half square foot per lineal
foot of building frontage. If a multiple tenant building frontage exceeds 200
feet and has a setback of greater than 100 feet, the maximum signage shall be
increased from one and one-half square foot per lineal foot of building
frontage to two square feet of signage per lineal foot of building frontage.
Additional signage may be permitted after Commission review and Council
approval.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Building Signs. One building sign shall be permitted per tenant. If a

building display more than two building signs.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Letters, Symbols and Logos. Under no circumstances will a letter,

approval of a violation of the provisions of this Code of Ordinances.
Inspections presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of
this Code of Ordinances shall not be valid. It shall be the duty of the permit
applicant to cause the work to remain accessible and exposed for inspection

Administrator after 30 days' written notice to the sign owner may order the
removal of any sign that is not maintained in accordance with the provisions of
this section and the cost assessed against the property where said sign is
located. However, in the case a sign structure becomes a safety hazard as
determined by the Public Works Director, the owner shall be ordered to
immediately abate the safety hazard. The Public Works Director or City

be asked to allow an extension of time upon a written request setting out the
reasons in support of said request. The extension request shall be made within
the first 14 days following the mailing of notice to the owner/responsible
party so that the Council may consider the request within thirty days after the

180.29 SNIPE SIGNS.
Â Â Â It is unlawful for any person to post or fail to remove a snipe sign. A
snipe sign is any sign or poster affixed in any manner to a tree, fence,
utility pole, building, or any similar object on public property, which is not
otherwise permitted. The City Administrator is authorized to remove any snipe
sign and if no one comes forward to claim the sign within seven days of its
removal, the City is authorized to dispose of the snipe sign.
180.30 SPECIAL SIGN PROVISIONS FOR BUILDINGS IN THE MAIN STREET DISTRICT.
Â Â Â  For all buildings and businesses in the Main Street Monticello District
(the â€œMain Street Districtâ€), the following special provisions shall apply. All
signs allowed by this Section 180.30 shall also comply with
180.04, Design Standards, except for Subsection 1 and 5 thereof.
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Temporary Movable Signs on Public Sidewalks. Any proprietor of an
establishment in the Main Street District, may display one (1) temporary
movable sign on the sidewalk in front of said establishment, subject to the
following provisions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All such temporary signs must at all times maintain at least a two-
foot (2â€™) setback from the street curb.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In order to allow for the free passage of pedestrian traffic on the
public sidewalk, a minimum of four feet (4â€™) of unobstructed public sidewalk
must be provided at all times. That unobstructed area may be between the
storefront and the edge of the sign closest to the storefront, or the sign and
any other obstruction to the free movement and ADA accessibility on the public
sidewalk, including but not limited to, street furniture, light poles, tree
wells, and car overhangs.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â No such temporary movable sign shall be attached in any manner to
the public sidewalk, or to any public fixtures within the right-of-way,
including but not limited to, light poles, traffic signs, tables, chairs, or
other fixtures, or on top of any temporary elevations such as fill material or
snowbanks.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â No such temporary sign shall exceed two and one-half feet (2Â½â€™) in
width and three and one-half feet (3Â½â€™) in height as measured to the outer
frame measurements and height measured from the natural grade of the sidewalk
surface adjacent to such establishment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â No more than one such sign may be placed in front of any single
store-front.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â All such signs must be well-maintained and kept in good repair.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Temporary signs shall only be placed on the public sidewalk at times
the business is open, and shall be removed from the public way during non-
business hours.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Projecting Sign (Also Called a Blade Sign). A sign that is generally
mounted perpendicular to the building wall by way of brackets or hanging
supports. This type of sign does not include awning, canopy, or marquee signs.
Due to the minimal setback of the buildings, in the Main Street District,
projecting signs are allowed over the public right-of-way.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â One projecting sign, per building frontage, per tenant is allowed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All projecting signs shall not be less than seven and a half feet
(7.5â€™) from the bottom of the sign to the grade below.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â No projecting sign mounted at less than 15 feet high shall extend
away from the building wall to a point closer than two feet (2â€™) to the back of
the curb; as measured to the furthest edge of the sign.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Sign Area Allowed. The total area of all signs (wall and projecting
signs) shall not exceed fifteen percent of the area of that frontage of the
building. No projecting sign shall exceed an area of ten percent of the area of
that frontage of the building. In multiple-tenant situations, the sign area for
each tenant shall be calculated based upon the area of their individual
storefront, unless otherwise directed in writing by the owner of the building.
Only one face of a projecting sign shall be counted towards the allowed area
for the individual sign, and the overall signage of a building or tenant
frontage. No allowed sign area may be transferred to another side of the
building.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Maximum Height. No projecting sign shall be located so as to extend
above the parapet or roof line of a single-story building, or the top of the
second story windows.
Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Design Load and Structure. The projecting sign shall be designed to
adhere to structural and load capacities for the Monticello area and of the
building that it is attached. Structural and load calculations may be required
prior to sign approval. All projecting signs shall be secured against excessive
movement by wind or other forces.
Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Illumination. Unless restricted elsewhere in this ordinance,
projecting signs may be externally or internally illuminated. If internally
illuminated, all projecting signs shall be designed in such a manner that only
the text, copy or graphic of the sign is illuminated, and the background is
opaque. This may be accomplished with individual channel letters, halo lit
letters, routered face with push through letters, or comparable design.
Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Shapes Encouraged. Complex shapes are encouraged for projecting
signs rather than simple rectangle, square and circle shapes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Icon Sign. An icon sign is a unique, three-dimensional object or
sign that describes a businessâ€™s product or services. As a three-dimensional
sign, these signs will be treated as a projecting sign and must comply with
those requirements, except those projecting less than 12â€ from the building
wall are not required to maintain the 7.5-foot clearance from the sidewalk. One
icon sign is allowed per business.
Â Â Â Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Nonconforming projecting signs that legally existed as of the date
of adoption of this amendment â€  (May __2023??) may continue to be used, despite
any change in panels. If said signs are removed, damaged, or failed to be
maintained in a safe and structurally sound manner, the signs shall not be
replaced except in conformity with this ordinance.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Building (Wall) Signs.
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Sign Area Allowed. The total area of all signs (wall and projecting
signs) shall not exceed fifteen percent of the area of that frontage of the
building. No individual wall sign shall exceed an area of ten percent of the
area of that frontage of the building. In multiple-tenant situations, the sign
area for each tenant shall be calculated based upon the area of their
individual storefront, unless otherwise directed in writing by the owner of the
building. Only one face of a projecting sign shall be counted towards the
overall signage of a building or tenant frontage. No allowed sign area may be
transferred to another side of the building.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Number of Signs. Multiple wall signs shall be allowed on any visible
wall, provide the total sign area shall not exceed that permitted above. Sign
area is not transferable between building sides.
Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Multiple-Tenant Buildings and Multiple Building Blocks. In instances
where multiple tenants share frontages in the same building, or multiple
buildings are joined by common walls into a â€œblock,â€ tenants may place wall
signs on non-adjacent walls, with the written permission of the building owner
on which the wall sign is to be placed. Said signs shall count toward the
overall size of signs allowed on that frontage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Awnings and Canopies. Awnings and canopies shall be permitted above
door and window openings in addition to permitted signage, whether or not the
awnings include the display of business name, logo, or other identifying
information. Awnings shall, however, be permitted in the same manner as signs.
All awnings shall be installed with a minimum clearance of 7-1/2 feet above the
sidewalk.
Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Illumination. Unless restricted elsewhere in this ordinance, wall
signs may be externally or internally illuminated. If internally illuminated,
all wall signs shall be designed in such a manner that only the text, copy or
graphic of the sign is illuminated, and the background is opaque. This may be
accomplished with individual channel letters, halo lit letters, routered face
with push through letters, or comparable design.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Roof Signs. Roof signs are allowed, but may only be placed on mansard
roofs subject to the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No roof sign shall be mounted lower than the bottom of the mansard
roof, and no roof sign shall project above (higher) than the top of the mansard
roof.
Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All roof signs shall be counted as part of the building (wall) sign
area otherwise allowed for that side of the building, and no area may be
transferred to another side of the building.
