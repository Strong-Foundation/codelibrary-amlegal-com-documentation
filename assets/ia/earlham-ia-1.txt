The applicant for any permit or license under this Code of Ordinances, by

court where the action is pending, a brief statement of the alleged facts from
which the cause arose, that the City believes that the person notified is
liable to it for any judgment rendered against the City, and asking the person
to appear and defend. A judgment obtained in the suit is conclusive in any
action by the City against any person so notified, as to the existence of the
defect or other cause of the injury or damage, as to the liability of the City
to the plaintiff in the first named action, and as to the amount of the damage
or injury. The City may maintain an action against the person notified to
recover the amount of the judgment together with all the expenses incurred by

Whenever a hazardous condition is created by the deposit, injection, dumping,

waters, the responsible person shall cause the condition to be remedied by a
cleanup, as defined in the preceding section, as rapidly as feasible to an

the present danger to the public health, safety and welfare, then no notice
shall be required and the City may proceed to procure the cleanup and bill the
responsible person for all costs associated with the cleanup. If the bill for
those services is not paid within 30 days, the City Attorney shall proceed to

exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property within the
time provided shall be deemed a waiver by the owner, lienholders and claimants
of all right, title, claim and interest in the vehicle or personal property and
that failure to reclaim the vehicle or personal property is deemed consent to
the sale of the vehicle at a public auction or disposal of the vehicle to a
demolisher and to disposal of the personal property by sale or destruction. If

under Section 80.03. The published notice may contain multiple listings of
abandoned vehicles and personal property but shall be published within the same
time requirements and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed
notice in Section 80.03.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[3b])

amount necessary to meet costs the police authority shall apply for
reimbursement from the Department of Transportation.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.89[4])
80.09   DUTIES OF DEMOLISHER.

pursuant to the provisions of Section 384.84, Code of Iowa:
   1.   Give 10 days’ notice of the opportunity for a hearing prior to
disconnection of service from the System which shall occur at the end of said
ten days and which shall continue until such time as the property owner has
received a permit for the connection and paid the required connection fee; upon
failure to show cause why disconnection should not be accomplished by the City,
the City may proceed with disconnection in the manner provided by law. All
costs of disconnection, in such amount as the City may reasonably establish,
shall be paid by the property owner at the same time and in addition to the
appropriate connection fees established herein, before reconnection. Any
environmental pollution or damage caused by unpermitted connection,
disconnection, and permitted reconnection, shall be the exclusive
responsibility of the property owner.

building sewer shall be performed in accordance with the provisions of the
State Plumbing Code and the provisions of Chapter 135 of this Code of
Ordinances.
96.05   CONNECTION REQUIREMENTS.
Any connection with a public sanitary sewer must be made under the direct
supervision of the Superintendent and in accordance with the following:
   1.   Old Building Sewers. Old building sewers may be used in connection with
new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test conducted by
the owner and observed by the Superintendent, to meet all requirements of this
chapter.
   2.   Separate Building Sewers. A separate and independent building sewer
shall be provided for every occupied building; except where one building stands
at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or
can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court,
yard, or driveway. In such cases the building sewer from the front building may
be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building
sewer.
   3.   Installation. The installation and connection of the building sewer to
the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the State Plumbing Code
and applicable rules and regulations of the City. All such connections shall be
made gastight and watertight. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and
materials must be approved by the Superintendent before installation.
   4.   Water Lines. When possible, building sewers should be laid at least 10
feet horizontally from a water service. The horizontal separation may be less,
provided the water service line is located at one side and at least 12 inches
above the top of the building sewer.
   5.   Size. Building sewers shall be sized for the peak expected sewage flow
from the building with a minimum building sewer size of four inches.
   6.   Alignment and Grade. All building sewers shall be laid to a straight
line to meet the following:

building at an elevation below the basement floor. The depth of cover above the
sewer shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost.
   8.   Sewage Lifts. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low
to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such
drain shall be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the
building sewer.
   9.   Pipe Specifications. Building sewer pipe shall be free from flaws,
splits, or breaks. Materials shall be as specified in the State Plumbing Code
except that the building sewer pipe, from the property line to the public
sewer, shall comply with the current edition of one of the P.V.C. – DWV –
A.S.T.M. D-2665 (Schedule 40).

compatible with the type of pipe used, subject to the approval of the
Superintendent. Solvent-welded joints are not permitted.
   12.   Unstable Soil. No sewer connection shall be laid so that it is exposed
when crossing any watercourse. Where an old watercourse must of necessity be
crossed or where there is any danger of undermining or settlement, cast iron
soil pipe or vitrified clay sewer pipe thoroughly encased in concrete shall be
required for such crossings. Such encasement shall extend at least six inches
on all sides of the pipe. The cast iron pipe or encased clay pipe shall rest on
firm, solid material at either end.
   13.   Preparation of Basement or Crawl Space. No connection for any
residence, business or other structure with any sanitary sewer shall be made
unless the basement floor is poured, or in the case of a building with a slab
or crawl space, unless the ground floor is installed with the area adjacent to
the foundation of such building cleared of debris and backfilled. The backfill
shall be well compacted and graded so that the drainage is away from the
foundation. Prior to the time the basement floor is poured, or the first floor
is installed in buildings without basements, the sewer shall be plugged and the
plug shall be sealed by the Superintendent. Any accumulation of water in any
excavation or basement during construction and prior to connection to the
sanitary sewer shall be removed by means other than draining into the sanitary
sewer.
96.06   INTERCEPTORS REQUIRED.
Grease, oil, sludge and sand interceptors shall be provided by gas and service
stations, convenience stores, car washes, garages, and other facilities when,
in the opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper
handling of such wastes that contain grease in excessive amounts or any
flammable waste, sand or other harmful ingredients. Such interceptors shall not
be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. When required, such
interceptors shall be installed in accordance with the following:
   1.   Design and Location. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity
as specified in the State Plumbing Code, to be approved by the Superintendent,

impervious material capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in
temperature. They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped
with easily removable covers that shall be gastight and watertight.
   3.   Maintenance. All such interceptors shall be maintained by the owner at
the owner’s expense and shall be kept in continuously efficient operations at
all times.
96.07   SEWER TAP.
Connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the “Y”
branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If no properly
located “Y” branch is available, a saddle “Y” shall be installed at the
location specified by the Superintendent. The public sewer shall be tapped with
a tapping machine and a saddle appropriate to the type of public sewer shall be
glued or attached with a gasket and stainless steel clamps to the sewer. At no
time shall a building sewer be constructed so as to enter a manhole unless
special written permission is received from the Superintendent and in
accordance with the Superintendent’s direction if such connection is approved.
96.08   INSPECTION REQUIRED.
All connections with the sanitary sewer system before being covered shall be
inspected and approved, in writing, by the Superintendent. As soon as all pipe
work from the public sewer to inside the building has been completed, and
before any backfilling is done, the Superintendent shall be notified and the
Superintendent shall inspect and test the work as to workmanship and material;
no sewer pipe laid under ground shall be covered or trenches filled until after
the sewer has been so inspected and approved. If the Superintendent refuses to
approve the work, the plumber or owner must proceed immediately to correct the
work.
96.09   PROPERTY OWNER’S RESPONSIBILITY.
All costs and expenses incident to the installation, connection and maintenance
of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify
the City from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned
by the installation of the building sewer.
96.10   ABATEMENT OF VIOLATIONS.
Construction or maintenance of building sewer lines whether located upon the
private property of any owner or in the public right-of-way, which construction
or maintenance is in violation of any of the requirements of this chapter,
shall be corrected, at the owner’s expense, within 30 days after date of
official notice from the Council of such violation. If not made within such
time the Council shall, in addition to the other penalties herein provided,
have the right to finish and correct the work and assess the cost thereof to
the property owner. Such assessment shall be collected with and in the same
manner as general property taxes.

   13.   Untreatable Wastes. Waters or wastes containing substances which are
not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes
employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage
treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having
jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.
97.05   RESTRICTED DISCHARGES; POWERS OF SUPERINTENDENT.
If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the
public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in Section 97.04 and which in the judgment of the
Superintendent may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes,
equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or
constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent may:
   1.   Rejection. Reject the wastes by requiring disconnection from the public
sewage system;
   2.   Pretreatment. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for
discharge to the public sewers;
   3.   Controls Imposed. Require control over the quantities and rates of
discharge; and/or
   4.   Special Charges. Require payment to cover the added cost of handling
and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under
the provisions of Chapter 99.
97.06   SPECIAL FACILITIES.
If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows,
the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the Superintendent and subject to the requirements of
all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws. Where preliminary treatment or
flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be
maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at
the owner’s expense.
97.07   CONTROL MANHOLES.
When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner’s
expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
97.08   TESTING OF WASTES.
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from
periodic grab samples).

not be required to pay any City permits as needed as a result of City required
relocation. If the City has a reasonable alternative route for the street,
right of way or alley or an alternative construction method, which would not
cause the relocation of Company installations or would minimize the cost or
expense of relocation of Company installations, the City and Company shall work
together to consider said alternative route or construction method. The City
shall, in the extension or modification of streets and roads, make provision
for the placement of company service lines and facilities on City-owned right
of way without charge to Company. In planning for the extension or modification
of streets, the City shall, to the extent practicable design such changes to

completed by the City as part of the City's project and are necessary whether
or not utility facilities must be relocated, the City at its own cost shall be
responsible for said removals. If the timing of vegetation and tree removals
does not coincide with Company's facilities relocation schedule and the Company
must remove vegetation and trees that are included in the City's portion of the
project, the City shall either remove them or reimburse the Company for the
expenses incurred to remove said materials. If project funds from a source
other than the City are available to pay for the relocation of utility
facilities, the City shall use its best efforts to secure said funds and
provide them to the Company to compensate the Company for the costs of
relocation.
111.05   EXCAVATIONS.

installation, maintenance or repair of conductor, conduits or the erection of
poles and wires or other appliances, the Company shall not unreasonably
obstruct the use of the streets. The Company in making such excavations shall,
if required by ordinance, obtain a City permit therefore and provide City
representatives with advance notice prior to the actual commencement of the
work, and shall comply with all provisions and requirements of the City in its
regulation of the use of City right of way in performing such work. In
emergencies which require immediate excavation, the Company may proceed with
the work without first applying for or obtaining the permit, provided, however,
that Company shall apply for and obtain the excavation permit as soon as
possible after commencing such emergency work. The Company shall comply with
all provisions and requirements of the City in its regulation of the use of
City right of way in performing such work. The Company shall comply with all
City ordinances regarding paving cuts, placement of facilities and restoration
of pavement and other public infrastructure. The Company shall replace the
surface, restoring the condition as existed prior to the Company's excavation
but shall not be required to improve or modify the public right of way,
sidewalks or other areas in or adjacent to the Company project to a condition
superior to its immediate previously existing condition. Company shall complete
all repairs in a timely manner. Company agrees any replacement of road surface
shall conform to current City ordinances regarding its depth and composition.

Vacating a street, avenue, alley, public ground or public right-of-way shall
not deprive the Company of its right to operate and maintain existing
facilities and their replacements on, below, above, or beneath the vacated
property. Prior to the City abandoning or vacating any street, avenue, alley or
public ground where the Company has electric facilities, the City shall grant
the Company a utility easement for said facilities. If the City fails to grant
the Company a utility easement for said facilities prior to abandoning or
vacating a street, avenue, alley or public ground, the City shall at its cost
and expense obtain easements for the existing Company facilities.
111.07   RELOCATION NOT REQUIRED.
The Company shall not be required to relocate, at its cost and expense, Company
facilities in the public right of way that have been relocated at Company
expense at the direction of the City in the previous ten (10) years.

Pursuant to relocation of Company facilities, if the City orders or requests
the Company to relocate its existing facilities or equipment in order to
directly facilitate a project for the primary benefit of a commercial or
private developer or other non-public entity, the City shall require the
developer or non-public entity to reimburse the Company for the cost of such
relocation as a precondition to relocation of its existing facilities or
equipment. The Company shall not be required to relocate in order to facilitate
such private project at its expense.
111.09   INDEMNIFICATION.
The Company shall indemnify, save and hold harmless the City from any and all
claims, suits, losses, damages, costs or expenses, on account of injury or
damage to any person or property, to the extent caused or occasioned by the

Company. The pruning and removal of vegetation and trees shall be completed in
accordance with nationally accepted safety and utility standards, NSI Z133.1-
2012, American National Standard for Arboricultural Operations-Safety
Requirements, and ANSI A300(part 1) - 2008 Pruning, (Revision of ANSI A300 part

specific basis, information indicating the horizontal location, relative to
boundaries of the right of way, of all equipment which it owns or over which it
has control that is located in City right of way, including documents, maps and
other information in paper or electronic or other forms ("Information.") The
Company and City recognize the Information may in whole or part be considered a
confidential record under state or federal law or both. Therefore, City shall
not release any Information without prior consent of the Company and shall
return the Information to Company upon request. City recognizes that Company
claims the Information may constitute a trade secret or is otherwise protected
from public disclosure by state or federal law on other grounds, and agrees to
retain the Information in its non-public files. Furthermore, the City agrees

location limitations for an existing driveway if they determine that by doing
so, no traffic hazard will be created.
140.24   DRIVEWAY APPROACHES TO ALLEYS.

the requirements for streets. However, variations may be considered on an
individual basis by the Public Works Director.

alleys or other public rights-of-way shall be construed to follow such
centerlines on the official zoning map. Where there is uncertainty as to the
boundaries of districts as shown on the official zoning map, the Board of
Adjustment shall interpret the district boundaries.
   3.   Maintaining Map. In the event that the official zoning map becomes
damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret because of use, the Council
may adopt a new official zoning map which shall supersede the prior official
zoning map. The new official zoning map may correct drafting or other errors or
omissions in the prior official zoning map, but no such correction shall have
the effect of amending the original zoning ordinance or any subsequent
amendment thereof. The new official zoning map shall be identified by the
signature of the Mayor attested by the Clerk, under the following words: “This
is to certify that this official zoning map supersedes and replaces the
official zoning map adopted (date of adoption of map being replaced) as part of
the Earlham Zoning Ordinance.”
   4.   Amendments. Amendments changing the boundaries of districts as shown on
the official zoning map shall be in form of an ordinance amending this chapter
and refer to the official map, and shall set out the identification by legal
description of the area affected and identify the zoning district in which the
area has been located, and the new district designation applicable to the
property area. The ordinance, after adoption and publication, shall be recorded
by the Clerk and a certified copy thereof shall be attached to the official
zoning map. Such amendatory ordinance, however, shall not repeal or reenact
said map, but only amend it. The official zoning map, together with amending
ordinances, shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of
land and water areas, buildings and other structures in the City. From time to
time the amendments can be drawn onto map in the manner provided by subsection
3. (See EDITOR’S NOTE at the end of this chapter for ordinances amending the
zoning map.)
165.06   INTERPRETATION OF STANDARDS.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance shall be held to be minimum requirements. Where this chapter imposes
a greater restriction than is imposed or required by other provisions of law or
by other rules or regulations or ordinances, the provisions of this chapter
shall control.
165.07   APPLICATION OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS.
The regulations set by this Zoning Ordinance within each district shall be
minimum regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of
structure or land.
165.08   COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   1.   No building, structure or land shall hereafter be used or occupied, and
no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected,
constructed, reconstructed or structurally altered unless in conformity with
all of the regulations specified herein for the district in which it is
located.
   2.   No building or other structure shall hereafter be erected or altered:
      A.   To exceed the height limit established herein;
      B.   To accommodate or house a greater number of families;

      D.   To have narrower or smaller rear yards, front yards, side yards or
other open spaces; or in any other manner to be contrary to the provisions of
this Zoning Ordinance.
165.09   OPEN SPACE TO SERVE SINGLE REQUIREMENT.
Yards or parts of a yard, or other open space, or off-street parking or loading
space required about or in connection with any building for the purpose of
complying with this chapter shall not be included as part of a yard, open space
or off-street parking or loading space similarly required for any other
building.
165.10   PREEXISTING YARDS OR LOTS.
Yards or lots existing on February 3, 1969, shall not be reduced in dimension
or area below the minimum requirements set forth in this Zoning Ordinance.
Yards or lots created after March 20, 1969, shall meet at least the minimum
requirements established by this Zoning Ordinance.
165.11   ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
The provisions of this Zoning Ordinance shall be enforced and administered by
the Zoning Administrator. If the Zoning Administrator finds that any of the
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance are being violated, he or she shall notify
in writing the person responsible for such violations, indicating the nature of
the violation and ordering the action necessary to correct it. The Zoning
Administrator shall order discontinuance of illegal use of land, buildings or
structures; removal of illegal buildings or structures or of additions,
alterations or structural changes thereto; discontinuance of any illegal work
being done; or shall take any other action authorized by this Zoning Ordinance
to ensure compliance with this Zoning Ordinance or to prevent violation of its
provisions.
165.12   BUILDING PERMIT REQUIRED.
Buildings or other structures shall not be erected, moved, added to or
structurally altered without a permit therefor, issued by the Zoning
Administrator. Building permits shall be issued in conformance with the
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, or upon written order from the Board of
Adjustment. Fees for building permits shall be as provided in Section 165.18.
When work for which a building permit is required by this chapter is started or
proceeded with by any person prior to obtaining the required permit, the total
building permit fee shall be increased by twenty percent, with a minimum
penalty increase of $10.00. The payment of such increased penalty fee shall not
relieve any person from fully complying with the requirements of this chapter
in the execution of the work or from any other penalties prescribed herein.
165.13   APPLICATION FOR BUILDING PERMIT.
All applications for building permits shall be accompanied by a plan showing
the actual dimensions and shape of the lot to be built upon, and the location
and dimensions of the existing or proposed building or alteration. The
application shall include existing or proposed building or alteration; existing
or proposed uses of the building and land; the number of families, housekeeping
units or rental units the building is designed to accommodate; conditions
existing on the lot; and such other matters as may be necessary to determine
conformance with and provide for the enforcement of this Zoning Ordinance.
165.14   CONSTRUCTION AND USE TO COMPLY WITH PLANS AND PERMITS.
Building permits issued on the basis of plans and applications approved by the
Zoning Administrator authorize only the use, arrangement and construction set
forth in such approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement or
construction. Use, arrangement or construction at variance with that authorized
shall be deemed a violation of this Zoning Ordinance.
165.15   APPEALS; ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES.
   1.   It is the intent of this Zoning Ordinance that all questions of
interpretation and enforcement shall be first presented to the Zoning
Administrator, and that such questions shall be presented to the Board of
Adjustment only on appeal from the decision of the Zoning Administrator; and
that recourse from the decisions of the Board of Adjustment shall be to the
courts as provided by law.
   2.   It is further the intent of this Zoning Ordinance that the duties of
the Council in connection with this Zoning Ordinance shall not include hearing
and deciding questions of interpretation and enforcement that may arise. The
procedure for deciding such questions shall be as stated in this section and
this Zoning Ordinance. Under this Zoning Ordinance, the Council shall have only
the duties of considering and adopting or rejecting the proposed amendments or
the repeal of this Zoning Ordinance as provided by law. Applications for
special permits for special uses as specified in Section 165.41 and considering
applications for uses listed in the “M” Industrial district shall be directed
to and decided by the Board of Adjustment.
165.16   CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.
   1.   The Council may on its own motion or on petition after public notice
and hearing as provided by law, and after report by the Planning and Zoning
Commission, amend, supplement or change the boundaries or regulations herein or
subsequently established. Any owner or owners of property may present a
petition duly signed and verified, requesting an amendment, supplement or
change in the regulations prescribed for a district or part thereof. Such
petition shall be signed by the owners of at least 50 percent of the property
within 300 feet therefrom, and said petition shall be filed with the Planning
and Zoning Commission.
   2.   The Commission shall make a report to the Council within 60 days from
the date of receipt of such petition. In case the proposed amendment,
supplement or change is disapproved by the Commission, or in case of a protest
against any proposed amendment or change signed by the owners of 20 percent or
more of the area of the lots included in the proposed amendment or change, or
by the owners of 20 percent or more of the property which is located within 200
feet of the exterior boundaries of the property for which the amendment or
change is proposed, such amendment shall not become effective except by the
favorable vote of at least three-fourths of all members of the Council.
165.17   COMPLAINTS REGARDING VIOLATIONS.
Whenever a violation of this Zoning Ordinance occurs or is alleged to have
occurred, any person may file a written complaint. Such complaint stating fully
the causes and basis thereof shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator. The
Zoning Administrator shall record properly such complaint, immediately
investigate and take action thereon as provided by this Zoning Ordinance.
165.18   FEES.
Building permit fees shall be determined by whatever agency is conducting the
inspection, and shall be set by resolution.
(Ord. 408 - May 19 Supp.)
165.19   ENFORCEMENT AND VIOLATIONS.  
All departments, officials and employees of the City who are vested with the
duty of authority to issue permits or licenses shall issue no such permit or
license for any use, structure, or purpose if the same would not conform to the
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
   1.   Violation of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance or failure to
comply with any of its requirements constitutes a misdemeanor. Each day such
violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.
   2.   The owner or tenant of any building, structure, premises or part
thereof and any architect, builder, contractor, agent or other person who
commits, participates in, assists in or maintains such violation may each be
found guilty of a separate offense and suffer the penalties herein provided.
   3.   Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
165.20   BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT CREATED.
A Board of Adjustment is established, which shall consist of five (5) members
appointed by the Council, at least three (3) of which shall be residents of the
City of Earlham. The City must try to have at least one of the remaining
members be an agricultural landowner. The term of office of the members of the
Board shall be five years. Terms shall overlap as provided by law. Meetings of
the Board shall be held at the call of the Chairperson and at such other times
as the Board may determine. The Chairperson, or in his or her absence, the
acting Chairperson may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses.
All meetings of the Board shall be open to the public. The Board shall keep
minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each member on each question, or
if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of
its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately
filed in the office of the Board and shall be a public record. The presence of
three members shall be necessary to constitute a quorum.
(Ord. 436 - Sep. 22 Supp.)
165.21   APPEALS.
   1.   Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person aggrieved, or by any
officer, department, board or bureau of the City affected by any decision of
the Zoning Administrator. Such appeal shall be taken within 10 days by filing
with the Zoning Administrator and with the Board a notice of appeal specifying
the grounds thereof. The Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Board
all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from is
taken.
   2.   An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
from, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Board, after notice of
appeal has been filed with him or her, that by reason of facts stated in the
certificate a stay would in his or her opinion cause imminent peril to life or
property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a
restraining order which may be granted by the Board or by a court of record on
application, on notice to the Zoning Administrator and on due cause shown.
   3.   The fee for appeal is $300 for residential property and $350 for
commercial property at the time the appeal is submitted. Any additional cost
incurred by the City shall be paid by the applicant prior to receiving the
permit. If the variance is not granted, a bill will be sent to the property
owner for the balance of the total cost. If property owner does not pay the
bill within 30 days, the amount will be assessed to property taxes in the same
manner as stated in Code of Ordinances of Earlham Chapter 92.06.
(Ord. 396 - May 18 Supp.)
   4.   The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing on the appeal,
give public notice thereof as well as due notice to the parties in interest,
and decide the same within a reasonable time. At the hearing, any party may
appear in person or by agent or by attorney.
165.22   POWERS OF BOARD.
   1.   Administrative Review. The Board shall have power to hear and decide
appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision
or determination made by the Zoning Administrator in the enforcement of this
Zoning Ordinance.
   2.   Special Exceptions. The Board shall have power to permit the following
exceptions to the district regulations set forth in this Zoning Ordinance,
subject to the requirements of this section:
      A.   To permit erection and use of a building or the use of premises or
vary the height and the regulations in any location for a public service
corporation for public utility purposes or for purposes of public
communication, which the Board determines is reasonably necessary for the
public convenience or welfare.
      B.   To permit the extension of a use into a district where it would
otherwise be prohibited, in a case where a district boundary line is so located
that a lot or plot is in more than one district.
      C.   To hear and decide only such other special exceptions as the Board
is specifically authorized to pass on by the terms of this Zoning Ordinance; to
decide such questions as are involved in determining whether special exceptions
should be granted; and to grant special exceptions with such conditions and
safeguards as are appropriate under this Zoning Ordinance; or to deny special
exceptions when not in harmony with the purpose and intent of this Zoning
Ordinance. A special exception shall not be granted by the Board unless and
until:
         (1)   A written application for special exception is submitted
indicating the section of this Zoning Ordinance under which the special
exception is sought and stating the grounds on which it is requested.
         (2)   Notice of public hearing is given in advance of the public
hearing. The owner of the property for which special exception is sought, or
his or her agent, and any other affected property owners, shall be notified by
mail. Notice of hearing may also be posted on the property for which special
exception is sought.
         (3)   The public hearing is held. Any party may appear in person, or
by agent or attorney.
         (4)   The Board makes a finding that it is empowered under the section
of this Zoning Ordinance described in the application to grant the special
exception, and that the granting of the special exception will not adversely
affect the public interest.
      D.   In granting any special exception, the Board may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Zoning Ordinance.
Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the special exception is granted, shall be deemed a violation of
this Zoning Ordinance.
      E.   The Board may prescribe a time limit within which the action for
which the special exception is required shall be begun or completed, or both.
Failure to begin or complete, or both, such action within the time limit set
shall void the special exception.
   3.   Variances.
      A.   The Board shall have power to authorize upon appeal, in specific
cases, such variance from the terms of this Zoning Ordinance as will not be
contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance would result in
unnecessary hardship. A variance from the terms of this Zoning Ordinance shall
not be granted by the Board unless and until:
         (1)   A written application for a variance is submitted demonstrating
that:
            a.   Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar
to the land, structure or building involved, and which are not applicable to
other lands, structures or buildings in the same district.
            b.   Literal interpretation of the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other
properties in the same district under the terms of this Zoning Ordinance.
            c.   The special conditions and circumstances do not result from
the actions of the applicant.
            d.   Granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Zoning Ordinance to
other lands, structures or buildings in the same district. No nonconforming use
of neighboring lands, structures or buildings in the same district, and no
permitted use of lands, structures or buildings in other districts shall be
considered grounds for the issuance of a variance.
         (2)   Notice of public hearing is given in advance of public hearing.
The owner of the property for which the variance is sought, or his or her
agent, and any other affected property owners shall be notified by mail.
         (3)   The public hearing is held. Any party may appear in person or by
agent or by attorney.
         (4)   The Board makes findings that the requirements of this section
have been met by the applicant for a variance.
         (5)   The Board further makes a finding that the reasons set forth in
the application justify the granting of the variance.
         (6)   The Board further makes a finding that the granting of the
variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this Zoning
Ordinance, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise
detrimental to the public welfare.
      B.   In granting any variance, the Board may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter. Violation of such
conditions and safeguards when made a part of the terms under which the
variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Zoning Ordinance.
      C.   Under no circumstances shall the Board grant a variance to allow a
use not permissible under the terms of this Zoning Ordinance in the district
involved or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this
Zoning Ordinance.
165.23   DECISIONS OF THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the Board may, so long as such action
is in conformity with the terms of this Zoning Ordinance, reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or
determination as ought to be made; and to that end shall have powers of the
Zoning Administrator from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of
three (3) members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order,
requirement, decision or determination of the Zoning Administrator or to decide
in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under
this chapter or to affect any variation in the application of this Zoning
Ordinance.
165.24   APPEALS FROM DECISION OF THE BOARD.
Any taxpayer, or any officer, department, board or bureau of the City, or any
person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of the Board
of Adjustment may present to a court of record a petition, duly verified,
setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, and
specifying the ground of the illegality. Such petition shall be presented to
the court within 30 days after the filing of the decision in the office of the
Board. The court may reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify the
decision up for review.
165.25   STREET FRONTAGE REQUIRED.
Lots containing any building used in whole or in part for residence purposes
shall abut for at least 40 feet on at least one street, except that lots
containing single-family semidetached dwellings shall abut for at least 37½
feet, or have an exclusive unobstructed private easement of access or right-of-
way at least 20 feet wide to a street; and there shall be only one single-
family dwelling for such frontage or easement.
165.26   ACCESSORY BUILDINGS AND GARAGES.
   1.   Accessory buildings or structures, except buildings housing animals or

   7.   No more than three accessory buildings or structures shall be allowed
on any lot within any residential district, one of which shall be a detached
garage.
(Ord. 456 - Mar. 25 Supp.)
   8.   The attachment of an accessory building to a main building as a means
to circumvent the 10-foot rule is not allowed.
   9.   In the R District, a private garage is permitted in the side or rear
yard on the same lot with a dwelling, either as a separate building or in a
separate room within or attached to the dwelling, provided that space for not
more than three motor vehicles is permitted. When wholly or partially within
the limits of the side yard and attached to a principal building, such garage
shall be considered a part of the principal building and shall conform to all
yard and space requirements as specified in this Zoning Ordinance for principal
buildings.
   10.   In the R District, a portable building is permitted in the side or
rear yard on the same lot with a dwelling. It shall not exceed 144 square feet
of floor space and a maximum building height of 10 feet. The portable building
is considered a part of the maximum of 30 percent of the rear yard space
requirement.
165.27   CORNER LOTS.
For corner lots platted after March 20, 1969, the street side yard shall be
equal in width to the setback regulation of the lots to the rear having
frontage on the intersecting street. On corner lots platted and of record on
March 20, 1969, the side yard regulation shall apply to the longer street side
of the lot, except in the case of reverse frontage where the corner lot faces
an intersecting street. In this case, there shall be a side yard on the longer
street side of the corner lot of not less than 50 percent of the setback
required on the lots to the rear of such corner lot, and no accessory building
on such corner lot shall project beyond the setback line of the lots in the

reduce the buildable width of the corner lot facing an intersecting street and
of record, or as shown by existing contract of purchase on March 20, 1969, to
less than 28 feet or to prohibit the erection of an accessory building.
165.28   DWELLING AND PROPERTY OCCUPATION.
   1.   Any business of permitted use conducted at the residential dwelling in
which one lives, or at any other structure on the same premises, shall not
deface and/or alter the dwelling, property and accessory structures to appear
anything other than a home and residential property. The dwelling must be lived
in by the proprietor of the business.
   2.   The dwelling and accessory buildings shall not have storefront-style
windows to display products or merchandise, nor shall such products be visible
to the exterior in any way.
   3.   The dwelling and property occupation shall not be a nuisance to
neighbors with undesirable sight, excessive sound, smell or air pollution nor
cause traffic congestion.
   4.   All who maintain a dwelling and property occupation must apply annually
for a permit to be signed and approved by the Zoning Administrator. This permit
may be revoked at any time by the Zoning Administrator if the dwelling and
property occupation ordinance is not strictly adhered to by the owner of the
business.
   5.   In the event the owner of the business is renting the property and
dwelling, the owner of the property must authorize the execution of such
permit.
165.29   BUILDING LINES ON APPROVED PLATS.
Whenever the plat of a land subdivision approved by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and on record in the office of the County Recorder shows a building
line along any frontage for the purpose of creating a front yard or side street
yard line, the building line thus shown shall apply along such frontage unless
specific yard requirements in this Zoning Ordinance require a greater setback.
165.30   FRONT YARD EXCEPTIONS.
In areas where some lots are developed with a front yard that is less than the
minimum required for the district by this Zoning Ordinance, or where some lots
have been developed with a front yard greater than required by this Zoning
Ordinance, the following rule shall apply. The front yard depth for a principal
building located on a lot within 250 feet, measured along the street line, from
the nearest corner of the lot under consideration to any portion of two or more
lots in the same block, and which lots are occupied by dwellings that front on
the same street as the proposed principal dwelling, shall be the average front
yard depth of such existing dwellings.
   1.   Buildings located entirely on the rear half of a lot shall not be
counted.
   2.   Buildings shall not be required to have a front yard greater than 50
feet or less than that required in the zoning district in which they are
located.
   3.   If no building exists on one side of a lot within 250 feet of the lot
in question, the minimum front yard shall be the same as the building on the
other side.
165.31   OPEN SPACE.
Yards or other open space provided about any building for the purpose of
complying with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance shall not be considered
as providing a yard or open space for any other building. The lot area per
family shall not be reduced in any manner except in conformity with the area
regulations herein established for the district in which such building is
located.
165.32   TEMPORARY DWELLING STRUCTURES.
Temporary buildings, trailers, mobile homes, tents, portable or potentially
portable structures shall not be used for dwelling purposes in any district,
except when located within a mobile home park.
165.33   FACTORY-BUILT (MODULAR) HOUSES.
A modular house is a structure built at a factory and inspected for compliance
with either the Uniform Building Code, the Uniform Plumbing Code, the Uniform
Mechanical Code, and the National Electrical Code or the One and Two-Family
Dwelling Code, each with certain amendments as adopted as the Iowa State
Building Code and mandatory for all such structures placed in Iowa. Compliance
is evidenced by a seal issued by the Building Code Commissioner and attached to
the house and accompanied by a copy of the manufacturer’s certificate of
compliance. A certified modular house shall be permitted anywhere a site-built
or prefabricated site-erected building is permitted, whether meeting the same
code requirements or not. A modular house may be placed on a parcel or lot if
its placement as to yards and setback and minimum square footage meets the
criteria which would apply to a site-built dwelling on the same lot. A modular
house is not a mobile home or mobile home add-on unit.
165.34   MOBILE HOMES (MANUFACTURED HOMES).
A manufactured (mobile) home is a structure built in a factory to the
construction and safety standards established under the authority of 42 U.S.C.,
Section 5403. Where it is proposed to place such a home outside a mobile home
park it shall be converted to real estate. A mobile home located outside of a
mobile home park shall have a minimum width of 24 feet on its shortest side,
and the structure shall meet minimum front, rear and side yard requirements of
the lot in its residential or other permitted zone. The foundation of such
mobile home shall be of an industry approved pier system, a permanent full
foundation of concrete blocks set in mortar, or a poured concrete foundation.
The footings shall be at least below the frost line and 12 inches below the top
of undisturbed earth unless piling is required. The frost line shall be deemed
to be 4½ feet below final finish grade at the foundation, and any backfill
shall be properly compacted to prevent excessive frost penetration. Footings
shall be at least 12 inches wide and 6 inches thick. The mobile home shall be
firmly anchored in accordance with accepted practice. A mobile home not in
place outside a mobile home park on the effective date of the ordinance
codified in this section and not complying with the standards required for
mobile homes since July 1976 under the State Building Code shall not be
permitted to be converted to real estate. Only mobile homes complying with the
standards of safety and construction required since 1976, with a medallion and
certificate of compliance, may be placed outside a mobile home park after the
effective date of the ordinance codified in this section.
165.35   LOTS OF RECORD.
Any lot of record on March 20, 1969, which is located in any residence
district, and which does not comply in area and/or minimum dimensions with the
requirements of the district in which it is located, may be used for a single-
family structure, provided that all setback and other requirements of this
Zoning Ordinance are complied with.
165.36   STRUCTURES PERMITTED ABOVE HEIGHT LIMIT.
The building height limitations of this Zoning Ordinance shall be modified as
follows:
   1.   Chimneys, cooling towers, fire towers, grain elevators, monuments,
penthouses, stacks, stage towers of scenery lofts, tanks, silos, water towers,
ornamental towers and spires, radio or television towers or necessary
mechanical appurtenances may be erected to a height in accordance with existing
or hereafter adopted ordinances.
   2.   Public, semipublic or public service buildings, hospitals, sanitariums,
or schools, when permitted in a district, may be erected to a greater height
than otherwise permitted in the district if the building is set back from each
property line at least one foot, in addition to the minimum yard requirements
for each two feet of additional building height above the height limit
otherwise provided in the district in which the building is constructed.
165.37   DOUBLE FRONTAGE LOTS.
Buildings on double frontage lots extending through from street to street shall
provide the required front yard on both streets.
165.38   REAR YARDS ADJACENT TO ALLEYS.
In computing the depth of a rear yard where the rear yard opens on an alley,
one-half of the alley width may be included as a portion of the rear yard.
165.39   OTHER EXCEPTIONS TO YARD REQUIREMENTS.
Every part of a required yard shall be open to the sky unobstructed with any
building or structure, except for a permitted accessory building in a rear
yard, and except for ordinary projections not to exceed 24 inches including
roof overhang.
165.40   AUTO REPAIR.
Where permitted in commercial districts, all auto repair, equipment repair and
body repair activities must take place within a completely enclosed building.
Outdoor storage is permitted only where incidental to auto repair and body
repair, provided that such storage is completely screened so as not to be
visible from residential areas or public rights-of-way. Screening is subject to
provisions of salvage yard screening requirements of Section 165.46(1)(C)(15).
Any spray painting must take place within structures designed for that purpose.

structure. All site plans and building permits in an F2 District must be
approved by the City Engineer before a building permit can be issued. Costs
incurred in seeking and obtaining such approval shall be paid by the applicant,
in addition to the usual building permit fee.
165.49   FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT.
   1.   Statutory Authority, Findings of Fact, and Purpose.
      A.   Statutory Authority. The Legislature of the State of Iowa has, in
Iowa Code § 414, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to
secure safety from Flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
      B.   Findings of Fact.
         (1)   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic
inundation that can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for Flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the City’s public health, safety, and general
welfare.
         (2)   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are
caused by: (i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood
damages that create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately
elevated or otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect
of obstructions on the flood plain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
      C.   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to protect and preserve the
rights, privileges, and property of the City and its residents, and to preserve
and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort, and convenience of its
residents by minimizing those Flood losses described in Section 165.49(1)(B)(1)
hereof, with provisions designed to:
         (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety,
or property in times of flood, or that cause excessive increases in flood
heights or velocities;
         (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, and public facilities
serving such uses, be protected against flood damage at the start of
construction or upon substantial improvement;
         (3)   Protect individuals from buying lands that may not be suited for
intended purposes due to flood hazard; and
         (4)   Ensure that property owners in the City maintain eligibility to
purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program.
   2.   General Provisions.
      A.   Lands to Which Section Applies. The provisions of this section shall
apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City that are located within
the boundaries of the Floodplain Overlay District as established in Section
165.49(3).
      B.   Rules for Interpretation of Floodplain Overlay District. The
boundaries of the Floodplain Overlay District areas shall be determined by
scaling distances on the official Flood Insurance Rate Map. When an
interpretation is needed as to the exact location of a boundary, the Zoning
Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The Board of Adjustments
shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any
requirement, decision, or determination made by the Zoning Administrator in the
enforcement or administration of this section.
      C.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used, and no
structure shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered,
without full compliance with the terms of this section and other applicable
regulations applying to uses within the jurisdiction of this section.
      D.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this
Section to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions. However, where this Section imposes greater restrictions,
the provision of this Section shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this Section are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
      E.   Interpretation. The provisions of this section shall, in their
interpretation and application, be deemed minimum requirements, be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body, and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
      F.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
Section are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This section does
not imply that areas outside the designated Flood Plain Overlay District areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages. This section shall not create
liability on the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this section or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
      G.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
Section is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this section shall not be affected thereby.
   3.   Establishment of Flood Plain Overlay District. The areas within the
jurisdiction of the City that are special flood hazard areas are hereby
designated as a Flood Plain (Overlay) District and shall be subject to the
standards of the Flood Plain (Overlay) District (as well as those for the
underlying zoning district). The Flood Plain Overlay District boundaries shall
be as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps for Madison County and
Incorporated Areas, City of Earlham, Panel 19121C0025D, 0050D, 0125D, 0150D,
dated June 21, 2017.
(Ord. 389 – Sep. 17 Supp.)
   4.   Standards for Flood Plain Overlay District. All uses must be consistent
with the need to minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable
performance standards. Where 100-year flood elevations and floodway data have
not been provided on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps, the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The applicant will
be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with
sufficient technical information to make such determination.
(Ord. 389 – Sep. 17 Supp.)
      A.   General Provisions. All development within the Flood Plain Overlay
District shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; use
construction methods and practices that will minimize flood damage; use
construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant to flood
damage; and obtain all other necessary permits from federal, State, and local
governmental agencies including approval when required from the Iowa Department
of Natural Resources.
      B.   Residential Buildings. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the 100-year flood level. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill that shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
100-year flood level and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers) may be allowed subject to favorable consideration by the Board of
Adjustment, where existing topography, street grades, or other factors preclude
elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods used must be adequate to support
the structure as well as withstand the various forces and hazards associated
with flooding. All new residential structures shall be provided with a means of
access that will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the 100-year flood.
      C.   Nonresidential Buildings. All new nonresidential structures or
substantially improved nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated a minimum of one foot above the 100-year flood
level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be flood
proofed to such a level. When flood proofing is utilized, a professional
engineer registered in the State of Iowa shall certify that the flood proofing
methods used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities,
impact and uplift forces and other factors associated with the 100-year flood;
and that the structure, below the 100-year flood level is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water. A record of the
certification indicating the specific elevation (in relation to North American
Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are flood proofed shall be
maintained by the Administrator.
      D.   New or Substantially Improved Structures.
         (1)   For all new or substantially improved structures, fully enclosed
areas below the lowest floor (not including basements) that are subject to
flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces
on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs
for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or meet or exceed the following criteria:
            a.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
            b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
            c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access and
low damage potential storage.
         (2)   New or substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
         (3)   New or substantially improved structures must be constructed
with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air- conditioning
equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as
to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding.
      E.   Factory-Built Homes.
         (1)   All factory-built homes, including those placed in existing
factory-built-home parks or subdivisions, shall be elevated on a permanent
foundation such that the lowest floor of the structure is a minimum of one foot
above the 100-year flood level.
         (2)   All factory-built homes, including those placed in existing
factory-built-home parks or subdivisions, shall be anchored to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include,
but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
      F.   Utility and Sanitary Systems.
         (1)   On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located
or designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
         (2)   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system
as well as the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment
facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood
protection equal to or greater than one foot above the 100-year flood level.
         (3)   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water
supply treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with
a level of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the 100-year
flood level.
         (4)   Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
      G.   Storage of Materials and Equipment. Storage of materials and
equipment that are flammable, explosive, or injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the
100-year flood level. Other material and equipment must either be similarly
elevated or: (i) not subject to major flood damage and anchored to prevent
movement due to flood waters; or (ii) readily removable from the area within
the time available after flood warning.
      H.   Flood Control Structural Works. Flood control structural works such
as levees, flood walls, and the like shall provide, at minimum, protection from
a 100-year flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall
provide for adequate interior drainage. In addition, structural flood control
works shall be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
      I.   Watercourse Alterations or Relocations. Watercourse alterations or
relocations must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the
altered or relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations must
be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
      J.   Subdivisions. Subdivisions (including factory-built-home parks and
subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
section. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access that will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the 100-year flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50
lots (whichever is less) shall include 100-year flood level data for those
areas located within the Flood Plain Overlay District.
      K.   Accessory Structures to Residential Uses. Detached garages, sheds,
and similar structures that are incidental to a residential use are exempt from
the base flood elevation requirements where the following criteria are
satisfied.
         (1)   The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential. Its size shall not exceed 600 sq. ft. in size. Those portions of the
structure located less than 1 foot above the BFE must be constructed of flood-
resistant materials.
         (2)   The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage
potential purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure
shall not be used for human habitation.
         (3)   The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building
site so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
         (4)   The structure shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation,
collapse and lateral movement.
         (5)   The structure’s service facilities such as electrical and
heating equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above
the base flood elevation.
         (6)   The structure’s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of Chapter 165.49(4)(D) of this ordinance.
Exemption from the 100-year flood level requirements for such a structure may
result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of the structure
and its contents.   (Ord. 389 – Sep. 17 Supp.)
      L.   Recreational Vehicles. A recreational vehicle is exempt from the
requirements of Section 165.49(4)(E) regarding anchoring and elevating factory-
built homes only if the recreational vehicle:
         (1)   Is located on the site fewer than 180 consecutive days; and
         (2)   Is fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use only if it is on its wheels or jacking system,
is attached to the site only by quick-disconnect-type utilities and security
devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
         (3)   Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than
180 consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements
of Section 165.49(4)(E) regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built
homes.
      M.   Pipeline River and Stream Crossings. Pipeline river and stream
crossings shall be buried in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently
protected to prevent rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
   5.   Administration.
      A.   Appointment, Duties, and Responsibilities of Zoning Administrator.
         (1)   The Zoning Administrator is hereby appointed to implement and
administer the provisions of this section and will herein be referred to as the
Administrator.
         (2)   Duties of the Administrator shall include, but not be limited
to, the following:
            (a)   Review all flood plain development permit applications to
assure that the provisions of this section will be satisfied.
            (b)   Review flood plain development applications to assure that
all necessary permits have been obtained from federal, State and local
governmental agencies including approval when required from the Department of
Natural Resources for flood plain construction.
            (c)   Record and maintain a record of the elevation (in relation to
North American Vertical Datum 1988) of the lowest floor (including basement) of
all new or substantially improved structures in the Flood Plain Overlay
District.
            (d)   Record and maintain a record of the elevation (in relation to
North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which all new or substantially improved
structures have been flood proofed.
            (e)   Notify adjacent communities/counties and the Department of
Natural Resources prior to any proposed alteration or relocation of a
watercourse and submit evidence of such notifications to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
            (f)   Keep a record of all permits, appeals and such other
transactions and correspondence pertaining to the administration of this
section.
      B.   Flood Plain Development Permit.
         (1)   Permit Required. A flood plain development permit issued by the
Administrator shall be secured prior to any flood plain development (any
manmade change to improved and unimproved real estate, including but not
limited to buildings or other structures, mining, filling, grading, paving,
excavation, or drilling operations), including the placement of factory-built
homes.
         (2)   Application for Permit. Application shall be made on forms
furnished by the Administrator, and shall include the following:
            (a)   Description of the work to be covered by the permit for which
application is to be made.
            (b)   Description of the land on which the proposed work is to be
done (lot, block, track, street address, or similar description) that will
readily identify and locate the work to be done.
            (c)   Indication of the use or occupancy for which the proposed
work is intended.
            (d)   Elevation of the 100-year flood.
            (e)   Elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988)
of the lowest floor (including basement) of buildings or of the level to which
a building is to be flood proofed.
            (f)   For buildings being improved or rebuilt, the estimated cost
of improvements and market value of the building prior to the improvements.
            (g)   Such other information as the Administrator deems reasonably
necessary (drawings, site plans, or the like) for the purpose of this section.
         (3)   Action on Permit Application. The Administrator shall, within a
reasonable time, make a determination as to whether the proposed flood plain
development meets the applicable standards of this section and shall approve or
disapprove the application. For disapprovals, the applicant shall be informed,
in writing, of the specific reasons therefor. The Administrator shall not issue
permits for variances except as directed by the City Board of Adjustment.
         (4)   Construction and Use to Be as Provided in Application and Plans.
Flood plain development permits based on the basis of approved plans and
applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in
such approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement, or
construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction different from that
authorized shall be deemed a violation. Prior to the use or occupancy of any
structure, the applicant shall submit certification by a professional engineer
or land surveyor, as appropriate, registered in the State of Iowa, that the
finished fill, building floor elevations, flood proofing, or other flood
protection measures were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this
section.
      C.   Variance.
         (1)   The City Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in
specific cases such variances from the terms of this section that will not be
contrary to the public interest where, due to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this section would result in unnecessary
hardship. Variances must meet the following standards.
            (a)   Variances shall be granted only upon: (i) a showing of good
and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance
would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a
determination that the granting of the variance will not result in increased
flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public
expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or
conflict with existing local codes or ordinances.
            (b)   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
            (c)   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for buildings than that ordinarily required by this section, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance
coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
         (2)   Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board of Adjustment Shall
Be Based. In passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider
all relevant factors specified in other sections of this section, and:
            (a)   The danger to life and property due to increased flood
heights or velocities caused by encroachments;
            (b)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other land or
downstream to the injury of others;
            (c)   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the
ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary
conditions;
            (d)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to Flood damage, and the effect of such damage on the owner;
            (e)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the City;
            (f)   The requirements of the facility for a flood plain location;
            (g)   The availability of alternative locations not subject to
flooding for the proposed use;
            (h)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing
development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future;
            (i)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and flood plain management program for the area;
            (j)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
            (k)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site;
            (l)   The cost of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer,
gas, electrical and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges; and
            (m)   Any other factors relevant to the purposes of this section.
         (3)   Conditions on Variances. Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this
section. Such conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
            (a)   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities;
            (b)   Limitation of periods of use and operation;
            (c)   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed
restrictions;
            (d)   Requirements for construction of channel modifications,
dikes, levees. and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this section; and
            (e)   Flood proofing measures.
   6.   Nonconforming Uses.
      A.   A structure or the use of a structure or premises that was lawful
before the passage or amendment of this section, but does not conform to the
provisions of this section, may be continued, subject to the following
conditions:
         (1)   If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any
future use of the building premises shall conform to this section.
         (2)   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not
be entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
      B.   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless
it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this section. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary, building, or safety codes or regulations, or
the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
designation.
   7.   Penalties for Violation. Violation shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any
person who violates this section or fails to comply with any of its
requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $500.00 or
imprisoned for not more than 30 days. Nothing contained herein shall prevent
the City from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy a violation.
   8.   Amendments. The regulations and standards set forth in this section may
from time to time be amended, supplemented, changed, or repealed. No amendment,
supplement, change, or modification shall be undertaken without prior approval
of the Department of Natural Resources.

   1.   “Block” means an area of land within a subdivision that is entirely
bounded by streets or highways, and/or the exterior boundaries of the
subdivision.
   2.   “Building lines” are shown on all lots intended for residential use of
any character, and on commercial and industrial lots when required by
ordinance. Such building lines shall not be less than required by the Zoning
Ordinance (Chapter 165 of this Code of Ordinances). Where the subdivided area
is not under zoning control, the Commission shall require building lines in
accordance with the needs of each addition.

subdividing or to the land subdivided or the resubdivision of land heretofore
divided or platted into lots or other divisions of land or, if a new street is
involved, any division of land.
   16.   “Surveyor” means a licensed surveyor authorized to practice surveying
by the State of Iowa.
166.03   VARIATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.
Whenever the tract proposed to be subdivided is of such unusual topography,
size, or shape, or is surrounded by such development of unusual conditions that
the strict application of the requirements contained in this chapter would
result in substantial hardships or injustices, the Council, upon recommendation
of the Commission, may vary or modify such requirements so that the subdivider
is allowed to develop the property in a reasonable manner; but so that at the
same time, the public welfare and interest of the City and surrounding area are
protected and the general intent and spirit of these regulations are preserved.
166.04   COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.

have been accepted by the Council as public streets.
166.05   CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS.
Any provisions of these regulations may be changed and amended from time to
time by the Council; provided, however, that such changes and amendments shall
not become effective until after study and report by the Commission and until

publication in a local newspaper of general distribution, or by posting notices
on the tract, or by sending notice to affected property owners by mail. Such
notice shall be given within seven days prior to the public hearing.
166.09   PRELIMINARY PLAT REQUIREMENTS.
The preliminary plat of a subdivision is not intended to serve as a record
plat. Its purpose is to show on a map all facts needed to enable the Commission
to determine whether the proposed layout of the land is satisfactory from the
standpoint of the public interest. The subdivider or representative may call at
City Hall in advance of the preliminary plat in order to discuss the proposed
subdivision and in order to obtain information as to the requirements necessary

plat, final plat or plat of survey, the sub-divider shall be responsible for
any additional fees incurred by the City for such engineering charges.
(Ord. 409 - Nov. 19 Supp.)
166.13   FINAL PLAT; NUMBER OF COPIES AND SCALE.
When and if the preliminary plat is approved, the subdivider shall submit four
copies (three full sized and one no larger than ledger size) of the final plat

subdivision is with their free consent and is in accordance with the desire of
the owners. This certificate must be signed and acknowledged by the owner and
spouse before some officer authorized to take the acknowledgments of deeds.
166.17   DESIGN STANDARDS.
The standards and details of design contained in this section are intended only
as minimum requirements so that the general arrangement and layout of a
subdivision may be adjusted to a wide variety of circumstances; however, in the
design and development of a plat, the subdivider should use standards
consistent with the site conditions so as to assure an economical, pleasant and
durable neighborhood.
   1.   Conformance with Comprehensive Plan. All proposed plats and
subdivisions shall conform to the comprehensive plan of the City.
   2.   Continuation of Existing Streets. Proposed streets shall provide for
continuation or completion of any existing streets (constructed or recorded) in
adjoining property, at equal or greater width, but not less than 60 feet in
width, and in similar alignment, unless variations are recommended by the
Commission.
   3.   Circulation. The street pattern shall provide ease of circulation
within the subdivision as well as convenient access to adjoining streets,
thoroughfares, or unsubdivided land as may be required by the Commission. In a
case where a street will eventually be extended beyond the plat, but is
temporarily dead ended, an interim turnaround may be required.
   4.   Street Intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right
angles as possible.
   5.   Cul-de-Sacs. Whenever a cul-de-sac is permitted, such street shall be
no longer than 600 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a
turnaround having a street property line diameter of at least 100 feet in the
case of residential subdivisions. The right-of-way width of the street leading
to the turnaround shall be a minimum of 60 feet. The property line at the
intersection of the turnaround and the lead-in portion of the street shall be
rounded at a radius of not less than 25 feet. A turnaround diameter greater
than 100 feet may be required by the Commission in the case of commercial or
industrial subdivisions if it is deemed necessary.
   6.   Street Names. All newly platted streets shall be named in a manner
conforming to the prevailing street naming system. A proposed street that is
obviously in alignment with other existing streets, or with a street that may
logically be extended although the various portions be at a considerable
distance from each other, shall bear the same name. Names of new streets shall
be subject to the approval of the Commission in order to avoid duplication or
close similarity of names.
   7.   Physical and Cultural Features. In general, streets shall be platted
with appropriate regard for topography, creeks, wooded areas, and other natural
features which would lend themselves to attractive treatment.
   8.   Half Streets. Dedication of half streets will be discouraged. Where
there exists a dedicated or platted half street or alley adjacent to the tract
to be subdivided, the other half shall be platted if deemed necessary by the
Commission.
   9.   Alleys. Alleys may be required in business areas and industrial
districts for adequate access to block interiors and for off-street loading and
parking purposes. Except where justified by unusual conditions, alleys will not
be approved in residential districts. Dead-end alleys shall be provided with a
means of turning around at the dead end thereof.
   10.   Easements. Easements for utilities shall be provided along rear or
side lot lines or along alleys, if needed. Whenever any stream or important
surface water course is located in an area that is being subdivided, the
subdivider shall, at the subdivider’s own expense, make adequate provision for
straightening or widening the channel so that it will properly carry the
surface water, and shall provide and dedicate to the City an easement along
each side of the stream, which easement shall be for the purpose of widening,
improving, or protecting the stream. The width of such easement shall be not
less than 20 feet, and the total width of the easement shall be adequate to
provide for any necessary channel straightening or relocation.
   11.   Neighborhood Plan. If any overall plan has been made by the Commission
for the neighborhood in which the proposed subdivision is located, the street
system of the latter shall conform in general thereto.
   12.   Unsubdivided Portion of Plat. Where the plat to be submitted includes
only part of the tract owned by the subdivider, the Commission may require
topography and a sketch of a tentative future street system of the unsubdivided
portion.
   13.   Major Thoroughfares. When a new subdivision, except where justified by
limiting conditions, involves frontage on a heavy trafficway, the street layout
shall provide motor access to such frontage by one of the following means:
      A.   A parallel street, supplying frontage for lots backing onto the
trafficway;
      B.   A series of cul-de-sacs or short loops entered from and planned at
right angles to such a parallel street, with their terminal lots backing onto
the highway;
      C.   An access drive separated by a planting strip from the highway to
which a motor access from the drive is provided at points suitably spaced;
      D.   A service drive or alley at the rear of the lots.
Where any one of the above-mentioned arrangements is used, deed covenants or
other means should prevent any private residential driveways from having direct
access to the trafficway.
   14.   Dedication. A deed to the City shall be given for all streets before
the same will be accepted for City maintenance.
   15.   Railroads. If a railroad is involved, the subdivision plan shall:
      A.   Be so arranged as to permit, where necessary, future grade
separations at highway crossings of the railroad;

from it to permit deep lots to back onto the railroad; or form a buffer strip
for park, commercial or industrial use;
      C.   Provide cul-de-sacs at right angles to the railroad so as to permit
lots to back onto them.
   16.   Street Widths. Streets shall have a width and cross-section as shown
in the Comprehensive City Plan for the type of street involved.
   17.   Street Grades. Streets and alleys shall be completed to grades which
have been officially determined or approved by the City Engineer. All streets
shall be graded to the full width of the right-of-way and adjacent side slopes
graded to blend with the natural ground level. The maximum grade shall not
exceed six percent for main and secondary thoroughfares, or 10 percent for
minor or local service streets. All changes in grades on major roads or
highways shall be connected by vertical curves of a minimum length equivalent
to 20 times the algebraic difference between the rates of grades, expressed in
feet per 100, or greater, if deemed necessary by the Engineer; for secondary
and minor streets, 15 times. The grade alignment and resultant visibility,
especially at intersections, shall be worked out in detail to meet the approval
of the Engineer.
   18.   Blocks. No block shall be longer than 1,320 feet. At street
intersections, block corners shall be rounded with a radius of not less than 15
feet; where at any one intersection a curve radius has been previously
established, such radius shall be used as standard.
   19.   Corner Lots. Corner lots shall have a minimum width of 75 feet in
order to permit adequate building setbacks on both front and side streets.
   20.   Double Frontage Lots. Double frontage lots, other than corner lots,
shall be prohibited except where such lots back on to a major street or highway
or except in the case of large commercial or industrial lots.
   21.   Minimum Lot Size. For the purpose of complying with minimum health
standards, the following minimum lot sizes shall be observed:
      A.   Lots which cannot be reasonably served by an existing public
sanitary sewer system and public water mains shall have a minimum width of 100
feet, measured at the building line, and an area of not less than 40,000 square
feet.
      B.   Lots which are not within a reasonable distance of a public sanitary
sewer system but are connected to a public water supply main shall have a
minimum width of 80 feet and an area of 40,000 square feet.
   22.   Side Lot Lines. Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles
to the street or radial to curved streets.
166.18   IMPROVEMENTS.
The subdivider shall install and construct all improvements required by this
section. All required improvements shall be installed and constructed in
accordance with approved specifications and under the supervision and to the
satisfaction of the Council.
   Paving. Minimum paving required is either Portland cement concrete of six-
inch reinforced (4,000 pounds per square inch) or seven-inch non-reinforced
with six-inch integral curb or asphaltic concrete of seven-inch thickness,
five-inch coarse graded binder course, and two-inch fine graded surface course
with six-inch cement concrete curb integral with 24-inch cement concrete gutter
(30 inches overall). Asphaltic concrete must be approved by the Engineer.
   Water. Water mains shall have a minimum diameter of six inches, with larger
sizes for feeder mains. Water mains shall be at least two feet outside of the
curb or traveled roadway on the high side of the street, with a minimum cover
of 48 inches. Water lines shall be available to each lot.
   Sanitary Sewers. Sanitary sewers shall be located at least four feet outside
of the curb or traveled roadway on the side opposite the water main. All house
laterals shall be in before paving of the street. Sanitary sewers shall have a
minimum diameter of eight inches and be made available to each lot. Any plat
that cannot reasonably be served by public sewer shall show results of soil
percolation tests made by the Engineer preparing the plat. Such tests shall be
in accordance with the State Board of Health.
   Storm Sewers. Storm sewers shall have a minimum diameter of 12 inches, and
larger as the increase in drainage area demands. Storm sewers are to be located
on the low side of the street well outside of the curb or traveled roadway
line. Storm drainage facilities shall be provided, such as storm sewers and
intakes and suitable permanent culverts or bridges of a size and design
approved by the Engineer.
   Gas. Gas mains shall be laid on the opposite side of the street from the
water mains and just outside of the curb or traveled roadway line.
   Utility Lines.
      A.   All utility lines except electric lines of a nominal voltage in
excess of 15,000 volts shall be installed underground in residential
subdivisions.
      B.   The subdivider shall be responsible for making the necessary
arrangements with the utility companies for installation of such facilities.
Such utility lines shall be installed in such a manner so as not to interfere
with other underground utilities.
      C.   Incidental appurtenances, such as pad-mounted electrical equipment
and their enclosures, pedestal-mounted terminal boxes, meters and meter
cabinets may be placed above ground but shall be located so as not to be
unsightly or hazardous to the public.
      D.   All underground electrical distribution shall be installed in
accordance with Safety Rules for the Installation and Maintenance of Electric
Supply and Communication Lines, National Bureau of Standards Publication No.
81, and Supplements No. 1 and No. 2 thereto, and with the latest requirements
of the State Utilities Board for such installations; and underground service
entrance conductors shall be in accordance with the current edition of the
National Electric Code and the State Building Code.
      E.   The Council may waive all or part of the requirements of this
subsection if it is determined that soil, topographical or other conditions
make such installations within the subdivision unreasonable or impractical.
Before the Council approves the final plat, all of the foregoing improvements
shall be constructed and accepted by formal resolution of the Council. Before
passage of such resolution of acceptance, the Engineer shall report that such
improvements meet all City specifications and ordinances or other requirements
and agreements between the subdivider and the City. This requirement may be
waived if the subdivider will post a performance bond or certified check with
the Council guaranteeing that such improvements will be constructed within a
period of one year from final acceptance of the plat; however, if the
performance bond is posted, final acceptance of the plat will not constitute
final acceptance by the City of any improvements to be constructed.
Improvements will be accepted only after their construction has been completed,
and no public funds will be expended in the subdivision until such improvements
have been completed and accepted by the City. The Council may waive the
requirements for the construction and installation of some or all of the
foregoing improvements in cases of resubdivisions where only the size, shape
and arrangement of the lots is being changed and no new streets are required,
and in cases of dedications of land or rights-of-way to public use where such
dedication is in excess of the needs of the subdivision and is desired by a
public agency in lieu of a purchase or condemnation proceeding.
 
USE AND MAINTENANCE OF THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
The following information is provided to assist in the use and proper
maintenance of this Code of Ordinances.
DISTRIBUTION OF COPIES
   1.   OFFICIAL COPY. The “OFFICIAL COPY” of the Code of Ordinances must be
kept by the City Clerk and should be identified as the “OFFICIAL COPY.”
   2.   DISTRIBUTION. Other copies of the Code of Ordinances should be made
available to all persons having a relatively frequent and continuing need to
have access to ordinances which are in effect in the City as well as reference
centers such as the City Library, County Law Library, and perhaps the schools.
   3.   SALE. The sale or distribution of copies in a general fashion is not
recommended as experience indicates that indiscriminate distribution tends to
result in outdated codes being used or misused.
   4.   RECORD OF DISTRIBUTION. The City Clerk should be responsible for
maintaining an accurate and current record of persons having a copy of the Code
of Ordinances. Each official, elected or appointed, should return to the City,
upon leaving office, all documents, records and other materials pertaining to
the office, including this Code of Ordinances.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 372.13[4])
NUMBERING OF ORDINANCES
AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
It is recommended that a simple numerical sequence be used in assigning
ordinance numbers to ordinances as they are passed. For example, if the
ordinance adopting the Code of Ordinances is No. 163, we would suggest that the
first ordinance passed changing, adding to, or deleting from the Code be
assigned the number 164, the next ordinance be assigned the number 165, and so
on. We advise against using the Code of Ordinances numbering system for the
numbering of ordinances.
RETENTION OF AMENDING ORDINANCES
Please note that two books should be maintained: (1) the Code of Ordinances.
and (2) an ordinance book. We will assist in the maintenance of the Code of
Ordinances book, per the Supplement Agreement, by revising and returning
appropriate pages for the Code of Ordinances book as required to accommodate
ordinances amending the Code. The City Clerk is responsible for maintaining the
ordinance book and must be sure that an original copy of each ordinance
adopted, bearing the signatures of the Mayor and Clerk, is inserted in the
ordinance book and preserved in a safe place.
SUPPLEMENT RECORD
A record of all supplements prepared for the Code of Ordinances is provided in
the front of the Code. This record will indicate the number and date of the
ordinances adopting the original Code and of each subsequently adopted
ordinance which has been incorporated in the Code. For each supplemented
ordinance, the Supplement Record will list the ordinance number, date, topic,
and chapter or section number of the Code affected by the amending ordinance. A
periodic review of the Supplement Record and ordinances passed will assure that
all ordinances amending the Code have been incorporated therein.
DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPLEMENTS
Supplements containing revised pages for insertion in each Code will be sent to
the Clerk. It is the responsibility of the Clerk to see that each person having
a Code of Ordinances receives each supplement so that each Code may be properly
updated to reflect action of the Council in amending the Code.
AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
The Code of Ordinances contains most of the laws of the City as of the date of
its adoption and is continually subject to amendment to reflect changing
policies of the Council, mandates of the State, or decisions of the Courts.
Amendments to the Code of Ordinances can only be accomplished by the adoption
of an ordinance.
