Pro Tempore, shall preside. In the absence of both, the Council may appoint a
temporary chairperson. The presiding officer shall call the meeting to order,
preserve order and decorum, may have persons creating disorder removed from the
meeting and decide all questions of order subject to an appeal to the Council.
A member called to order shall immediately suspend his or her remarks until
permitted by the presiding officer to explain. If there is no appeal, the
decision of the chair shall be conclusive, but if the member appeals to the
Council from the decision of the chair, the Council shall decide the question
without debate.
      (3)   Quorum. A majority of the Council shall constitute a quorum to
transact ordinary business, but a smaller number may adjourn from time to time,
or any three may compel the attendance of absent members, and upon order
therefrom, the Police Chief shall bring in the absentees. Upon order of the
chair, the Clerk, or in his or her absence, the Deputy City Manager/Finance
Officer, shall call the roll and record the same and preserve it in the minutes
of the proceedings. The name of any member entering the meeting after the roll
call has been taken shall be recorded in the minutes in the proper
chronological order of business. The name of any member leaving the meeting
shall be similarly recorded chronologically.
      (4)   Called meetings.
         (a)   The Mayor may, or upon the request of a majority of the members
of the Council shall, call a special meeting of the Council and set such
reasonable time as the circumstances warrant. All calls shall be made by
personal notice or by leaving written notice at the residence or business
office of the member. The Clerk shall record such notice of service in the
minute book and each member shall subscribe signature to an acknowledgment of
such notice if received.
         (b)   When a special meeting of the City Council shall be called by
the Mayor, or otherwise, the purpose or object of the meeting shall be named in
the call, and no other business except that specified therein shall be
transacted at said special meeting.
      (5)   Order of business. Upon the appearance of a quorum, the Council
shall proceed to the business before them. The order of business shall be as
follows:
         (a)   Reading of the minutes of the last meeting and the approval,
amendment or correction of the same. When copies of the minutes have been
distributed to all Council members in advance of the reading, the Council may
waive the reading and adopt the minutes;
         (b)   Approving the agenda prepared by the Clerk and making any
revisions, deletions or additions, with particular attention to matters raised
by letter, petition or remonstrance;
         (c)   Hearings and lettings on public improvements shall have
precedence, together with resolutions thereon;
         (d)   Consideration of ordinances;

thereof, the Clerk shall call roll, and if a quorum is present, the Council may
officially conduct a meeting. The reading of minutes of the previous meeting
may be dispensed with, in which case such minutes shall be considered at a
subsequent regular meeting and there acted upon. The Council may dispense with
the consideration of claims and limit the receiving of requests and petitions
to those pertinent to the subject of the call or purpose established at a prior
adjournment. Upon approving the agenda for the meeting, the Council shall
proceed in accordance therewith and the order of business established therein.
         (b)   Notice of the time and place of special called meetings shall be
given the news media if time permits. Where an emergency prevents the giving of
such notice, the nature of the emergency shall be stated in the minutes of that
meeting.

less than 80 hours before the convening of the meeting using the agenda. The
Clerk may decline a request of a citizen subject to an appeal to any Council
member who may order such item to be entered into the agenda. No person may
request to appear on the agenda after opening of the meeting unless the
circumstances of the request appear to the Mayor or the Council on the advice
of the City Attorney, to be such as to warrant adding thereto the matter so
requested, and then only at the time of perfecting the agenda. The tentative
agenda shall be dispatched so that it normally will be in the hands of every
Council member not later than 48 hours before the start of the regular meeting
to which it applies, and posted at the city hall at least 24 hours before the

certain purpose only by the unanimous vote of the Council members present at
the meeting.

changed without one week’s previous notice in writing being given of the
proposed change; nor shall any rule be rescinded without a vote of three-
fourths of the members elected to the City Council.

has been seconded. When seconded, the motion shall be stated by the Mayor or
presiding officer before debate. Upon request of the chair or any Council
member, the motion shall be reduced to writing. All resolutions shall be
presented in writing. In all cases where a resolution or a motion is entered in
the minutes of the meeting, the name of the member moving the same and the
member making the second shall be entered. Resolutions shall appear in the
minutes by title only if the Clerk keeps a permanent book of resolutions.
      (11)   Withdrawal of motions. After a motion or resolution is stated by
the chair, it shall be deemed in the possession of the Council, but it may be
withdrawn at any time before decision or amendment.
      (12)   Voting. Voting shall be by “yes” or “no” and shall be recorded by
name in the case of ordinances and resolutions and by the number of “yeses” or
“noes” in the case of ordinary motions. Whenever a member abstains, his or her
vote shall be recorded as an abstention so that the total vote and abstentions
shall equal the number present. At the request of two members, the vote of each
member on any motion shall be recorded in the minutes. No member shall vote on
any question in which he or she has a conflict of interest as defined by Iowa
Code §§ 362.5 and 362.6 unless permitted therein and the provisions thereof for
determining the voting record shall be followed. An abstention shall be deemed
as a “yes” vote except where the member has a conflict of interest, which
conflict shall be stated at the time of abstention.
      (13)   Readings and amendment of ordinances.
         (a)   All proposed ordinances shall have a separate consideration on
three different days unless there is a motion to dispense with the second and/
or third consideration and a three-fourths majority of the Council shall so
approve. Actual reading of the ordinance shall not be required if written
copies are available or unless two or more members request it. An ordinance may
be amended after first or during second consideration and before voting the
ordinance for passage on second consideration. After placing the ordinance on
third and final consideration or voting for dispensing with the second and/or
third consideration, the ordinance may not be amended but shall be voted on for
final passage unless tabled, postponed or referred to a committee. Any proposed
ordinance not voted on for final passage must be returned to second
consideration status if it is to be amended. When a question is postponed
indefinitely, it shall not be again introduced or acted upon by the Council for
the ensuing two months.
         (b)   On motion to “strike out and insert,” the paragraph to be
amended shall first be read as it stands, the words proposed to be struck out,
and those to be inserted, and finally the paragraph as it would stand if so
amended.
         (c)   A motion simply to lay a question on the table is not debatable
but a motion to lay on the table and publish, or any other condition, is
subject to amendment and debate.
      (14)   Motion to reconsider.
         (a)   A motion may be reconsidered at any time during the same meeting
or at the first meeting held thereafter. A motion for a reconsideration being
once made, and decided in the negative, shall not be renewed.
         (b)   A motion to reconsider must be made and seconded by members who
voted in the majority, by those on the prevailing side, or by those who were
absent and did not vote upon the question to be reconsidered.
         (c)   No question shall be reconsidered more than once, nor shall a
vote to reconsider be reconsidered.

made by the Building and Zoning Officer in the enforcement of the zoning
ordinance;
   (B)   Special exceptions. To hear and decide only such exceptions as the
Board of Adjustment is specifically authorized to pass on by the terms of the
zoning ordinance;
   (C)   Variances. To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variances

where, owing to the special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions
of this subchapter would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance from the
terms of this subchapter shall not be granted by the Board of Adjustment unless
and until:
      (1)   A written application for a variance is submitted demonstrating
that:
         (a)   Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to
the land, structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other
lands, structures or buildings in the same district;

actions of the applicant; and
         (d)   Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant
any special privilege that is denied by the zoning ordinance to other lands,
structures or buildings in the same district. No non-conforming use of
neighboring lands, structures or buildings in the same district, and no
permitted use of land, structures or buildings in other districts shall be
considered grounds for the issuance of a variance.
      (2)   The Board of Adjustment shall make findings that the requirements
have been met by the applicant for a variance;
      (3)   The Board of Adjustment shall further make a finding that the
reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance, and
that the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the
reasonable use of land, building or structure;
      (4)   The Board of Adjustment shall further make a finding that the
granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of the zoning ordinance, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or
otherwise detrimental to the public welfare;
      (5)   The application for a variance shall be accompanied by a fee to be
determined by resolution of the City Council; and
      (6)   In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment may prescribe

ordinance.

structure within the corporate limits of the city pursuant of §
150.173.

other waste characteristics require special control, suitable waste monitoring
equipment shall be installed by the user to monitor and record those waste
characteristics being controlled.
      (2)   The sampling manhole shall be accessible to authorized city
personnel on a 24-hour basis, and it shall be constructed in accordance with
plans approved by the Public Works Director. The control structure shall be
installed by the owner at his or her expense and shall be maintained by him or
her so as to be safe, accessible and in operating condition at all times.
      (3)   In its sole discretion, the city may waive the requirement for a
sampling manhole if the user agrees to pay wastewater service charges required
under §
51.11, and that the strength of waste on which the service charge is based on
tests made on similar wastes discharged by other industries of the same type,
if such information is available; if not, by such other methods as the city may
wish to employ. Whatever method is used for finding the strength of the waste,
the determination of the city shall be binding as a basis for charges.

   (A)   The volume of flow used in computing sewer rental charges shall be
based upon actual in situ flow measurements.
   (B)   In the event the city finds it is not practical to measure either the
actual sewage and industrial waste flow or the flow of diverted water, it may
at its discretion approve some other manner of computing or estimating the
amount of water diverted from or discharged to the public sanitary sewerage
system.
   (C)   Also, in the event that the city finds it is not practical to make an
actual measurement of the waste discharge from the premises of the customer
into the public sanitary sewerage system, the city may at its discretion,
accept as the volume of waste discharged from the premises that are shown by
water meters of the city.
   (D)   Where a person discharging industrial wastes into the sanitary sewers
of the city procures any part or all of his or her water supply from sources
other than the municipal utilities, all or part of which is discharged into the
sanitary sewer, the person discharging said waste shall install and maintain,
at his or her expense, water meters of a type approved by the city for the
purpose of determining the proper volume of flow to be charged.
(Prior Code, § 4-4-8) (Ord. 215, passed 3-20-1977)
§ 51.09 TESTING WASTES.
   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of water and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association and
shall be determined at the structure provided, or upon suitable samples taken
at said control structure. In the event that no special control structure has
been required, the control structure shall be considered to be the nearest
downstream control structure in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the water pollution
control works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and
property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether 24-hour
composite of all outfalls of the premises is appropriate or whether a grab
sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD, ammonia and
suspended solids analyses are obtained from a 24-hour composite of all outfalls
whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab samples.)

herein.
         (b)   Measurement by meters. Such rates or charges shall be based upon
the amount of water supplied by the municipal utilities, as shown by the water
meter readings of that company, except for non-metered users. All persons
required to pay the comprehensive sewer service charge established in this
chapter shall receive billing for such charge separately stated on the
municipal utilities’ bill and shall pay such charges to the municipal utilities
as billed. Those users who are billed by the municipal utilities monthly shall
pay their comprehensive sewer user charges monthly.
         (c)   Date due; penalty. All comprehensive sewer user charges are due
and payable within 20 days after the date of billing. Accounts not paid within
20 days will be assessed a delinquency charge of 1.5% per month on each
delinquent invoice.
         (d)   Special rates. Where, in the judgment of the city, special
conditions apply to the use of water to the extent that the application of the
comprehensive sewer user charge or method of measurement would be inequitable
or unfair to either the city or the user, a special rate or method of
measurement shall be established by the city. Such rates or methods of
measurement shall be subject to approval by the city. In such cases, the city
may require that water consumed on the premises concerned shall be separately
metered at the expense of the user, who shall also pay the cost of the reading
of such meters and any increased billing or collecting charges resulting
therefrom.
         (e)   Collection of unpaid charges; notice; establishment of property
lien.
            1.   Comprehensive sewer user charges shall be delinquent when a
charge has been unpaid for a period of two months following the billing date.
            2.   Delinquent sewer charges are a lien against the property
served. When charges become delinquent, the city may terminate service to the
property and/or may certify the delinquent charges to the County Treasurer to
be collected in the same manner as real property taxes, all pursuant to the
provisions of Iowa Code § 384.84.
            3.   a.   Termination of sanitary sewer service to a property or
certification of delinquent sanitary sewer charges to the County Treasurer
shall not be accomplished until ten days after a written notice is sent by
ordinary mail by the city to the account holder, which notice shall include the
amount of the delinquent charges and shall notify the account holder that, if
the charges are not paid in full, service will be terminated and/or that the
amount of the delinquent charges will be certified to the County Treasurer for
collection. The notice shall further notify the account holder that a hearing
may be requested before the City Manager prior to the discontinuance of
service.
               b.   If the account holder is a tenant and if the owner or
landlord of the property has made a written request for notice to the city, the
notice shall also be given to the owner or landlord.
            4.   If the account holder, owner or landlord requests a hearing
before the City Manager, the City Manager shall promptly schedule and hold a

   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the storage, collection,
handling and disposal of waste materials generated in the city; to establish
regulations concerning waste which are consistent with and in compliance with
state and federal requirements; and to protect the community from such hazards
to health, safety and welfare as might otherwise result from the storage,

   (B)   Encourage, promote and accomplish recycling of materials that would
otherwise become solid waste;
   (C)   Maintain and operate a system of solid waste and recyclables
collection and disposal, which is efficient, practical and cost effective;
   (D)   Prevent the accumulation or improper disposal of waste materials;
   (E)   Prevent littering; and

399, passed 3-18-1991; Ord. 521, passed 11-16-1999)
§ 52.02 INTEGRATION WITH STATE STATUTES AND ADMINISTRATIVE RULES.

irreconcilable with any provision of state law or validly enacted state
administrative rules and regulations, the state statutes and rules shall
control.

§ 130.24 THEFT.
   A person commits theft pursuant hereto when that person does any of the
following with regard to property not exceeding $300 in value:
   (A)   Takes possession or control of the property of another, or property in
the possession of another, with the intent to deprive the other thereof;
   (B)   Misappropriates property which the person has in trust, or property of
another which the person has in the person’s possession or control, whether
such possession or control is lawful or unlawful, by using or disposing of it
in a manner which is inconsistent with or a denial of the trust or of the
owner’s rights in such property, or conceals found property, or appropriates
such property to the person’s own use, when the owner of such property is known
to the person. Failure by a bailee or lessee of personal property to return the
property within 72 hours after a time specified in a written agreement of lease
or bailment shall be evidence of misappropriation;
   (C)   Obtains the labor or services of another, or a transfer of possession,
control or ownership of the property of another, or the beneficial use of
property of another, by deception. Where compensation for goods and services is
ordinarily paid immediately upon the obtaining of such goods or the rendering
of such services, the refusal to pay or leaving the premises without payment or
offer to pay or without having obtained from the owner or operator the right to
pay subsequent to leaving the premises gives rise to an inference that the
goods or services were obtained by deception;
   (D)   Exercises control over stolen property, knowing such property to have
been stolen, or having reasonable cause to believe that such property has been
stolen, unless the person’s purpose is to promptly restore it to the owner or
to deliver it to an appropriate public officer. The fact that the person is
found in possession of property which has been stolen from two or more persons
on separate occasions, or that the person is a dealer or other person familiar
with the value of such property and has acquired it for a consideration which
is far below its reasonable value, shall be evidence from which the court or
jury may infer that the person knew or believed that the property has been
stolen;
   (E)   Takes, destroys, conceals or disposes of property in which someone
else has a security interest, with intent to defraud the secured party;
   (F)   (1)   Makes, utters, draws, delivers or gives any check, share draft,
draft or written order on any bank, credit union, person or corporation, and
obtains property or service in exchange therefor, if the person knows that such
check, share draft, draft or written order will not be paid when presented.
      (2)   Whenever the drawee of such instrument has refused payment because
of insufficient funds, and the maker has not paid the holder of the instrument
the amount due thereon within ten days of the maker’s receipt of notice from
the holder that payment has been refused by the drawee, the court or jury may
infer from such facts that the maker knew that the instrument would not be paid
on presentation. Notice of refusal of payment shall be by certified mail, or by
personal service in the manner prescribed for serving original notices.
      (3)   Whenever the drawee of such instrument has refused payment because
the maker has no account with the drawee, the court or jury may infer from such
fact that the maker knew that the instrument would not be paid on presentation.
   (G)   Any act that is declared to be theft by any provision of this code.

   (C)   Such storage shall not exceed a maximum height of six feet.

of any description, air rifles, spring guns, bows and arrows, slings or any
other device capable of firing or launching a missile or projectile which is
potentially dangerous to wildlife or human safety, within the corporate limits
of the city; from outside the corporate limits in a matter causing a projectile
to cross the corporate boundary and enter the airspace above the city limits,

§ 150.021 CONSTRUCTION SITE EROSION CONTROL.
   (A)   Definitions. The definitions set out in §§
154.05(P) are hereby incorporated in this division (A) by reference.
   (B)   Erosion and silt control plan. No person shall engage in any land
disturbing activity, without first providing and then implementing and
following an erosion and silt control plan compliant with this section. This
plan is required before a construction permit shall be issued. The erosion and
silt control plan shall comply with the following directives.
      (1)   Nature of work. The plan must describe the nature and extent of the
work.
      (2)   Silt screen fence. 
         (a)   A silt screen fence shall be installed below the direction of
runoff in a manner so as to be most effective in preventing siltation of soil
onto downstream adjacent properties, streets or into a public lake or storm
sewer.
         (b)   The silt screen fence shall be installed to run a sufficient
length of the land disturbing activity and be blocked on each end to prevent
runoff around the ends of the fence in order to protect the adjacent
properties, streets, public waters or storm sewer from siltation from the
entire land disturbing activity area. Silt fence should normally be spaced so
that not more than one-fourth acre of land drains into 100 feet of silt fence
run. The bottom edge of a silt fence should equal the top elevation of the next
fence downstream, especially when the slope is steep or the flows are
concentrated. The spacing of silt fence on a slope should never be more than
100 feet to keep drainage areas to one-fourth acre per 100-foot of run.
         (c)   The silt screen shall have a minimum width of 24 inches and be
installed in such a manner so that the bottom of the screen is tucked into the
surface of the lot a minimum of six inches by digging a narrow slit and
simultaneously tucking the fabric into the ground and compacting the silt, thus
reducing the chance of piping under the fence.
         (d)   The silt screen fence support posts shall be spaced along the
entire length of the fence with a maximum distance of eight feet between the
posts. Said posts shall extend above the silt screen and be placed into the
ground at a depth consistent with their design and to provide adequate support
of the silt screen.
         (e)   Silt screening shall also be constructed around any storm sewer
or drain intakes that could receive dirt or silt from the land disturbing
activity.
      (3)   Alternative methods of erosion control. An alternative solution to
erosion control and siltation management may be proposed to the Zoning Officer
such as the use of compost blankets. Approved erosion control methods as
defined in the Iowa DNR erosion control manuals (including Construction Site
Erosion Control Manual and How to Control Streambank Erosion) or the Iowa
Stormwater Management Manual may be used if erosion is kept to acceptable
levels and sediment is contained on site. In addition, § 402 of the Clean Water
Act, being 33 U.S.C. § 1342, which contains the national pollutant discharge
elimination system (NPDES) regulations, should be considered.
      (4)   Duration.
         (a)   The silt screen fence or alternative method of erosion control
shall be installed before any land disturbing activity begins, and shall remain
in place and be maintained until all land disturbing activity is completed and
sufficient landscaping or vegetation stabilization exists to prevent runoff.
National pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) considers the site
stabilized when 70% of the soil surface is vegetated.
         (b)   Before the silt screen fence or alternate method of erosion
control is permanently removed, all collected silt at the base of the fencing
must be removed and distributed on the site or disposed of at a site that poses
no continued threat of siltation.
      (5)   NPDES permit required. With a development of one acre or more, the
city shall be provided a copy of the NPDES permit before approval of a plat can
be made.
      (6)   Construction of vehicle exit. Removal of soil, silt and debris from
construction sites shall also be limited by the construction and maintenance
during the duration of the project of a rock or gravel vehicle exit to the site
which shall be of sufficient length and area to significantly limit the amount
of soil, silt and debris carried from the site on the tires of vehicles exiting
the site.
(Prior Code, § 8-1-7) (Ord. 733, passed 11-21-2011) Penalty, see §
150.999
§ 150.022 USE OF CITY REAL PROPERTY AND EASEMENTS.
   (A)   No person shall place, erect or construct any permanent, fixed
improvement or tree on real property of the city, including street right-of-
way, unless pursuant to an infringing use agreement approved by the City
Council.
   (B)   No person shall place, erect or construct any permanent fixed
improvement or tree on real property over which the city has been granted a
permanent easement, except pursuant to an infringing use agreement approved by
the Council or pursuant to the provisions of division (C) below.
   (C)   Fences or surface paving may be placed on lands subject to an easement
granted to the city, but the city, municipal utilities or other franchised
utilities reserve the right to remove, cut or demolish any fence improvements
as required in the reasonable exercise of the easement rights. Damaged surface
paving will normally be replaced by the city or utility. The land owner assumes
all risk of loss or damage and costs arising from the city’s exercise of its
easement rights. (Prior Code, § 8-1-8) (Ord. 889, passed 6-20-2022) Penalty,

§ 152.02 STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   General. The State Legislature has in Iowa Code Chapter 414, as
amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure
safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of
the community.
      (2)   These flood losses, hazards and related adverse effects are caused
by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and the cumulative effect of obstructions on
the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
      (3)   This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing
flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the
Department of Natural Resources.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges and property of the city and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in §
152.02(B)(1) with provisions designed to:
      (1)   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood
flows so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially;
      (2)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities;
      (3)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement;
      (4)   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard; and
      (5)   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.

limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
   (G)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated Floodplain (Overlay) District areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create
liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (H)   Severability. If any section, clause, provision or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.

§ 152.07 FLOODWAY FRINGE (OVERLAY) DISTRICT (FF).
   (A)   Permitted uses. All development within the Floodway Fringe District
shall be permitted to the extent not prohibited by any other ordinance (or
underlying zoning district) and provided applicable performance standards of
the Floodway Fringe District are met.
   (B)   Performance standards. All development must be consistent with the
need to minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance
standards. Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no development may
increase the base flood elevation more than one foot. The applicant will be
responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient
technical information to make such determination.
      (1)   Development. All development shall:
         (a)   Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement;

associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
      (7)   Storage of material and equipment. Storage of materials and
equipment that are flammable, explosive or injurious to human, animal or plant
life is prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or
not be subject to major flood damage and be anchored to prevent movement due to
flood waters; or be readily removable from the area within the time available
after flood warning.
      (8)   Flood control structural works. Flood control structural works such
as levees, flood walls and the like shall provide, at a minimum, protection
from the base flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall
provide for adequate interior drainage. In addition, the Department of Natural
Resources shall approve structural flood control works.
      (9)   Watercourse alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations
must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources must
approve such alterations or relocations.
      (10)   Subdivisions. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and

         (b)   Exemption from the base flood elevation requirements for such a
structure may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of
the structure and its contents.
      (12)   Recreational vehicles.
         (a)   Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of
152.07(B)(5) of this chapter regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built
homes when the following criteria are satisfied:
            1.   The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less
than 180 consecutive days, and,
            2.   The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
         (b)   Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than
180 consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements
of
152.07(B)(5) of this chapter regarding anchoring and elevation

crossings shall be buried in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently
protected to prevent rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
      (14)   Maximum damage potential development. All new or substantially
improved maximum damage potential development shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated a minimum of one foot above the elevation of the
500-year flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be
floodproofed to such a level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional
engineer registered in the state shall certify that the floodproofing methods
used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact
and uplift forces and other factors associated with the 0.2% annual chance
flood; and that the structure, below the 0.2% annual chance flood elevation is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water. A
record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in relation to
North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are floodproofed
shall be maintained by the Administrator. Where 0.2% chance flood elevation
data has not been provided in the flood insurance study, the State Department
of Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The applicant

§ 152.09 APPOINTMENT AND DUTIES OF BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
   (A)   Appeals. Where it is alleged there is any error in any order,
requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative official in
the enforcement of this chapter, the aggrieved party may appeal such action.
The notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board of Adjustment and with the
official from whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason
for the appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to
the Board of Adjustment all the documents constituting the record upon which
the action appealed from was taken.
   (B)   Variance. The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in
specific cases such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be
contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary
hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards:
      (1)   Variances shall only be granted upon a showing of good and
sufficient cause; a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and a determination that the
granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local codes
or ordinances;
      (2)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands;
      (3)   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief;
      (4)   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for structures than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
and such construction increases risks to life and property; and
      (5)   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
   (C)   Hearings and decisions of the Board of Adjustment.
      (1)   Hearings. Upon the filing with the Board of Adjustment of an appeal
or a request for a variance, the Board shall hold a public hearing. The Board
shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing and give public notice thereof, as
well as due notice to parties in interest. At the hearing, any party may appear
in person or by agent or attorney and present written or oral evidence. The
Board may require the appellant or applicant to provide such information as is
reasonably deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or
evaluation of a professional engineer or other expert person or agency,
including the Department of Natural Resources.
      (2)   Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal or
variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an appeal, the Board may, so
long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter,
reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement,
decision or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in
writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision.
In granting a variance, the Board shall consider such factors as contained in
this section and all other relevant sections of this chapter and may prescribe
such conditions as contained in division (C)(2)(b) below.
         (a)   Factors upon which the decision of the Board of Adjustment shall
be based. In passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider
all relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
            1.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights
or velocities caused by encroachments;
            2.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others;
            3.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the
ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary
conditions;
            4.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
            5.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the city;
            6.   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location;
            7.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to
flooding for the proposed use;
            8.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing
development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future;
            9.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for the area;
            10.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
            11.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site;
            12.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer,
gas, electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and bridges; and
            13.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
chapter.
      (b)   Conditions attached to variances. Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this
chapter. Such conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
            1.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities;
            2.   Limitation of periods of use and operation;
            3.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed
restrictions;
            4.   Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees and other protective measures; provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this chapter; and
            5.   Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the
flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration,
rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated
with the regulatory flood. The Board of Adjustment shall require that the
applicant submit a plan or document certified by a registered professional
engineer that the floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory
flood protection elevation and associated flood factors for the particular
area.
   (D)   Appeals to the court. Any person or persons, jointly or severally,
aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Adjustment may present to a court of
record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal,
in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition
shall be presented to the court within 30 days after the filing of the decision
in the office of the Board.

(Prior Code, § 9-13-2A) (Ord. 438, passed 3-15-1993; Ord. 471, passed 8-5-1996)
§ 154.04 INFORMATION REQUIRED; PRELIMINARY; FINAL PLAT.
   (A)   Preliminary plat. In seeking to subdivide land, the owner shall submit
four copies of a preliminary plat to the Planning and Zoning Commission before
the submission of the final plat. The preliminary plat shall be drawn to scale
and shall show the proposed location and width of streets, lot lines and
dimensions of each proposed lot. The plat shall also show surrounding streets,
lots, water sources, sewers and water mains. The scale, of such preliminary
plats shall not be less than one inch to 100 feet. The developer shall provide
a topographical map of the property showing contour intervals of not more than
five feet or as the Commission may require. All elevations shall be referenced
to city datum. Any plat not containing all information specified above shall
not be considered by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (B)   Final plat. A final plat on polyester material and three prints
thereof, and the plat on electronic media compatible with the city’s computer
hardware and software, shall be submitted to the city. It shall show:
      (1)   The boundaries of the property;

(Prior Code, § 9-13-3) (Ord. 103, passed 7-16-1962; Ord. 226, passed 7-2-1979;
Ord. 361, passed 7-5-1988; Ord. 423, passed 8-17-1992; Ord. 471, passed 8-5-
1996)
§ 154.05 MINIMUM STANDARDS OF DESIGN; DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Approval. No preliminary or final plat of a subdivision shall be
approved by either the Planning and Zoning Commission or by the Council unless
it conforms with the minimum standards and requirements contained in this
chapter.
   (B)   Acre subdivision. Whenever the area is divided into lots containing
one or more acres and there are indications that such lots will eventually be
resubdivided into small building lots, consideration must be given to the
street and lot arrangement of the original subdivision so that additional minor
streets can be opened which will permit a logical arrangement of smaller lots.
   (C)   Relation to adjoining street system. The arrangement of streets in new
subdivisions shall make provisions for the continuation of the principal
existing streets in adjoining additions (or their proper projections where
adjoining property is not subdivided) insofar as they may be necessary for
public requirements. The width of such streets in new subdivisions shall not be
less than the minimum street width established in this code. The street and
alley arrangement must also be such as to not cause hardship to owners of
adjoining property when they plat their land and seek to provide for convenient
access. Whenever there exists a dedicated half-street or alley adjacent to the
tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street or alley shall be
dedicated.
   (D)   Street width.
      (1)   The widths for a major street shall not be less than 66 feet.
      (2)   The minimum width for a minor street shall be 60 feet.
   (E)   Alleys. The minimum width of an alley in a residential block shall be
16 feet. (Alleys are not recommended for residential districts except under
unusual condition.)
   (F)   Easements. Public utility easements not less than ten feet in width
shall be provided along and adjacent to each street or alley included in the
plat and all such utilities will be placed in these easements whenever
practical. Such additional easements as may be necessary and appropriate shall
also be included in a plat.
   (G)   Length in blocks. No block shall be longer than 900 feet between
street lines, except when special conditions make a longer block more
desirable.
   (H)   Width of blocks. The width of blocks shall not be more than 300 feet,
except that when such requirements would entail unusual and substantial
difficulties or hardships or when it is desired to provide a development
containing large residential lots, the Planning and Zoning Commission and the
Council may modify such requirements and allow the subdivider to plat blocks of
other widths.
   (I)   Terminal streets. Terminal residential streets or cul-de-sacs may be
established where necessary to afford access to all lots. No terminal street
may be platted longer than 500 feet and all such terminal streets shall
terminate in a circular open space having a minimum diameter of 100 feet.
   (J)   Lot lines. All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to straight
street lines, or radial to curved street lines, unless a variation of this rule
will give a better street and lot plan. Lots with double frontage shall be
avoided.
   (K)   Size and shape of lots. The minimum dimensions for rectangular lots
shall be 66 feet in width, the minimum dimensions for a cul-de-sac or curved
lots shall be 60 feet in width at the building line, and in no case shall a lot
that is to be used for residential purposes contain less than is required by
the lot area regulation of the zoning district in which the property is
located. A portion of each platted lot not less than 66 feet in dimension shall
abut a public street or public way.
   (L)   Corner lots.
      (1)   All corner lots shall have extra widths sufficient to permit the
maintenance of building lines on both the front and side streets as required by
the applicable zoning provisions.
      (2)   Lots on major street intersections and at all other points likely
to be dangerous shall have a radius of not less than 15 feet at the street
corner; on business lots a chord may be substituted for the circular arc.
   (M)   Easements along streams. Whenever any stream or important surface
water course is located in an area that is being subdivided, the subdivider
shall make adequate provision for straightening or widening the channel so that
it will properly carry surface water and shall provide and dedicate to the city
an easement along each side of the stream, which easement shall be for the
purpose of widening, improving or protecting the stream. The width of such
easement shall not be less than ten feet from each bank of the stream, and the
total width of the easement shall be adequate to provide any necessary channel
relocations and straightenings.
   (N)   Improvements. It is the determination of the City Council, in
furtherance of the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the
city, that all new subdivisions shall have the benefit, where feasible, of the
following improvements: integral monolithic paved concrete street and curb,
sanitary and storm sewers, water mains and fire hydrants, electric service and
street lighting, and access to parks and green areas. Therefore, no final plat
of any subdivision shall be finally approved until one or more of the following
alternative methods of ensuring the construction of required improvements has
been accomplished:
      (1)   Construction of said improvements in accordance with city
specifications prior to approval of the final plat;
      (2)   In regard to integral monolithic paved concrete street and curb,
sanitary and storm sewers, and water mains and fire hydrants, the developer may
meet the requirements for final plat approval by posting with the city a surety
bond or cash in a supervised escrow account conditioned upon construction of
all required improvements by a date approved by the Council and stated in said
surety bond or escrow agreement. The amount of the surety bond or escrow
deposit shall not be less than 110% of the estimated cost of the uncompleted
improvements. If the improvements are not completed within the specified time,
the city may require performance by the surety or use the funds deposited in
escrow, or any necessary portion thereof, to complete construction of the
improvements. The Council shall have the authority and discretion to establish
different dates for the construction of each of the improvements;
      (3)   (a)   Subject to the approval of the Council, in its discretion,
the city and the developer may enter into a development agreement which may
provide for the construction and installation of integral monolithic paved
concrete street and curb, sanitary and storm sewers, and water mains and fire
hydrants in the development by the city and which may provide for the
collection of utility fees, connection fees or the imposition of special
assessments to recover or offset all or part of the cost of the improvements
constructed or installed by the city.
         (b)   In evaluating any such proposed development agreement, the City
Council shall consider the following factors:
            1.   The benefit to the city of the proposed development;
            2.   The apparent need or demand for the development proposed;
            3.   The cost and feasibility of extending sanitary sewer, storm
sewer and water mains to serve the development;
            4.   The likelihood that the city will recover its costs or receive
benefit from utility charges, connection fees, special assessments or increased
property tax revenue as the result of the development;
            5.   The quality and extent of security provided to the city that
the costs to be incurred by the city will be recovered or that commensurate
benefits will be received; and
            6.   Any other relevant factors.
      (4)   In regard to electrical service and street lighting, the developer
may provide to the city the certification of the provider of electrical service
to the subdivision establishing that appropriate arrangements have been made
between the developer and the provider of electrical service such that the
provider of electrical service to the subdivision guarantees and warrants that
necessary electrical services and street lighting will be constructed in the
subdivision by a date stated in the certification and approved by the Council;
      (5)   The regulations and standards for the improvements required herein
shall be as follows.
         (a)   Grading and improvements of streets. Integral monolithic paved
concrete street and curb constructed in any subdivision shall conform to the
city’s specifications throughout the subdivision.
         (b)   Sewers. A lateral connection to the sanitary sewer main shall be
extended to each lot line. Storm sewer inlets shall be designed and located as
needed to serve the subdivision. Installations of sanitary and storm sewers
shall be in accordance with the standards and specifications of the city. The
certification of a licensed engineer that sewer improvements have been
completed pursuant to city specifications shall be filed with the city upon
completion of the improvements.
         (c)   Water mains and fire hydrants. The development shall cause water
mains, fire hydrants and appurtenances to be installed. A lateral connection to
the water main shall be extended to each lot line. Such installments shall be
in accordance with the standards and specifications of the Water Department.
The location of all fire hydrants shall be approved by the Water Department.
The certification of a licensed engineer that water mains, service lines and
hydrants have been completed pursuant to utilities’ specifications shall be
filed with the city upon completion of the improvements.
         (d)   Electrical service and street lighting. The developer shall
install electrical service to each lot in the subdivision and shall provide for
street lighting. Such electrical service and street lighting shall be designed,
constructed and installed pursuant to the standards and regulations established
by the Board of Trustees of the municipal utilities, or if electrical service
is to be provided by an entity other than municipal utilities, according to the
standards and regulations imposed by the Public Works Director.
         (e)   Inspection during installation. Periodic inspection during the
installation and construction of improvements shall be made by the Public Works
Director, or his or her duly authorized agent, in order to assure conformity
with the approved plans and specifications. The developer shall notify the
proper administrative officer when each phase of the installation is completed
and ready for inspection.
      (6)   (a)   As convenient access to parks and recreational areas and the
preservation of green space is a significant benefit to owners and occupants of
residential properties, each proprietor of a plat located in the A or B
Residential Zoning District of the city shall consider including parks,
recreational areas and green space in a proposed plat for the benefit of owners
and occupants of property in the subdivision.
         (b)   Such areas may be established and maintained by the proprietor,
by an organization or association of property owners in the subdivision or may,
upon approval of the Park Board, be dedicated to and accepted by the city.
      (7)   The construction of new sidewalks, in accordance with city
specifications, is required when a lot in a residential subdivision platted
after July 16, 2012, is improved, unless this requirement is waived by specific
action of the City Council. Sidewalk construction shall be a requirement of a
building permit and shall be accomplished within the building permit.
   (O)   Trails. The proprietor of a subdivision plat shall consult the current
master plan maintained by the city for the development of trails in the city.
If the master plan indicates the planned development of trails in the area to
be platted, the plat shall include a ten-foot expansion of major street right-
of-way to accommodate the future placement of a trail. The proprietor of a plat
shall include, in the application for plat approval, a statement confirming
that the city’s master trail plans have been considered and that the plat
includes additional right-of-way for trails, if required, consistent with the
master plan.
   (P)   Stormwater management.
      (1)   Definitions.    For the purpose of this division (P), the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         EROSION. The detachment, transportation and deposition of soil
particles by water or wind. Sheet erosion, rill erosion, gully erosion, lake
bank and stream bank erosion and streambed erosion are common types of EROSION
that create sediment laden runoff, which moves sediment to a point of
deposition down gradient from its point of origin.
         IMPERVIOUS SURFACES. Surfaces through which water cannot penetrate.
IMPERVIOUS SURFACES are mainly constructed surfaces, rooftops, sidewalks,
patios, roads and parking lots covered by impenetrable materials such as
asphalt, concrete, brick and stone. These materials seal surfaces, repel water
and prevent precipitation and meltwater from infiltrating soils. Soils
compacted by urban development are also highly impervious.
         LAND DISTURBING ACTIVITY. Any earth movements that alter the surface
of the land that may result in soil erosion from wind and water and the
movement of sediment and sediment related pollutants off site, including, but
not limited to, grading, topsoil removal, road or bank cutting, waterway
construction or enlargement, excavation, filling or stripping of vegetation, or
creation of a new subdivision. The following activities are excluded from this
definition:
            1.   Excavation, filling or a combination thereof involving less
than three cubic yards and tilling, vegetation and/or tree cover removal from
an area less than 1,000 square feet;
            2.   Tilling, planting or harvesting of agricultural, horticultural
or forest crops;
            3.   Minor activities, such as residential gardening, landscaping,
repairs and maintenance work;
            4.   Installation of public utility lines and connections, fence
posts, signposts, telephone poles, electric poles and other kinds of posts or
poles;
            5.   Installing septic tanks and drainage fields, unless these are
to serve a building whose construction is a land disturbing activity;
            6.   Emergency work to protect life or property; and
            7.   Construction, relocation, alteration or maintenance of public
improvements by a public body.
         LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID). Stormwater control strategies that
combine resource conservation and a hydrologically functional site design with
pollution prevention measures to reduce development impacts to better replicate
natural watershed hydrology and water quality. Using several strategies, LID
controls runoff discharge, volume, frequency and quality to mimic pre-
development runoff conditions. Stormwater best management practice (BMP)
techniques and/or structures, as defined in the Iowa Stormwater Management
Manual, shall be incorporated to remove 80% of the total suspended solids
(TSS). These development practices shall address water quality volume of 1.25
inches of rainfall in a 24-hour period. Examples of low impact development
techniques include:
            1.   Better site design;
            2.   Bioretention cells;
            3.   Bioswales; and
            4.   Rain gardens.
         NATIONAL POLLUTANT DISCHARGE ELIMINATION SYSTEM (NPDES). Section 402
of the U.S. Clean Water Act, being 330 U.S.C. § 1342, contains the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) regulations. The key aspect of
this section is that any land disturbing activity that impacts one acre or more
is required to obtain an NPDES permit from DNR. The application process
requires that the applicant certify that an adequate stormwater pollution
prevention plan (SWPPP) has been developed for the site.
         PERMEABLE PAVEMENT. A breathable pavement surface that allows water to
flow freely through it, filtering water as it flows and draining into an
underlying bedding of additional filters.
         PERVIOUS SURFACES. A ground cover through which water can penetrate at
a rate comparable to that of water through undisturbed soils. Examples include
turf systems and pervious pavers.
            1.   Concrete pavers/Uni Eco-Stone. Interlocking concrete paving
blocks separated by holes (pores) that are filled with gravel. This grid paving
system is designed for commercial and residential vehicle load applications.
Drainage openings in the paving surface allow stormwater to infiltrate.
            2.   Concrete (open cell) pavers/Turfgrid. The Turfgrid paving
system offers an open cell concrete structure with 40% open area designed to be
planted with turf. The system protects turf roots and soil from compaction due
to foot and vehicle traffic.
            3.   Recycled plastic pavers/Grasspave. Grasspave is similar to the
Turfgrid system (above) which provides for turf planting, but is manufactured
with 100% recycled plastic. This paving system offers load bearing strength
while protecting vegetation root systems from compaction. Open cells enable
root development and storage capacity for rainfall from storm events.
         SEDIMENT. Detached particles of soil that move via an erosion process.
         SILT SCREEN. A fencing screen material manufactured for the purpose of
capturing and retaining soil, silt and sediment from water and gravity runoff
from a land slope. SILT SCREEN supported by posts to form a continuous soil,
silt or sediment barrier is called a silt screen fence.
         SILTATION. The deposition of sediment moving via the erosion process.
Deposition is usually considered to occur off site from where the erosion that
is generating the sediment is occurring.
      (2)   Stormwater management. For all new subdivisions which include
property within zoning districts, CBD, C-1, C-2, D, E or MH, a stormwater
management plan compliant with this division (P)(2) shall be required,
implemented and followed. The following guidelines apply:
         (a)   The stormwater management plan shall include, but not be limited
to, the following: proposed final grading conditions with explanation of how
adjacent areas will be impacted by grading and compaction, current natural
drainage and how it will be impacted after completion, vegetative map with
existing vegetation before and after construction and stormwater management
system to be used during and after construction;
         (b)   The plan shall provide for management of water quality for
construction activities and for post-construction conditions;
         (c)   The plan shall minimize the impact of stormwater on adjacent and
downstream properties;
         (d)   The plan shall be developed to comply with the Iowa Stormwater
Management Manual and shall use a design rainfall event of 1.25 inches in 24
hours for computing water quality volume (WQv);
         (e)   Low impact development is encouraged, and should be incorporated
into the plan unless the site is not suitable in supporting low impact
development practices;
         (f)   It is recommended that 30% of the original open space of the
property be designed to manage stormwater;
         (g)   The use of impervious surfaces should be mitigated with low
impact development designs to assist in stormwater management on the property.
The use of pervious surfaces should be emphasized. The use of pervious surfaces
for parking to enhance low impact development stormwater management is
encouraged. For impervious parking areas, as a rule of thumb, an area equal to
10% of the parking area is recommended, to incorporate rain gardens,
bioretention cells or grass swale conveyances;
         (h)   This stormwater management plan shall be designed by a licensed
engineer; and
         (i)   For lots exceeding three acres, the post-development runoff rate
resulting from 1.25 inches of rain in a 24-hour period shall not exceed 125% of
the pre-development runoff rate; for lots not exceeding three acres, the post-
development runoff rate for rainfall not exceeding 1.25 inches of rain in a 24-
hour period shall not exceed 200% of the pre-development runoff rate.
      (3)   Consultant. The city may contract with a qualified consulting
engineer to review, comment and advise the city as to any stormwater management
plan that has been submitted for review. All costs associated with such a
consultant shall be borne by the developer.

period of more than 30 days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to

effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that could not be built

coverage, height, yards or other characteristics of the structure or its
location on the lot such structure may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
      (1)   No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which
increases its non- conformity. Such structures may be enlarged or altered in a
way which does not increase its non-conformity.
      (2)   Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of
more than 50% of its 100% valuation, it shall be repaired or reconstructed only
in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatsoever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
   (D)   Non-conforming uses of structures and land. Where a lawful use of a
structure, or of a structure and land in combination exists at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that would not be permitted in
the district under the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may be continued
so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
      (1)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this
chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
      (2)   Any non-conforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which was manifestly arranged or designed for such use, and which
existed at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use
shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
      (3)   If no structural alterations are made, any non-conforming use of
structure, or structure and land in combination, may be changed to another non-
conforming use of the same or a more restricted classification provided that
the Board of Adjustment by making findings in the specific case, shall find
that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the
district than the existing non-conforming use. In permitting such change, the
Board of Adjustment may require conditions and safeguards in accord with the
purpose and intent of this chapter. Where such non-conforming use of a
structure, land or structure and land in combination is hereafter changed to a
more conforming use, it shall not thereafter be changed to a less conforming
use.
      (4)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a non-conforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located, and the
non-conforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
      (5)   When a non-conforming use of a structure, or structure and land in
combination, is discontinued or ceased to exist for a period of more than 90
days, the structure, or structure and land in combination, shall not thereafter
be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it
is located.
      (6)   Where non-conforming use status applied to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the non-
conforming status of the land.
   (E)   Repairs and maintenance. 
      (1)   On any building devoted in whole or in part to any non-conforming
use, work may be done in any period of 12 months on ordinary repairs, or on
repairs or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing to an
extent not exceeding 50% of the 100% valuation of the building; provided that
the cubic content of the building as it existed at the time of passage or
amendment of this chapter shall not be increased.
      (2)   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof
declared to be unsafe by an official charged with protecting the public safety
upon orders of such official.
   (F)   Change of tenancy or ownership. There may be a change of tenancy,
ownership or management of any existing non-conforming use of land, of
structures or of structures and land in combination. However, industrial uses
located in residential zones may not be allowed to continue after a change in
ownership.
   (G)   Alteration, extension or reconstruction. All other provisions of this
chapter notwithstanding, any residential structure, including single-family
residential, two-family residential, duplex residential, group residential and
multi-family residential, which is a non-conforming use by virtue of its
location in a zoning district in which such a use is not permitted, may be
altered, extended or reconstructed as follows.
      (1)   Such non-conforming residential structures may be altered, extended
or reconstructed to the extent such alteration, extension or reconstruction
would be permitted under this chapter if the structure were located in the A
Residential District established under the zoning ordinance.
      (2)   This division (G) shall not authorize the change of the use of the
structure to any non-conforming use other than residential, nor to authorize
the expansion of the non-conforming use, except as such expansion would be
permitted if the structure were located in the A Residential District. (Prior

§ 155.027 SUPPLEMENTAL USE REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. These provisions apply to specific use classifications in
addition to regulations established by the district regulations. In the event
of any conflict in provisions, the more restrictive provision shall apply
unless specifically indicated to the contrary.
   (B)   Zero lot line development (townhouse and duplex regulations).
      (1)   Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to allow for the
development of single-family, duplex or multi-lot townhouse dwellings on
property with design standards prescribed to allow for zero side lot line
setbacks. This concept is intended to provide more usable yard area and provide
development flexibility relating only to side yard setbacks. Any zero lot line
development approval under this section shall be restricted to development as
prescribed herein.
      (2)   Firewall regulations. Any zero side lot line development,
including, but not limited to, townhouse or duplex common walls, shall comply
with the firewall regulations of the International Building Code pertaining to
any joint building wall located at the common property line.
      (3)   Zero lot line development in new subdivisions. Zero lot line side
yards allowing for the placement of a building or structure on a side property
line may be approved at the time of preliminary plat or amendment, or any
manufactured home park approval or amendment. On such zero lot line
developments, the minimum required front and rear yard setback requirements
shall be maintained; and the side yard opposite of the zero lot line side shall
maintain setback requirements as identified in this chapter. Minimum lot width
and area requirements for newly platted parcels shall be limited to:
 
Central Business District - no minimum lot width 4,000 square feet lot area
Mobile Home District - no minimum lot width      4,000 square feet lot area
Other zoning districts - 40 feet lot width       4,000 square feet lot area
Residential zoned lots - 40 feet lot width       4,000 square feet lot area
 
      (4)   Zero lot line development in existing subdivisions.
         (a)   Owners of a single tract or parcel wishing to split the property
for purposes of a zero lot line development may do so, subject to the
requirements of this division (B)(4)(a). Minimum lot width and area
requirements for parcels and lots within existing subdivisions shall be limited
to:
 
Other zoning districts - no minimum lot width 4,000 square feet lot area
Residential zoned lots - 25 feet lot width    2,500 square feet lot area
 
         (b)   If lot width or area requirements cannot be accommodated, such
zero lot line development may be granted special exception status by the Zoning
Board of Adjustment.
      (5)   Zero lot line development for single-family or duplex residential.
Zero lot line development for single-family or duplex residential may only have
one common property line. Zero lot line for multiple-family residential,
townhouse developments or commercial properties may be a series of lots in a
row upon which each parcel has zero lot line on each side in order to
accommodate multiple building units in a row. In any case, the end unit in any
proposed development shall have the minimum required side yard. In the case of
a corner lot, the end unit in a zero lot line development shall have a side
yard setback the same distance as the front yard setback for the zoning
district in which the property is located. Any lot divided for zero lot line
development shall maintain a minimum of 25 feet in width and 2,500 square feet
in lot size.
      (6)   Utilities. When zero lot line development is approved for any
development, each portion of a property, parcel or tract effectively split by
the zero lot line shall be provided with a separate water meter, water shut-
off, electric meter, gas meter (if applicable), sewer main or septic system (as
applicable) wholly contained on the lot and dedicated to serve each individual
dwelling or building.
      (7)   Maintenance agreement. For any building sharing a zero lot line, a
duplex agreement, party wall agreement or construction maintenance agreement
shall be prepared and filed with the city between the owners of the zero lot
line lots. Such agreement shall be recorded in the County Recorder’s office.
The purpose of such agreement is to identify responsibilities and access for
construction, maintenance and repairs of the dwellings or buildings located and
sharing the zero lot line.
   (C)   Home occupations. 
      (1)   An accessory use conducted entirely within a dwelling unit, which
is clearly incidental to the use of the structure for residential purposes and
does not change the residential character of the site.
      (2)   Home occupations accessory to the residential use shall be subject
to the following limitations:
         (a)   The residential character of the building must be maintained;
         (b)   Only one unrelated person living outside the residence and
members of the immediate family may be employed in the home occupation;
         (c)   The use must be conducted as a secondary use and in such a
manner as not to give an outward appearance nor manifest any characteristics of
a business in the ordinary meaning of the term. The occupation must be
conducted entirely within the dwelling which is a bona fide residence of the
practitioners, or within an attached garage;
         (d)   The use must not infringe upon the right of neighboring
residents to enjoy peaceful and healthy occupancy of their home for which
purpose the residential district was created and primarily intended;
         (e)   The occupation shall not produce external noise, vibration,
smoke, dust, odor, heat, glare, fumes, electrical interference or waste runoff
outside the dwelling unit or on the property surrounding the dwelling unit;
         (f)   Has no exterior display, no exterior storage of materials and no
other exterior indication of the home occupation or variation from the
residential character of the principal building;
         (g)   May have no more than one, flush mounted, non-illuminated sign
not exceeding six square feet;
         (h)   The home occupation shall not generate customer related
vehicular traffic substantially in excess of the normal anticipated residential
traffic;
         (i)   No more than 25% of the total floor area of the principal
building may be utilized by the home occupation. However, this regulation shall
not apply to daycare services;
         (j)   No equipment or materials associated with the home occupation
shall be displayed or stored where visible from anywhere off the premises;
         (k)   Music lessons, when operated as a home occupation shall be
limited to two students at any one time. Dance lessons, when operated as a home
occupation shall be limited to no more than four students at any one time; and
         (l)   Nothing herein shall be construed to allow the following
businesses or occupations as home occupations: animal hospitals, animal
breeding, clinics, hospitals, contractor’s yards, junkyards, restaurants,
rental outlets, vehicle repair shops or massage parlors. However, a massage
therapist licensed pursuant to the provisions of Iowa Code Chapter 152C shall
be permitted to engage in the practice of massage therapy as a home occupation,
subject to the general home occupation regulations. Daycare for more than six
children shall not be allowed as a home occupation. Children regularly residing
in the home shall not be counted in computing this limitation.

greater.
         (d)   The foregoing provisions notwithstanding, on residential lots in
the B and C-1 Zoning Districts, there may be constructed not more than two
accessory buildings of sufficient area to provide one vehicle storage space for
each dwelling unit and one additional space of the same size for general
storage.
         (e)   On lots not included in the A or B Residential Zoning District,
and not used for residential purposes, accessory structures are permitted
subject to the development regulations applicable in the zoning district.
         (f)   Lots used for residential purposes in the A, B, B-1 and C-

overhangs, eaves, gutters or other features that project beyond the building
wall; and
         (c)   Satellite dishes and fuel storage tanks are permitted accessory
structures only in the rear yard and only when located at least six feet from

generating light, heat or electrical energy are permitted as residential and
commercial accessory structures, subject to the height and site development
regulations in divisions (D)(2) and (D)(3) above. Solar collectors shall not be
placed within any front yard setback area. The 20-foot maximum height
limitation does not apply to solar collectors mounted upon a conforming
building or structure, so long as the highest point of the solar collector does
not exceed ten feet above the highest point of the building or structure. Solar
collectors shall not be constructed, nor operated, so as to cause glare to be
reflected on any existing residential structure, except that of the owner of
the collector. Solar collectors shall not be considered accessory buildings
subject to the limitation of division (D)(1) above.

PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY PROTECTION OVERLAY DISTRICT
§ 155.230 STATEMENT OF INTENT.
   The city recognizes that consequences of certain land use activities,
whether intentional or accidental, may contaminate or degrade the quality of
the ground water from which the public water supply is drawn. The purpose of
this subchapter is to protect from and prevent the contamination or degradation
of municipal ground water resources from certain land use activities by
imposing appropriate restrictions upon lands located within the ground water
recharge area of the municipal water supply. There is created by this
subchapter, an overlay zoning ordinance, under which supplemental land use
regulations, limitations and restrictions apply in addition to the land use
restrictions contained in other chapters or chapters of this code. The
restrictions imposed in this subchapter are in addition and supplemental to all
other zoning and land use restrictions contained in this code.
(Prior Code, § 9-17-1) (Ord. 518, passed 8-2-1999)
§ 155.231 OVERLAY DISTRICT AND ZONES.
   A Public Water Supply Protection Overlay District is hereby created and
divided into Zone A, Zone B and Zone C as follows.
   (A)   Zone A is identified as the primary source of water for the municipal
well aquifer and as the area most likely to transmit ground water contaminants
to the municipal wells. Zone A is more restrictive than Zone B. Zone A
represents the area in which the time of travel of a contaminant to a well is
one year or less.
   (B)   Zone B is identified as a secondary source of water for the municipal
well aquifer and as an area where there is a lower probability of surface
contaminants reaching the municipal well fields. Zone B is less restrictive
than Zone A. Zone B represents an area in which the time of travel of a
contaminant to a well is one year to five years.
   (C)   Zone C is identified as a tertiary source of water for the municipal
well aquifer and as an area where there is an even lower probability of surface
contaminants reaching municipal well fields. Zone C is less restrictive than
Zone B. Zone C is an area in which the time of travel for a contaminant to a
well is five years to ten years.

Overlay District and Zones A, B, and C thereof are set forth on the Public
Water Supply Protection Overlay District zoning map, which is adopted herewith,
and which is incorporated herein by reference, and is attached to Ordinance 518
on file in the office of the City Clerk. This map, together with everything
shown thereon and all amendments thereto, shall be as much a part of this
subchapter as though fully set forth and described herein.
   (B)   The location of land uses in relation to the Public Water Supply
Protection Overlay District, and the zones thereof, shall be determined by the
Zoning Officer, whose determination shall be conclusive, subject to appeal to
the Board of Adjustment or the State District Court.
   (C)   A defined parcel of real estate under common ownership which is
partially within a zone of the District shall be subject to the regulations
applicable for that zone. Portions of a parcel which are within different zones
of the District shall be subject to the requirements applicable to the zone in
which a portion of a parcel is located. However, a property owner may seek, and
the Board of Adjustment may grant, as part of the terms of a special exception
use permit pursuant to §
155.237, relief from the requirements of this division (C).

§ 155.277 AIRPORT HEIGHT ZONES AND AIRSPACE HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.
   In order to carry out the provisions of this section, there are hereby
created and established certain zones, which include all of the land lying
beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces and conical surfaces as
they apply to the Northwest Iowa Regional Airport. Such zones are shown on the
Northwest Iowa Regional Airport zoning map prepared by the city and made a part
hereof. An area located in more than one of the following zones is considered
to be only in the zone with the more restrictive standard. The various zones
and height limitations are hereby established and defined as follows.
   (A)   Airport zones.
      (1)   Approach surface zone. A surface longitudinally centered on the
extended runway centerline, extending outward and upward from the end of the
primary surface and at the same slope as the approach zone height limitation
slope set forth below. In plan, the perimeter of the approach surface coincides
with the perimeter of the approach zone.
      (2)   Inner approach surface zone. The inner portion of the approach
surface extends out from the runway end to the where the 14 C.F.R. part 77(C)
approach surface reaches a 100-foot height above the ground elevation.
      (3)   Runway with a precision instrument approach zone. The inner edge of
this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000
feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 16,000
feet at a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet from the primary surface. Its
centerline is the continuation of the centerlines of runway 12 (existing) and
runway 18 (planned).
      (4)   Runway protection zone (RPZ). An area off the runway end to enhance
the protection of people and property on the ground.
      (5)   Runway 30 and runway 36 instrument approach zone. The inner edge of
this approach zone coincides with the primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide.
The approach zone extends out uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at a
horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is
the continuation of the centerlines of runways 30 and 36.
      (6)   Transitional zones. The transitional zones are the areas beneath
the transitional surfaces.
      (7)   Horizontal zone. The horizontal zone is established by swinging
arcs of 10,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of
each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those
arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.
      (8)   Conical zone. The conical zone is a surface extending outward and
upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20 to one for
a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
      (9)   Primary surface zone. The surface longitudinally centered on a
runway. The primary surface is extended 200 feet beyond each end of each
runway. The width of the primary surface is 1,000 feet. The elevation of any
point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point
on the runway centerline.
   (B)   Height limitations. Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter,
no structure shall be erected, altered or maintained, and no tree shall be
allowed to grow in any zone created by this subchapter to a height in excess of
the applicable height limit herein established for such zone. Such applicable
height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question as
follows.
      (1)   Runway 30. Slopes 40 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at
the end of, and at the same elevation as the primary surface, and extending to

the end of, and at the same elevation as the primary surface, and extending to
a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet along the extended centerline.
      (3)   Runway 18. Slopes 50 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at
the end of, and at the same elevation as the primary surface, and extending to
a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet, then slopes 40 feet outward for each foot
upward extending to a horizontal distance of 40,000 feet along the extended
centerline.
      (4)   Runway 12. Slopes 50 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at
the end of, and at the same elevation as the primary surface, and extending to
a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet, then slopes 40 feet outward for each foot
upward extending to a horizontal distance of 40,000 feet along the extended
centerline.
      (5)   Transitional zones. Slope seven feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
the approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport
elevation which is 1,340.7 feet above mean sea level. In addition to the
foregoing, there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for
each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the
approach surface, and extending to where they intersect the conical surface.
Where the runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone, there are
established height limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface,
and extending a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured at 90-degree angles
to the extended runway centerline.
      (6)   Horizontal zone. Established at 150 feet above the airport
elevation or at a height of 1,490.70 feet above mean sea level.
      (7)   Conical zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning

§ 155.278 USE RESTRICTIONS.
   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subchapter, no use may be made
of land or water within any zone established by this subchapter in such a
manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to
distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of
pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport,
create bird strike hazards or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with
the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
   (A)   Runway protection zone. 
      (1)   A runway protection zone is a trapezoidal area off the end of the
runway threshold established to enhance the protection of people and property
on the ground in the event an aircraft lands or crashes beyond the runway end.
Runway protection zones underlie a portion of the approach closest to the
airport.
      (2)   Compatible land use within the RPZ is generally restricted to such
land uses as agricultural and uses that do not involve congregations of people
or construction of buildings or other improvements that may be obstructions.
The following land use criteria apply within the RPZ.
         (a)   While it is desirable to clear all objects from the RPZ, some
uses are permitted; provided they do not attract wildlife, are outside the
runway object free area and do not interfere with navigational aids.
Agricultural operations (other than forestry or livestock farms) are expressly
permitted under this provision. Golf courses (but not clubhouses), although
discouraged, may be permitted if a wildlife hazard assessment determines that
it will not provide an environment attractive to birds. Automobile parking
facilities, although discouraged, may be permitted; provided the parking
facilities and any associated appurtenances, in addition to meeting all of the
preceding conditions, are located outside of the object free area extension.
         (b)   Land uses prohibited from the RPZ are residences and places of
public assembly. Churches, schools, hospitals, office buildings, shopping
centers and other uses with similar concentrations of persons typify places of
public assembly.
   (B)   Building restriction line. No structures, other than those approved by
the Federal Aviation Administration and the city, and which conform to the
underlying zoning designation, shall be constructed within the building
restriction line (BRL).
   (C)   Exemption for airport operations. Use restrictions shall not apply to
necessary and incidental airport operations.
   (D)   Prohibited uses. Regardless of any other provisions of this
subchapter, no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by
this subchapter in such a manner as to do any of the following.
      (1)   Create electrical interference. Create electrical interference with
navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft.
      (2)   Imitate airport lights. All lights or illumination used in
conjunction with streets, parking, signs or use of land and structures shall be
arranged and operated in such a manner that is not misleading or dangerous to
aircraft operating from the Northwest Iowa Regional Airport or in the vicinity
thereof.
      (3)   Result in glare. Result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the
airport.
      (4)   Impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport. No operations
from any use shall produce smoke, glare or other visual hazards within three
statute miles of any runway of the Northwest Iowa Regional Airport.
      (5)   Create bird strikes. Create bird strike hazards.
      (6)   Endangerment of aircraft. Otherwise endanger or interfere with the

§ 155.284 NON-CONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Regulations not retroactive. Ordinance 697 amendments shall not be
construed to require the removal, lowering or other change or alteration of any
structure or tree which complied with this subchapter prior to the adoption of
the ordinance codified herein, or which existed prior to the adoption of this
subchapter. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the
construction, alteration or intended use of any structure, the construction or
alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date hereof and is
diligently prosecuted.
   (B)   Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding division (A) above, the owner of
any existing non-conforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the
installation, operation and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as
shall be deemed necessary by the manager of the Northwest Iowa Regional Airport
to indicate the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the
presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be
installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the Northwest Iowa
Regional Airport. Any permit granted may be conditioned to require the owner of
the structure in question to install, operate and maintain, at the owner’s
expense, such marking and lights as may be necessary.
   (C)   Alteration or change of non-conforming use. No permit shall be granted
that would allow a non-conforming use or structure to become a greater hazard
to air navigation than it was on the effective date hereof, or any amendment
hereto, or than it is when the application for a permit is made.
   (D)   Non-conforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the
administrative agency or its designee determines that a non-conforming
structure is abandoned for one year or destroyed, by any means, to the extent
of more than 60% of the replacement cost, said structure shall not be rebuilt,
restored or re-occupied for any purpose unless it shall thereafter conform to
all regulations of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 9-15-10) (Ord. 697, passed 3-1-2010)
ADMINISTRATION AND PROCEDURES
§ 155.295 SPECIAL EXCEPTION PROCEDURE.
   The formulation and enactment of these zoning regulations is based upon the
division of the city into districts, each of which are permitted specified uses
which are mutually compatible. In addition to such permitted compatible uses,
however, it is recognized that there are certain other uses which may be
necessary or desirable to allow in certain locations in certain districts but
because of their actual or potential impact on neighboring uses or public
facilities, need to be carefully regulated with respect to their location for
the protection of the city. Such uses, on account of their peculiar location,
need or the nature of the service offered, may have to be established in a
district in which they cannot be reasonably allowed as a permitted use.
   (A) Jurisdiction. The Building and Zoning Officer shall be responsible for
administration of the special exception procedure and the Board of Adjustment
shall be responsible for the review, evaluation and action on all applications
for a special exception use permit.
   (B)   Application and fee. Application for a special exception use permit
shall be filed with the Building and Zoning Officer. The application shall
include the following:
      (1)   Name and address of the owner and applicant;
      (2)   Address and legal description of the property;
      (3)   If the applicant is not the legal owner of the property, a
statement that the applicant is the authorized agent of the owner of the
property;
      (4)   A statement describing the nature and operating characteristics of
the proposed use, including any data pertinent to the findings required for
approval of the application;
      (5)   Site plans, preliminary building elevations, preliminary
improvement plans and such additional maps and drawings, all dimensions
sufficiently shown, as required to illustrate the following:
         (a)   The date, scale, north point, title, name of owner and name of
person preparing the site plan;
         (b)   The location and dimensions of boundary lines, easements and
required yards and setbacks;
         (c)   The location, height, bulk, general appearance and intended use
of existing and proposed buildings on the site, and approximate location of
existing buildings on abutting sites within 50 feet;
         (d)   The location of existing and proposed site improvements
including parking and loading areas, pedestrian and vehicular access,
landscaped areas, utility or service areas, fencing and screening, signs, and
lighting;
         (e)   The location of watercourses and drainage features;
         (f)   The number of existing and proposed off-street parking and
loading spaces, and a calculation of applicable minimum requirements; and
         (g)   The relationship of the site and proposed use to surrounding
uses, including pedestrian and vehicular circulation, current use of nearby
parcels and any proposed off-site improvements to be made.
      (6)   Any applicable fee established by the City Council.
   (C)   Public hearing and notice. The Board of Adjustment shall hold a public
hearing on each application for a special exception use permit. Notice shall be
given as prescribed in §
155.299. At the public hearing, the Board shall review the application and
shall receive pertinent evidence concerning the proposed use and proposed
conditions under which it would be operated or maintained.
   (D)   Report of the Building and Zoning Officer. The Building and Zoning
Officer shall review the application or proposal and shall prepare a report
which shall be filed with the Board of Adjustment and available to the
applicant at the time of the hearing.
   (E)   Action by the Board of Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment shall act
on the application not more than 20 days following the closing of the public
hearing on a special exception use permit. The Board may grant a special
exception use permit as the permit was applied for, or in a modified form or
subject to conditions, or may deny the application. The Board shall notify the
applicant of its decision by mail.
   (F)   Review and evaluation criteria. The Building and Zoning Officer and
the Board shall review and evaluate special exception use permit applications
using the following criteria:
      (1)   Conformance with applicable regulations and standards established
by the zoning regulations;
      (2)   Compatibility with existing or permitted uses on abutting sites, in
terms of building height, bulk and scale, setbacks and open spaces, landscaping
and site development, and access and circulation features;
      (3)   Potentially unfavorable effects or impacts on other existing or
permitted uses on abutting sites, to the extent such impacts exceed those which
reasonably may result from use of the site by a permitted use;
      (4)   Modifications to the site plan which would result in increased
compatibility, or would mitigate potentially unfavorable impacts, or would be
necessary to conform to applicable regulations and standards and to protect the
public health, safety, morals and general welfare;
      (5)   Safety and convenience of vehicular and pedestrian circulation in
the vicinity, including traffic reasonably expected to be generated by the
proposed use;
      (6)   Protection of persons and property from erosion, flood or water

facilities;
      (9)   That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, parking and/or
necessary facilities have been or will be provided;
      (10)   That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide
ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public
streets;

instruments on any adjoining lot or property;
      (14)   The use shall not involve any malodorous gas or matter which is
discernible on any adjoining property;
      (15)   The use shall not involve any pollution of the air by fly-ash,
dust vapors or other substance which is harmful to health, animals, vegetation
or other property or which causes soiling, discomfort or irritation;
      (16)   The use shall not involve any direct or reflected glare which is
visible from any adjoining property or from any public street, road or highway;
      (17)   The use shall not involve any activity substantially increasing
the burden on any public utilities or facilities unless provisions are made for
any necessary adjustments;
      (18)   The use shall not interfere with the use or enjoyment of
neighboring permitted uses. If such interference is found, provisions may be
made for increased setbacks (up to 500 feet) from property lines or screening
of incompatible use by the use of fences or hedges; and
      (19)   The use shall not create a hazard to vehicular traffic. If any
such hazard is determined, provisions may be taken to increase the required
setback in regard to open air storage.
   (G)   Conditions of approval. The Board of Adjustment may establish
conditions of approval. Conditions may include, but shall not be limited to,

regulation of vehicular ingress and egress, and traffic circulation; regulation
of signs; regulation of hours or other characteristics of operation;
requirements for maintenance of landscaping and other improvements;

compatibility with surrounding uses, to preserve the public health, safety and
welfare, and to enable the Commission to make the findings required for
approval of the permit.
   (H)   Lapse of a conditional use permit. Unless a longer time shall be
specifically established as a condition of approval, a special exception use
permit shall lapse and shall become void, one year following the date on which
such permit became effective, unless prior to expiration, a building permit is
issued and construction is commenced and diligently pursued toward completion,
or a certificate of occupancy is issued for the use, or the site is occupied if
no building permit or certificate of occupancy is required.
   (I)   Revocation.
      (1)   The issuance of special exception use permit by the Board shall
entitle the owner to continue to operate the use so long as he or she remains
in compliance with the terms and conditions of this chapter and the terms,
conditions, limitations, requirements and safeguards set forth in the special
exception use permit, if such a special exception use permit is granted, does
expressly grant to the city, for the enforcement of this chapter, the power and
authority to enter upon the premises at any reasonable time for the purpose of
inspection and enforcement of the terms of this chapter or of the terms of the
special exception use permit.
      (2)   In the event the owner or occupant of the property for which a
special exception use permit has been issued, shall violate any provision of
this chapter or any term, condition, limitation, regulation or safeguards
contained in the special exception use permit, the special exception use permit
shall be and become null and void and the owner or occupant shall be deemed to
be in violation of this chapter and the city may proceed to enforce the
provisions of this chapter and the terms, conditions, limitations and
safeguards of the special exception use permit as provided in this chapter. In
addition to all other remedies provided herein, in the event that such special
exception use permit shall be and become null and void, the compliance bond, if
any, given by the owner under the provisions of this chapter shall be
forfeited.
   (J)   Approval to run with the land. A special exception use permit granted
pursuant to these provisions shall run with the land and shall continue to be
valid upon a change of ownership of the site or structure which was the subject
of the special exception use permit application.
(Prior Code, § 9-12-1) (Ord. passed 10-11-1990; Ord. 407, passed 1-20-1992)
§ 155.296 VARIANCE PROCEDURE.
   This procedure is intended to provide relief from the terms of this chapter
when, because of special circumstances applicable to the property, the strict
application of this chapter deprives such property of privileges enjoyed by
other property in the vicinity and under identical zoning classification, and
to ensure that any adjustment thereby authorized shall not constitute a grant
of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties
in the vicinity and the district in which such property is located.
   (A)   Application.
      (1)   Application for a variance shall be filed with the Building and
Zoning Officer. The application shall contain the following:
         (a)   Name and address of the owner or applicant;
         (b)   Address and legal description of the property;
         (c)   If the applicant is not the legal owner of the property, a
statement that the applicant is the authorized agent of the owner;
         (d)   A statement describing the variance requested and the reasons
why it complies with the criteria for variances provided in this section; and
         (e)   Site plans, preliminary building elevations, preliminary
improvement plans or other maps or drawings, sufficiently dimensioned as
required to illustrate the following, to the extent related to the variance
application:
            1.   Existing and proposed location and arrangement of uses on the
site, and on abutting sites within 50 feet;
            2.   Existing and proposed site improvements, buildings and other
structures on the site, and any off-site improvements related to or
necessitated by the proposed use. Building elevations shall be sufficient to
indicate the general height, bulk, scale and architectural character;
            3.   Existing and proposed topography, grading landscaping and
screening, irrigation facilities, and erosion control measures; and
            4.   Existing and proposed parking, loading, and traffic and
pedestrian circulation features, both on the site and any off-site facilities
or improvements related to or necessitated by the proposed use.
      (2)   The Building and Zoning Officer may request additional information
necessary to enable a complete analysis and evaluation of the variance request,
and a determination as to whether the circumstances prescribed for the granting
of a variance exists.
      (3)   The application shall be accompanied by a fee established by the
City Council.
   (B)   Report of the Building and Zoning Officer. The Building and Zoning
Officer shall review and prepare a report on the application. The report shall
be filed with the Board of Adjustment and available to the applicant at the
time of the public hearing.

hearing on each application for a variance. Notice shall be given as prescribed
in §
155.299.
   (D)   Action by the Board of Adjustment.
      (1)   The Board of Adjustment shall act upon the application not more
than 20 days following the closing of the public hearing on a variance. The
Board may grant a variance as the variance was applied for or in a modified
form, or subject to conditions, or the application may be denied. A variance
may be revocable, may be granted for a limited time period or may be granted
subject to conditions as the Board may prescribe. The Board shall notify the
applicant of its decision by mail.
      (2)   The concurring vote of four members of the Board of Adjustment
shall be necessary to grant a variance.
   (E)   Findings; basic criteria. The Board of Adjustment may grant a variance
if it makes affirmative findings of fact on each of the following criteria:
      (1)   The zoning regulations applicable to the property do not allow for
a reasonable use;
      (2)   The hardship for which the variance is requested is unique to the
property and not general to the area in which the property is located;
      (3)   The variance will not alter the character of the area adjacent to
the property, will not impair the use of adjacent conforming property and will
not impair the purposes or regulations of the zoning district in which the
property is located; and
      (4)   The hardship for which the variance is requested did not result
from actions of the applicant.
   (F)   Lapse of variance. Unless a longer time period shall be specifically
established as a condition of approval, a variance shall lapse and shall become
null and void, one year following the date on which the variance became
effective, unless prior to the expiration of one year, a building permit is
issued and construction is commenced and diligently pursued toward completion
on the site which was the subject of the variance application, or a certificate
of occupancy is issued for the site or structure which was the subject of the
variance application, or the site is occupied if no building permit or
certificate of occupancy is required.
   (G)   Revocation. Upon violation of any applicable provision of this
chapter, or if granted subject to conditions, upon failure to comply with
conditions, a variance shall be revoked upon notification to the owner of the
use or property subject to the variance.
   (H)   Variance to run with land or structure. Unless otherwise specified at
the time a variance is granted, a variance shall run with the land and shall
continue to be valid upon change of ownership of the site or structure to which
it applies.

   This procedure is intended to afford review of administrative actions taken
pursuant to this chapter where such actions may be in error.
   (A)   Appeals. Appeals to the Board of Adjustment may be taken by any person
aggrieved, or by any officer, department or board of the city affected by any
administrative decision of the Building and Zoning Officer. Such appeal shall
be taken within 15 days, as provided by the rules of the Board, by filing with
the City Clerk a notice of appeal, which shall specify the grounds thereof. The

   (B)   Fee. The appeal shall be accompanied by a fee prescribed by the City
Council.
   (C)   Stay of proceedings. An appeal from the action of the Building and
Zoning Officer shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of such action unless
the Building and Zoning Officer certifies to the Board of Adjustment, after
notice of appeal shall have been filed with the Building and Zoning Officer,
that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in the
Building and Zoning Officer’s opinion, cause imminent peril to life or
property. In the event the Building and Zoning Officer shall make and file such
certificate, his or her action shall not be stayed otherwise than by a
restraining order that may be granted by the Board of Adjustment, or by a court
of record, upon application of the party aggrieved by the action of the
Building and Zoning Officer, and after notice to him or her and upon due cause
shown.
   (D)   Public hearing and notice. The Board of Adjustment shall hold a public

155.299. Upon the hearing of such appeal, any interested party may appear in
person or by agent or attorney.
   (E)   Action.
      (1)   The Board of Adjustment shall act on the appeal within 20 days
following the closing of the public hearing. In exercising the powers set out
in this section, the Board may, in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and may take such order,
requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end
shall have all the powers of the Building and Zoning Officer from whose action
the appeal was taken. The Board shall notify the appellant of its decision by
mail.
      (2)   The concurring vote of four members of the Board of Adjustment
shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirements, decision or
determination of the Building and Zoning Officer, or to decide in favor of the
appellant in any matter upon which it is required to pass under these
provisions.

address of the owner of each lot as shown by the records of the county which is
within 300 feet of the property proposed for rezoning and a map keyed to the
ownership and address data. Such list shall be certified as accurate, according
to the records of the county, by an appropriate representative of an
abstracting or chapter company, attorney or registered land surveyor doing
business in the city.
      (2)   The Building and Zoning Officer may require additional information
or maps if they are necessary to enable the Commission to determine whether the
change is consistent with the objectives of this chapter.

   (D)   Public hearing. Not more than 30 days after filing of an application,
the Planning and Zoning Commission may hold a public hearing on an application
for a text amendment, but is not required to do so, and shall hold a public
hearing on any application for a change in the zoning classification of any
property. Notice shall be given as prescribed in §

amendment or rezoning be enacted, be enacted in a modified form or be rejected.
   (F)   Action by the City Council.
      (1)   Not more than 30 days following receipt of the recommendation of
the Planning and Zoning Commission, the City Council shall hold a public
hearing on the text amendment or rezoning. Within 30 days following the closing
of a public hearing, the City Council shall make a specific finding as to
whether the change is consistent with the objectives of this chapter.

introduce an ordinance amending the text of the zoning regulations or amending
the zoning map, whichever is appropriate.
      (3)   If the City Council finds that the change is not consistent, it
shall deny the application. The City Council shall not modify a recommendation
of the Planning and Zoning Commission on a rezoning or change until it has
requested and considered a report of the Commission on the modification.
Failure of the Commission to report within 30 days after receipt of the City
Council request shall be deemed concurrence.
   (G)   Protest provisions. Any ordinance enacted by the City Council to
reclassify property from one district to another district shall require a
favorable vote of three-fifths of all members of the City Council, when a
written protest against the rezoning is received from either of the following:
      (1)   From persons owning 20% or more of the land included within the
proposed rezoning; or
      (2)   From persons owning 20% or more of the land area adjoining and
within 200 feet of the area proposed for rezoning, but excluding land outside
the city.
   (H)   New application. Whenever a petition requesting an amendment,
supplement or change of any regulations prescribed by this chapter has been
denied by the City Council, such petition cannot be renewed for one year. This
provision, however, shall not prevent the City Council or Planning and Zoning
Commission from acting on its own initiative in any case or at any time
provided in this section.
