46.01 Curfew                 46.03 Contributing to Delinquency
46.02 Cigarettes and Tobacco  
 
46.01 CURFEW.
   The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote
the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and
specifically to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults
responsible for minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors
committed after the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences
and criminal activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.

      A.   “Emergency errand” means, but is not limited to, an errand relating

requiring immediate action to prevent serious illness, bodily injury, or loss
of life.
      B.   “Knowingly” means knowledge that a responsible adult should
reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that
responsible adult’s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful
or careless adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult
responsibility through an objective test. It is therefore no defense that an
adult responsible for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or
conduct or whereabouts of the minor.

secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically
accompanied by a law enforcement officer or a person employed by the facility
where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to
providing nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate
juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the person’s
parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but
not for longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or
magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
      E.   “Public place” includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys, and sidewalks dedicated to public use and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises, whether publicly or privately owned,
that are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited
commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is
permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has
access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is
considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.
      F.   “Responsible adult” means a parent, guardian or other adult
specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have

of the U.S. Constitution guarantees of free exercise of religion, freedom of
speech, freedom of assembly or, if traveling, within one hour after the end or
before the beginning of the activity.

within the time periods prohibited by this section unless the minor’s presence
falls within one of the above exceptions.
   5.   Enforcement Procedures.
      A.   Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in

that the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the person’s
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any nonsecured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into
custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.
      C.   Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into
custody, the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the
minor as soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible
for the minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at
such time as the court may direct.
      D.   Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minor’s parent, guardian or other person
legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the
law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative
of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person
who is known to the child.
   6.   Penalties.
      A.   Responsible Adult’s First Violation. In the case of a first
violation by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall, by certified mail,
send to the adult responsible for the minor, written notice of the violation
with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of
the curfew ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with
applicable penalties.
      B.   Responsible Adult’s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as
defined in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows
the minor to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a
municipal infraction.
      C.   Minor’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a
minor, the law enforcement officer shall give the minor a written warning,
which states that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of
the curfew ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with
applicable penalties, or, at the law enforcement officer’s discretion, may
issue the minor a citation for a first violation.

violations of any of the provisions of this section, the minor is guilty of a
municipal infraction.

purchase, or attempt to purchase any tobacco, tobacco products, alternative
nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes. Possession of tobacco,
tobacco products, alternative nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes
by an individual under 21 years of age shall not constitute a violation of this
section if the individual under 21 years of age possesses the tobacco, tobacco
products, alternative nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes as part
of the person’s employment and said person is employed by a person who holds a
valid permit under Chapter 453A of the Code of Iowa or who lawfully offers for

identities and addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders,
notice by one publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area
where the vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of
notice under Subsection 2 of this section. The published notice may contain

well located and constructed in such a manner that there is a continuous layer
of low permeability soil or rock at least five feet thick located at least 25
feet below the normal ground surface and above the aquifer from which water is
to be drawn.  A shallow well is a well located and constructed in such a manner
that there is not a continuous layer of low permeability soil or rock (or
equivalent retarding mechanism acceptable to the department) at least five feet
thick, the top of which is located at least 25 feet below the normal ground
surface and above the aquifer from which water is to be drawn.
2   The separation distances are dependent upon two factors:  the type of
piping that is in the existing sewer or drain, as noted in the table, and that
the piping was properly installed in accordance with the standards.
3   Solid wastes are those derived from the treatment of water or wastewater. 
Certain types of solid wastes from water treatment processes may be land-
applied within the separation distance on an individual, case-by-case basis.
4   Solid waste means garbage, refuse, rubbish, and other similar discarded
solid or semisolid materials, including but not limited to such materials
resulting from industrial, commercial, agricultural, and domestic activities.

94.01 FINDINGS.
   The City’s public potable water supply system (hereinafter, “public water
system”) must be protected from contamination that can result from cross
connection with any private water piping system that fails to prevent backflow
of untreated or inadequately treated water from wells or any other source. To
prevent such contamination, it is necessary to establish an application

treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes,
they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation
by the owner at the owner’s expense.
97.07 CONTROL MANHOLES.
   When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner’s
expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
97.08 TESTING OF WASTES.
   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from
periodic grab samples.)

155.01 PURPOSE AND GENERAL POLICY.
   The Council finds that in order to ensure public safety and provide
efficient delivery of services by the City and others wishing to utilize
wireless communication technologies, in order to protect public and private
investments, ensure the health, safety, and welfare of the population, to
provide for the regulation and administration of the orderly location of
antenna arrays and towers and to secure the rights of the City to a return on
its investment on public property, it is necessary for the City to establish
uniform rules and policies. This chapter is to be interpreted in light of these
findings for the benefit of the residents of the City.
155.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter the following terms are defined:
   1.   “Antenna” means a device, dish or array used to transmit or receive
telecommunications signals.
   2.   “Communications tower” means a tower, pole or similar structure which
supports a telecommunications antenna operated for commercial purposes above
ground in a fixed location, free standing, guyed or on a building.
   3.   “Height” of a communication tower is the distance from the base of the
tower to the top of the structure.
   4.   “Telecommunication” means the transmission, between or among points
specified by the user, of information of the user’s choosing, without change in
the form or content of the information as sent and received.
155.03 LOCAL REGULATIONS AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF
1996.
   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 prohibits the City from establishing
policies that discriminate against one or a group of providers in favor of
another or another group of providers or potential providers. The following
objectives shall be applied consistently to all telecommunications providers
that request a location within the City limits for their communication towers
and antennas.
   1.   To minimize the overall number of towers located in the City, providers
may be required to participate in collocation agreements.
   2.   To ensure that new towers will be safe and blend into their
environment, providers will propose designs consistent with site
characteristics.
   3.   To minimize placement of wireless equipment in highly populated areas,
residential locations will be considered as a last resort.
   4.   To assure revenues from site leases of City-owned and City-controlled
land and structures reflects fair compensation for use of City property and
administration of this chapter.
155.04 PRIORITIES.
   Priority of the use of City-owned land for communications antennas and
towers will be given to the following entities in descending order of priority:
   1.   All functions of the City.
   2.   Public safety agencies that are not a part of the City, including law
enforcement, fire and ambulance services, and private entities with a public
safety agreement with the City.
   3.   Other governmental agencies for uses which are not related to public
safety.
   4.   Entities providing licensed commercial communications services,
including cellular, personal communications services (PCS), specialized
mobilized radio (SMR), enhanced specialized mobilized radio (ESMR), paging and
similar services that are marketed to the general public for business and/or
personal use.
155.05 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR PLACEMENT.

155.07 PLACEMENT OF FACILITIES AND RELATED LEASE FEES.
   The placement and maintenance of communications antennas or towers on City-
owned sites, such as water towers and parks, will be allowed when the following
additional requirements are met.
   1.   Water Tower or Reservoir Sites. The City’s water tower and reservoir
represent a large public investment in water pressure stabilization and peak
capacity reserves. Therefore, its protection is of prime importance. As access
to the City’s water storage system increases, so does the potential for
contamination of the public water supply. For these reasons, the placement of
communications towers or antennas on water towers or reservoir sites will be
allowed only when the following requirements are met.
      A.   The applicant must have written approval from the Public Works
Director each time access to the facility is desired. This will minimize the
risk of contamination to the water supply.
      B.   There is sufficient room on the structure and/or the grounds to
accommodate the applicant’s facility.
      C.   The presence of the facility will not increase the water tower or
reservoir maintenance cost to the City.
      D.   The presence of the facility will not be harmful to the health or
safety of the workers maintaining the water tower or reservoir.
      E.   A minimum fee of $500.00 per month will be assessed for placing
facilities on a City water tower.
   2.   Parks. The presence of certain communications antennas or towers
represents a potential conflict with the purpose of certain City-owned parks
and recreational facilities. Towers shall be prohibited in designated
conservation areas. Communications antennas or towers will be considered only
in the following parks after the recommendation of the Parks and Recreation
Board and approval of the Council.
      A.   Public parks of a sufficient scale and character that are adjacent
to an existing commercial or industrial use.
      B.   Commercial recreational areas and major ball fields.
      C.   Park maintenance facilities.
      D.   A minimum fee of $500.00 per month will be assessed for placing
facilities on park property.
155.08 NOISE AND EMISSION STANDARDS.
   No equipment shall be operated at towers and telecommunications facilities
so as to produce noise in excess of applicable noise standards under WAC 173-
60, except during emergencies or periodic routine maintenance which requires
the use of a backup generator, where the noise standards may be exceeded
temporarily. The Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 gives the FCC sole
jurisdiction to regulate radio frequency emissions. Facilities that meet the
FCC standards shall not be conditioned or denied on the basis of emissions
impacts. Applicants for tower sites shall be required to provide information on
the projected power density of the facility and how this meets the FCC
standards.
155.09 APPLICATION PROCESS.

Upon such abandonment, the owner/operator of the tower shall have an additional
180 days within which to:
   1.   Reactivate the use of the tower or transfer the tower to another owner/
operator who makes actual use of the tower; or
   2.   Dismantle and remove the tower.
   At the earliest, 181 days from the date of abandonment, without reactivating
or upon completion of dismantling and removal, any special exception and/or
variance approval for the tower shall automatically expire.
155.11 TERMINATION.
   The Council may terminate any lease if it is determined that any of the
following conditions exist:
   1.   A potential user with a higher priority cannot find another adequate
location and the potential use would be incompatible with the existing use.
   2.   A user’s frequency broadcast unreasonably interferes with other users
of higher priority, regardless of whether or not this interference was
adequately predicted in the technical analysis.
   3.   A user violates any of the standards in this chapter or the conditions
attached to the City’s lease agreement.
   Before taking action, the City will provide notice to the user of the
intended termination and the reasons for it, and provide an opportunity for a
hearing before the Council regarding the proposed action. This procedure need
not be followed in emergency situations.
155.12 HOME RULE.
   This chapter is intended to be and shall be construed as consistent with the
reservation of local authority contained in the 25th Amendment to the Iowa
Constitution granting cities Home Rule powers. To such end, any limitation on
the power of the City contained herein is to be strictly construed and the City
reserves to itself the right to exercise all power and authority to regulate
and control its local affairs and all ordinances and regulations of the City
shall be enforced against the holders of any lease.
155.13 NEW TECHNOLOGIES.

which the grant was made to the holder of the lease present the opportunity to
the holder of the lease to be more effective, efficient and economical through
the use of a substance or material other than those for which the lease was
originally made, the holder of the lease may petition the Council which, with
such requirements or limitations as it deems necessary to protect public
health, safety, and welfare, may allow the use of such substances under the
terms and conditions of the lease.
155.14 TWO-MILE LIMIT.
   The Council shall have review and approval rights for applications submitted
to the Zoning Commission for the placement of communications antennas or towers
within two miles of the City limits.

thick ACC (Asphaltic Cement Concrete) on a four-inch depth granular prepared
sub grade in conformance with the City’s standard construction specifications.
157.06 OPTIONAL CONSTRUCTION DEFERMENT.
   In lieu of constructing the walking and bike trail at the time of the
building permit process, the applicant may petition the Council to utilize one
of the following options:
   1.   The dollar cost for construction of the walking and bike trail as
agreed upon between the applicant and the Council may be paid to the City and
which the City shall hold in a separate account to be utilized for construction
of the walking and bike trail by the City at a future time.
   2.   The applicant may provide a written petition for assessment which
indicates that the applicant, successors and assigns desire to be assessed for
the cost of the improvement by the City as a part of a future construction
project. This petition shall be duly recorded and made to be binding upon the
property to allow the petition to run with the land.
The Council shall have the right to accept or reject any option if deemed to be
in the best interest of the City. As a minimum, the applicant shall provide for

structure by 25 percent or more. All additions constructed after the effective
date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by the community
shall be added to any proposed addition in determining whether the total
increase in original floor space would exceed 25 percent.
   35.   “Variance” means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of
the floodplain management regulations.
   36.   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations.
160.02 STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSE.
   1.   The Legislature of the State of Iowa has, in Chapter 414 of the Code of
Iowa, as amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to
secure safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
   2.   Findings of Fact.
      A.   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic
inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community.
      B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by: (i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
      C.   This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
   3.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Paragraph 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
      A.   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows
so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
      B.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
      C.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
      D.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
      E.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   1.   Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter shall
apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City which are located within
the boundaries of the Floodplain (Overlay) District as established in this
section.
   2.   Establishment of Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) for Marion County and Incorporated Areas, City of
Pleasantville, Panels 190125C0143D, 0144D, 0256D, 0257D, dated February 16,
2018, which were prepared as part of the Flood Insurance Study for Marion
County is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be the Official
Floodplain Zoning Map. The Marion County Flood Insurance Study is hereby
adopted by reference and is made a part of this chapter for the purpose of
administering floodplain management regulations.
   3.   Rules for Interpretation of Floodplain (Overlay) District. The
boundaries of the Floodplain (Overlay) District areas shall be determined by
scaling distances on the official Flood Insurance Rate Map. When an
interpretation is needed as to the exact location of a boundary, the City
Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The Board of Adjustment
shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any
requirement, decision, or determination made by the City Administrator in the
enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   4.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used, and no
structure shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered
without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
   5.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
   6.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
   7.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated Floodplain (Overlay) District areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create
liability on the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
   8.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.

160.05 ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING (OVERLAY) DISTRICTS.
   The floodplain areas within the jurisdiction of this chapter are hereby
divided into the following districts:
   1.   Floodplain (Overlay) District – those areas identified as Zone A on the
Official Floodplain Zoning Map.
   The boundaries shall be as shown on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map.
Within these districts, all uses not allowed as permitted uses are prohibited
unless a variance to the terms of this chapter is granted after due
consideration by the Board of Adjustment.
160.06 STANDARDS FOR FLOODPLAIN (OVERLAY) DISTRICT.
   1.   Permitted Uses.
      A.   All development within the Floodplain District shall be permitted to
the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance (or underlying
zoning district) and provided they meet the applicable performance standards of
the Floodplain District.
      B.   Any development which involves placement of structures, factory-
built homes, fill or other obstructions, storage of materials or equipment,
excavation or alteration of a watercourse shall be reviewed by the Department
of Natural Resources to determine (i) whether the land involved is either
wholly or partly within the floodway or floodway fringe and (ii) the base flood
elevation. The applicant shall be responsible for providing the Department of
Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make the
determination.
      C.   Review by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources is not required
for the proposed construction of new or replacement bridges or culverts where:
         (1)   The bridge or culvert is located on a stream that drains less
than two square miles, and
         (2)   The bridge or culvert is not associated with a channel
modification that constitutes a channel change as specified in 567-71.2(2),
Iowa Administrative Code.
   2.   Performance Standards. All development must be consistent with the need
to minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance
standards. Where base flood elevations and floodway data have not been provided
in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be
contacted to compute such data. The applicant will be responsible for providing
the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to
make such determination. All development shall:
      A.   Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement.
      B.   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
      C.   Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
   3.   Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the base flood elevations. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
base flood elevations and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed where existing topography,
street grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the
methods used must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the
various forces and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential
structures located in areas that would become isolated due to flooding of
surrounding ground shall be provided with a means of access that will be
passable by wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this criterion
shall not apply where the Administrator determines there is sufficient flood
warning time for the protection of life and property. When estimating flood
warning time, consideration shall be given to the criteria listed in 567-75.2
(3), Iowa Administrative Code.
   4.   Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level. When
floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State of
Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and
other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the
base flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
   5.   All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
      A.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
         (1)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
         (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
         (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, structure access and
low damage potential storage.
      B.   New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
      C.   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
electric meter, electrical service panel box, hot water heater, heating, air
conditioning, ventilation equipment (including ductwork), and other similar
machinery and equipment elevated (or in the case on non-residential structures,
optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation.
      D.   New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
plumbing, gas lines, water meters, gas meters, and other similar service
utilities either elevated (or in the case of non-residential structures,
optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation or designed to be watertight and withstand inundation to such a
level.
   6.   Factory-Built Homes.
      A.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the structure
is a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation.
      B.   All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including
those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be
anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame
ties to ground anchors. Anchorage systems may include, but are not limited to,
use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors as required by the State
Building Code.
   7.   Utility and Sanitary Systems.
      A.   On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located or
designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
      B.   All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system as well as
the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment facilities
(other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood protection
equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood elevation.
      C.   New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water
supply treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with
a level of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood
elevation.
      D.   Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
   8.   Storage of Materials and Equipment. Storage of equipment and materials
that are flammable, explosive, or injurious to human, animal or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or:
(i) not subject to major flood damage and be anchored to prevent movement due
to flood waters; or (ii) readily removable from the area within the time
available after flood warning.
   9.   Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as
levees, flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the base
flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for
adequate interior drainage. In addition, structural flood control works shall
be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
   10.   Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must
be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations must be
approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
   11.   Subdivisions. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and
subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the base flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50 lots
(whichever is less) shall include base flood elevation data for those areas
located within the Floodplain (Overlay) District.
   12.   Accessory Structures to Residential Uses. Detached garages, sheds, and
similar structures that are incidental to a residential use are exempt from the
base flood elevation requirements where the following criteria are satisfied.
      A.   The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage potential.
Its size shall not exceed 600 square feet in size. Those portions of the
structure located less than one foot above the BFE must be constructed of
flood-resistant materials.
      B.   The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage potential
purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure shall not
be used for human habitation.
      C.   The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building site
so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
      D.   The structure shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement.
      E.   The structure's service facilities such as electrical and heating
equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above the base
flood elevation.
      F.   The structure’s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of Subsection 5(A) of this section. 
   Exemption from the base flood elevation requirements for such a structure
may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of the
structure and its contents.
   13.   Recreational Vehicles.
      A.   Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of Subsection
6 of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built homes when
the following criteria are satisfied.
         (1)   The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less
than 180 consecutive days; and
         (2)   The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
      B.   Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than 180
consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements of
Subsection 6 of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built
homes.
(Subsection 13 – Ord. 2310-2024 – May 24 Supp.)
   14.   Pipeline Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be
buried in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to
prevent rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
   15.   Maximum Damage Potential Development. All new or substantially
improved maximum damage potential uses shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated a minimum of one foot above the elevation of the 500-year
flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed
to such a level. When flood proofing is utilized, a professional engineer
registered in the State shall certify that the flood proofing methods used are
adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and
uplift forces and other factors associated with the 0.2 percent annual chance
flood; and that the structure, below the 0.2 percent annual chance flood
elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water. A record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in
relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are
flood proofed shall be maintained by the Administrator. Where 0.2 percent
chance flood elevation data has not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study,
the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such
data. The applicant will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural
Resources with sufficient technical information to make such determinations.
160.07 ESTABLISHMENT OF APPEAL AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.  
   The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide: (i) appeals; and (ii)
requests for variances to the provisions of this chapter, and shall take any
other action which is required of the Board.
   1.   Appeals. Where it is alleged there is any error in any order,
requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in
the enforcement of this chapter, the aggrieved party may appeal such action.
The notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board and with the official from
whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason for the
appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to the Board
all the documents constituting the record upon which the action appealed from
was taken.
   2.   Variance. The Board may authorize upon request in specific cases such
variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances
granted must meet the following applicable standards.
      A.   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
      B.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
      C.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      D.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for structures than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance
coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
      E.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
   3.   Hearings and Decisions of the Board.
      A.   Hearings. Upon the filing with the Board of an appeal or a request
for a variance, the Board shall hold a public hearing. The Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the hearing and give public notice thereof, as well as due
notice to parties in interest. At the hearing, any party may appear in person
or by agent or attorney and present written or oral evidence. The Board may
require the appellant or applicant to provide such information as is reasonably
deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or evaluation of
a professional engineer or other expert person or agency, including the
Department of Natural Resources.
      B.   Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal or
variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an appeal, the Board may, so
long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter,
reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in
writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision.
In granting a variance, the Board shall consider such factors as contained in
this section and all other relevant sections of this chapter and may prescribe
such conditions as contained in Subparagraph (2) below.
         (1)   Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board Shall Be Based. In
passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all relevant
factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
            a.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights
or velocities caused by encroachments.
            b.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
            c.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the
ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary
conditions.
            d.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            e.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the City.
            f.   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
            g.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to
flooding for the proposed use.
            h.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing
development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
            i.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for the area.
            j.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            k.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.
            l.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer,
gas, electrical, and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
            m.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
chapter.
         (2)   Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the
factors listed above, the Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such
conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
            a.   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
            b.   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
            c.   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed
restrictions.
            d.   Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this chapter.
            e.   Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the
flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration,
rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated
with the regulatory flood. The Board shall require that the applicant submit a
plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
   4.   Appeals to the Court. Any person or persons, jointly or severally,
aggrieved by any decision of the Board may present to a court of record a
petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole
or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be
presented to the court within thirty days after the filing of the decision in
the office of the Board.
160.08 NONCONFORMING USES.  
   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before
the passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but which
is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be continued
subject to the following conditions:
   1.   If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any future use
of the structure premises shall conform to this chapter.
   2.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
   3.   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,

165.04 APPLICATION OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS.
   The regulations set by this chapter within each district shall be minimum
regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of structure or
land, and particularly, except as hereinafter provided:
   1.   No building, structure or land shall hereafter be used or occupied, and
no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected,
constructed, reconstructed, or structurally altered unless in conformity with
all of the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is
located.
   2.   No building or other structure shall hereafter be erected or altered:
      A.   To exceed the height;
      B.   To accommodate or house a greater number of families;
      C.   To occupy a greater percentage of lot area;
      D.   To have narrower or smaller rear yards, front yards, side yards, or
other open spaces than herein required; or in any other manner contrary to the
provisions of this chapter.
   3.   No part of a yard or other open space or off-street parking or loading
space required about or in connection with any building for the purpose of
complying with this chapter, shall be included as part of a yard, open space,
or off-street parking, or loading space similarly required for any other
building.
   4.   No yard or lot existing at the time of passage of the Zoning Code shall
be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements set forth
herein.  Yards or lots created after the effective date of the Zoning Code
shall meet at least the minimum requirements established by this chapter.
165.05 NONCONFORMING LOTS, USES OF LAND, AND USES OF STRUCTURES AND PREMISES.
   1.   Intent.  Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments
that may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures and uses of land and
structures which were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, but
which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this
chapter or future amendment. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these
nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their
survival.  It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall
not be enlarged upon, expanded, or extended, or be used as grounds for adding
other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.  To avoid
undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in
the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual
construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or
amendment of the Zoning Code and upon which actual building construction has
been diligently carried on.   
   2.   Nonconforming Lots of Record.  In any district in which single-family
dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other
provisions of this chapter, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory
buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of the Zoning Code.  This provision shall apply even
though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that
are generally applicable in the district.
   3.   Nonconforming Uses of Land.  Where, at the effective date of adoption
or amendment of the Zoning Code, lawful use of land exists that is made no
longer permissible under the terms of the Zoning Code as enacted or amended,
such use may be continued subject to the following provisions:
      A.   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased or extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of the Zoning Code.
      B.   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of the Zoning Code.
      C.   If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than six months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform
to the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which such
land is located.
   4.   Nonconforming Use of Structures.  If a lawful use of a structure, or of
structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption
or amendment of the Zoning Ordinance that would not be allowed in the district
under the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may be continued subject to the
following provisions:
      A.   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter
in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, or structurally altered except in changing the use
of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
      B.   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of the Zoning Code, but no such use shall be extended to

with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official.
   6.   Special Permit Uses.  Any use for which a special exception is
permitted as provided in Section

165.06 GENERAL REGULATIONS.
   1.   Visibility at Intersections in Residential Districts.  On a corner lot
in any residential district, nothing shall be erected, placed, planted, or
allowed to grow in such a manner as to impede vision between a height of two
and one-half and 10 feet above the centerline grades of the intersecting
streets in the area bounded by the street lines of such corner lots and a line
joining points along said street lines 25 feet from the point of intersection
or right-of-way lines.
   2.   Fences, Walls, and Hedges.  Fences, walls, and hedges may be permitted
in any required yard, or along the edge of any yard, provided that no fence,
wall or hedge along the side or front edge of any front yard shall be over four
feet in height.
   3.   Street Frontage Required.  No lot shall contain any building used in
whole or in part for residence purposes unless such lot abuts for at least 40
feet on at least one street, or unless it has an exclusive unobstructed private
easement of access or right-of-way of at least 20 feet wide to a street; and
there shall be not more than one single-family dwelling for such frontage or
easement.
   4.   Accessory Buildings.  No accessory buildings shall be erected in any
required court or in any yard other than a rear yard, except as provided
herein. Accessory buildings shall be distant at least five feet from a rear lot
line and any other separate building on the lot, and two feet from side lot
lines, and on a corner lot they shall conform to the setback regulations on the
side street.  Accessory buildings, except buildings housing animals or fowl,
may be erected as a part of the principal building, or may be connected thereto
by a breezeway or similar structure, provided all yard requirements for a
principal building are complied with.  An accessory building which is not a
part of the main building shall not occupy more than 900 square feet of 30
percent of the rear yard, whichever is less; and shall not exceed 16 feet in
height with 10 feet sidewalls.  However, this regulation shall not be
interpreted to prohibit the construction of a 440 square foot garage on a
minimum rear yard. All accessory buildings shall meet the minimum standards set
out in Paragraph D of Subsection 10 of this section entitled “Residential
Dwelling Standards.”
   5.   Corner Lots.  For corner lots, platted after the effective date of the
Zoning Code, the street side yard shall be equal in width to the setback
regulation of the lots to the rear having frontage on the intersecting
street.  On corner lots platted and of record at the time of the effective date
of the Zoning Code, the side yard regulation shall apply to the longer street
side of the lot except in the case of reverse frontage where the corner lot
faces an intersection street.  In this case, there shall be side yard on the
longer street side of the corner lot of not less than 50 percent of the setback
required on the lots to the rear of such corner lot, and no accessory building
on said corner lot shall project beyond the setback line of the lots in the
rear; provided further, this regulation shall not be interpreted as to reduce
the buildable width of the corner lot facing an intersecting street and of
record or as shown by existing contract of purchase at the time of the
effective date of the Zoning Code, to less than 28 feet or to prohibit the
erection of an accessory building.
   6.   Building Lines on Approved Plats.  Whenever the plat of a land
subdivision approved by the Commission and on record in the office of the
County Recorder shows a building line along any frontage for the purpose of
creating a front yard or side street yard line, the building line thus shown
shall apply along such frontage in place of any other yard line required in
this chapter unless specific yard requirements in this chapter require a
greater setback.
   7.   Front Yard - Exceptions.  In areas where some lots are developed with a
front yard that is less than the minimum required for the district by this
chapter or where some lots have been developed with a front yard greater than
required by this chapter, the following rule shall apply.  Any new building or
addition in front thereof shall not be closer to the street right-of-way than
the average of the front yard of the first building on each side within a
distance of 200 feet measured from building to building, except as follows:
      A.   Buildings located entirely on the rear half of a lot shall not be
counted.
      B.   No building shall be required to have a front yard greater than 50
feet.
      C.   If no building exists on one side of a lot within 200 feet of the
lot in question, the minimum front yard shall be the same as the building on
the other side.
   8.   Adult Uses.  Adult uses in residential districts, commercial districts,
or industrial districts which are immediately adjacent to and which serve
residential neighborhoods have a deleterious effect on both the business and
the residential segments of the neighborhood.  The establishment of more than
two adult uses within 1,000 feet of each other compounds this deleterious
effect.  Control of the location of adult uses is needed to allow an acceptable
level of such uses while maintaining neighborhoods which meet the expectations
of the general public.
      A.   An adult use shall not be located within 1,000 feet of another adult
use or within 1,000 feet of any public or parochial school, licensed day-care
facility, church, public park, residential district, or any dwelling (one-
family, two-family or multiple dwelling).
      B.   The 1,000 foot restrictions shall be computed by measurement from
the residential zone or from the nearest property line of the land used for
another adult use or any public or parochial school, licensed day-care
facility, church, public park, residential district, or any dwelling to the
nearest entrance of the building in which adult uses are to occur, using a
route of direct measured horizontal distance.
      C.   All building openings, entries, windows, etc., shall be covered in
such a manner as to prevent a view into the interior from any public or semi-
public area.  Advertisements, displays or other promotional materials shall not
be shown or exhibited so as to be visible to the public from pedestrian
sidewalks, walkways, or from other public or semi-public areas.
   9.   Sidewalks.  Sidewalks shall be required for any new dwelling.  The
sidewalks shall be constructed on all sides of the lot which abut a street and
built according to the specifications set out in
Chapter 136 of this Code of Ordinances.  The building permit shall include
plans for the construction and placement of the sidewalks.
   10.   Residential Dwelling Standards.  All residential dwelling units shall
meet the following minimum standards:
      A.   The dwelling unit must have a minimum width of 22 feet for at least
65 percent of the length of the dwelling unit, said dimension to be exclusive
of attached garages, porches, or other accessory structures.
      B.   All dwelling units including attached garages shall be placed on a
permanent frost-free foundation.
      C.   All dwelling units shall have a minimum roof pitch of 3:12.  This
requirement shall not apply to manufactured housing if the housing otherwise
complies with 42 U.S.C. Sec. 5403.
      D.   All dwelling units shall have an exterior wall covering that is
either:
         (1)   Wood or masonry finish or its appearance, and/or;
         (2)   Vertical or horizontal grooved siding or lap siding or its
appearance.
         (3)   The use of flat or corrugated sheet metal for exterior walls or
roof covering is prohibited.  Metal roofing that meets or exceeds the
requirements of
Chapter 156 of the Code of Ordinances shall be allowed.

demonstrable and exceptional hardship as distinguished from variations for
purposes of convenience, profit, or caprice.

public’s health, safety, and general welfare.  All site plans submitted shall
conform to the standards and to the City’s standard construction
specifications.
   1.   The design of the proposed development shall make adequate provisions

property in such a manner as to not unduly diminish or impair the use and
enjoyment of adjoining property and to this end shall minimize the adverse
effect on such adjoining properties from automobile headlights, illumination of
required peripheral yards, refuge containers, and imperilment of light and
air.  For purposes of this section, the term “use and enjoyment of adjoining
property” means the use and enjoyment presently being made of such adjoining
property, unless such property is vacant.  If vacant, the term “use and
enjoyment of adjoining property” means those uses permitted under the zoning
district in which adjoining property is located.
   3.   The proposed development shall conform to all applicable provisions of
the Code of Iowa, and all applicable provisions of this Code of Ordinances.
   4.   The proposed development shall have such entrances and exits upon
adjacent streets and such internal traffic circulation pattern as will not
unduly increase congestion on adjacent surrounding public streets.
   5.   All electrical, telephone and other public utilities shall be placed
underground, where required under applicable subdivision regulations, or
wherever installation of the same is reasonably practicable.
   6.   The proposed development shall be in conformity with the standards of
the comprehensive plan and with recognized principles of civic design, land use
planning and landscape architecture.

surrounding area and in an aesthetically sound manner.
      B.   Parking Lot Lights:
         (1)   Parking lot lights are required to be halogen, metal halide,
LED, or others with similar qualities to reduce glare and provide for improved
color correct vision.
         (2)   Full cut-off high pressure sodium lamps, not exceeding a maximum
lumen rating of 16,000 lumens, may be used in outdoor storage areas where the
need for good color rendering capabilities for safety and security is not
necessary. Such areas must not be accessible to the general public or adjacent
to any residential zoning district.
         (3)   The fixture itself cannot be adjustable; the fixture must be
permanently fixed at an angle such that it shines directly onto the parking
lot.
         (4)   No portion of the lamp, lens, or diffuser shall be visible from
the side or top of any shield, or otherwise protrude from the bottom of the
shield.
         (5)   No forward-throwing flood lights are allowed in the parking lot.

with a certified copy of its resolution showing action of the Commission.
   10.   The Council shall then consider the plat and if the same is acceptable
and in accordance with this chapter, the Council shall accept the same. If said
plat is disapproved by the Council, such disapproval shall be pointed out in
writing wherein said proposed plat is objectionable.
   11.   The passage of a resolution by the Council accepting the plat shall
constitute final approval of the platting of the area shown on the final plat,
but the subdivider or owner shall cause such plat to be recorded in the office
of the County Recorder, as provided in Chapter 354 of the Code of Iowa, and
amendatory acts thereto, and shall file satisfactory evidence of such recording
in the office of the Clerk before the City shall recognize the plat as being in

170.04 SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS.
   1.   Blocks.
      A.   No block shall be longer than 1,320 feet except as approved by the
Commission.
      B.   At street intersections, block corners shall be rounded with a
radius of not less than 25 feet; where, at any one intersection, a curve radius
has been previously established, such radius shall be used as standard.
   2.   Easements. Easements for utilities shall be provided along rear or side
lot lines or long alleys, if needed. Whenever any stream or important surface
water course is located in an area that is being subdivided, the subdivider
shall, at the subdivider’s own expense, make adequate provision for
straightening or widening the channel so it will properly carry the surface
water, and shall reserve or dedicate to the City an easement along each side of
the stream. Such easements shall be for the purpose of widening, improving,
maintaining, or protecting the stream. The width of such easements shall be not
less than 20 feet each, plus the stream design width and the total width of the
easement shall be adequate to provide for any necessary channel straightening
or relocation.
   3.   Lots.
      A.   Corner lots shall be not less than 20 feet greater in width than the
minimum required interior lot width so as to permit adequate building setbacks
on both front and side streets.
      B.   Double frontage lots other than corner lots are prohibited except
where such lots back onto a major street or highway or except in the case of
large commercial or industrial lots. Such double frontage lots shall be
buffered from the rear street frontage by permanent screen walls, planting
screens, or other screening method deemed acceptable by the Commission.
Ingress/egress shall be limited to the frontage street and is strictly
prohibited on the rear street.
      C.   Each lot shall be provided by means of a public street with
satisfactory access to an existing public street.
      D.   Each lot shall be provided with not less than 20 feet of access
frontage to a public street.
      E.   No lot shall be less in size, or shape required to provide an
adequate building site in compliance with the Zoning Regulations.
      F.   Lot Size. For the purpose of complying with minimum health
standards, the following minimum lot sizes shall be observed:
         (1)   Lots which cannot be reasonably served by an existing public
sanitary sewer system and public water mains shall have a minimum width of 100
feet, measured at the building line, and an area of not less than two acres or
the minimum permitted by the Zoning Regulations, whichever is larger.
         (2)   Lots which are not within a reasonable distance of a public
sanitary sewer system but are connected to a public water supply main shall
have a minimum width of 80 feet and an area of two acres or the minimum
permitted by the Zoning Regulations, whichever is larger.
      G.   Side lot lines where possible shall be at right angles or radial to
the street lines.
   4.   Concrete Monuments. Monuments shall be placed at block corners, point
of curves. Iron rods shall be placed at the change in direction along lot lines
and at each lot corner.
   5.   Streets and Right-of-Ways.
      A.   Alleys. Alleys may be required in business areas and industrial
districts for adequate access to block interiors and for off-street loading and
parking purposes. Except where justified by unusual conditions, alleys will not
be approved in residential districts. Dead-end alleys shall be provided with a
means of turning around at the dead end thereof.
      B.   Circulation. The street pattern shall provide ease of circulation
within the subdivision as well as convenient access to adjoining streets,
thoroughfares or unsubdivided land as may be required by the Commission. In a
case where a street will eventually be extended beyond the plat, but is
temporarily dead ended, an interim turnaround may be required.
      C.   Comprehensive Plan. All proposed plats and subdivisions shall
conform to the Comprehensive Plan.
      D.   Continuation of Existing Streets. Proposed streets shall provide for
continuation or completion of an existing street (constructed or recorded) in
adjoining property at equal or greater width, but not less than 60 feet in
width, except cul-de-sacs and in similar alignment, unless variations are
recommended by the Commission and approved by the Council.
      E.   Cul-de-sac. Whenever a cul-de-sac is permitted, such street shall
comply with the minimum requirements set forth on Sketch 1 at the end of this
chapter, as applicable.
      F.   Dedication. A deed to the City shall be given for all streets before
the same will be accepted for City maintenance.
      G.   Half Streets. Dedication of half streets will be discouraged. Where
there exists a dedicated or platted half street or alley adjacent to the tract
to be subdivided, the other half shall be platted if deemed necessary by the
Commission.
      H.   Land Not Platted. Where the plat to be submitted includes only part
of the tract owned by the subdivider, the Commission may require topography and
a master plan of the entire tract of land under the ownership, mortgage
purchase options or other agreements for deed.
      I.   Major Thoroughfares. When a new subdivision, except where justified
by limiting conditions, involves frontage on a heavy trafficway, the street
layout shall provide motor access to such frontage by one of the following
means:
         (1)   A parallel street supplying frontage for lots backing on the
trafficway.
         (2)   A series of cul-de-sacs or short loops entered from and planned
at right angles to such a parallel street, with their terminal lots backing
onto the highways.
         (3)   An access drive separated by a planting strip from the highway
to which a motor access from the drive is provided at points suitably spaced.
         (4)   A service drive or alley at the rear of the lots. Where any of
the above-mentioned arrangements is used, deed covenants or other means should
prevent any private residential driveways from having direct access to the
trafficway.
      J.   Neighborhood Plan. If any overall plan has been made by the
Commission for the neighborhood in which the proposed subdivision is located,
the street system of the latter shall conform in general thereto.
      K.   Physical and Cultural Features. In general, streets shall be platted
with appropriate regard for topography, creeks, wooded areas, and other natural
features which would lend themselves to attractive treatment.
      L.   Railroads. If a railroad is involved, the subdivision plat should:
         (1)   Be so arranged as to permit, where necessary, future grade
separations at highway crossings of the railroad.
         (2)   Border the railroad with a parallel street at a sufficient
distance from it to permit deep lots to back onto railroad, or form a buffer
strip for park, commercial or industrial use.
         (3)   Provide cul-de-sacs at right angles to the railroad so as to
permit lots to back onto the railroad.
      M.   Street Grades. Streets and alleys shall be completed to grades which
have been officially determined or approved by the City Engineer. All streets
shall be graded to the full width of the right-of-way and adjacent side slopes
graded to blend with the natural ground level. The maximum grade shall not
exceed six percent for main and secondary thoroughfares or 10 percent for minor
or local service streets. All changes in grades on major roads or highways
shall be connected by vertical curves of a minimum length equivalent to 20
times the algebraic difference between the rates of grades, expressed in feet
per hundred, or greater, if deemed necessary by the City Engineer, for
secondary and minor streets, 15 times. The grade alignment and resultant
visibility, especially at intersections, shall be worked out in detail to meet
the approval of the City Engineer.
      N.   Street Intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly at
right angles as possible.
      O.   Street Names. All newly platted streets shall be named and in a
manner conforming to the prevailing street naming system. A proposed street
that is obviously in alignment with other existing streets, or with a street
that may logically be extended although the various portions be at a
considerable distance from each other, shall bear the same name. Names of new
streets shall be subject to the approval of the City in order to avoid
duplication or close similarity of names.
      P.   Driveways. All newly constructed driveways shall be surfaced with
Portland Cement Concrete or asphaltic material or shall be dust-proofed in some
other manner as may be approved by the Council and shall be maintained in a
dust-free condition. Driveways shall include all residential, commercial,
industrial, or institutional access drives and parking lots and shall be hard
surfaced in the right-of-way and on private property. Any addition or
alteration in excess of 50 percent of the main floor area shall reconstruct the
driveway with the aforementioned material.

final plat, all of the foregoing improvements shall be constructed and accepted
by formal resolution of the Council. Before passage of said resolution of
acceptance, the City Engineer shall report that said improvements meet all City
specifications and ordinances or other requirements and agreements between the
subdivider and the City. This requirement may be waived if the subdivider posts
a performance bond or certified check with the City guaranteeing that said
improvements will be constructed within a period of one year from final
acceptance of the plat; however, if a performance bond is posted, final
acceptance of the plat will not constitute final acceptance by the City of any
improvements to be constructed. Improvements will be accepted only after their
construction has been completed and no public funds will be expended in the
subdivision until such improvements have been completed and accepted by the
City. If a performance bond is posted, such bond shall be subject to review by
the City Attorney prior to acceptance, shall specifically assure the expedient
installation and completion of all improvements within the specified
construction time period, and shall indemnify the City from any and all costs
or losses of the development and construction. The Council may waive the
requirements of this chapter for the construction and installation of some or
all of the improvements in cases of resubdivisions where only the size, shape,
and arrangement of the lots is being changed; provided, however, such waiver
shall be limited to existing improvements in good repair as determined by the
City Engineer. Improvements not existing or in poor repair shall meet the
requirements of this chapter. The Council may waive the requirements of this
chapter for the construction and installation of some or all of the
improvements in cases of dedications of land or right-of-way to public use
where such dedication is in excess of the needs of the subdivision and is
desired by a public agency in lieu of a purchase or condemnation proceeding.
