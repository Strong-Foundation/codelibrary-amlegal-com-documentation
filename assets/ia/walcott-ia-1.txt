claim, or interest of the owner, lienholders, or claimants after the expiration
of the 10-day reclaiming period.
7.   If it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identities
and addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders, notice by one
publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the
vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice
under Subsection 2 of this section. The published notice may contain multiple
listings of abandoned vehicles, but shall be published within the same time
requirements and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed notice
in Subsection 2 of this section.

The Public Works Director shall supervise the installation of water service
pipes and their connection to the water main and enforce all regulations
pertaining to water services in the City in accordance with this chapter. This
chapter shall apply to all replacements of existing water service pipes as well
as to new ones. The Public Works Director shall make such rules, not in
conflict with the provisions of this chapter, as may be needed for the detailed
operation of the water system, subject to the approval of the Council. In the
event of an emergency the Public Works Director may make temporary rules for
the protection of the system until due consideration by the Council may be had.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 372.13[4])
90.03   MANDATORY CONNECTIONS.
All residences, commercial establishments, industrial establishments, or other
structures/establishments located within the City limits intended or used for
human habitation, occupancy, or use, or intended or used for the disbursement
of water for other purposes, shall be connected to the public water supply
system, if the same is reasonably available to the property upon which the
applicable structure is located or use incurred. No private water system shall
be installed, expanded or otherwise used if the public water supply is
reasonably available, as referenced herein, and at such time as the public
water supply is reasonably available, as referenced herein, all use of a
private water supply system shall be discontinued and connection with the
public water supply system shall be effected. Before any private water system
is installed, expanded or otherwise used due to the unavailability of the
public water supply system, said system must be approved by the Public Works
Director and the Council, and the payment of a permit fee established by
resolution of the Council shall be made. In addition, all permits required by
any federal or State governmental agency such as the County Board of Health or
the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be submitted. Satisfactory
results of a water test performed by an approved authority shall be submitted
to the City before use of a private water system is permitted. No cross
connections between private and public water supply systems shall be permitted.
These provisions shall not be construed to require the City to extend existing
public water supply system lines to any property or area of the City.
Notwithstanding the provisions as set forth in the preceding paragraph, the
Council, by resolution or motion, may waive the requirement of connection to
the public water supply system otherwise reasonably available, and/or may
permit the expansion of a private water supply system, for private property
serviced by a private commercial water supply system in existence, if the
Council determines that such waiver or expansion is a substantial benefit to
and in the best interest of the City of Walcott. Before approving the waiver or
expansion, the Council shall consider the following factors (and such other
factors as the Council deems pertinent):
1.   The meeting of fire protection or other safety standards.
2.   The cost of extending the private water supply system to the public water
supply system.
3.   The cost of installation of the existing private water supply system and
the time such private water system has been in operation, as it relates to the
property owner/s recoupment of costs.
4.   The economic or other benefit to the City of Walcott anticipated to be
achieved by the waiver of the connection required or the expansion of the
private water supply system.
5.   Any desired limitation on the expansion of the private water supply system
such as a use limitation, termination of the permitted use at a specific time
or upon a specific occurrence, change of ownership of the property, testing
standards or other matters, any or all of which may be imposed as part of the
resolution or motion adopted by the Council.
6.   The need to obtain approval (initial or continuing) from the Public Works
Director, federal or State governmental agencies or the like.
7.   The historical pattern of use of the private water supply system.
8.   The City of Walcott’s past practices, if any, regarding the private water
supply system’s uses or expansions.
In the event the Council waives a connection requirement and/or permits the
expansion of an existing commercial private water supply system, the Council
reserves the right to require a connection of the private water supply system
to the public water system in the event the conditions under which the waiver
or expansion was permitted change or the owner of the property (or tenant of
the property, if applicable) fails to comply with restrictions established by
the Council.
90.04   ABANDONED CONNECTIONS.
When an existing water service is abandoned or a service is renewed with a new
tap in the main, all abandoned connections with the mains shall be turned off
at the corporation stop and made absolutely watertight.

permit must be obtained from the City. The application for the permit shall
include a legal description of the property, the name of the property owner,
the name and address of the person who will do the work, and the general uses
of the water. If the proposed work meets all the requirements of this chapter
and if all fees required under this chapter have been paid, the permit shall be
issued. Work under any permit must be completed within six months after the
permit is issued, except that when such time period is inequitable or unfair
due to conditions beyond the control of the person making the application, an
extension of time within which to complete the work may be granted. The permit
may be revoked at any time for any violation of these chapters.
90.06   WATER CONNECTION FEE.
Before any permit is issued, the person who makes the application shall pay
$25.00 to the Clerk to cover the cost of issuing the permit. There shall be a

shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the City from any loss
or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation or
maintenance of said water service pipe.
90.10   FAILURE TO MAINTAIN.
When any portion of the water service pipe which is the responsibility of the
property owner becomes defective or creates a nuisance and the owner fails to
correct such nuisance, the City may do so and assess the costs thereof to the
property. In the event of an emergency, service pipes located between the main
and curb stop may be repaired by the City without notice and costs thereof may
be assessed to the property.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[3a and h])
90.11   CURB VALVE.

90.12   INTERIOR VALVE.
There shall be installed a shut-off valve on every service pipe inside the
building as close to the entrance of the pipe within the building as possible
and so located that the water can be shut off conveniently. Where one service
pipe supplies more than one customer within the building, there shall be
separate valves for each such customer so that service may be shut off for one
without interfering with service to the others.
90.13   INSPECTION AND APPROVAL.
All water service pipes and their connections to the water system must be
inspected and approved in writing by the City before they are covered, and the
City shall keep a record of such approvals. If the City refuses to approve the

work. Every person who uses or intends to use the municipal water system shall
permit the City staff to enter the premises to inspect or make necessary
alterations or repairs at all reasonable hours and on proof of authority.
90.14   COMPLETION BY THE CITY.
Should any excavation be left open or only partly refilled for 24 hours after

should the work be improperly done, the City shall have the right to finish or
correct the work, and the Council shall assess the costs to the property owner
or the plumber. If the plumber is assessed, the plumber must pay the costs
before receiving another permit. If the property owner is assessed, such
assessment may be collected with and in the same manner as general property
taxes.

93.02 Facts Found                93.05 Termination of Shortage
93.03 Authority Granted to Mayor 93.06 Violation
 
93.01   PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to authorize the Mayor to manage the City’s
water supply and to take special measures to preserve the same in the event of
a water shortage.
93.02   FACTS FOUND.
The Council hereby makes the following findings of facts regarding the capacity
and use of the water supply system of the City:
1.   The continued existence of climatic, hydrological, and other extraordinary
conditions may endanger health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the
City by affecting the capacity and operation of the water supply system serving
the City and may therefore require that certain uses of water, not essential to
public health, safety, and welfare, be reduced, restricted, or curtailed.
2.   When the condition of a shortage of potable water becomes increasingly
more critical, conservation measures to further reduce consumption or curtailed
non-essential water use may be required.
3.   There exists an immediate potential for a shortage of potable water in the
City water system, and increasingly more restrictive conservation measures are
required to prevent a crucial water shortage.
93.03   AUTHORITY GRANTED TO MAYOR.
The Mayor is hereby authorized and directed to implement conservation measures
by ordering the restricted use or absolute curtailment of the use of water for
certain non-essential purposes for the duration of the water shortage in the
manner hereinafter set forth. In exercising this discretionary authority and in
making the determination set forth herein, the Mayor shall give due
consideration to water levels, available/usable storage on hand, draw-down
rates and the projected supply capability at the well-head; supply capacity,
rate of usage and projected supplies of wells in the water system; system
purification and pumping capacity; daily water consumption and consumption
projections of the system’s customers; prevailing and forecast weather
conditions; fire service requirements; pipeline conditions (including breakage,
stoppage, and leaks); supplementary source data; safety and such other data
pertinent to the past, current, and projected water demands.
93.04   EXEMPTIONS.
The provisions of the chapter or regulations promulgated hereunder, which are
hereby authorized, shall not apply to any governmental activity, institution,
business, or industry, upon a proper showing to be necessary for the public
health, safety, and welfare, or the prevention of severe economic hardship or
the substantial loss of employment. Any activity, institution, business or
industry aggrieved may appeal to the Council in the manner provided elsewhere
in this Code of Ordinances.
93.05   TERMINATION OF SHORTAGE.
Upon a determination by the Mayor of the existence of one of the following
conditions, the Mayor shall take the action indicated:
1.   Water Alert. When moderate, but limited, supplies of water are available,
the Mayor shall, through appropriate and reasonable means, call upon the
general population to employ prudent restraint in water usage and to conserve
water voluntarily by methods available.
2.   Water Emergency. When very limited supplies of water are available, the
Mayor shall order curtailment of less essential or non-essential uses of water,
including, but not limited to, one or more of the following:
   A.   The watering of shrubbery, trees, lawns, grass, plants, or any
vegetation, except indoor planting, greenhouse or nursery stocks, and except
watering by commercial nurseries of freshly planted plants upon planting and
once a week for five weeks following planting.
   B.   The washing of automobiles, trucks, trailers, airplanes, or any other
type of mobile equipment.
   C.   The washing of streets, driveways, parking lots, service station
aprons, office buildings, exteriors of homes or apartments, or other outdoor
surfaces.
   D.   The operation of any ornamental fountain or other structure making a
similar use of water.
   E.   The filling of swimming and wading pools, or the refilling of swimming
and wading pools which were drained after the effective date of the order,
except for replacement of water lost because of evaporation or overflow caused
by use.
   F.   The use of water from fire hydrants for any purpose other than fire
suppression or other public emergency.

16.   "Pass-through" means a discharge which exits the POTW into waters of the
United States in quantities or concentrations which, alone or in conjunction
with a discharge or discharges from other sources, is a cause of a violation of
any requirement of the City's NPDES permit, including an increase in the
magnitude or duration of a violation.

reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's operation or for
violating any Pretreatment Standard or requirement.
   C.   The City may determine that an industrial user subject to categorical
Pretreatment Standards is a non-significant categorical industrial user (NSCIS)
rather than a SIU on a finding that the industrial user never discharges more
than 100 gpd of total categorical wastewater (excluding sanitary, non-contact
cooling and boiler blowdown wastewater, unless specifically included in the
Pretreatment Standard) and the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The industrial user, prior to [City's] finding, has consistently

batch discharge, which has a reasonable potential to cause interference or
pass-through, or in any other way violate the POTW's regulations, local limits
or permit conditions. Any discharge of water, sewage, or industrial waste that
in concentration of any given constituent or in quantity of flow exceeds for
any period of duration longer than 15 minutes more than five times the average
24-hour concentration or flows during normal operation is considered a slug
discharge.
32.   "Storm drain" or "storm sewer" means a sewer that carries storm and
surface waters and drainage but excludes sewage and industrial wastes, other
than unpolluted cooling water.

notice of violation.
   A.   Within the days specified in the written notice of violation of the
receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required
actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Public Works Director.
   B.   Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the user of liability for
any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
   C.   Nothing in this Section shall limit the authority of Public Works
Director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
3.   Continuing Violations.
   A.   Any person who shall continue any violation beyond the time limit

period, greater than 10 exceedances in any three-month period, greater than 12
exceedances in any 6-month period, or greater than 20 exceedances in any 12-
month period are designated significant non­ compliance. Facilities in
significant non-compliance shall be notified to the public by publication in
local newspaper and media outlining the exceedances.
4.   Emergency Suspensions. The Public Works Director may immediately suspend a
user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension
is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably
appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of persons. Public Works Director may also immediately
suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that
threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or
may present, an endangerment to the environment.
   A.   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Public Works
Director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance
of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its
receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Public Works Director
may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated
to the satisfaction of the Public Works Director that the period of
endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in Section 95.09(5)
are initiated against the user.
   B.   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Public Works Director prior to the date
of any show cause or termination hearing under this ordinance.
   C.   Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any Emergency Suspension under this Section.

   D.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of
inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
   E.   Violation of the Pretreatment Standards in this ordinance.
   F.   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge
and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section 95.09(4B) why the
proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the Public
Works Director shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
6.   Liability Imposed. Any person violating any of the provisions of these
chapters shall become liable to the City for any expense, loss, or damage
occasioned the City by reason of such violation.

as defined herein.
12.   Noxious or Malodorous Gases. Any noxious or malodorous gas or other
substance which either singly or by interaction with other wastes can create a
public nuisance or hazard to life or of preventing entry into sewers for their
maintenance and repair.
13.   Damaging Substances. Any waters, wastes, materials or substances which
react with water or wastes in the sewer system to release noxious gases,
develop color of undesirable intensity, form suspended solids in objectionable
concentration, or create any other condition deleterious to structures and
treatment processes.
14.   Untreatable Wastes. Waters or wastes containing substances which are not
amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed
or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment
plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having

section; or (iv) having an average daily flow or organic load greater than two
percent of the average daily sewage flow of the City. Where necessary, the
discharging party may be required to pay a surcharge as set forth in the sewer
rate chapter provisions and/or shall provide at such user's expense, such
preliminary treatment as may be necessary to (i) reduce the biochemical oxygen
demand to 300 parts per million and the suspended solids to 300 parts per
million by weight; or (ii) reduce objectionable characteristics or constituents
to within the maximum limits provided for in this section; or (iii) control the
quantities and rates of discharge of such waters or wastes. Plans,
specifications, and any treatment facilities shall be submitted for review and
approval to the City Engineer and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, and
no construction of such facilities shall be commenced until said approval is
obtained in writing.
97.04   RESTRICTED DISCHARGES - POWERS.
If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the
public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in Section 97.03, and which in the judgment of the
Public Works Director may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works,
processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard
to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Public Works Director may:
1.   Rejection. Reject the wastes by requiring disconnection from the public
sewage system;
2.   Pretreatment. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for
discharge to the public sewers;
3.   Controls Imposed. Require control over the quantities and rates of
discharge; and/or
4.   Special Charges. Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and
treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the
provisions of Chapter 99.
97.05   SPECIAL FACILITIES.
If the Public Works Director permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste
flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject
to the review and approval of the Public Works Director and Council, and
subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws.
Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any
waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and
effective operation by the owner at the owner's expense.
1.   Pretreatment Facilities.
   A.   Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with
this ordinance and shall achieve compliance with all categorical Pretreatment
Standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in Sections 97.02 and
97.03 within the time limitations specified by EPA, the State, or the Public
Works Director, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for
compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the User's expense.
Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the Public Works Director for review and shall be acceptable to
the Public Works Director before such facilities are constructed. The review of
such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge
acceptable to the City under the provisions of this ordinance.
   B.   Grease, oil, and suspended solids interceptors shall be provided when,
in the opinion of the Public Works Director, they are necessary for the proper
handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil,
suspended solids, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required
for residential users. All interception units shall be of a type and capacity
approved by the Public Works Director and shall be so located to be easily
accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall comply with the
City's Fats, Oil and Grease Management regulations and shall be inspected,
cleaned, and repaired by the user at their expense
97.06   INSPECTION STRUCTURE.
When required by the Public Works Director or the Council, the owner of any
property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install
a suitable structure together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and
measurement of the wastes. Such structure shall be accessible and safely
located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Public Works Director. The structure shall be installed by the owner at the
owner's expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and
accessible at all times. All commercial or industrial establishments
discharging other than domestic waste shall be required to install a monitoring
manhole, in accordance with standards established by the Public Works
Department. The Public Works Department shall require the installation of
continuous monitoring equipment, when in the judgment of the Public Works
Director, such installation is deemed to be necessary for appropriate
monitoring (the total cost to be borne solely by the discharging party).
97.07   TESTING OF WASTES.
1.   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole.
2.   In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control
manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public
sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected.
3.   Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect
the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence
of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses involved will
determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is
appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but
not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour
composites of all outfalls whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab
samples.)
4.   Sampling and analysis results shall be reported to the City monthly unless
otherwise stipulated by agreement. Reported results shall identify results more
than the thresholds contained in the Code of Ordinances and stipulated in
applicable agreement(s). Any results that are greater than thresholds shall be
reported to the City upon knowledge of the result.
5.   Failure to conduct a required test will result in a $500.00 penalty fee
for each test that is omitted.

interpreted to obligate the City to continue permitting discharges into the
municipal sewer system which exceed maximum requirements or limitations as may
be otherwise established. The City Council with recommendation from the Public
Works Director may consider a reduction, but not 100 percent elimination of
surcharges, for extenuating circumstances such as equipment malfunction,
extraordinary single event, or other pertinent information if petitioned by the
discharger. Council's decision is final and discharger shall abide by the
rendered decision. Any surcharge reduction actions by Council are on the
individual case and merits and not preconditioned by prior such reductions.
(Ord. 551-24 - Jan. 25 Supp.)
99.10   SEWER SERVICE CHARGES ADJUSTMENT.
The City Council may grant an adjustment to sewer service charges for water
leaks that have resulted in unusually high sewer user fees, provided that the
adjustment meets the following criteria:
1.   The customer can demonstrate the following:
   A.   The excessive sewer service charge was the result of a leak in the
plumbing system on the customer’s property.
   B.   The leak has been completely repaired.
   C.   The leak was not caused by the customer’s or occupant’s negligence.
   D.   The water from the leak did not enter the sanitary sewer system.

100.01   REQUIRED CONNECTION – STORM DRAINS.
1.   The owner of any house, building or property served by a collection pit
with any means of extracting and/or discharging stormwater, surface water,
ground water, roof runoff, sub-surface drainage, cooling water, area drainage,
downspout drainage, or the like (all limited to unpolluted waters) shall
connect such extracted water or discharge to a City storm sewer when such storm
sewer is available within 100 feet of the property line. Such connection shall
be at the owner’s sole expense. Connections shall be required for all
residential or other structures constructed after June 1, 1991, and shall apply
to structures constructed prior to such date when City storm sewer becomes
available within the prescribed distance and upon the expiration of 120 days
following notice to the property owner of the required connection, given by the
City.
2.   There is hereby established a City-wide inspection program to determine
the existence and location of required connections to the City storm sewer. The
failure of any person owning affected property to voluntarily permit inspection
within 30 days of notice of the City’s intent to inspect any real estate under
the ownership of said person shall result in the imposition of a surcharge of
$50.00 per month per customer, which amount shall be added to the customer’s
utility bill until such time as inspection is permitted.
100.02   PROHIBITED DISCHARGES.
No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged or permit to be discharged
any stormwater, surface water, ground water, roof runoff, sub-surface drainage
(including, but not limited to interior and exterior foundation drains),
cooling water, area drainage, downspout drainage, or pit drainage of unpolluted
waters into any sanitary sewer system of the City by means of any pipe,
downspout, tile, or other connective or channeling device (direct or indirect
connection).
100.03   PROHIBITED CONNECTION SURCHARGE.
1.   Any person found to be in violation of the restrictions on prohibited
connections shall be subject to the imposition of a surcharge of $50.00 per
month which amount shall be added to the customer’s utility bill.
2.   Inspection Program. There is hereby established a City-wide inspection
program to determine the existence and location of all foundation and similar
drains connected to the sanitary sewer system with the City. The failure of any
person to voluntarily permit inspection within 30 days of notice of the City’s
intent to inspect any real estate under the control of said person shall result
in the imposition of a surcharge of $50.00 per month per customer, which amount
shall be added to the customer’s utility bill until such time as inspection is
permitted.
3.   Provision for Reinspection. There is hereby established a City-wide
reinspection program to determine that compliance with the referenced

The Company shall have the right to excavate in any public street for the
purpose of laying, re-laying, repairing, or extending gas pipes, mains,

sewer or the flow of water therefrom, which have been or may hereafter be
located by authority of the City.
110.04   CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE.
The Company shall, excluding facilities located in private easements (whether

expense, locate and relocate its existing facilities or equipment in, on, over,
or under any public street or alley in the City in such a manner as the City
may reasonably require for the purposes of facilitating the construction,
reconstruction, maintenance, or repair of the street or alley. If the City has
a reasonable alternative route for the street, alley, or public improvements or
an alternative construction method, which would not cause the relocation of the
Company installations, the City shall select said alternative route or
construction method. The City shall be responsible for surveying and staking
the right-of-way for City projects that require the Company to relocate Company
facilities. If requested, the City shall provide, at no cost to the Company,

necessary whether or not utility facilities must be relocated, the City at its
own cost shall be responsible for said removals. If the timing of the tree
removals does not coincide with the Company facilities relocation schedule and
the Company must remove trees that are included in the City’s portion of the
project, the City shall either remove the trees at its cost or reimburse the
Company for the expenses incurred to remove said trees. If project funds from a

facilities, the City shall attempt to secure said funds and provide them to the
Company to compensate the Company for the costs of relocation.

Company agrees any replacement of road surface shall conform to current City
code regarding its depth and composition. The Company shall not be required to
restore or modify public right-of-way, sidewalks, or other areas in or adjacent
to the Company project to a condition superior to its immediate previously
existing condition or to a condition exceeding its previously existing
condition to the extent any alterations are required for the City to comply
with City, State, or federal rules, regulations, or laws.

not deprive the Company of its right to operate and maintain existing
facilities on, below, above, or beneath the vacated property. Prior to the City
abandoning or vacating any street, avenue, alley or public ground where the
Company has facilities in the vicinity, the City shall provide the Company with
not less than 60-days’ advance notice of the City’s proposed action and, upon
request grant the Company a utility easement covering existing and future
facilities and activities. If the City fails to grant the Company a utility
easement for said facilities prior to abandoning or vacating a street, avenue,

110.03 -
110.07 of this chapter, if the City orders or requests the Company to relocate

facilitate the project of a commercial or private developer or other non-public
entity, the City shall reimburse or the City shall require the developer or
non-public entity to reimburse the Company for the cost of such relocation as a
precondition to relocation. The Company shall not be required to relocate in
order to facilitate such private project at its expense.
110.09   INDEMNIFICATION.
The Company shall indemnify and save harmless the City from any and all claims,
suits, losses, damages, costs, or expenses, on account of injury or damage to
any person or property, to the extent caused or occasioned by the Company’s
negligence in construction, reconstruction, excavation, operation, or
maintenance of the natural gas facilities authorized by this franchise;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to defend, indemnify
and save harmless the City for any costs or damages to the extent arising from
the negligence of the City, its officers, employees, or agents.
110.10   INFORMATION.
Upon reasonable request the Company shall provide the City, on a project
specific basis, information indicating the horizontal location, relative to
boundaries of the right-of-way, of all equipment which it owns or over which it
has control that is located in City right-of-way, including documents, maps,

certified mail, copies of annexation ordinances in a timely manner to ensure

reimburse the Company for the expenses incurred by the Company to provide such
data or information.
110.23   OBLIGATION TO COLLECT.
The obligation to collect and remit the fee imposed by this chapter is modified

or a lesser rate than provided in this chapter, in which case the obligation of
the Company to collect and remit franchise fee shall be modified to zero or the
lesser rate;
2.   The City adds additional territory by annexation or consolidation and is
unable or unwilling to impose the franchise fee upon all persons selling
natural gas at retail to consumers within the additional territory, in which
case the franchise fee imposed on the revenue from sales by the Company in the

paid by any other retail seller of natural gas within the City; or

action”) that modifies, but does not repeal, the ability of the City to impose
a franchise fee or the ability of the Company to collect from City customers
and remit franchise fees to the City. Within 60 days of final franchise fee
action, the City shall notify the Company and the parties shall meet to
determine whether this chapter can be revised, and, if so, how to revise the
franchise fee on a continuing basis to meet revised legal requirements. After
final franchise fee action and until passage by the City of revisions to the
franchise fee ordinance, the Company may temporarily discontinue collection and
remittance of the franchise fee if in its sole opinion it believes it is
required to do so in order to comply with revised legal requirements.
110.24   OBLIGATION RELIEVED.
The other provisions of this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Company shall be completely relieved of its obligation to collect and remit to
the City the franchise fee as, effective as the date specified below with no
liability therefor under each of any of the following circumstances as
determined to exist in the sole discretion of Company:

ruled to be unlawful by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date of
such ruling or as may be specified by that Court.

collection, or remittance of a franchise fee unlawful, effective as of the date
lawfully specified by the General Assembly.
3.   The Iowa Utilities Board, or its successor agency, denies the Company the
right to impose, collect, or remit a franchise fee provided such denial is
affirmed by the Supreme Court of Iowa, effective as of the date of the final
agency order from which the appeal is taken.
110.25   MANAGEMENT FEES.
Upon implementation of a franchise fee the City shall not, pursuant to Chapter
480A.6 of the Code of Iowa, impose or charge Company right-of-way management
fees for permits for Company construction, maintenance, repairs, excavation,
pavement cutting, or inspections of Company work sites and projects or related
matters.

Either City or Company (“party”) may terminate this franchise if the other
party shall be materially in breach of its provisions. Upon the occurrence of a
material breach, the non-breaching party shall provide the breaching party with
notification by certified mail specifying the alleged breach. The breaching
party shall have 60 days to cure the breach, unless it notifies the non-
breaching party, and the parties agree upon a shorter or longer period for
cure. If the breach is not cured within the cure period, the non-breaching

thereof, because of (i) dilapidation, deterioration, or decay; (ii) faulty
construction; (iii) the removal, movement, or instability of any portion of the
ground necessary for the purpose of supporting such building; (iv) the
deterioration, decay, or inadequacy of its foundation; or (v) any other cause,
is likely to partially or completely collapse.

faulty construction, or otherwise, is determined by any health officer to be
unsanitary, unfit for human habitation, or in such condition that it is likely
to cause sickness or disease.
4.   Fire Hazard. Whenever any building or structure, because of dilapidated
condition, deterioration, damage, or other cause, is determined by the Fire
Marshal or Fire Chief to be a fire hazard.
5.   Abandoned. Whenever any portion of a building or structure remains on a
site after the demolition or destruction of the building or structure, or
whenever any building or structure is abandoned for a period in excess of six
months so as to constitute such building or portion thereof an attractive
nuisance or hazard to the public.

a public nuisance known to the common law or in equity jurisprudence.
146.07   NOTICE TO OWNER.
The enforcement officer shall examine or cause to be examined every building or
structure or portion thereof reported as dangerous or damaged and, if such is
found to be an unsafe building as defined in this chapter, the enforcement
officer shall give to the owner of such building or structure written notice
stating the defects thereof. This notice may require the owner or person in
charge of the building or premises, within 48 hours or such reasonable time as
the circumstances require, to commence either the required repairs or
improvements or demolition and removal of the building or structure or portions
thereof, and all such work shall be completed within 90 days from date of
notice, unless otherwise stipulated by the enforcement officer. If necessary
(the building or structure is in such condition as to make it immediately
dangerous to life, limb, property, or safety of the public or its occupants),
such notice shall also require the building, structure, or portion thereof to
be vacated forthwith and not reoccupied until the required repairs and
improvements are completed, inspected, and approved by the enforcement officer.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[3h])
1.   Notice Served. Such notice shall be served by personal service or by
sending certified mail to the owner of record, according to Section 364.12[3h]
of the Code of Iowa, if the owner is found within or without the City limits.
If the owner is not found within the City limits such service may be made upon
the owner by registered mail or certified mail. The designated period within
which said owner or person in charge is required to comply with the order of
the enforcement officer shall begin as of the date the owner receives such
notice.
2.   Hearing. Such notice shall also advise the owner that he or she may
request a hearing before the Council on the notice by filing a written request
for hearing within 15 days of the date of the serving of notice (for notice
served by certified or registered mail, the 15 day period shall commence four
days after the date of mailing). A request for hearing shall include an address
to which notice of such hearing shall be provided.
146.08   CONDUCT OF HEARING.
If requested, the Council shall conduct a hearing in accordance with the

specifying the date, time, and place of hearing. Said hearing shall be
scheduled as soon as practicable after receiving the written appeal. Such date
shall not be less than 15 days nor more than 60 days from the date the appeal
was filed. Notice of such hearing shall be personally served or mailed at least
10 days prior to the date of hearing.
2.   Owner’s Rights. At the hearing, the owner may appear and show cause why
the alleged dangerous building should not be demolished or repaired.
3.   Determination. The Council shall make and record findings of fact and may

herein shall constitute a waiver of the right to administrative hearing and
adjudication of the notice and order or any portion thereof.

The enforcement officer shall cause to be posted at each entrance to such
building a notice to read: “DO NOT ENTER. UNSAFE TO OCCUPY. CITY OF WALCOTT,
IOWA.” Such notice shall remain posted until the required demolition, removal,
or repairs are completed. Such notice shall not be removed without written
permission of the enforcement officer, and no person shall enter the building
except for the purpose of making the required repairs or of demolishing the
building.
146.11   EMERGENCY ACTION.  
The enforcement officer may order an emergency demolition of a structure or any
part thereof when circumstances exist such that the threat to life or health is
so imminent and substantial that to order repair would not be prudent. No prior
notice to the owner of the demolition is necessary, but notice of the cost of
the action shall be given prior to the cost being charged to the owner as
provided elsewhere herein. The enforcement officer may order the emergency
repair of a structure or any part thereof in circumstances other than those
described in the preceding sentence, where an immediate threat to life or
health exists. No prior notice to the owner of the repair is necessary, but
notice of the cost of the action shall be given prior to the cost being charged
to the owner as provided elsewhere herein.
146.12   RIGHT TO DEMOLISH; MUNICIPAL INFRACTION.
In case the owner fails, neglects, or refuses to comply with the notice to
repair, rehabilitate, or to demolish and remove the building or structure or
portion thereof, the Council may order the owner of the building prosecuted as
a violator of the provisions of this chapter and may order the enforcement
officer to proceed with the work specified in such notice. A statement of the
cost of such work shall be transmitted to the Council. As an alternative to
this action, the City may utilize the municipal infraction process to abate the
nuisance.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[3h])
146.13   COSTS.
Costs incurred under Section
146.12 shall be paid out of the City treasury. Such costs shall be charged to
the owner of the premises involved and levied as a special assessment against
the land on which the building or structure is located, and shall be certified
to the County Treasurer for collection in the manner provided for other taxes.
In addition, the City may take any other action deemed appropriate to recover
costs incurred.

CHAPTER 161
STORMWATER DETENTION FACILITIES
 
161.01 Purpose                       161.06 Stormwater Detention Plan

161.05 Stormwater Detention Review   161.10 Appeal
 
161.01   PURPOSE.
The purpose of these regulations is to diminish threats to public health,
safety, and welfare caused by increased runoff of stormwater from new
development and redevelopment. This excessive stormwater could result in the
flooding of damageable properties.
161.02   APPLICABILITY.
No building permit shall be issued for the construction, reconstruction, or
structural alteration of a building and/or its parking area, nor shall a
preliminary plat, final plat, or site plan be approved without conformity with
the provisions of this stormwater detention chapter.
161.03   STORMWATER DETENTION CRITERIA.
1.   All stormwater storage areas must be designed to contain and safely pass
stormwater runoff. Adequate spillway provisions shall be provided to transport
peak runoff from a 100-year storm assuming the outlet to be plugged. All
stormwater facilities shall be designed in accordance with the design standards
established by this chapter.
2.   All areas within the City as shown on the map, “Stormwater Detention
Areas,” Figure-1 (on file at City Hall), or any development which, in the
opinion of the City Engineer, lacks an adequate system for the passage of
stormwater, shall comply with this chapter.
   A.   The required stormwater detention shall be that volume necessary to
handle the runoff of a 100-year rainfall, for the critical duration from the
drainage area tributary to the stormwater storage area, less the volume
discharged during the same duration from a five year storm having a runoff
coefficient of “C” = 0.15 when using the Rational Method (for areas of less
than 20 acres) or a curve number of 60 when using the S.C.S. TR-55 Method. The
City may require a lesser release rate when the downstream outlet is
insufficient to safely convey the five-year storm frequency release rate.
   B.   For sites less than 20 acres, the required detention storage (RDS) will
be that found to be the most critical resulting from the inflow from the run-
off of a fully developed tributary area from a 100-year storm and the outflow
of the five-year storm on a predevelopment basis. This can be expressed by the
following equation:
 
      [Inflow rate from]    [Release rate from]   [Duration of the ]
RDS = [critical 100-year] - [ 5-year storm ]    x [critical 100-year]
      [ storm (cfs) ]       [ ]                   [ storm (sec) ]
 
   C.   For sites greater than 20 acres, the method of sizing of the detention
storage volume must be approved by the City Engineer.
3.   Detention storage may be provided as a dry bottom or wet bottom storage
area.
   A.   Dry bottom stormwater storage areas may be designed to serve a
secondary purpose for recreation, open space parking, or other types of uses
that will not be adversely affected by intermittent flooding.
      (1)   (1)   A method of carrying the low flow through these areas shall
be provided in addition to a system of drains to prevent soggy areas.
      (2)   Outlet control structures shall be designed as simply as possible
and shall require little or no attention for proper operation. Each stormwater
storage area shall be provided with a method of emergency overflow in the event
that a storm in excess of the 100-year frequency storm occurs. This emergency
overflow facility shall be designed to function without attention and shall
become part of the excess stormwater passageway. Hydraulic calculations shall
be submitted to the City Engineer to substantiate all design features.
      (3)   Both outlet control structures and emergency overflow facilities
shall be designed and constructed to fully protect the public health, safety,
and welfare. Stormwater runoff velocities shall be kept at a minimum, and
turbulent conditions at an outlet control structure will not be permitted
without complete protection for the public safety. The use of fences shall be
kept to a minimum and used only as a last resort when no other method of
protection is feasible.
      (4)   Paved surfaces that are to serve as stormwater storage shall be
designed with permanent-type control outlets. Emergency overflow areas shall be
provided.
   B.   Wet bottom stormwater storage areas shall be designed with all of the
items required for dry bottom stormwater storage areas, except that the
provisions of Subsection 3(A)(1) of this section shall not be required.
However, the following additional conditions shall be complied with:
      (1)   Water surface areas shall not exceed one-fifteenth of the tributary
drainage area.
      (2)   Facilities shall be provided to lower the pond elevation by gravity
flow for cleaning purposes and shoreline maintenance. Shoreline protection
shall be provided to prevent erosion from wave action.
      (3)   Minimum normal water depth shall be four feet. If fish are to be
maintained, some portion of the pond area should be a minimum of nine feet
deep.
      (4)   Control structures for stormwater release shall be designed to
operate with only a minor increase in the water surface level when the design
storage capacity has been exceeded. Hydraulic calculations shall be submitted
to the City Engineer to substantiate all design features.
161.04   EXEMPTIONS.
The following shall be exempt from these regulations:
1.   Any final plat approved by October 3, 2005, and based upon a preliminary
plat that was approved prior to October 3, 2005, subject to the development not
being required to provide detention facilities by any other ordinances of the
City.
2.   A preliminary or final plat of single-family development consisting of
lots, all of which are one acre or larger.
3.   Any single-family and two-family developed and undeveloped lots which
existed on October 3, 2005.
161.05   STORMWATER DETENTION REVIEW.
1.   For new or expanding commercial, industrial, and multi-family
developments, a stormwater detention plan shall be submitted as part of the
site plan review.
2.   For new single-family and two-family residential developments, a
stormwater detention plan shall be submitted as part of the final plat review.
3.   If no plat or site plan review is required, a stormwater detention plan
must be approved by the City Engineer before a building permit is issued.
161.06   STORMWATER DETENTION PLAN REQUIREMENTS.
Each applicant shall submit all calculations and other such information as
deemed necessary to demonstrate to the City Engineer the stormwater runoff rate
and capacity of stormwater storage facilities. Required information may vary
according to the size of development, and shall include, but not be limited to,
the following:
1.   Map of the property and immediate vicinity showing elevation of contours.
2.   Mapping and description of existing and proposed drainage system features
of the property and immediate vicinity.
3.   Physical features of the property and immediate vicinity including, but
not limited to, the state and type of development in the area, public
infrastructure, and other similar characteristics.
161.07   COMMON DETENTION FACILITIES.
The City may, in lieu of on-site detention facilities, accept off-site
detention facilities. Until such time as the permanent off-site stormwater
detention facilities are available, temporary on-site detention shall be
provided. An acceptable legal contract between the developer and the off-site
land owner shall be approved by the City Council.
161.08   COMPLETION OF FACILITIES.
The stormwater detention facilities shall be constructed and in use in
accordance with the following criteria.
1.   For commercial, industrial, and multi-family developments, the facilities
shall be constructed concurrent with site grading. A certificate of completion
shall be furnished by the developer’s Engineer certifying that they have been
constructed according to the approved plans before a certificate of occupancy
is issued by the City.
2.   For single-family and two-family residential building, the developer’s
Engineer shall certify that the public improvements have been substantially
complete, and the detention facility rough graded, before a building permit is
issued. A certificate of completion shall be furnished by the Engineer
certifying that the facilities into which the lots drain have been constructed
according to the approved plans before a certificate of occupancy permit is
issued by the City.
161.09   RESPONSIBILITIES.
Industrial, commercial, condominium, and multi-family developments, and single-
family or two-family lots or development with individual detention facilities
shall meet the following requirements:
1.   The developer shall be responsible for providing a plan of ownership of
the detention facilities involving a single owner, an association, or another
plan of ownership approved by the City.
2.   The owner shall be responsible to insure the continuing functioning of the
facility as originally designed and intended. All plans submitted for
stormwater detention systems shall describe an adequate procedure for normal
maintenance for the detention system. Any failure of the stormwater detention
system due to inadequate normal or capital maintenance shall be the
responsibility of the owner of the property on which the detention system is
located. It shall also be the property owner’s responsibility to remedy any
negligence in maintenance that resulted in the failure of the system. The
submittal of plans for such a system or the purchase of property on which such
system is located shall be deemed as acceptance of responsibility for normal
and capital maintenance of system.
3.   The developer shall dedicate an easement to the City reserving the land
for use as a stormwater detention facility providing the City with the right to
inspect the facility, and the necessary easements for ingress and egress.
4.   The City shall provide inspection of the detention facilities as deemed
appropriate. If any maintenance work is necessary, the City shall serve a
written order to the owner of the facilities, specifying therein the work
necessary to be done and providing for a reasonable time for its completion.
Any property owner to whom an order is directed shall have the right to appeal
to the City Council. Unless the order is revoked or modified, it shall remain
in full force and be obeyed by the owner as directed within the time
established by the City. When an owner to whom an order has been issued fails
to comply within the time specified, the City shall remedy the condition, or
contract with others for such purpose, and charge all costs, including
administration, to whom the order is directed. If the cost of remedying a
condition is not paid within 30 days after the mailing of a statement from the
City, the cost shall be assessed against the property for collection in the
same manner as a property tax. In the event the association fails or is unable
to pay the costs associated with detention facility maintenance, these costs
shall be assessed against those users of the facility based upon their
percentage of use. The provisions of this subparagraph shall be applicable to
any stormwater detention facility in existence as of the effective date
of Ordinance No. 415-05 codified by this chapter, notwithstanding any
provisions of Paragraph D above or any other provisions limiting the
applicability of the provisions of this chapter.
161.10   APPEAL.
The City Council may, in the resolution approving the preliminary plat of any
subdivision, and, upon appeal of the developer or the recommendation of the
City Engineer, waive or change the requirements of this chapter for a
particular development whenever the developer demonstrates either:
1.   That, due to the location of the property, strict compliance would provide
no discernible benefit for reduction of flooding on any adjacent or downstream
property; or
2.   That, due to the nature of the property, strict compliance would create
unusual hardship out of proportion to any foreseeable benefit, and that the
requested change or reduction in requirements will not increase the risk of
flooding of any building or the buildable portion of any lot on any adjacent or
downstream property.

162.01   TITLE.
These regulations shall be known as the Rental Housing Code, and may be cited
as such and will be referred to herein as “this code”.
162.02   PURPOSE.
1.   The purpose of this code is to provide minimum standards to safeguard life
or limb, health, property, and public welfare by regulating and controlling the
use and occupancy, location, and maintenance of all residential dwellings and
structures which are rental occupied within this jurisdiction.
2.   The purpose of this code is not to create or otherwise establish or
designate any particular class or group of persons who will, or should be,
especially protected or benefited by the terms of this code.
162.03   ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
1.   Administration and enforcement is a function of the Building Department of
the City.
2.   This code has been adopted and is to be used in conjunction with other
City codes, including codes as amended and adopted in
Chapter 160, including, but not limited to, requirements of the International
Property Maintenance Code, and should not be construed to include all
regulations pertaining to buildings and development. Nothing in this chapter
shall be interpreted as prohibiting or limiting enforcement by the Building
Inspector or any other department of the City, County, or State codes and
ordinances as adopted and amended by those respective jurisdictions.
162.04   SCOPE.
The provisions of this code apply to all residential rental properties or
portions thereof used or designed, or intended to be used, for human
habitation, whether vacant or occupied. This code shall further apply to all
accessory structures and any nuisance as defined by this Code of Ordinances or
codes adopted by the City that may exist in a building or the building’s yard.
162.05   REQUIREMENTS FOR RENTAL PROPERTY.
1.   General. It shall be a violation of this code for any person to let to
another for rent and/or occupancy, except in compliance with the provisions of
the City's Rental Housing Guide, any dwelling, dwelling unit, duplex, multi-
family dwelling, sleeping room, single-family dwelling, or condominium unless
the owner or agent holds a valid Certificate of Structural Compliance/Rental
License, issued by the City, applicable to those portions of the specific
structure used for residential rental purposes or affecting any areas used for
residential rental purposes.
(Ord. 533-23 - Jan. 24 Supp.)
2.   Certificate of Structural Compliance/Rental License (referred to as
Certificate). The Certificate, when issued, shall certify that the requirements
of this code are met. The Certificate shall be transferable at the time of a
change in ownership and shall be maintained as a public record of the City. The
owner or agent shall notify the City of any change of interest or ownership in
the property within 30 days of any conveyance or transfer of interest affecting
the property, and provide the name and address of all persons who have acquired
an interest therein. The Certificate shall state the date of issuance and the
address of the structure to which it is applicable. All dwelling units and
sleeping rooms being let for rent and/or occupancy without a valid Certificate
may be ordered vacated.
3.   Issuance of Certificate. When the provisions of this code have been
complied with by the owner or operator, along with payment of the required fees
(fees shall be set by resolution of the City Council), the City shall issue a
Certificate. The Certificate will remain valid until the property’s next
required inspection.
4.   Revocation of Certificate. When there exists a material and substantial
noncompliance with this code which directly affects the health, life, safety,
or property of the occupants or the public, the City may revoke the Certificate
in whole, or modify the Certificate to reflect the compliance of each separate
dwelling unit or sleeping room within a structure. The owner or agent of the
affected property shall be notified in writing by certified mail of the license
revocation.
162.06   INSPECTIONS.
1.   Dwelling Inspection Schedule. Rental properties in substantial compliance
will be placed on a two-year inspection schedule. All other rental properties
will be inspected annually. Compliance determination will be the responsibility
of the Building Inspector.
2.   Appointments for Inspections. Appointment for inspections for the owner/
agent of the building shall be scheduled by the Building Inspector. The owner/
agent may request the appointment to be rescheduled. However, the inspection
shall be performed within 30 days of the original date. An owner/agent shall be
required to arrange for access to all portions of the building. Failure to
provide access to all portions of the building shall prevent the issuance of a
Certificate, and thus compliance with the law. The owner/agent shall notify all
tenants of the inspection in accordance with the Chapter 562A of the Code of
Iowa, Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Law.
3.   General Procedures for Inspections. Inspections shall not be:
   A.   Conducted with a minor as the sole representative of the owner.

agent present.
   C.   Conducted without prior notice to the tenant, as required by State law.
   D.   Conducted of an occupied dwelling without the owner/agent or tenant of
the dwelling or designated agent being present.
4.   Admittance to Unit. Should the person in control of the unit refuse
admittance to the Building Inspector or designee, and refuse to reschedule the
licensing inspection or re-inspection, the Building Inspector may request that
a court of competent jurisdiction issue an administrative search warrant.
5.   Inspection. All areas of each dwelling governed by this chapter shall be
inspected. Should access not be obtained to all areas, a re-inspection must be
scheduled and an additional fee may be charged for each subsequent re-
inspection in accordance with the established fee schedule.
162.07   RENTAL HOUSING CODE FEE SCHEDULE.
Fees shall be charged for services rendered in relation to this chapter. These
services include, but are not limited to, the following: certification,
licenses, re-inspections, failure to appear for inspections or re-inspections,
late cancellations, and appeals. Fees will be assessed on a two-year schedule
for those properties in substantial compliance, and annually for those
properties on an annual inspection schedule. The amount shall be established by
resolution of the City Council.
162.08   NOTICE OF VIOLATIONS.
Whenever the appropriate authority determines that any rented residential
structure, or the premises surrounding any of these, fails to meet the
requirements set forth in this code or in applicable rules and regulations
issued pursuant thereto, a notice shall be issued setting forth the alleged
failures and advising the owner, occupant, or agent that such failures must be
corrected. This notice shall:
1.   Be in writing.
2.   Set forth the alleged violations of this code and applicable rules and
regulations issued pursuant thereto.

the property shall be re-inspected for compliance. Upon failure to correct
violations, a criminal or municipal citation will be issued.

1.   General.  Any person aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision, or
determination made by the Building Inspector on all matters pertaining to
buildings, structures, or occupancy included in this chapter has the right to
appeal to the City Council. An appeal may be submitted to the City Council
within 10 working days of the Building Inspector’s decision, and, upon payment
of a fee, established by Council resolution, to the City. The appeal must
include the reason for the appeal and a statement detailing relief requested.
2.   Following the receipt of an appeal request, the City Council will hold a
hearing within 30 days at which time the petitioner shall be given an
opportunity to show just cause why the notice or order should be modified or
withdrawn, or why the period of time permitted for compliance should be
extended.
3.   The City Council shall have the power to affirm, modify, or revoke the
notice or order, grant variances from the provisions of this code or from
applicable rules and regulations issued pursuant thereto, or to grant an
extension of time for the performance of any act required where the City
Council finds there is practical difficulty or undue hardship connected with
the performance of any act required by the provisions of this code or by
applicable rules or regulations issued pursuant thereto and that such extension
is in harmony with the general purpose of this code to secure the public
health, safety, and welfare.
162.10   CONFLICT OF ORDINANCES.
In any case where a provision of this code is found to be in conflict with a
provision of any zoning, building, fire, safety, or health ordinance or Code of
the City existing on the effective date hereof, the provision which establishes
the higher standard for the practical promotion and protection of the health
and safety of the people shall prevail. In any case, where a provision of this
Code is found to be in conflict with a provision of any other ordinance or Code
of the City existing on the effective date hereof which establishes a lower
standard for the promotion and protection of the health and safety of the
people, the provisions of this Code shall be deemed to prevail, and such other
ordinances or Codes are hereby declared to be repealed to the extent that they
may be found in conflict with this Code.

be deemed to be approved; unless the subdivider would agree to an extension of
the time, for a period not to exceed 60 days. The Commission shall submit its
recommendations to the Council for its action by resolution. The approval of
the preliminary plat by the Council does not constitute approval of the
subdivision, but is merely an authorization to proceed with the preparation of
the final plat.
4.   One copy of the preliminary plat approved by the Council and signed by the
Mayor and City Clerk, and shall be maintained in the office of the Zoning
Administrator. One copy is authorization for the subdivider to proceed with the

in a circular right-of-way having a minimum diameter of 100 feet, with a
minimum paving radius of 40 feet, culs-de-sac in business and industrial
districts shall have a minimum paving radius of 60 feet. The length of culs-de-
sac shall not exceed 600 feet (these requirements may be modified by the City

Director, in light of the nature and volume of traffic projected to use the
culs-de-sac street). Specific streets shall be classified in accordance with
the above by a resolution of the Council or as may be shown on a Thoroughfare
Plan of the City.
   G.   If the subdivider plats a subdivision as defined in this Code and makes
use of an existing concrete industrial roadway or street, said subdivider shall
be required to add one additional minimum 12-foot wide lane of concrete (in
accordance with Public Works requirements) to the existing industrial street or
roadway and shall further be required to add the appropriate shoulder. If such
subdivider makes use of an existing street which is not improved with concrete,
that subdivider shall install one-half of the street. In either case,

increased as deemed advisable by the Commission.
      (6)   Intersections of more than two streets at one point shall be
avoided.
      (7)   Whenever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to a
highway designated as a limited access highway by the appropriate highway
authorities, provision shall be made for a marginal access street or a parallel
street at a distance acceptable for the appropriate use of the land between the
highway and such street.
      (8)   Unobstructed sight distances measured from a point five feet above
the proposed grade line, to permit horizontal visibility on all streets, must
be established along the centerline of such streets as follows:
         a.   Limited access highways: to be determined by the Commission, but
generally not less than 500 feet.
         b.   Arterial streets and parkways: 600 feet.
         c.   Feeder and residential streets: 300 feet.

3.   Blocks.
   A.   Blocks shall not exceed 800 feet in length in residential zoning
districts.
   B.   Blocks for commercial or industrial zoned districts shall be reviewed
by the Commission.
   C.   Blocks shall be of sufficient width to permit two tiers of lots of
appropriate depth except where an interior street parallels a limited access
highway or arterial street.
4.   Lots.
   A.   All lots shall abut on a street.
   B.   Side lines of lots shall be at approximately right angles to straight
streets and on radial lines on curved streets. Some variation from this rule is
permissible, but pointed or very irregular lots shall be avoided.
   C.   Double frontage lots shall not be platted, except that where desired
along arterial streets or limited access highways, lots may face on an interior
street and back on such thoroughfares. In that event, a strip at least 20 feet
in width shall be provided along the back of the lot for plantings or
screening.
   D.   The depth-to-width ratio of the usable area of a lot shall be at a
maximum of 3.0 to 1.0.
   E.   Corner residential lots shall be wider than normal in order to permit
appropriate setbacks from both streets.
   F.   No property shall be platted as an outlot or otherwise designated as an
outlot on any plat, survey, or similar depiction, unless use of said outlot is
restricted to a farm use approved by
Chapter 167 of this Code of Ordinances, within a subdivision and the platting
of a parcel of ground as an outlot shall not be deemed to eliminate any
required subdivision improvements. No outlot may be improved or used other than
is set forth herein without further platting, nor shall any use of an outlot
involve the violation of zoning or building requirements, regarding side yards,
setback lines, or similar restrictions. No outlot shall be improved without
giving consideration to, and complying with, the Comprehensive Plan, proposed
street, easement layout, and similar restrictions established by the City.
   G.   Flag lots are not permitted in new subdivisions or resubdivisions of
existing platted subdivisions. Flag lots currently in existence may be improved
as long as the portion of said lot adjacent to an existing public street has a
minimum frontage of 40 feet and as long as all applicable zoning or subdivision
requirements are met.
5.   Easements.
   A.   Utility easements of not less than 10 feet shall be provided along rear
lot lines and alongside lot lines where needed. When the property does not
adjoin another subdivision, where an easement has been provided, then an
easement of not less than 20 feet shall be provided. Easements of greater width
may be required where needed. Easements shall be at final grade before any
utilities are provided for the property and the subdivider, contractor, or
builder shall keep all easements free of any excavation dirt, construction
material, or any other obstacles during construction.
   B.   Whenever any stream or important surface water course is located in an
area that is being subdivided, the subdivider shall, at his or her own expense,
make adequate provision for straightening or widening the channel so that it
will properly carry the surface water, and shall also provide and dedicate to
the City an easement along each side of the stream, which easement shall be for
the purpose of widening, improving, or protecting the stream and for
recreational use. The width of such easement shall not be less than 20 feet and
the total width of the easement shall be adequate to provide for any necessary
channel relocations and straightening.
6.   Building Setback Lines. Such lines shall be established back of highway
and street right-of-way lines as established by the Thoroughfare Plan, and in
no case shall the building setback lines be less than 25 feet.
7.   Public Open Space. Where sites for parks, schools, playgrounds, or other
public uses are located within the subdivision area as shown on the
Comprehensive Plan, or where such sites appear to be desirable, the Commission
may request their dedication for such purposes, or their reservation for a
period of one year following the date of the approval of the plat. In the event
a governmental agency concerned passes a resolution expressing its intent to
acquire the land so reserved, the reservation period shall be extended for an
additional six months.
Where the subdivider can show that the strict application of the requirements
contained in this section would cause unnecessary hardship because of
topographical or other conditions peculiar to the site, the Council, upon
recommendation of the Commission, may vary or modify such requirements so that
the subdivider is allowed to develop the property in a reasonable manner; but
so, at the same time, the public welfare and interest of the City and
surrounding area are protected and the general intent and spirit of these
regulations are preserved.
166.08   PRELIMINARY PLAT APPROVAL NOT TO CONSTITUTE SUBDIVISION APPROVAL.
Approval of the preliminary plat by the Council does not constitute approval of
the subdivision, but is merely an authorization to the subdivider to proceed
with the preparation of the final plat.
166.09   FINAL PLAT REQUIREMENTS.
The final plat shall meet the following specifications:
1.   The final plat may include all or any part of the approved preliminary
plat.

4.   When the final plat is submitted to the Council, it shall be accompanied
by the following instruments, and each of these instruments must be submitted
to the City Attorney for approval. This approval must be obtained in writing
prior to submission of the documents to the Council. It is the subdivider’s
responsibility to secure such approval.
   A.   A statement by the proprietors and their spouses, if any, that the plat
is prepared with their free consent and in accordance with their desire, signed
and acknowledged before an officer authorized to take the acknowledgments of
deeds. The statement by the proprietors may also include a dedication to the

      (1)   A certificate bearing the approval of the City Engineer stating
that all improvements and installations to the subdivision required by this
chapter shall be made or installed in accordance with the specifications of the
City, and a letter from the Public Works Director stating the same, and that
there is on file a four-year cash maintenance bond for all improvements,
approved by the City Engineer and City Attorney before acceptance, with the
provision that the aforesaid four-year cash maintenance bond shall be subject
to the numbered provision for arbitration set out in Paragraph (3) below. In
lieu of the submission of a cash surety (completion) bond, the subdivider may
submit an irrevocable letter of credit in compliance with the provisions of
this paragraph, subject to the approval of the Council, City Engineer and City
Attorney. In circumstances where a plat is located in an area where public
infrastructure does not presently exist or is in an area where improvements to
public infrastructure may be expanded or improved and in the opinion of the
Council, development does not warrant present installation of subdivision
improvements, the Council may require that a standard assessment waiver form
provided by the City be filed with the plat in lieu of an engineer’s
certificate or cash equivalent surety bond. The provisions of Paragraph (3)
below regarding arbitration proceedings shall not be applicable to the City’s
implementation of provisions of an assessment waiver or the special assessment
process.
      (2)   In the event that a surety or completion bond is necessary for
construction, there shall be submitted a cash surety bond with the City which
shall insure to the City that all improvements will be completed by the
subdivider or property owners within the two years after official acceptance of
the plat. The form, type, and disposition of the bond in the event of discharge
against same, shall be subject to the provisions of Paragraph (3) immediately
below, and the specific language, cash denomination, and the cash bond which
shall be in the form of cash time certificates or savings accounts at a local
bank, shall be approved in writing by the City Attorney, City Engineer, and
City Council, and the amount of the bond shall be not less than 115 percent of
the estimated cost of the improvement. If the improvements are not completed in
the specified time, the Council may use the bond or any necessary portion
thereof to complete the same, all at the discretion of the Council subject to
Paragraph (3) below. No building permits shall be issued on any portion of the
subdivision unless said portion has been approved and the improvements accepted
by the Council. A four-year cash maintenance bond shall be required for all
improvements, and the cash maintenance bond shall be approved as set out above,
by the City Attorney, City Engineer and the Council. A cash maintenance bond
submitted pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph shall be for a
percentage of the estimated improvement costs determined by the Council by
resolution. In lieu of the submission of a cash maintenance bond for
improvements, the subdivider may submit an irrevocable letter of credit (for
the prescribed amount) to be approved by the City Council, City Engineer, and
City Attorney. Additionally in lieu of a cash maintenance bond for
improvements, a subdivider may submit a maintenance bond from a bonding company
approved by the City, under such terms and conditions as meet the intent of
this paragraph. Notwithstanding the preceding, if a bonding company maintenance
bond is provided, the provisions of next Paragraph (3) shall not be applicable.
Notwithstanding the preceding, in lieu of a cash surety bond or irrevocable
letter of credit, a subdivider may submit a surety bond from a bonding company
approved by the City, under such terms and conditions as meet the intent of
this paragraph. If a bonding company surety bond is provided, the provisions of
the next Paragraph (3) shall not be applicable.
      (3)   The paragraphs set out above define surety and maintenance bonds,
and define the period for which said bonds shall be effective. It is
specifically provided with regard to these bonds however, that the Council may
and in many cases shall, require that the bonds in either event be in the form
of cash time certificates or interest bearing savings accounts in favor of the
bonded individual or development, but set up in so far as ownership in a manner
which allows the bank holding the time certificate or savings account to
disburse the proceeds of same directly upon the authority of the of the
Council, subject to the following:
         a.   In the event it becomes necessary, according to the discretion of
the Council, to exercise against the surety or maintenance bond provided for
herein, the Council shall at that time notify the subdivider or developer that
all or a portion of the bond may be attached for completion, maintenance, or
reconstruction of the indicated project, and that if the subdivider or
developer disputes the figures determined by the Council for the setoff against
such cash bond, then he or she may elect, by notice in writing to the Council,
delivered within 30 days of the date that notice of intent to exercise against
the bond has been mailed by ordinary mail at the address defined in the escrow
bond agreement with the City and escrow bank, to effect arbitration procedures
as defined herein. In that event, the developer shall choose an individual for
arbitration of any dispute regarding the amount and necessity of cash setoff
against the maintenance or surety bond, and the Council shall likewise select
an arbitrator who may be, but need not be an Attorney at Law, and the two
arbitrators shall select a third arbitrator. It shall be the duty of the three
arbitrators to determine within 60 days of the date of their commission, what,
if any, setoffs are necessary against the cash bond to effect the proper
maintenance, repair, completion, construction, or reconstruction necessitated
by the alleged default against the cash bond, and to make its recommendation in
writing to the Council and the developer or subdivider. The Council shall then
proceed to certify the recommendation and agreement of the arbitration board
and shall notify the Bank Escrow Agent to release that indicated amount to the
City pursuant to the authority defined above and further set out in the bank
escrow agreement.
         b.   In the event the developer does not choose to dispute the cash
setoff defined by the Council as necessary to complete, construct, reconstruct,
maintain, or repair the indicated project, which is the subject of the bond
controversy, then the initial defined amount of the Council shall be that
amount certified by the Council to the Bank Escrow Agent and paid by the Bank
Escrow Agent in favor of the City.
         c.   In the event the developer or subdivider does not serve notice in
writing to the Council of his or her intent to elect arbitration within the
defined timetable above, such person shall be presumed to have acquiesced in
the setoff demands of the Council, and certification by the Council at that
time to the Bank Escrow Agent shall similarly call for payment by the escrow
agent in favor of the City.
         d.   The method of determining arbitration individuals shall be at the
discretion of the parties indicated above, subject however to the following:
The subdivider or developer shall first choose and determine an arbitrator,
within 30 days of the date that he or she serves notice upon the City of the
intent to elect an arbitration of the dispute. The Council shall have 30 days
from the date they receive written notice of the selection of the subdivider/
developer’s arbitrator, to select their own arbitration individual, after which
the two arbitrators so selected shall have an additional 30 day period to agree
upon a satisfactory third arbitration individual. If the developer fails to
comply with the defined timetable in selecting an arbitrator, he or she shall
again be presumed to acquiesce to the initial demands of the Council with
regard to the cash setoff initially demanded against the bond, and in that
event, upon certification by the Council, the Bank Escrow Agent shall pay out
the indicated sum in favor of the City. In the event that the two arbitrators
selected by the developer and the Council cannot agree upon a satisfactory
third arbitrator, within the defined timetable, or in the event that the three
arbitrators, once selected, cannot come to an agreement with regard to a
specific sum and/or other specific remedy as the situation, by maintenance,
construction, or reconstruction by the original developer, then the arbitrators
shall be discharged of their commission to negotiate and determine the dispute,
and another arbitration board shall be reestablished according to the same
timetable and definition as set out above for the first. This procedure shall
continue until either the developer acquiesces in the initial setoff demands of
the Council, or an arbitration board is selected which reaches a final
consensus agreement as to defined dollar setoff against the arbitration demand
or defines other satisfactory redress in favor of the City to alleviate the
cause of the bond setoff demand. The costs of arbitration shall be borne by the
subdivider or developer, to the extent of the initial arbitrator chosen by said
subdivider or developer for his or her benefit, or any successor arbitrators
chosen in methods defined above or necessitated by the result of health,
disability, or death intervention, and it shall similarly be the obligation of
the subdivider/developer to pay one-half the cost and reasonable compensation
required by the third arbitrator selected by the two previously named
arbitrators. The City shall pay the costs and compensation of the arbitrator
chosen by the City, and one-half of the costs of the third arbitrator selected
above. These methods of arbitration shall be final binding upon any subdivider
or developer who acknowledges a specific bond maintenance agreement or bond
escrow agreement in favor that the City pursuant to the definition above, and
no appeal from the final judgment of the arbitrators or disposition by the
Council as defined above shall lie.
   G.   State approved plans and profiles of all sanitary sewers, water mains,
and appurtenances.
   H.   A letter from the subdivider’s engineer stating the quantities of
excavation, streets, sewers, water mains, and other necessary improvements, if
a cash surety bond is to be filed, with the approval of the City Engineer.
   I.   A “hold harmless” agreement protecting the City from any damages,
claims, or suits resulting from the construction and development by the owner
and/or subdivider. Said agreement shall be approved as to format by the City
Attorney, and recorded with the plat.
166.10   FINAL PLAT APPROVAL.
1.   Upon the receipt of the final plat by the Zoning Administrator, it shall
be referred to the Planning and Zoning Commission for its review and
recommendations thereon to the Council. Upon the Commission’s action, said
action shall be forwarded to the Clerk who shall place discussion of the final
plat on the agenda for the next scheduled meeting of the Council.
2.   If the Commission does not approve the final plat of the subdivision, the
Council may approve said plat only by a three-fourths vote of the entire
membership of the Council.

shall direct the Mayor and City Clerk to certify the resolution and affix same

4.   The final plat shall be filed by the applicant with the County Recorder
within four months of date of approval by the Council, and if not filed within

control to be made, or any money expended for improvements in any area that has
been subdivided, or upon any street that has been platted after the date of an
adoption of this chapter, unless such subdivision or street has been approved
in accordance with the provisions contained herein.
166.18   VIOLATIONS; LIEN PROVISION.
A violation of any provision of this chapter shall be any one consecutive 24-
hour period during which a violation exists, and for each consecutive or non-
consecutive defined date an additional violation if the alleged violation is
not corrected. Each lot, parcel of land, or property affected by this
subdivision chapter shall be subject to lien certification in the event of such
violation, and said violation shall cause the City to file a notice of lien
against any said property, and said lien shall be enforced and effected as a
valid lien upon the real estate involved until purged by payment. In the event
that any person feels that he or she has not violated the provisions of this
chapter and should not be subject to the discretionary fine violation as set
above in lien procedures, such person may elect to have the dispute settled
pursuant to the arbitration provisions defined in this chapter. Any final
determination made by the arbitrators shall be certified by the City to a bond
escrow agent, and shall be paid by said bond escrow agent in favor of the City,
or, if no such bond in fact exists in the individual situation involved, then
lien procedures will be implemented against real estate owned or subdivided by
the developer, by certification of a lien to the County in which the real
estate is situated; and/or the lien shall be entered of record as a lis pendens
lien against the indicated developer or subdivider.

which shall have been given in a newspaper of general circulation not less than
seven or more than 20 days before the date of said hearing.

sale or rental of material depicting or describing specified sexual activities
or specified anatomical areas and still be categorized as an adult bookstore or

commercial establishments from being categorized as an adult bookstore or adult
video store so long as one of its principal business purposes is the offering

business purpose need not be a primary use of an establishment, so long as it
is a significant use based upon the visible inventory or commercial activity of
the establishment.

less restricted district. Additionally, parking areas for multiple dwellings
shall have installed a minimum of one 175-watt mercury vapor lamp (or
equivalent) for every eight parking spaces required by the provisions of this
Code. The lighting from such installation shall be directed away from the
actual dwelling area of the property and shall not unreasonably interfere with
normal use of the dwelling area.
   C.   Commercial Parking Area and Requirements. (Property starting at Durant
and Main Streets., go east to Henry Street, then north to Bryant Street, then
east to Blue Grass Road, then north to Lincoln Street, then west to Henry
Street, then north to Otis Street, then west to Parker Street, then south to
Durant Street, then east to point of beginning.) Commercial area parking
requirements will be reviewed by a case by case basis before the Commission.
   D.   Number of Parking Spaces Required.
      (1)   Whenever a structure is erected, converted, or structurally altered
for a two-family or multiple family dwelling, two parking spaces shall be
provided on the lot or adjoining property for each dwelling unit in the
structure. Two parking spaces shall be provided on the lot of a single family
structure.
      (2)   In all cases, the number of employees to be used when determining
the number of parking spaces required shall be the maximum number of employees
at work at the same time. (See Table 1 for the parking space requirements
according to use.)
      (3)   All parking spaces provided shall be located no closer to the
boundaries of any lot affected than the building setback line required by
provisions of this Code of Ordinances. Parking spaces shall have a separate
access to each parking space.
   E.   Definition and Interpretation.
      (1)   Parking Space. Each parking space rectangular in shape shall be not
less than nine feet wide and 20 feet long, exclusive of access driveways.
      (2)   Loading Space. Each loading space shall not be less than 10 feet
wide, 60 feet in length and 14 feet in height, exclusive of access and turning
areas.
      (3)   Floor Area. In the case of merchandising or service types of uses,
“floor area” means the gross floor area used or intended to be used by tenants,
or for service to the public or customers, patrons or clients, but does not
include areas used principally for non-public uses, such as toilet or
restrooms, utilities, or dressing rooms.
      (4)   Benches in Place of Public Assembly. In stadiums, sports arenas,
churches, and other places of public assembly in which patrons or spectators
occupy benches, pews, or other similar seating facilities, each 24 inches of
such seating facilities shall be counted as one seat for the purpose of
determining requirements for off-street parking facilities under this chapter.
      (5)   Development Standards. Off-street accessory parking areas and
driveways in R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, commercial, and industrial zoning
districts shall be improved with a minimum of four inches of reinforced
concrete or the asphalt equivalent, and shall be graded and drained as to
dispose of all surface water accumulation within the area. Any lighting used to
illuminate such parking areas shall be so arranged as to reflect the light away
from adjoining lots in any “S.A.”, “R-1”, “R-2”, R-3, “R-4”, or “R-5” District.
      (6)   Exceptions. The Board of Adjustment may authorize on appeal a
modification, reduction, or waiver of the foregoing requirements if it should
find that in the particular case the peculiar nature of any use, or other
exceptional situation, or condition would justify such modification, or
reduction or waiver.
      (7)   In the case of any use which is not specifically mentioned in the
following table, the provisions for a similar use mentioned shall apply, as
determined by the Building Official.

communities and reviewed various studies relating to such location of adult
entertainment land uses, and has determined that the protection sought is best
served by enacting provisions of regulation as set forth subsequent hereto. It
is the purpose of this subsection to regulate sexually oriented businesses and
related activities to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of
the citizens of the City, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations
to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented
businesses within the City. The provisions of this subsection have neither the
purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of
any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly,
it is not the intent or effect of this subsection to restrict or deny access by
adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to
deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented
entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent or effect of
this subsection to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials.
Nothing in this subsection is intended to authorize, legalize or permit the
establishment, operation or maintenance of any business, building or use which
violates any other provisions of law. Such adult entertainment land uses are
subject to the following restrictions for location of “adult use”
establishments.
      (1)   “Adult use” establishments are prohibited within 1,500 feet of the
following specified zoning districts and/or uses:

line, without regard to intervening buildings, from the nearest point to the
property parcel upon which the proposed use is to be located, to the nearest
point of the parcel of property or the land use district boundary line from
which the proposed land use is to be separated.

1.   The purpose of the Planned Unit Development “P.U.D.” District is to
promote to the extent possible:
   A.   A maximum choice in the types of environment available to the public by
allowing a development that would not be possible under the strict application
of the other sections of this chapter.
   B.   Permanent preservation of common open space and recreation areas and
facilities.
   C.   A pattern of development to preserve natural vegetation, topographic
and geologic features.
   D.   A creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities
that results in better development, design and the construction of aesthetic
amenities.
   E.   An efficient use of the land resulting in more economic networks of
utilities, streets and other facilities.
   F.   A land use which promotes the public health, safety, comfort, morals
and welfare.
The “P.U.D.” District is intended to provide for a development incorporating a
single type or a variety of related uses which are planned and developed as a
unit but departs from the normal standards and requirements of other sections
of this chapter. The “P.U.D.” may provide amenities not otherwise required by
law and may establish facilities and open space greater than the minimums
required by law. Such development may consist of conventionally subdivided lots
or provide for development by a land use and zoning plan which establishes the
location and extent of the features of the “P.U.D.” in keeping with the purpose
of the plan. The foregoing purposes and principles shall not be interpreted to
permit the reduction of standards set forth in this section.
2.   Procedure. The owner, owners or bona fide buyer of any tract of land may
petition the Commission for a zoning change to the “P.U.D.” zoning district in
accordance with the provisions of Section
167.29. A “P.U.D.” shall be authorized in accordance with the following
procedures:
   A.   Application Procedure.
      (1)   The application for a rezoning to the “P.U.D.” zoning district

will conform to the Comprehensive Plan and to the purpose of the “P.U.D.”
District set forth in Subsection 1. The Commission shall grant or deny said
application pursuant to the provisions contained in Paragraph 3(A). Approval of
the “P.U.D.” shall constitute an expression of approval by the Commission of
the application plan as a guide to the preparation of the preliminary “P.U.D.”
plan. The applications shall be accompanied by a filing fee in an amount of
$150.00
      (2)   To reduce the number of steps involved in the approval of a Planned
Unit Development, a preliminary “P.U.D.” plan meeting the requirements of
Paragraph B and Paragraph 3(B) of this section may be submitted in lieu of an
application plan required in (1) above. This type of application shall be
accompanied by a fee of $150.00 plus an amount equal to that prescribed by
Paragraph B(1)(a) below.
   B.   Approval of the Preliminary Plan.
      (1)   Supporting data in accordance with Paragraph 3(B) of this section.
         a.   A filing fee of $150.00 for 10 acres or less and $250.00 for over
10 up to 20 acres. More than 20 acres the filing fee is $300.00 if procedure in
Paragraph 2(A)(1) of this section was followed, otherwise it has already been
included in the cost noted under procedure in Paragraph 2(A)(2).
         b.   Copies of the preliminary “P.U.D.” plan and supporting data shall
be submitted to the Zoning Administrator for certification as to conformity
with these regulations, recommendations and suggestions regarding the overall
design, if any.
         c.   Copies of the preliminary “P.U.D.” plan shall be submitted to the
Commission who shall hold public hearings on the application for a preliminary
“P.U.D.” Plan giving notice of the times and places as required by State law by
publishing a notice thereof at least once in a newspaper publication having
general circulation within the City. Following the public hearings, a
recommendation for approval or denial of the preliminary “P.U.D.” plan shall be
made by the Commission to the Council.
      (2)   Findings. The Commission shall set forth the reasons for the
recommendation, and said recommendation shall set forth how the proposal would
be in the public interest, including but not limited to findings of facts on
the following:
         a.   In what respects the proposed plan is consistent with the stated
purpose of the “P.U.D.” requirements.
         b.   The extent to which the proposed plan meets the requirements and
standards of the “P.U.D” district.
         c.   The extent to which the proposed plan departs from the zoning and
subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the subject property, including
but not limited to, the density, dimension, area, bulk and use, and the reasons
why such departures are deemed to be in the public interest.
         d.   The physical design of the proposed plan and the manner in which
said design makes adequate provision for public services, provides adequate
control over vehicular traffic, provides for and protects designated common
open space, and furthers the amenities of light, air, recreation and visual
enjoyment.
         e.   The relationship and compatibility of the proposed plan to the
adjacent properties and neighborhood.
         f.   The desirability of the proposed plan to physical development,
tax base and economic well-being of the entire community.
         g.   The conformity with the intent and spirit of the Comprehensive
Plan.

of a minor change, or disapproval of the “P.U.D.” plan. As a condition to the
approval of the preliminary “P.U.D.” plan, the Council shall set forth findings
of fact in accordance with this subsection on which they base their approval
and describing how the proposal meets the standards of Subsection 4 of this
section.
      (4)   All conditions, documents, and plans required by the Council must
be delineated on the plan or agreed to in writing prior to Council approval.
      (5)   The Council may require such special conditions as they may deem
necessary to insure conformance with the intent of all Comprehensive Plan
elements, the stated purpose of the “P.U.D.” district, and established City
policies.
      (6)   Approval of a preliminary “P.U.D.” shall not constitute approval of
the final plan. Rather it shall be deemed an expression of approval to the
layout submitted on the preliminary plan as a guide to the preparation of the
final plan which will be submitted for approval of the Council and subsequent
recording upon the fulfillment of the requirements of these regulations and
conditions of the preliminary plan approval, if any. The final plan shall be
approved as the final land use and zoning plan if it conforms substantially
with the preliminary land use and zoning plan. The final plan may be considered
as a preliminary and final plan and may be submitted for preliminary and final
approval, if all of the land is to be developed at one time, and if all
requirements hereof are met.
   C.   Approval of Final Plan. The final “P.U.D.” plan shall be submitted to
the Zoning Administrator who shall refer same to the Commission. The final
“P.U.D.” plan shall conform with the preliminary “P.U.D.” plan as approved or
subject to minor changes, and may be submitted in stages, with each stage
reflecting the approved preliminary plan; provided, however, such stage
conforms to all requirements of these regulations. The required procedure for
approval of a final plan shall be:
      (1)   A final “P.U.D.” plan and other supporting data required for
approval shall be in accordance with the provisions of Subsection 3 of this
section. Final plans must be submitted for approval in accordance with agreed
scheduling, but not later than five years from the approval of the preliminary
plan by the Council. The Council may grant an extension in time, or the
developer may resubmit an application; in the event that same is not done, the
Council shall initiate such zoning changes as it deems necessary to preserve
the public interest. If construction falls more than two years behind the
schedule filed with the final plan, the plan becomes subject to revocation. The
Zoning Administrator shall monitor all pending “P.U.D.” projects and inform the
Council of those six months or more behind schedule.
      (2)   The final plan and supporting data shall be submitted to the Zoning
Administrator for certification that the final plan is in conformity with these
regulations and in agreement with the approved preliminary plan.
      (3)   After review of the final plan, the Commission shall submit the
“P.U.D.” plan to the Council with a recommendation for approval, disapproval,
or approval with minor modifications. Any changes or modifications which arise
shall be specifically noted and referred to the Council who shall determine
whether the change constitutes a major or minor change and whether the
Commission needs to review the preliminary plan again.
      (4)   The Council shall, within 60 days, approve, disapprove, or extend
the time period for another 60 days in taking action on the final plan.
      (5)   All conditions, documents and plans required by the Council must be
delineated on the plan or agreed to in writing prior to Council approval.
   D.   Recording the Final Planned Unit Development Plan. The construction of
any public improvement in the “P.U.D.” shall be initiated only after recording
of the final “P.U.D.” plan with the County Recorder. Building permits are to be
issued only after the final “P.U.D.” plan has been recorded with the County
Recorder and shall be issued in full conformance with this chapter. The use of
all parcels in the “P.U.D.” must be recorded on the plat along with the
statement, See City Code of Ordinances of Walcott, Iowa, Section 167.17 –
“P.U.D.” District. The recording of the final plan shall inform all who deal
with the “P.U.D.” of the restrictions placed upon the land and will act as a
zoning control device.
   E.   Changes in the “P.U.D.”. The “P.U.D.” shall be developed according to
the approved and recorded final plan, except where authorized changes or
amendments are permitted. The recorded plan and supporting data together with
all recorded amendments shall be binding on the applicants, their successors,
guarantees and assigns, and shall limit and control the use of land and
location of structures in the “P.U.D.” project as set forth therein.
      (1)   Major Changes. A change in the approved preliminary “P.U.D.” plan
or final “P.U.D.” plan which alters the concept or intent of the “P.U.D.”
including a change in usage, the configuration, increase in floor area or the
height of buildings, an increase in intensity, a reduction of proposed open
space, a change in road locations or standards, a change in the final governing
agreement, provisions or covenants, or other major changes, shall be approved
only by submission of a new preliminary “P.U.D.” plan in accordance with the
procedures as previously set forth for the approval of preliminary and final
“P.U.D.” plans. All approved major changes in the final “P.U.D.” plan shall be
recorded with the County Recorder as amendments to the final “P.U.D.” plan.
      (2)   Minor Changes. The Commission may approve minor changes in the
“P.U.D.” which do not change the concept, or intent of the development, without
going through the “preliminary approval” steps. Minor changes shall be any
change not defined as a major change.

at the time of the adoption of this chapter may be continued. If no structural
alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a building may be changed to
another nonconforming use of the same or more restricted classification with
approval of the Zoning Administrator. The foregoing provisions shall also apply

January, 1993, as long as said lot is properly zoned for single-family dwelling
use and as long as yard dimensional requirements are met (i.e., front, side and
rear yard setbacks), notwithstanding that lot size area is deficient.
167.21   ZONING BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
1.   Creation and Membership. A Zoning Board of Adjustment is hereby
established, which shall consist of five members. The word “Board” when used in
this section means Zoning Board of Adjustment. All members shall be appointed
for overlapping terms of five years. Members shall be removable for cause by
the Council upon written charges and after public hearing. Vacancies shall be
filled for the unexpired term of any member whose term becomes vacant. The
Council shall provide for the appointment of a Board of Adjustment and in the
regulations and restrictions adopted pursuant to the authority of Chapter 414.7
of the Code of Iowa shall provide that the said Board of Adjustment may in
appropriate cases and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards make
special exceptions to the terms of the zoning ordinance in harmony with its
general purpose and intent and in accordance with general or specific rules
therein contained and provide that any property owner aggrieved by the action
of the Council in the adoption of such regulations and restrictions may
petition the said Board of Adjustment to modify regulations and restrictions as
applied to such property owners. The Council may provide for its review of
variances granted by the Board of Adjustment before their effective date. The
Council may remand a decision to grant a variance to the Board of Adjustment
for further study. The effective date of the variance is delayed for 30 days
from the date of the remand.
2.   Meetings. Meetings of the Board of Adjustment shall be held either the
second or fourth Mondays of the month and at such times and as frequently as
such Board may determine necessary. All hearings conducted by said Board shall
be open to the public. The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing
the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent and failing to vote,
indicating such fact, and shall also keep records of its hearings and other
official actions. Findings of fact shall be included in the minutes of each
case of a requested variance, and the reasons for approval or denying such
variation shall be specified. Every rule or regulation, every amendment or
repeal thereof, and every order, requirement, decision, or determination of the
Board shall be filed immediately in the office of the secretary of the Board
and shall be a public record. The Board shall adopt its own rules of procedure
not in conflict with this chapter or with the Iowa statutes in such case made
and provided, and may select or appoint such officers as it deems necessary.
3.   Appeals. An appeal may be taken to the Zoning Board of Adjustment by any
person or by any officer, department, board, or bureau affected by a decision
of the Zoning Administrator. Such appeal shall be taken within such time as
shall be prescribed by the Board by general rule, by filing with the Zoning
Board of Adjustment a notice of appeal, specifying the grounds thereof. A fee
in the amount of $150.00 shall be paid to the Zoning Administrator with the
notice of appeal, and all such fees shall be credited to the General Fund of
the City. The Zoning Administrator shall transmit to the Board all of the
papers constituting the record upon which the appeal was taken. The Board shall
render a decision on the appeal without unreasonable delay. Any person may
appear and testify at the hearing either in person, or by a duly authorized
agent or attorney.4.   Jurisdiction.
   A.   The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals from any
order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Zoning Administrator
on all matters pertaining to zoning.
   B.   The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall also hear and decide all matters
referred to it or upon which it is required to pass under this chapter.
   C.   The Zoning Board of Adjustment may reverse, affirm wholly or partly, or
may modify or amend the order, requirements, decision, or determination
appealed from to the extent and in the manner that the Zoning Board of
Adjustment may decide be fitting and proper. The Zoning Board of Adjustment
shall also have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal was taken.
   D.   When a property owner shows that a strict application of the terms of
this chapter relating to the use, construction, or alteration of buildings and
structures, or to the use of land that imposes upon him practical difficulties
or particular hardships, then the Board may make such variations of the strict
application of the terms of this chapter as are in harmony with its general
purpose and intent. When the Board is satisfied, under the evidence heard
before it, that a granting of such variation will not merely serve as a
convenience to the applicant, but is necessary to alleviate some demonstrable
hardship or difficulty so great as to warrant a variation in the following
instances:
      (1)   To permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a
district divides a single ownership as shown on record, such extensions of any
district will not exceed 100 feet.
      (2)   To permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming building which has
been destroyed or damaged to an extent of more than 50 percent of its value, by
fire, or act of God, or the public enemy, where the Board shall find some
compelling public necessity requiring a continuation of the nonconforming use,
but in no case shall such a permit be issued if its primary function is to
continue a monopoly.
      (3)   To permit the erection and use of a building, or the use of land in
any location for a public service corporation for public utility purposes which
the Board deems reasonably necessary for the public convenience or welfare.
      (4)   To make a variance where, by reason of an exceptional situation,
surroundings, or condition of a specific piece of property, or by reason of
exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a specific piece of property
of record, or by reason of exceptional topographical conditions, the strict
application of any provision of this chapter would result in peculiar hardship
upon the owner of such property, and amount to a practical confiscation of
property, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience to such owner, provided
such relief can be granted without substantially impairing the general purpose
and intent of the Comprehensive Plan as established by the regulations and
provisions contained in this chapter.
      (5)   To interpret the provisions of this chapter where the street layout
actually on the ground varies from the street layout as shown on the Official
Zoning Map fixing the several districts.
      (6)   To waive the parking requirements in the business or industrial
districts whenever the character or use of the building is such as to make
unnecessary the full provision of parking facilities, or where such regulations
would impose an unreasonable hardship upon the use of the lot, as contrasted
with merely granting an advantage or a convenience.
      (7)   To permit land within 200 feet of a multiple dwelling to be
improved for the parking spaces required in connection with a multiple
dwelling, but only when there is positive assurance that such land can be used
for such purposes, for the use of the occupants of the multiple dwelling.
   E.   In considering all appeals and all proposed variations to this chapter,
the Board shall first determine, before making any variation from this chapter

any order, requirement, decision, or determination of the Zoning Administrator,
to decide in favor of the applicant any matter upon which it is authorized to
render a decision.
   F.   Nothing herein contained shall be construed to give or grant to the
Board the power of authority to alter or change the Zoning Ordinance, or the
Official Zoning Map, such power and authority being reserved to the Council in
the manner hereinafter provided.
5.   Notification. The Board shall make no decision except in a specific case
and after a public hearing conducted by the Board. The Board shall select a
reasonable time and place for the hearing of the appeal and give due notice by
letter thereof to the property owners within 300 feet in all directions. Such
notice shall contain the address or location of the property for which the
variance or other ruling by the Board is sought, as well as a brief description
of the nature of the appeal. Notice of time and place of hearing shall be
published at least once in a newspaper in general circulation in the City not
less than seven days or more than 20 days before such hearing.

   E.   Notwithstanding the preceding provisions, in the C-3 zoning district
fences shall be permitted in the front yards, providing the fence is
constructed of chain-link material and does not exceed eight feet in height.
   F.   Fences may be constructed only upon the issuance of a permit from the
Building Official and the payment of such a permit fee as shall be established
by the Council. The application for this permit shall be in writing and shall
be accompanied by a drawing clearly showing both the proposed location of the
fence and a description of such fence.
   G.   There shall be permitted a fence for the use, benefit, and protection
of the public (as opposed to a private use, benefit, or protection) to be
located at Wescott Park in the City, said location in part extending into the
right-of-way of James Street, said fence location shall specifically be subject
to the following conditions:
      (1)   Said fence shall be of chain link material, six feet in height.
      (2)   The wire fencing material shall not extend beyond or above a
required top rail or other protective cover.
      (3)   The fence shall be offset at a minimum of two locations to permit
ingress to and egress from the fenced area.
      (4)   Said fence shall not extend north of a line located nine and one-
half feet north of the existing property line of Wescott Park (said line
alternatively described as being located six and one-half feet south of the
south edge of the existing sidewalk located parallel to James Street). Said
fence shall at all points remain south of the utility pole located in the James
Street right-of-way.
      (5)   As said fence extends southward in a westerly direction, it shall
at all points be located east of a utility pole located at the west edge of
Wescott Park property line.
      (6)   The location of said fence in any easement or right-of-way area
shall be subject to the needs of any utility company or the City, which needs
may require the removal of said fence on a temporary or permanent basis or may
cause damage to said fence. The City or other lawful users shall not be held
liable for the removal or damage to said fence and shall assume no
responsibility for any such removal or damage.
   H.   There shall be permitted a fence for the use, benefit, and protection
of the public (as opposed to a private use, benefit or protection) to be
located at Victory Park in the City, said location in part extending into the
right-of-way of James and Downey Streets. Said fence location shall
specifically be subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   Said fence shall be of chain link material, four feet in height.
      (2)   The wire fencing material shall not extend beyond or above a
required top rail or other protective cover.
      (3)   The fence shall be offset at a minimum of one location to permit
ingress to and egress from the fenced area. The interior centerfield posts

      (4)   The location of said fence in any easement or right-of-way area
shall be subject to the needs of any utility company or the City, which needs
may require the removal of said fence on a temporary or permanent basis or may
cause damage to said fence. The City or other lawful users shall not be held
liable for the removal or damage to said fence and shall assume no
responsibility for any such removal or damage.
   I.   Temporary fences are fences which are seasonal in nature or located
around construction sites, and are not meant to be used as permanent
structures. Temporary fences are allowed for a maximum of 180 days. Fences used
as “snow fences” cannot be erected prior to October 15 of any given year and
must be removed by May 1 of any given year. Construction fences must be removed
within 10 days after completion of the project. No temporary fence shall be
erected without first obtaining approval from the Building Official and no
temporary fence shall be erected and used as a permanent fence.
   J.   Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, a fence
may be located upon a utility easement located upon the rear yard of a platted
lot or specified existing parcel of real estate, subject to the following
conditions:
      (1)   No fence permitted pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
shall be constructed without first obtaining a building permit from the Walcott
Building Inspector.
      (2)   If the easement width of the property upon which the fence is to be
located is equal in width to the easement width on any adjacent lot upon which
a continuation of the easement is located, a permitted fence may be located no
closer than six feet to the affected property line. If there is no adjacent
property upon which an easement is located, or said easement portion located
upon adjacent lot is not equal in width to that upon the property upon which
the fence is to be located, no fence may be located closer than 12 feet to the
property line of the property upon which the fence is to be located. The
Walcott Building Inspector may adjust this distance as is appropriate if an
easement is partially located upon adjacent property but is not of equal width
to the portion located upon the property upon which the fence is to be
constructed
      (3)   If the easement area outside the fence to be constructed contains
utility structures or other structures, the Walcott Building Inspector may deny
approval for fence construction or may direct a location of the fence other
than the minimum distances required hereunder. In no case shall a fence
constructed under the provisions of this paragraph limit the easement’s use or
reduce the usable size as it relates to the primary use or uses of the easement
area.
      (4)   In the event the City, or its assignees, or any utility company, or
such company’s assignee, determines that it is necessary to relocate, destroy
or remove any fence which is permitted to be constructed pursuant to the
provisions of this unnumbered paragraph, as a result of the need of said party
to access the utility easement for any purpose related to the use of said
utility easement upon which the fence is constructed, the City or its
assignees, or any lawful utility company or assignees of the same, may
relocate, destroy or remove any such fence without liability therefore, and all
costs of such relocation, destruction or removal shall be the obligation of the
property owner upon whose property a fence is constructed under the provisions
of this unnumbered paragraph. If time permits, notice from the City or any
utility company will be given to the property owner who shall have a reasonable
period of time to relocate, destroy or remove said property owner’s fence. If
the same is not accomplished by a date indicated, the City, any utility
company, or their respective assignees, may relocate, destroy or remove such
fence with costs ascribable to the property owner upon whose property the fence
is constructed (nothing in this provision shall be interpreted to limit the
right of the City, any utility company or their respective assignees to remove,
destroy or relocate any permitted fence in an emergency situation without
notice). A property owner, by the construction of a fence in compliance with
the provisions of this unnumbered paragraph, is deemed to acknowledge the
limitation specified in this unnumbered paragraph (concerning relocation,
destruction or removal of a permitted fence) and agrees to hold harmless and
indemnify the City, any utility company, their respective agents and assigns,
for any and all liability for such relocation, destruction or removal. The cost
of the same, if ascribable to the property owner, shall be paid within 15 days
of written demand therefore.
167.25   BOUNDARIES OF THE DISTRICTS.
Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various
districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map and made a part of this chapter,
the following rules apply:
1.   Streets and Alleys Used For District Lines. The district boundaries are
either streets or alleys unless otherwise shown, and where the districts
designated on the Official Zoning Map accompanying and made a part of this
chapter are bounded approximately by street or alley lines.
2.   Lot Lines Used For District Lines. Where the district boundaries are not
otherwise indicated, and where the property has been or may hereafter be
divided into blocks and lots, the district boundaries shall be construed to be
the lot lines, and where the districts designated on the Official Zoning Map
are bounded approximately by lot lines, unless the boundaries are otherwise
indicated on the map.
167.26   ENFORCEMENT.
It is the duty of the Zoning Administrator to enforce this chapter. It is also
the duty of the officers and employees of the City to assist the Zoning
Administrator by reporting to said official instances of new construction,
reconstruction, or changes in land use which seemingly constitute violations.
167.27   INTERPRETATION, PURPOSE, AND CONFLICT.
In interpreting and applying the provisions of this chapter, they shall be the
minimum requirements for the promotion of the public safety, health,
convenience, comfort, morals, prosperity and general welfare of the inhabitants
of the City. It is not intended by this chapter to interfere with, abrogate or
annul any ordinance, rules, regulations, or permits previously adopted or
issued, and not in conflict with any of the provisions of this chapter, which
shall be adopted or issued pursuant to law relating to the use of buildings or
lots and likewise not in conflict with this chapter that imposes a greater
restriction upon the use of buildings or lots, upon height of buildings, or
requires larger open spaces than are required by such ordinance or agreements,
the provision of this chapter shall control.

the Council may from time to time in the manner hereinafter set forth amend the
regulations imposed in the districts created by this chapter. This chapter may
be amended, provided that in all amendments adopted under the authority of this

the Commission votes for an indefinite extension of this period, the Commission
shall make written findings of fact and shall submit same together with its
recommendations to the City Council. Where the purpose and effect of the
proposed amendment is to change the zoning classifications of particular
property, the findings of fact and recommendation shall include the following
information:
   A.   The zoning classification of property within the general area of the
property in question.
   B.   The suitability of the property in question to the use permitted under

167.29   SITE PLAN REVIEW.
1.   Purpose. In accordance with the Comprehensive Plan of the City, it is
essential that new developments on currently developed or undeveloped land meet
established minimum standards for the design of existing developments, to
insure adequate provisions for public/private utilities, such as sewer, water,
roads, and promote the health, safety and general welfare of the public.
2.   Application. A Site Plan review is required when developing a previously
undeveloped tract of land, and maybe required adding an additional building, or
significantly expanding a current building for other than single-family or two-
family residential use. If the proposed use is a principal permitted use within
the zoning district, the Commission will review the site plan. For special
permitted uses, the site plan will be reviewed by the Commission after the
Special Use Permit has been issued by the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
3.   Procedure. 20 copies, which should include 11 copies of 50 feet to one
inch scale, eight copies of 11-inch by 17-inch, and one electronic copy, of the
application and site plan for a proposed development listed in Paragraph 2
above shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator, who will determine if all
the information is provided and adequate for review. Once all the required
information is received, the Zoning Administrator shall immediately forward
copies of the Site Plan to the Fire Chief, Public Works Director, City
Attorney, and City Engineer for review and recommendation. Notification signs
shall be posted by the applicant in accordance with the requirements of Section
6 of this section. The Zoning Administrator will schedule a review by the
Commission at the next regular meeting beyond 13 working days of official
receipt. The Commission shall review the Site Plan proposed at said meeting and
receive a report from the Fire Chief, Public Works Director, City Engineer,
Zoning Administrator, and receive comments from the public. The Commission
shall make its determination of conditions for approval of the Site Plan within
35 days of the first meeting. If no action is forthcoming within the 35 days,
the site plan shall be forwarded to the Council for action. The Council shall
not act upon the Site Plan proposal until it has received a recommendation from
the Commission unless such recommendation is not received within 60 days. The
Council shall, after considering the Commission recommendations, approve,
approve with modifications, or deny any proposal by resolution. The Council may
include such conditions in its resolution of approval as it deems necessary. If
the Site Plan proposal is not acted upon by the City Council within 60 days
from the date that the Council receives the Commission’s recommendation, and
such time is not extended by mutual consent of the Council and petitioner, it
shall be deemed denied. The petitioner may request that the Site Plan proposal
be held from further action for an unstated length of time; however, if such
length of time exceeds 180 days, the proposal shall be considered withdrawn and
shall be reconsidered only upon re-filing a new application, meeting all
requirements of this chapter.
4.   Site Plan Review Standards. The standards for the site plan listed below
are intended only as minimum requirements, so that the general development
pattern in the City may be adjusted to a wide variety of circumstances and
topography, and to insure reasonable and orderly growth in the City.

other naturally sensitive areas which lend themselves to protection from
degradation.
   D.   The proposed development shall be designed with adequate water supply,
sewage treatment facilities, stormwater drains and structures necessary to
protect the public health and welfare by not overloading existing public
utilities. Except when waived by the City Council, runoff from the development
shall not be an outlet into existing drainage facilities in excess of the
existing runoff prior to development.
   E.   The proposed development shall be designed, and the buildings and
improvements shall be located within the tract or parcel in such a manner as
not to unduly diminish or impair the use and enjoyment of adjoining or
surrounding property. And to such end, the developer shall provide for such
fences, landscaping and other improvements as are proper and necessary to
buffer the proposed use from the existing or potential surrounding land uses.
   F.   The proposed development shall be designed not to unduly increase the
public danger of fire, explosion, and other safety hazards on the general
public, or the persons residing or working in adjoining or surrounding
property.
5.   Information on Site Plan. The purpose of the Site Plan is to show the
facts needed to enable the Commission and Council to determine whether the
proposed development meets the requirements of this chapter, and complies with

regulations in the “F” Floodplain Management Overlay District.
   A.   Legal Authorization. The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in
Chapter 414 of the Code of Iowa, as amended, delegated the power to cities to
exercise any power and perform any function it deems appropriate to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City or of its residents,
and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort and
convenience of its residents.
   B.   Findings of Fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the City of Walcott are subject to
periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection, relief, and impairment of the tax
base all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare of the community.
      (2)   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by:
The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages which
create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding.
The cumulative effect of obstruction on the flood plain causing increases in
flood heights and velocities.
      (3)   This ordinance relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing
flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the
Department of Natural Resources.
   C.   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City of Walcott, its
residents and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare,
comfort and convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses with
provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
property in times of flood, or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
      (3)   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
      (4)   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
program.
      (5)   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood
flows so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
   D.   Lands to Which Section Applies. The areas within the jurisdiction of
the City having special flood hazards are hereby designated as a Floodplain
(Overlay) District and shall be subject to the standards of the Floodplain
(Overlay) District (as well as those for the underlying zoning district). The
Floodplain (Overlay) District boundaries shall be as shown on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Scott County and Incorporated Areas, City of
Walcott, Panels 19163C0175G and 0310G, dated March 23, 2021. The Scott County
Flood Insurance Study is hereby adopted by reference and is made a part of this
ordinance for the purpose of administering floodplain management regulations.
   E.   Rules for Interpretation of Flood Hazard Boundaries. The boundaries of
the special flood hazard areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the
official Flood Map. When an interpretation is needed as to the exact location
of a boundary, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall make the necessary
interpretation. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it
is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the Zoning Enforcement Officer in the enforcement or
administration of this section.
   F.   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used, and no
structure shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered
without full compliance with the terms of this section and other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this section.
   G.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this section
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this section imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this section are hereby repealed to the extent of the
inconsistency only.
   H.   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this section shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the Council and shall not be deemed a limitation or
repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
   I.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
section are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This section does
not imply that areas outside the designated special flood hazard areas will be
free from flooding or flood damages. This section shall not create liability on
the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage
that results from reliance on this section or any administrative decision
lawfully made hereunder.
   J.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
section is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this section shall not be affected thereby.
   K.   Development and Use Requirements. All uses must be consistent with the
need to minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance
standards. Where base flood data has not been provided in the Flood Insurance
Study, the Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such
data. All development within the special flood hazard areas shall be designed
and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement, be
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage, use construction methods and
practices that will minimize flood damage, use construction materials and
utility equipment that are resistant to flood damage, obtain all other
necessary permits from Federal, State and local governmental agencies including
approval/sign off from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.
3.   Uses Permitted. Because this district is superimposed over other
districts, the uses permitted shall be the same as are allowed in each of the
underlying districts subject to the standards herein and in the other
districts.
4.   Uses Permitted on Review. Because this district is superimposed over other
districts, the uses permitted on review shall be the same as are allowed in
each of the underlying districts subject to the standards herein and in the
other districts.
5.   Uses Prohibited. Because this district is superimposed over other
districts, the uses prohibited on review shall be the same as are allowed in
each of the underlying districts subject to the standards herein and in the
other districts.
6.   Area and Structure Regulations. Because this district is superimposed over
other districts, the area and structure requirements shall be the same as are

floodplain management program for the area.
      (10)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
      (11)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.
      (12)   Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
section.
   C.   Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the Zoning Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this
section. Such conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
      (1)   Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
      (2)   Limitation of periods of use and operation.
      (3)   Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed
restrictions.

levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this section.
      (5)   Floodproofing measures.
10.   Nonconforming Uses.
   A.   A structure, or use of a structure, or lot which was lawful before the
passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this section, but which is
not in conformity with the provisions of this section, may be continued subject
to the following conditions:
      (1)   If such a use is discontinued for three consecutive years, any
future use of the building or lot shall conform to this section.
      (2)   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
   B.   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, except
unless it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this section.
This limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with
existing State or local health, sanitary, building, safety codes, regulations,
or the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
