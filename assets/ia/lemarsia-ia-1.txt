required due to economic obsolescence and the reconstruction is necessary to
implement recognized industry standards for the manufacturing and processing of
specific products and the reconstruction is required for the owner of the

distribution centers is eligible to receive a partial exemption from taxation
for a period of five years. The exemption shall also apply to the acquisition
of or improvement to machinery and equipment assessed as real estate pursuant
to Section 427A.1[1e] of the Code of Iowa, unless the machinery or equipment is
part of the normal replacement or operating process to maintain or expand the

Director of Revenue.
8.07 APPROVAL.
A person may submit a proposal to the City Council to receive prior approval
for eligibility for a tax exemption on new construction. If the City Council
resolves to consider such proposal, it shall publish notice and hold a public
hearing thereon. Thereafter, at least 30 days after such hearing, the City
Council, by ordinance, may give its prior approval of a tax exemption for new
construction if the new construction is in conformance with City zoning. Such
prior approval shall not entitle the owner to exemption from taxation until the
new construction has been completed and found to be qualified real estate.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 427B.4)
8.08 EXEMPTION REPEALED.
When in the opinion of the City Council continuation of the exemption granted

claim, or interest of the owner, lienholders, or claimants after the expiration
of the 10-day reclaiming period.
7.Â Â Â If it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identities
and addresses of the last registered owner and all lienholders, notice by one
publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the
vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice
under Subsection 2 of this section. The published notice may contain multiple

abandoned motor vehicle, or any person being the owner of a motor vehicle whose
title certificate is faulty, lost, or destroyed, may dispose of such motor
vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without notification
procedures, if such motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more wheels or
other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable. The police
authority shall give the applicant a certificate of authority. The applicant
shall then apply to the County Treasurer for a junking certificate and shall
surrender the certificate of authority in lieu of the certificate of title.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 321.90[2e])
80.08 PROCEEDS FROM SALES.

A backflow prevention valve meeting City specifications may be installed on the
customerâ€™s side of the water meter for each new service pipe and any service
pipe which is repaired or replaced. There is no grandfather clause on anything
related to cross-connection and/or backflow. All units must comply, regardless
of age. The City has adopted the IPC and State Codes, whichever is of higher
degree on all codes that are related to but not limited to all that pertain to
cross-connection and/or backflow. The owner, plumber or person working on a
potable water service also needs to conform to all codes in effect including
the following:
1.Â Â Â All services connected to the City water distribution system must do a
hazard survey. After making a hazard survey, the owner of the service shall
report to the City Water Department the degree of the hazard and shall give the
address, type of backflow prevention unit used, date of installation and
initial tests done by a certified tester approved by the City. The owner shall
provide a copy of the test to be filed by the City for dates to determine
future tests and to have available for State and Federal government officials
to check and also for citizens who may be interested in the test. Hazard charts
are posted and available at City Hall and at the Water Department.
2.Â Â Â All tests done on any backflow device or assembly must be tested by a
certified tester with a current license from the Iowa Department of Health or
approved state department of another state and also by the City.
3.Â Â Â All tests will be done using an approved form with three copies, one for
the City, one for the owner, and one for the tester.
4.Â Â Â All backflow prevention assemblies and devices will be installed so they
are readily accessible as defined in the IPC 608.14 so to make testing without
any interference and also height requirements as in the IPC 608.13.
5.Â Â Â All machinery and/or equipment that comes equipped with a backflow device
in the unit must have the backflow device installed so it also is readily
accessible. If it does not, a whole different unit must be installed as close
as possible to the unit so as to make for a testable site. (This would apply to
CO2 fountains and other apparatus that may apply.)
6.Â Â Â Water softeners, reverse osmosis and other apparatus that may be a hazard
of a cross-connection shall maintain a proper air gap when discharging to a
drain.
7.Â Â Â Whenever a backflow device is used and closes a system where pressure
changes could take place, an expansion or bladder device must be used to
protect the system from water hammer or excessive pressure.
8.Â Â Â Booster Pump.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No person shall install or maintain a water service connection to any
premises where a booster pump has been installed on a service line to or within
such premises, unless the booster pump is equipped with a low pressure cut-off
designed to shut off the booster pump when the pressure in the service line on
the suction side of the pump drops below 20 pounds per square inch gauge or
less.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â It is the duty of the water customer to maintain the low pressure cut-
off device in working order.
9.Â Â Â Violations.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The water purveyor shall deny or discontinue, after notice to the
customer thereof, the water service to any premises wherein:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Any backflow prevention device required by this section which
includes the IPC and State codes with automatic updates thereof, is not
installed or maintained in a manner acceptable by the City.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â It is found that the backflow prevention device has been removed or
bypassed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â An unprotected cross-connection exists on the premises.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â A low-pressure cut-off booster pump is not installed properly or
maintained in working order.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The Water Superintendent is denied entry to determine compliance
with these regulations.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The Water Superintendent shall immediately deny or discontinue, without
notice to the customer thereof, the water service to any premises wherein a
service cross-connection exists which constitutes an immediate threat to the
safety of the public water system. The Water Superintendent shall notify the
customer within 24 hours of the denial or disconnection of service.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Water service to such premises shall not be restored until the customer
has corrected or eliminated such conditions or defects in conformance with
these regulations and to the satisfaction of the Water Superintendent.
90.20 DAMAGING WATER PROPERTY.
It is unlawful to break, injure, mar or deface, interfere with or disturb any
building, machinery, apparatus, fixtures, hydrants, attachments, or
appurtenances of the water system or any public or private hydrant or water
trough, or stop-cock box, meter, water supply or service pipe or any part
thereof, or deposit anything in any stop-cock box, or commit any act tending to
obstruct or impair the intended use of any of the above-mentioned property,
without permission of the proper authorities or excepting cases herein or
otherwise provided by ordinance.
90.21 OWNER RESPONSIBLE FOR PIPES AND FIXTURES.
The Water Department will not be responsible for private water pipes and/or
fixtures. All owners must, at their own expense, keep their service pipe from
the point of connection with the City mains to their premises, and all other
apparatus, in good working order, free from unmetered leaks and properly
protected from frost and other danger. If leaks develop, the owner must at the
ownerâ€™s own expense repair the leak. Once a leak is identified by the City,
oral or written notice will be given to the property owner and the notice will
provide the owner with a reasonable time within which to repair the service
pipe. If in the opinion of the Superintendent the owner is negligent in
repairing unmetered water leaks, the Superintendent may order the work
performed at once and all costs of such work shall be charged to and paid by
the owner. In the event of ongoing leakage in a service line, a daily charge
set by Council resolution will be assessed for the usage of unmetered water. No
claims shall be made against the City by reason of the breaking of any of the
service pipes or apparatus or from any other damage that may result from
shutting off water for repairing or any other purpose, or for any variation in
pressure. No reduction will be made from regular rates because of leaking pipes
or fixtures.
90.22 LIABILITY OF CITY.
The City shall not be responsible for accidents resulting from insecure boilers
or from variation in the water pressure, or the ram of the water from the
mains, or from collapse from any cause whatever.
90.23 NONPUBLIC WATER WELLS PROHIBITED.
No nonpublic well or water supply shall be installed where a public water
supply system is reasonably accessible to the landowner. The determination of
accessibility shall be made by the City Administrator. In the event the City
Administrator determines the property is not accessible to a public water
supply system, or if there is clear and convincing evidence that the accessible
public water supply is inadequate to meet the needs of the landowner, then a
variance from this prohibition may be obtained from the variance board if a
well permit is obtained pursuant to State law or County ordinance.
90.24 LAWN WATERING RESTRICTIONS.
Upon resolution of the Council that a water shortage event is taking place,
restrictions upon the irrigation or watering of residential, commercial and
industrial lawns shall be applied.

such meter in accordance with requirements established by the City.
91.07 METER REPAIRS.
Whenever a water meter owned by the City is found to be out of order the
Superintendent shall have it repaired. If it is found that damage to the meter
has occurred due to the carelessness or negligence of the customer or property
owner, or the meter is not owned by the City, then the property owner shall be
liable for the cost of repairs. Service calls resulting from improper meter
installation shall be billed to the customer or property owner, based on fees
established by resolution of the Council.
91.08 RIGHT OF ENTRY.
The Superintendent or designee shall be permitted to enter the premises of any
customer at any reasonable time to read, remove, or change a meter. The City

overcharges collected since the last known date of accuracy, but not more than
five percent of the total water bill and not for a longer period than three
months. If the meter is found to be accurate or slow or less than five percent
fast, the user shall pay a testing charge set by resolution of the Council.
91.11 OUTSIDE WATER USAGE METERS.
The City will install a second meter for outside water usage in accordance with
the guidelines set by the City Administrative Policy for Water Meters and in
such a way that it can be easily determined that only water used outside and
not going into the sanitary sewer system is running through the meter. The
plumber shall notify the Superintendent when the plumbing has been installed
and is ready for meter installation by the City. No person shall intentionally
break the seal on a water meter that has been sealed by the City Water
Department. If a seal is accidentally broken, the owner shall report the
incident to the City Water Department within 24 hours. There shall be a fee
charged to the property owner for this service in accordance with the schedule
of such fees approved by resolution of the Council.
91.12 CHARGES WHEN METERS FAIL TO REGISTER.
In cases where meters fail to register the amount of water passing through them
by being stopped up or from any cause whatever, the quantity used shall be
determined and the charge made based upon the same period from the previous
year.

instances, the specific reason for deferment shall be set forth in writing, and
upon future connection of such premises to the municipal water system,
annexation of such premises, or other occurrences which eliminate the
underlying reason for deferral, the special connection charge shall immediately
become due and payable in full, including accrued interest for the full
assessment period.
93.07 SPECIAL SERVICE LINES.
The City reserves the right to approve special service line extensions within
the exclusive service area of the municipal water system in lieu of an actual
water main extension and as a temporary measure. Such service lines shall be

otherwise provide for the same.
3.Â Â Â The City reserves the right to interrupt or terminate water service,
without notice, to special service lines due to leaks or other maintenance
problems, conditions which may result in the contamination of the municipal
water system, or water shortages or pressure reductions within the municipal
water system, all without notice.
93.08 REIMBURSEMENT FOR CONSTRUCTION OF WATER MAINS.
The City may enter into development agreements with developers for the
extension of water mains and appurtenances within platted subdivisions.
Reimbursement shall be in an amount established by Council. The final
reimbursable amount will be determined at the completion of construction by the
City or the developer. The City will not reimburse any work associated with
service lines to platted lots. The final cost of construction will then be
divided by the number of platted lots to determine the amount to be reimbursed
per lot. In the case of City construction, the developer will reimburse the
City the amount per lot upon the sale of the lot. In the case of developer
construction, the City will reimburse the developer the total Cityâ€™s share of
improvement costs upon the Council's acceptance of the improvements.

wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a

99.08 Rate When Private Water Supply    99.16 Fixed Monthly Capital Cost Charge
Used
Â 
99.01 PURPOSE.
It is determined and declared to be necessary and conducive to the protection
of the public health, safety, welfare and convenience of the City to collect
charges from all users who contribute wastewater to the Cityâ€™s treatment works.
The proceeds of such charges so derived will be used for the purpose of
operating, maintaining and retiring the debt for such public wastewater
treatment works.
99.02 GENERATION OF REVENUES BY USER CHARGE.
The user charge system shall generate adequate annual revenues to pay costs of
annual operation and maintenance including replacement and costs associated
with debt retirement of bonded capital associated with financing the treatment
works which the City may by ordinance designate to be paid by the user charge
system. That portion of the total user charge which is designated for operation
and maintenance including replacement of the treatment works shall leave a
balance of net revenues sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on
revenue bonds and pledge orders as they become due.
99.03 OPERATION, MAINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENT FUND.
All portions of the total user charge collected which is designated for
operation and maintenance including replacement purpose shall remain in sewer
fund, in accordance with Code of Iowa Sec. 384.84.
99.04 FISCAL YEAR-END BALANCES.
Fiscal year-end balances in the sewer fund shall be carried over to the sewer
fund in the subsequent fiscal year, and shall be used for no other purposes
than those designated for this account. Moneys which have been transferred from
other sources to meet temporary shortages in the sewer fund shall be returned
to their respective accounts upon appropriate adjustment of the user charge
rates for operation, maintenance and replacement. The user charge rate shall be
adjusted such that the transferred moneys will be returned to their respective
accounts within the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the moneys
were borrowed.
99.05 USE OF TREATMENT WORKS DETERMINED BY WATER METERS; APPLICABILITY OF
RATES.
Each user shall pay for the services provided by the City based on said userâ€™s
use of the treatment works as determined by water meters acceptable to the
City. The user charge rates established in this chapter apply to all users,
regardless of their location, of the Cityâ€™s treatment works.
99.06 BASIS OF USER CHARGE.
For residential customers, monthly user charges shall be based on the water
usage for that month. For industrial and commercial customers, user charges may
be based on water used during the current month. If a commercial or industrial
customer has a consumptive use of water, or in some other manner uses water
which is not returned to the wastewater collection system, the user charge for
that customer may be based on a wastewater meter or separate water meter
installed and maintained at the customerâ€™s expense, and in a manner acceptable
to the City.
99.07 USER CHARGES.
The base monthly fee shall be $12.21 effective July 1, 2024, $15.06 effective
July 1, 2025, $17.91 effective July 1, 2026, $20.76 effective July 1, 2027,

effective July 1, 2027, $10.6398 effective July 1, 2028, and $12.2513 effective
July 1, 2029, per 1,000 gallons of water (or wastewater) as determined in the
preceding section.
(Section 99.07 â€“ Ord. 990 â€“ Nov. 24 Supp.)
99.08 RATE WHEN PRIVATE WATER SUPPLY USED.
The charge or rate for the use of and service rendered by the sewage treatment
plant to all contributors of sewage and industrial wastes, using either a
private water supply or a private water supply in addition to water furnished
by the City, or its successor, shall be figured on the following basis: The
quantity of water from such privately owned supplies, used and discharged into
the sanitary utilities, shall be determined to the satisfaction of the City at
the expense of the owner. If the estimated quantity of water from any such
supply exceeds 50 gallons per day, the City may require that such water supply
be metered at the expense of the owner. After the quantity of water from such
private water supply or from such private water supply in addition to water
purchased from the City or its successor that is used and discharged into the
sanitary utilities has been determined, the equivalent net water bill at
current rates of the City or its successor shall be computed. The sewage
service rates for the premises shall then be calculated by the application of
the proper percentage as set out under Section
99.07.
99.09 SURCHARGES FOR CERTAIN WASTEWATER CUSTOMERS.
For those customers (Wells Enterprises, Inc. and DFA Dairy Brands Fluid, LLC)
who contribute wastewater, the strength of which is greater than normal
domestic sewage, a surcharge in addition to the normal user charge will be
collected. There will be two rate blocks used for these customers:
1.Â Â Â Block No. 1 â€“ Discharge up to the 2010 (winter season) Treatment Agreement
Limits. Rates will be the same as the residential/commercial user rates. These
rates include operation and maintenance costs plus debt service on past and
proposed improvements to the existing plant.

Â 
99.10 PAYMENT OF INCREASED COSTS.
Any user which discharges any toxic pollutants which cause an increase in the
cost of managing the effluent or the sludge from the Cityâ€™s treatment works or
any user which discharges any substance which singly or by interaction with
other substances caused identifiable increases in the cost of operation,
maintenance or replacement of the treatment works shall pay for such increased
costs. The charge to each such user shall be as determined by the responsible
plant operating personnel and approved by the Council.
99.11 PAYMENT OF BILLS.
All sewer user charges are due and payable under the same terms and conditions
provided for payment of a combined service account as contained in Section
92.03 of this Code of Ordinances. Sewer service may be discontinued in
accordance with the provisions contained in Section
92.04 if the combined service account becomes delinquent, and the provisions
contained in Section
92.07 relating to lien notices shall also apply in the event of a delinquent
account.
99.12 LIEN FOR NONPAYMENT.
Except as provided for in Section
92.07 of this Code of Ordinances, the owner of the premises served and any
lessee or tenant thereof shall be jointly and severally liable for sewer
service charges to the premises. Sewer service charges remaining unpaid and
delinquent shall constitute a lien upon the property or premises served and
shall be certified by the Clerk to the County Treasurer for collection in the
same manner as property taxes.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
99.13 REVIEW OF SYSTEM AND REVISION OF RATES.
The City shall review the user charge system at least every five years and
revise user charge rates as necessary to ensure that the system generates
adequate revenues to pay the costs of operation and maintenance including
replacement and that the system continues to provide for the proportional
distribution of operation and maintenance including replacement costs among
users and user classes.
99.14 NOTIFICATION OF RATE CHANGE.
The City will notify each user of any rate change. This notice will be in
conjunction with a regular bill. This notice will include the rate being
charged for operation and maintenance including replacement of the treatment
works.
99.15 REIMBURSEMENT FOR CONSTRUCTION OF SEWERS.
The City may enter into development agreements with developers for the
extension of sewer mains and appurtenances within platted subdivisions.
Reimbursement shall be in an amount established by Council. The final
reimbursable amount will be determined at the completion of construction by the
City or the developer. The City will not reimburse any work associated with
service lines to platted lots. The final cost of construction will then be
divided by the number of platted lots to determine the amount to be reimbursed
per lot. In the case of City construction, the developer will reimburse the
City the amount per lot upon the sale of the lot. In the case of developer
construction, the City will reimburse the developer the total Cityâ€™s share of
improvement costs upon the Councilâ€™s acceptance of the improvements.
99.16 FIXED MONTHLY CAPITAL COST CHARGE.
The City of Le Mars will bill Wells Enterprises, Inc. $83,333 per month and
Dean Foods $21,250 per month fixed cost associated with the construction and

100.04 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
1.Â Â Â Notices of Violation. If the City Administrator finds based on
scientifically reliable data that any industrial user has violated or is
violating a wastewater treatment agreement in a material way, the City
Administrator may issue a notice of violation, and such notice shall be served
in person on the managing officer of the industrial user or by certified mail
on such person with return receipt received. The notice of violation must
specify the parameters violated, the date and time of the violation, the data
upon which the City relies in finding such violation, and the manner in which
such data was collected.
2.Â Â Â Consent Agreements. The City Administrator may enter into consent
agreements, consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other
similar documents (â€œconsent agreementâ€) establishing an agreement with any
industrial user responsible for any such noncompliance as to which notice is
given in a notice of violation. Such agreements shall specify the actions to be
taken by the industrial user and the time frame for completion of those actions
outlined in the consent agreement. In the event a consent agreement is not
entered into within 60 days of the service of notice of violation, the City
Administrator may seek a compliance order in accordance with subsection 3.
3.Â Â Â Compliance Orders. In the event a consent agreement is not entered into,
or the industrial user fails to comply with the terms of a consent agreement,
the City Administrator may request the City Council to approve the issuance of
a compliance order to the industrial user responsible for the discharge,
directing that the industrial user submit a plan of action which will include a
schedule for the industrial user to come into compliance. The industrial user
shall be notified in writing of any such request at least seven days prior to
the Councilâ€™s consideration of the request by personal service on the managing
officer or by certified mail on such person with return receipt requested. The
notice shall include the time, date, and location of the meeting at which the
request will be considered, the proposed compliance order being requested and
the basis therefor, including all data. The industrial user shall have the
opportunity to present information and argument at such meeting. In the event a
compliance order is issued in the form approved by the Council, and the
industrial user does not submit an acceptable plan of action or come into
compliance within the agreed upon schedule, the City Administrator may seek a
cease and desist order pursuant to Subsections 4 and 5, or request the issuance
of a municipal infraction citation pursuant to Subsection 6.
4.Â Â Â Cease and Desist Orders. The City Administrator may request that the City
Council approve a cease and desist order per the criteria set forth in
subsection 3 above, directing the industrial user to cease its failure to
comply with a compliance order or desist unlawful discharging of industrial
waste to the Cityâ€™s sewer system. Such order shall not be issued until such
time as a show cause hearing has been held as set out below in Subsection 5.
5.Â Â Â Show Cause Hearings. The City Administrator may order any industrial user
that fails to comply with a compliance order to appear before the City Council
and show cause why a cease and desist order should not be issued. Notice shall
be served on the industrial user specifying the time and place for the meeting,
the proposed order, the basis for such action including all data, and a request
that the industrial user show cause why this proposed order should not be
issued. Such written notice must be served personally at least fourteen (14)
days prior to the hearing on the managing officer of the industrial user or by
certified mail on such person with return receipt received. The industrial user
shall have the opportunity to present information and argument at such hearing.
Whether or not the industrial user appears as ordered, immediate enforcement
action in the form of a cease and desist order may be issued by the City
Council following the hearing date. The industrial user may also request a
hearing before the City Council to show cause why a proposed cease and desist
order should not be issued, and the City Council shall notify the City
Administrator and industrial user of any such hearing in the manner set out in
this section.
6.Â Â Â Municipal Infractions. In the event an industrial user fails to comply
with the terms and conditions of a compliance order within the specified period
of time, the City Administrator may request the City Council to authorize the
issuance of a civil citation for a municipal infraction for an environmental
violation. The industrial user shall be notified in writing of any such request
at least 14 days prior to the Council consideration of the request, by personal
service on its managing officer or by certified mail on such person with return
receipt requested, and such notice shall include the time, date, and location
of the meeting at which the request will be considered, the reasons for such
action, the proposed action being requested and the basis therefor including
supporting data. The industrial user shall have the opportunity to present
information and argument at the meeting. In the event the City Council grants
the request, which decision must be in writing, the City Administrator may
issue the citation in accordance with
Chapter 4 of this Code of Ordinances.
7.Â Â Â Administrative Penalty Charges. An industrial user contributing wastewater
to the POTW in excess of the limitations contained within its wastewater
discharge agreement may be assessed a penalty charge, based on the schedule
below, which shall be in addition to the rates and charges ordinarily billed to
such users for sewer use:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â $1.00 per 1,000 gallons for flow in excess of a 30-day average
discharge limit;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â $1.00 per 1,000 gallons for flow in excess of a daily maximum discharge
limit;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â $0.20 per pound of CBOD in excess of a 30-day average discharge limit;
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â $0.20 per pound of CBOD in excess of a daily maximum discharge limit;
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â $0.20 per pound of TSS in excess of a 30-day average discharge limit
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â $0.20 per pound of TSS in excess of a daily maximum discharge limit
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â $50.00 per occurrence for fats, oil and grease discharged in excess of
a daily maximum discharge limit based upon data from a compliance sampling
event;
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â $200.00 per occurrence for discharges with a pH in violation of a
discharge limit;
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â $3.00 per pound of TKN in excess of a 30-day average discharge limit;
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â $3.00 per pound of TKN in excess of a daily maximum discharge limit.
Unpaid penalty charges shall, after 60 calendar days, be assessed an additional
penalty of 10 percent for the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue
thereafter at a rate of one percent per month, compounded monthly. Industrial
users desiring to dispute such penalty charges must file written request with
the City Administrator to reconsider the penalty charges along with full
payment within 30 days of being notified of the penalty charges. The City
Administrator shall convene a hearing before the City Council on the matter
within 30 days of receiving the request from the industrial user, with notice
to be given in writing at least seven days in advance of the hearing in the
same manner as provided for in Section
100.04(1). The individual user may present information and argument at such
hearing. The Council shall issue its decision on any such request within 20
days of such hearing. In the event the industrial userâ€™s request results in a
full or partial refund, the refund, together with any interest accruing
thereto, shall be returned to the industrial user within 10 days of the City
Councilâ€™s decision. An industrial user which is denied, in whole or in part,
the relief sought in any such request for reconsideration may seek further and
additional relief through any and all other remedies available under applicable
law. Issuance of an administrative penalty charge shall not be a prerequisite
for the City taking any other action against the industrial user; however, if
the City elects to impose administrative penalty charges, it cannot also cause
a citation for municipal infraction to be issued for the same alleged
violations of the industrial userâ€™s wastewater treatment agreement. All penalty
charges collected under the guidelines of this chapter shall be directed to the
operating budget of the Cityâ€™s wastewater treatment plant.
8.Â Â Â Emergency Service Suspensions.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The City Administrator may immediately suspend an industrial userâ€™s
sewer service at a particular discharge point (after notice to the industrial
userâ€™s managing officer) when such a suspension: (i) is necessary in order to
stop an actual or threatened discharge which, based on data collected in
accordance with recognized scientific methodology, presents or causes an
imminent substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of the general
public or to the environment; or (ii) when the discharge threatens to cause
undue, substantial, irreversible damage to the equipment within the Cityâ€™s POTW
or harm to its personnel.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Any industrial user notified of a suspension shall immediately stop or
eliminate its contribution to the sewer system at that discharge point. In the
event of an industrial userâ€™s failure to immediately comply with the suspension
order, the City Administrator shall take such steps as deemed necessary
including immediate severance of the designated sewer connection, to prevent or
minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any
individuals or the environment. The City Administrator shall allow the
industrial user to recommence its discharge when industrial user has
demonstrated to the City Administrator that the period of endangerment has
passed. The City Administrator must accept or deny the request of the
industrial user to recommence its discharge within 48 hours of such a request.
If the City Administrator refuses the industrial userâ€™s request to recommence
discharge, a hearing must be held within 48 hours of that refusal before the
City Council, with notice to be given immediately in the same manner as
provided in Section
100.04(1), at which time the City Administrator must show cause why suspension
must be continued and the industrial user shall have the opportunity to present
information and argument. The City Council shall issue its decision on the
request to lift the suspension at that hearing, stating the basis therefor. In
the event the industrial userâ€™s request is granted, the City Administrator
shall immediately allow the discharge to recommence. In the event the
industrial userâ€™s request is denied, the industrial user may seek further and
additional relief through any and all other remedies available under applicable
law.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â An industrial user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge which results in the emergency suspension of its sewer service at a
particular discharge point shall submit to the City Administrator a detailed
written statement describing the causes of the harmful condition and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence prior to any show cause or
termination hearing provided for under other sections of this chapter.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require a hearing prior
to any emergency suspension under this section.
9.Â Â Â Terminations of Industrial Waste Discharge. In addition to the
circumstances upon which the City may suspend sewer service under Section
100.04(8), any industrial user which commits the violations set forth below may
be subject to termination of its wastewater treatment agreement:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Violation of a cease and desist order;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Refusal of reasonable access to the industrial userâ€™s premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Falsifying self-monitoring reports; or
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Failure to pay fees, sewer user charges, or administrative penalty
charges within 60 days of written notice of same.
10.Â Â Â Procedures for Termination of Industrial Waste Discharge. The City may
terminate an industrial userâ€™s wastewater treatment agreement pursuant to
Section
100.04 (9) based on the following procedures:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The City shall issue a written notice to the industrial user a minimum
of 20 days prior to the date set for a hearing before the City Council. Such
notice shall notify the industrial user of the time, date, and place of
hearing, the purpose for the hearing, the proposed action, and the basis for
such proposed action including the information upon which the City relies in
proposing such action. Such written notice shall be served in the same manner
as provided for in Section
100.04(1).
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If after such hearing, the City Council makes a finding in writing
based on substantial evidence that actions subject to the termination of
industrial waste discharge under Section
100.04(9) have occurred as alleged and are not remedied as of the time of such
hearing or to be remedied within a reasonable period thereafter, the City
Council may direct the City Administrator to terminate the industrial userâ€™s
wastewater treatment agreement subject to the requirements set forth below. The
City Council shall set out its decision and the basis therefor in writing.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Written notice of the City Councilâ€™s decision shall be served on the
managing officer of the industrial user by registered mail, return receipt
requested, or by personal service. If termination is ordered, the effective
date of such termination can be no sooner than 45 days after the date of
receipt of the notice by the industrial user. At any time, the industrial user
may challenge that decision through any and all remedies available to it under
applicable law.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â In the event of termination of the industrial userâ€™s wastewater
treatment agreement, the agreement shall be reinstated once the industrial user
has provided information to the City Administrator that the user has remedied
the circumstances which resulted in the Cityâ€™s decision to terminate. The City
Administrator must accept or deny the request within 48 hours. If the City
Administrator refuses to reinstate, a hearing must be held within 48 hours of
that refusal before the City Council, at which time the City Administrator must
show cause why termination must be continued. The procedures shall be in
accordance with those set out in Section
100.04(8)(B) to the extent applicable.
100.05 OTHER REMEDIES.
In addition to other remedies provided for in
Chapter 99, including but not limited to in Section
99.10, an industrial user may be charged by the City for all or part of any
administrative penalty or fine imposed on the City by a State or federal agency
for violations of the Cityâ€™s obligations, but only to the extent the City
proves based on scientifically reliable data that the Cityâ€™s violation was
caused by the industrial userâ€™s unlawful discharges. The remedies provided in
Chapter 100 shall not be exclusive, and the City may pursue other remedies, as
are authorized by applicable law, against any persons violating the provisions
in this chapter, including injunctive relief.
100.06 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS.
In addition to any and all other defenses that an industrial user may have to
any action undertaken pursuant to this chapter or
Chapter 4, an industrial user may assert the following affirmative defenses.
Proof of any such affirmative defense shall be a bar against any and all action
by the City pursuant to this chapter or
Chapter 4.
1.Â Â Â Upset. For the purpose of this section, â€œupsetâ€ means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
discharge limits because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused
by operational error, lack of preventative maintenance, or careless or improper
operation. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense if the following
requirements are met:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â An upset occurred and the industrial user has reasonably identified the
causes of the upset;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The industrial userâ€™s facility was at the time being operated in a
prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and
maintenance procedures; and
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The industrial user submitted the following information to the City
Administrator as soon as possible following the upset:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A description of the upset and reasonable cause of noncompliance;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The period of noncompliance, including dates and times;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
recurrence of the noncompliance.
2.Â Â Â Prohibited Discharge Standards. An industrial user shall have an
affirmative defense to any action brought against it pursuant to this chapter
or
Chapter 4 if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know, that its
discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would
cause major interference with the Cityâ€™s POTW.
3.Â Â Â Bypass. For the purpose of this section, â€œbypassâ€ means the intentional
diversion of waste streams from any portion of an industrial userâ€™s treatment
system; and â€œsevere property damageâ€ means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facility which causes it to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources, which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of the bypass. Bypass is an
affirmative defense to actions under this chapter and
Chapter 4 only in the following limited circumstances:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or
severe property damage;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â There were no feasible alternatives to bypass; and
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Catastrophic failure of primary equipment and backup systems occurred
due to unforeseen causes or natural disasters; or
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Upon prior written notice to the Superintendent, bypass occurs for the
purpose of essential maintenance to assure efficient operation of treatment
equipment.

Â 
101.01 PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish a storm water drainage system
district and provide a means of funding the operation and maintenance of storm
water management facilities including, but not limited to, retainage basins,
detention basins, storm sewers, inlets, ditches, drains, and drainage
facilities.
101.02 STORM WATER DRAINAGE SYSTEM.
The entire City is hereby declared a storm water drainage system district for
the purpose of establishing, imposing, adjusting, and providing for the
collection of rates for the operation and maintenance of storm water management
facilities. As additional areas are annexed to the City they shall immediately
be included in the storm water drainage system district.
101.03 RATES.
The rates for the operation and maintenance of the storm water management
facilities shall be collected by imposing a monthly rate on every City water
meter, non-metered buildings and paved surface lots based on a two rate system
for storm water drainage fees. A rate shall be established for residential
users per month per water meter and a separate rate shall be established for
all non-residential users. The monthly rate for the storm water fee shall be
established by resolution by the City Council annually, or from time to time as
determined by City Council. A monthly rate shall be collected on every
residence, apartment, and dwelling unit in mobile home parks, business,
commercial and industrial City water meter, non-metered buildings and paved
surfaced lots. The rates shall be billed and collected in the same manner as
water and/or sewer service rates. The Council shall have the authority to
establish different monthly rates for different classifications of City water
meters, non-metered buildings and paved surfaced lots.
101.04 PAYMENT OF RATES.
The monthly rates are due and payable under the same terms and conditions as
water and/or sewer service charges.
101.05 LIEN FOR NONPAYMENT.

a 25 year period from and after the effective date of the ordinance codified in
this chapter, â€   provided however, that there may be a re-evaluation prior to
the end of year 15, with the opportunity for both parties to request
amendments. If neither party requests such re-evaluation by means of a written
notice to the other party at least 90 days prior to the expiration of year 15,
this franchise will continue without change for the remaining 10 years.

â€â€ Â EDITORâ€™S NOTE: Ordinance No. 881, adopting an electric franchise for the
  City, was passed and adopted on July 21, 2009.
111.02 STATE CODE RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS.
The rights and privileges hereby granted are subject to the restrictions and
limitations of Chapter 364 of the Code of Iowa, or as subsequently amended or
changed.
111.03 POLES AND WIRES; TRIMMING TREES.
The Company shall have the right to erect all necessary poles and to place
thereon the necessary wires, fixtures and accessories as well as excavate and
bury conductors for the distribution of electric energy and communications
signals in and through the City, but all said conduits and poles shall be
placed as not to interfere with the construction of any water pipes, drain or
sewer, or the flow of water therefrom, which have been or may hereafter be
located by authority of the City. The Company is authorized and empowered to
prune or remove at Company expense any tree extending into any street, alley or
public grounds to maintain electric reliability, safety, to restore utility
service and to prevent limbs, branches or trunks from interfering with the
wires and facilities of the Company. The pruning of trees shall be done to
current nationally accepted safety and utility industry standards.
111.04 RELOCATION OF INSTALLATIONS.
The Company shall, at its cost and expense, locate and relocate its
installations in, on, over or under any public street or alley in the City in
such manner as the City may at any time reasonably require for the purposes of
facilitating the construction, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of the
street or alley or any public improvement of, in or about any such street or
alley or reasonably promoting the efficient operation of any such improvement.
If the City has a reasonable alternative route for the street, alley or public
improvements or an alternative construction method, which would not cause the
relocation of the Company installations, the City shall select said alternative
route or construction method. If relocation of the Company facilities could be
avoided by relocating other franchiseeâ€™s or facility userâ€™s equipment and
facilities or by using a different method to perform the street and/or curbing
construction, and said other cost of construction or relocation is less than
the Companyâ€™s, the City shall select the route or method that is less
expensive. The Company will notify the City if project funds from a source
other than the City are available to pay for the relocation of utility
facilities, the City shall attempt to secure said funds and provide them to the
Company to compensate the Company for the costs of relocation.
111.05 EXCAVATIONS.
In making excavations in any streets, avenues, alleys and public places for the
repair, maintenance or installation of conduits or the erection of poles and
wires or other appliances, the Company shall not unreasonably obstruct the use
of the streets and shall replace the surface, restoring the original condition
as nearly as practicable.
111.06 INDEMNIFICATION.
The Company shall indemnify and save harmless the City from any and all claims,
suits, losses, damages, costs or expenses on account of injury or damage to any
person or property, caused or occasioned, in whole or in part, by Companyâ€™s
negligence in construction, reconstruction, excavation, operation or
maintenance of the electric utilities authorized by this franchise, provided,
however, that the Company shall not be obligated to defend, indemnify and save
harmless the City for any costs or damages arising from the negligence of the
City, its officers, employees or agents.
111.07 MAINTAIN FACILITIES.
The Company shall construct, operate and maintain its facilities in accordance
with the applicable regulations of the Iowa Utilities Board or its successors.

the quantity and quality consistent with applicable Iowa laws and regulations.
111.09 POLICE REGULATIONS.
All reasonable and proper police regulation shall be adopted and enforced by
the City for the protection of the facilities of the Company.
111.10 FRANCHISE FEE.

Code. The franchise fee shall only be imposed through the adoption of an
ordinance authorizing said franchise fee. The City shall work with the Company
to develop a methodology and timeline to implement the franchise fee. The City
shall provide the Company with written notice no less than 90 days in advance
of the effective date of any franchise fee enacted by the City.

The City hereby grants to the Grantee a nonexclusive franchise which authorizes
the Grantee to construct and operate a cable system in, along, among, upon,
across, above, over, under, or in any manner connected with public ways within
the service area, and for that purpose to erect, install, construct, repair,

appurtenant to the cable system for the transmission and distribution of cable
services, data services, information and other communications services or for
any other lawful purposes.
113.03 OTHER ORDINANCES.
The Grantee agrees to comply with the terms of any lawfully adopted generally
applicable local ordinance, to the extent that the provisions of the ordinance
do not have the effect of limiting the benefits or expanding the obligations of
the Grantee that are granted by the franchise. Neither party may unilaterally
alter the material rights and obligations set forth in this chapter. In the
event of a conflict between any ordinance and this chapter, this chapter shall
control.
113.04 OTHER AUTHORIZATIONS.
The City shall not permit any person to provide services similar to those
provided by the Grantee in the service area without first having secured a
nonexclusive franchise from the City. The City agrees that any grant of
additional franchises or other authorizations including OVS authorizations by
the City to provide services similar to those provided by the Grantee pursuant
to this chapter to any other entity shall cover the entire service area and
shall not be on terms and conditions more favorable or less burdensome to the
grantee of any such additional franchise or other authorization than those
which are set forth herein. In any renewal of the franchise, the City, should
it seek to impose increased obligations upon the Grantee, must take into
account any additional franchises or authorizations previously granted and find
that the proposed increased obligations in the renewal, are not more burdensome
and/or less favorable than those contained in any such additional franchises or
authorizations.
113.05 CONDITIONS OF OCCUPANCY.
The cable system installed by the Grantee pursuant to the terms hereof shall be
located so as to cause a minimum of interference with the proper use of public
ways and with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who own
property that adjoins any of such public ways.
113.06 RESTORATION OF PUBLIC WAYS.
If during the course of the Granteeâ€™s construction, operation, or maintenance
of the cable system there occurs a disturbance of any public way by the
Grantee, Grantee shall replace and restore such public way to a condition
reasonably comparable to the condition of the public way existing immediately
prior to such disturbance.
113.07 RELOCATION FOR THE CITY.
Upon its receipt of reasonable advance written notice, to be not less than ten
business days, the Grantee shall protect, support, raise, lower, temporarily
disconnect, relocate in or remove from the public way, any property of the
Grantee when lawfully required by the City by reason of traffic conditions,
public safety, street abandonment, freeway and street construction, change or
establishment of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, gas or water
pipes, or any other type of public structures or improvements which are not
used to compete with the Granteeâ€™s services. The Grantee shall in all cases
have the right of abandonment of its property.
113.08 RELOCATION FOR A THIRD PARTY.
The Grantee shall, on the request of any person holding a lawful permit issued
by the City, protect, support, raise, lower, temporarily disconnect, relocate
in or remove from the public way as necessary any property of the Grantee,
provided: (i) the expense of such is paid by said person benefiting from the
relocation, including, if required by the Grantee, making such payment in
advance; and (ii) the Grantee is given reasonable advance written notice to
prepare for such changes. For purposes of this subsection, â€œreasonable advance
written noticeâ€ shall be no less than 30 business days in the event of a
temporary relocation, and no less than 120 days for a permanent relocation.
113.09 TRIMMING OF TREES AND SHRUBBERY.
The Grantee shall have the authority to trim trees or other natural growth in
order to access and maintain the cable system.
113.10 SAFETY REQUIREMENTS.
Construction, operation, and maintenance of the cable system shall be performed
in an orderly and workmanlike manner. All such work shall be performed in
substantial accordance with generally applicable federal, State, and local
regulations and the National Electric Safety Code.
113.11 UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION.
In those areas of the service area where all of the transmission or
distribution facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone
communications and electric services are underground, the Grantee likewise
shall construct, operate, and maintain its cable system underground. Nothing
contained in this section shall require the Grantee to construct, operate, and
maintain underground any ground- mounted appurtenances.
113.12 ACCESS TO OPEN TRENCHES.
The City agrees to include the Grantee in the platting process for any new
subdivision. At a minimum, the City agrees to require as a condition of issuing
a permit for open trenching to any utility or developer that: (i) the utility
or developer give the Grantee at least ten daysâ€™ advance written notice of the
availability of the open trench; and (ii) the utility or developer provide the
Grantee with reasonable access to the open trench. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Grantee shall not be required to utilize any open trench.
113.13 REQUIRED EXTENSIONS OF THE CABLE SYSTEM.
Grantee agrees to provide cable service to all residences in the service area
subject to the density requirements specified in this subsection. Whenever the
Grantee receives a request for cable service from a potential subscriber in an
unserved area contiguous to Granteeâ€™s existing distribution facilities where
there are at least 10 residences within 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet (one-
quarter cable mile) from the portion of the Granteeâ€™s trunk or distribution
cable which is to be extended, it shall extend its cable system to such
subscribers at no cost to said subscribers for the cable system extension,
other than the published standard/nonstandard installation fees charged to all
subscribers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to extend the cable system into any portion of the
service area where another operator is providing cable service, into any
annexed area which is not contiguous to the present service area of the
Grantee, or into any area which is financially or technically infeasible due to
extraordinary, circumstances, such as a runway or freeway crossing.
113.14 SUBSCRIBER CHARGES FOR EXTENSIONS.
No subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily. However, if an area does
not meet the density requirements of Section
113.13 above, the Grantee shall only be required to extend the cable system to
subscribers in that area if the subscribers are willing to share the capital
costs of extending the cable system. Specifically, the Grantee shall contribute
a capital amount equal to the construction cost per mile, multiplied by a
fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of residences per 1,320
cable-bearing strand feet from the Granteeâ€™s trunk or distribution cable, and
whose denominator equals 10. Subscribers who request service hereunder shall
bear the remaining cost to extend the cable system on a pro rata basis. The
Grantee may require that payment of the capital contribution in aid of
construction borne by such potential subscribers be paid in advance.
Subscribers shall also be responsible for any standard/nonstandard installation
charges to extend the cable system from the tap to the residence.
113.15 CABLE SERVICE TO PUBLIC BUILDINGS.
1.Â Â Â The Grantee, upon request, shall provide without charge, a standard
installation and one outlet of family basic cable to those administrative
buildings owned and occupied by the City (e.g., City Hall, Library, Convention
Center, Wellness Center, Weidler Community Service Center, Street Building,
Water Building, Waste Water Building, National Guard Armory, Fire Stations,
police stations, etc.), and K-12 public and Gehlen schools that are passed by
its cable system. The cable service provided shall not be distributed beyond
the originally installed outlet without authorization from the Grantee. The
cable service provided shall not be used for commercial purposes, and such
outlets shall not be located in areas open to the public. The City shall take
reasonable precautions to prevent any inappropriate use of the Granteeâ€™s cable
system or any loss or damage to Granteeâ€™s cable system. The City shall hold the
Grantee harmless from any and all liability or claims arising out of the
provision and use of cable service required by this subsection. The Grantee
shall not be required to provide an outlet to such buildings where a
nonstandard installation is required, unless the City or building owner/
occupant agrees to pay the incremental cost of any necessary cable system
extension and/or nonstandard installation. If additional outlets of basic cable
are provided to such buildings, the building owner/occupant shall pay the usual
installation and service fees associated therewith.
2.Â Â Â The Grantee shall activate and assign one channel on the cable system to
the full-time non-commercial transmission of public, education and governmental
(PEG) programming to be determined and carried out at the sole discretion of
the City. The City may request and the Grantee shall provide a second channel
for the use of PEG programming but not until the City can demonstrate that the
first channel assigned to PEG programming is used on an average of eight hours
per day with not less than five hours each week being new programming. Upon
reasonable request by the Grantee, the City shall provide a written report
describing the use and programming of said PEG access channel or channels.
3.Â Â Â The Grantee shall provide ongoing capital support for public, educational,
and governmental access equipment and facilities in the amount of twenty cents
per subscriber per month for the entire term of the franchise payable in the
same manner as the franchise fee payment pursuant to this chapter. The Grantee
acknowledges that this amount shall not be considered gross revenues subject to
the payment of franchise fees pursuant to this chapter. Furthermore, payments
of this ongoing support shall not be deemed to be â€œfranchise feesâ€ within the
meaning of Section 622 of the Cable Act and such payment shall not be deemed to
be â€œpayments-in-kindâ€ or any involuntary payments chargeable against the
compensation to be paid to the City by Grantee pursuant to this chapter.
Grantee shall be allowed to collect such fee as a pass-through to cable
subscribers. The City shall indemnify the Grantee for all programming provided
on the access channel and hold the Grantee harmless from any claims by any
person that the PEG Capital Support Grant violates applicable law.
4.Â Â Â In addition to two existing locations, Le Mars Public High School and Le
Mars City Council Chambers, Grantee agrees to establish three additional
locations for a total of five locations within the service area to the cable
system, such new locations to be identified and approved by the City, that will
be capable of communication to the head end for further distribution throughout
the cable system of audio and video signals. Said locations are intended to
serve as remote points from which live and taped PEG programming can be
transmitted via the cable system and the PEG access channels. The City and
Grantee agree to negotiate in good faith to identify further specifics
regarding the location and use of the three new locations.
113.16 FRANCHISE FEE.
1.Â Â Â The Grantee shall pay to the City a franchise fee of five percent of
annual gross revenues (as defined in Section
113.01 of this chapter). In accordance with the Cable Act, the 12-month period
applicable under the franchise for the computation of the franchise fee shall
be a calendar year. The franchise fee payment shall be due annually and payable
within 90 days after the close of the preceding calendar year. Each payment
shall be accompanied by a brief report prepared by a representative of the
Grantee showing the basis for the computation.
2.Â Â Â Limitation on Franchise Fee Actions. The period of limitation for recovery
by the City of any franchise fee payable hereunder shall be three years from
the date on which payment by the Grantee is due to the City.
3.Â Â Â Rates and Charges. The City may regulate rates for the provision of basic
cable and equipment as expressly permitted by federal law.
4.Â Â Â Renewal of Franchise.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The City and the Grantee agree that any proceedings undertaken by the
City that relate to the renewal of the Granteeâ€™s franchise shall be governed by
and comply with the renewal provisions of federal law.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In addition to the procedures set forth in the Cable Act, the City
agrees to notify the Grantee of all of its assessments regarding the identity
of future cable-related community needs and interests, as well as the past
performance of the Grantee under the then-current franchise term. The City
further agrees that such assessments shall be provided to the Grantee promptly
so that the Grantee has adequate time to submit a proposal pursuant to the
Cable Act and complete renewal of the franchise prior to expiration of its
term.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this subsection,
the Grantee and the City agree that at any time during the term of the then-
current franchise, while affording the public appropriate notice and
opportunity to comment in accordance with the provisions of federal law, the
City and the Grantee may agree to undertake and finalize informal negotiations
regarding renewal of the then-current franchise and the City may grant a
renewal thereof.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The Grantee and the City consider the terms set forth in this
subsection to be consistent with the express renewal provisions of the Cable
Act.
5.Â Â Â Conditions of Sale. If a renewal or extension of the Granteeâ€™s franchise
is denied or the franchise is lawfully terminated, and the City either lawfully
acquires ownership of the cable system or by its actions lawfully effects a
transfer of ownership of the cable system to another party, any such
acquisition or transfer shall be at the price determined pursuant to the
provisions set forth in Section 627 of the Cable Act. The Grantee and the City
agree that in the case of a final determination of a lawful revocation of the
franchise, the Grantee shall be given at least 12 months to effectuate a
transfer of its cable system to a qualified third party. Furthermore, the
Grantee shall be authorized to continue to operate pursuant to the terms of its
prior franchise during this period. If, at the end of that time, the Grantee is
unsuccessful in procuring a qualified transferee or assignee of its cable
system which is reasonably acceptable to the City, the Grantee and the City may
avail themselves of any rights they may have pursuant to federal or State law.
It is further agreed that the Granteeâ€™s continued operation of the cable system
during the 12-month period shall not be deemed to be a waiver or an
extinguishment of any rights of either the City or the Grantee.
6.Â Â Â Transfer of Franchise. The Granteeâ€™s right, title, or interest in the
franchise shall not be sold, transferred, assigned, or otherwise encumbered,
other than to an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with the Grantee, without prior written notice to the City. No such notice
shall be required, however, for a transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other
hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title, or interest of the
Grantee in the franchise or cable system in order to secure indebtedness.
113.17 BOOKS AND RECORDS.
The Grantee agrees that the City, upon 30 daysâ€™ written notice to the Grantee
and no more than once annually may review such of its books and records at the
Granteeâ€™s business office, during normal business hours and on a non-disruptive
basis, as is reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of this
chapter. Such notice shall specifically reference the subsection of this
chapter which is under review, so that the Grantee may organize the necessary
books and records for easy access by the City. Alternatively, if the books and
records are not easily accessible at the local office of the Grantee, the
Grantee may, at its sole option, choose to pay the reasonable travel costs of
the Cityâ€™s representative to view the books and records at the appropriate
location. The Grantee shall not be required to maintain any books and records
for franchise compliance purposes longer than three years. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Grantee shall not be required to
disclose information which it reasonably deems to be proprietary or
confidential in nature, or disclose books and records of any affiliate which is
not providing cable service in the service area. The City agrees to treat any
information disclosed by the Grantee as confidential and only to disclose it to
employees, representatives, and agents thereof that have a need to know, or in
order to enforce the provisions hereof. The Grantee shall not be required to
provide subscriber information in violation of Section 631 of the Cable Act.
113.18 INSURANCE AND INDEMNIFICATION.
1.Â Â Â Insurance Requirements. The Grantee shall maintain in full force and
effect, at its own cost and expense, during the term of the Franchise,
Commercial General Liability Insurance in the amount of $1,000,000 combined
single limit for bodily injury and property damage. The City shall be
designated as an additional insured. Such insurance shall be non- cancelable
except upon 30 daysâ€™ prior written notice to the City. Upon written request,
the Grantee shall provide a Certificate of Insurance showing evidence of the
coverage required by this subsection.
2.Â Â Â Indemnification. The Grantee agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless,
and defend the City, its officers, boards and employees, from and against any
liability for damages and for any liability or claims resulting from property
damage or bodily injury (including accidental death), which arise out of the
Granteeâ€™s construction, operation, or maintenance of its cable system in the
service area provided that the City shall give the Grantee written notice of
its obligation to indemnify the City within ten days of receipt of a claim or
action pursuant to this subsection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee
shall not indemnify the City for any damages, liability, or claims resulting
from the willful misconduct or negligence of the City.
113.19 ENFORCEMENT AND TERMINATION OF FRANCHISE.
1.Â Â Â Notice of Violation. In the event that the City believes that the Grantee
has not complied with the terms of the franchise, the City shall informally
discuss the matter with Grantee. If these discussions do not lead to resolution
of the problem, the City shall notify the Grantee in writing of the exact
nature of the alleged noncompliance.
2.Â Â Â The Granteeâ€™s Right to Cure or Respond. The Grantee shall have 30 days
from receipt of the notice described in Subsection 1: (i) to respond to the
City, contesting the assertion of noncompliance; or (ii) to cure such default;
or (iii) in the event that, by the nature of default, such default cannot be
cured within the 30-day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such
default and notify the City of the steps being taken and the projected date
that they will be completed.
3.Â Â Â Public Hearing. In the event that the Grantee fails to respond to the
notice described in Subsection 1 pursuant to the procedures set forth in
Subsection 2, or in the event that the alleged default is not remedied within
30 days or the date projected pursuant to paragraph 2(iii) above, if it intends
to continue its investigation into the default, then the City shall schedule a
public hearing. The City shall provide the Grantee at least 10 daysâ€™ prior
written notice of such hearing, which specifies the time, place, and purpose of
such hearing, and provide the Grantee the opportunity to be heard.
4.Â Â Â Enforcement. Subject to applicable federal and State law, in the event the
City, after the hearing set forth in Subsection 3, determines that the Grantee
is in default of any provision of the franchise, the City may:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Seek specific performance of any provision, which reasonably lends
itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages; or
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other equitable
relief; or
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the
franchise, seek to revoke the franchise in accordance with Subsection 5.
5.Â Â Â Revocation. Should the City seek to revoke the franchise after following
the procedures set forth in Subsections 1 through 4 above, the City shall give
written notice to the Grantee of its intent. The notice shall set forth the
exact nature of the noncompliance. The Grantee shall have 90 days from such
notice to object in writing and to state its reasons for such objection. In the
event the City has not received a satisfactory response from the Grantee, it
may then seek termination of the franchise at a public hearing. The City shall
cause to be served upon the Grantee, at least 30 days prior to such public
hearing, a written notice specifying the time and place of such hearing and
stating its intent to revoke the franchise. At the designated hearing, Grantee
shall be provided a fair opportunity for full participation, including the
right to be represented by legal counsel, to introduce relevant evidence, to
require the production of evidence, to compel the relevant testimony of the
officials, agents, employees, or consultants of the City, to compel the
testimony of other persons as permitted by law, and to question witnesses. A
complete verbatim record and transcript shall be made of such hearing.
Following the hearing, the City shall determine whether or not the franchise
shall be revoked. If the City determines that the franchise shall be revoked,
the City shall promptly provide Grantee with its decision in writing. The
Grantee may appeal such determination of the City to an appropriate court which
shall have the power to review the decision of the City de novo. Grantee shall
be entitled to such relief as the court finds appropriate. Such appeal must be
taken within 60 days of Granteeâ€™s receipt of the determination of the City. The
City may, at its sole discretion, take any lawful action which it deems
appropriate to enforce the Cityâ€™s rights under the franchise in lieu of
revocation of the franchise.
6.Â Â Â Force Majeure. The Grantee shall not be held in default under, or in
noncompliance with, the provisions of the franchise, or suffer any enforcement
or penalty relating to noncompliance or default, where such noncompliance or
alleged defaults occurred or were caused by circumstances reasonably beyond the
ability of the Grantee to anticipate and control. This provision includes work
delays caused by waiting for utility providers to service or monitor their
utility poles to which the Granteeâ€™s cable system is attached, as well as

The following words when used in this chapter shall have the meanings:
1.Â Â Â â€œDangerous or dilapidated structureâ€ means:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any building, shed, fence or other man-made structure which is

of disease; or which may cause injury to the health of the occupants of it or
neighboring structures.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Any building, shed, fence or other man-made structure which, because of
faulty construction, age, lack of proper repair or any other cause, constitutes
or creates a fire hazard.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Any building, shed, fence or other man-made structure which, by reason
of faulty construction or any other cause, is liable to cause injury or damage
by its collapsing or by the collapse or fall of all or any part of such
structure.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Any building, shed, fence or other man-made structure which, because of
its condition or because of lack of doors or windows, is available to or
frequented by persons who are not lawful occupants of such structure.
3.Â Â Â â€œImminently dangerous structureâ€ is any building, shed, fence or other

145.02 BUILDING MAINTENANCE STANDARDS.
The exterior of every structure on every property shall be maintained in good
repair, to the end that the structure will be preserved; adjoining properties
protected from blighting influences; and safety and fire hazards eliminated.
1.Â Â Â Standards. All buildings shall be maintained to be weather and water
tight. Broken windows, holes in roofs, and missing siding shall be replaced
with similar materials to maintain the weather and water tight properties of
the structure. All wood including floor boards, decking, subfloors, joists,
rafters, roof sheeting, and siding shall be replaced when missing, rotted or
damaged. Materials and practices used in reconstruction and residing shall be
of standard quality and appearance commensurate with the character of house or
building. Owners or responsible parties shall not use materials which would
depreciate the value of adjoining premises or neighborhood. Painted surfaces
shall be maintained or repainted so that an individual wall surface does not
have peeling or missing paint in area in excess of 50 percent of that
individual surface area.
2.Â Â Â Maintenance Standards Violation. A violation of this section shall
constitute a municipal infraction subject to penalties outlined in
Chapter 4 of this Code of Ordinances.
3.Â Â Â Enforcement. All inspections and enforcement actions shall be under the
Code Enforcement Officer.
4.Â Â Â Notice. When it is determined by the Code Enforcement Officer that a
property is in violation of this section, the Code Enforcement Officer may
serve upon the owner of the property a notice to remedy. The following methods
of notice shall be deemed adequate:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â By personal service upon the owner of the property in which the
violation exists.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If, after reasonable effort, personal service cannot be made, service
shall be made by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known
owner.
5.Â Â Â Abatement. In the event that the violation is not abated as ordered and
within the time specified, the City may abate such violation by undertaking
such abatement and assessing the costs thereof against the property.
145.03 DANGEROUS AND DILAPIDATED STRUCTURE PROCEDURE AND REMEDY.
Whenever the inspecting official determines that any structure is a dangerous
or dilapidated structure, the inspecting official shall:
1.Â Â Â Cause to be posted in a conspicuous place on the structure a notice which
shall read substantially as follows: â€œDanger â€” Unsafe or Unfit Structure.â€ Such
notice shall remain posted until the required repairs, removal or demolition is
completed. Such notice shall not be removed except by the inspecting official
or by the inspecting officialâ€™s written permission and no persons shall enter a
building except for the purpose of making the required repairs, removal or
demolition.
2.Â Â Â Cause to be served upon the owner thereof and the occupants, if any, a
written notice which shall contain:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The street address and a legal description sufficient for
identification of the premises upon which the structure is located.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A statement that the inspecting official has found the structure to be
a dangerous or dilapidated structure with a description of the conditions found
to render the structure dangerous under the provisions of this section.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â That the structure must be vacated by all occupants within a specified
time, which shall be reasonable under the circumstances.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â A statement of the corrective action to be taken as determined by the
inspecting official including a time for commencing and completing such
corrective action. All repair or modification or demolition work ordered shall
be commenced within a reasonable time not to exceed 30 days from the date of
the notice and to be completed within a reasonable time not to exceed six
months from the date of the notice. Corrective action may include repair,
removal or demolition, as determined by the inspecting official.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â A statement that if the required repair, modification or demolition
work is not commenced within the time specified, the City may cause the
structure to be demolished and will assess all costs thereof in accordance with
State law. A statement that the inspecting official will report the failure of
the owner to repair, modify or demolish the structure to the Council; that the
Council will conduct a public hearing on the report and may order the City
Administrator to proceed with demolition of the structure and thereafter assess
all the costs of demolition against the property and to the owner; that the
owner may file written objections with the Clerk or appear at the public
hearing and be heard orally in relation to the matter; and the date, time and
place of the public hearing before the Council.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â A statement of the right to appeal the notice in writing to the City
Administrator, within 15 days of the date of notice. However, a notice to
demolish a structure shall not be subject to an appeal when said notice is
given subsequent to a notice to repair or modify and such repairs or
modifications have not been completed.
3.Â Â Â Such notice may be in the form of an ordinance or by certified mail to the
property owner as shown by the records of the County Auditor and to the
occupants, if any, and shall state the time within which action is required.
However, in an emergency, the City may perform any action which may be required
under this section without prior notice and assess the costs as provided by
law, after notice to the property owner and hearing.
4.Â Â Â The inspecting official shall file a copy of such written notice with the
County Recorder.
145.04 TIME FOR COMPLIANCE.
Any structure which shall have been posted with a notice that it is unsafe or
unfit shall immediately be made as safe, secure and free from dangers to others
as is possible pending repair or demolition. When the corrective action
required is repair or modification, the owner of the premises shall, within 30
days of the date of notice, file a sworn statement of intention, with plans and
financial reports as may be requested by the inspecting official to assure such
intention, to repair, or modify the structure as required for compliance with
the provisions of intention. The owner shall within 60 days of the date of
notice, commence actual repairs or modifications as required and as stated in
the sworn statement of intention. The owner shall, within a reasonable time
determined by the inspecting official but not to exceed six months from the
date of notice, complete such repairs or modifications as stated and required.
When the corrective action required is the demolition of the structure, the
owner of the premises shall, within 15 days of the date of notice, commence
said demolition; and shall, within a reasonable time determined by the
inspecting official but not to exceed 60 days from the date of notice complete
such demolition as stated and required. The Board of Housing Appeals may grant
one extension of time to comply with an order to repair or modify or demolish a
structure when the owner affirmatively shows the financial ability to perform
the work; and the work, through no fault of the owner, cannot be completed
within the time provided. Such extension shall be for a reasonable period of
time not to exceed 90 days for repairs or modifications and not to exceed 60
days for demolition.
145.05 REMOVAL OF POSTED NOTICE.
No person shall deface, cover, obliterate, or remove the notice posted pursuant
to Section
145.03 from any structure which has been so posted by the inspecting official
as unsafe or unfit, except as provided in this section. No such structure shall
again be occupied or used until such posted notice is removed by the inspecting
official. The inspecting official shall remove such posted notice when the
defect or defects which caused the posted notice have been eliminated, or when
the demolition or removal of the structure is commenced.
145.06 SERVICE BY PUBLIC UTILITIES.
After the date for the vacation of the structure, it is unlawful for any public
utilities corporation or company to furnish gas or electrical service to any
structure which has been posted with notice by the inspecting official as
unsafe or unfit, when the inspecting official in his or her discretion has
notified the public utilities corporation or company in writing of his or her
action in posting the structure as of the date and services shall be
discontinued. The utility service shall not be restored to a posted structure
until notice in writing is received from the inspecting official authorizing
the restoration of service to be used in connection with the revocation, repair
or remodeling of the structure to comply with the provisions of this chapter.
The inspecting official shall give such written authorization for the
restoration of service when the posted notice is removed pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter.
145.07 DEMOLITION.
1.Â Â Â When the owner fails to commence or complete the required repairs, removal
or demolition within the specified time period, the inspecting official shall
report the ownerâ€™s failure to the Council.
2.Â Â Â The Council shall then hold a hearing and may, by resolution authorize the
inspecting official to demolish the structure or take such other action it
deems appropriate, including the granting of a stay.
3.Â Â Â Upon passage of such resolution, the inspecting official shall file a
certified copy of such resolution with the County Recorder.
145.08 ACCESS FOR DEMOLITION; PENALTIES.
The owner of the structure who has received the report of the intent of the
inspecting official to demolish, shall give entry and free access to the agent
and the inspecting official for the purpose of demolition. Any owner who
refuses, impedes, interferes with or hinders or obstructs entry by such agent
pursuant to a notice of intention to demolish shall be subject to the municipal
infraction penalties of this code in Section
4.03.
145.09 GRADING OF PREMISES AFTER DEMOLITION.
Whenever the premises is demolished, whether carried out by the owner, or by
the inspecting official, such demolition shall include the filing of the
excavation on which the demolished premises was located in such manner as to
eliminate all potential danger to the public health, safety, or welfare arising
from such excavation.
145.10 EXTERMINATION PROCEDURE BEFORE DEMOLITION.
All demolition shall be preceded by an inspection of the premises by the
inspecting official to determine whether or not extermination procedures are
necessary. If the premises are found to be infested, appropriate rat
extermination to prevent the spread of rats to adjoining or other areas shall
be instituted before, during and after demolition.
145.11 BIDS FOR DEMOLITION; BID OPENING; AWARD OF CONTRACT.
The inspecting official shall commence demolition as follows:
1.Â Â Â When the estimated cost of demolition, in the opinion of the appropriate
authority, is $5,000.00 or more, the work shall be done under contract and the
inspecting official shall seek sealed bids as near in form and manner as those
used in contracts for street improvements. If no bids are received, the
inspecting official may negotiate a contract with a qualified contractor. Bids,
if any, shall be opened in the office of the inspecting official.
2.Â Â Â When the estimated cost of demolition, in the opinion of the inspecting
official, is less than $5,000.00, the work shall be done under contract and the
inspecting official shall seek sealed bids in a manner he or she deems
appropriate or shall negotiate a contract with a qualified contractor. Bids, if
any, shall be opened in the office of the inspecting official.
3.Â Â Â A contract for demolition pursuant to Subsection 1 of this section shall
be awarded by resolution of the City Council.
4.Â Â Â A contract for demolition pursuant to Subsection 2 of this section shall
be awarded by the City Administrator.
145.12 STAY OF DEMOLITION; BOND.
1.Â Â Â The owner, or any interested person, may request a delay in the demolition
of a structure at the time of the hearing on resolution authorizing demolition.
Such request shall be made in writing. The Council may grant such request
properly before it when in its opinion it is practical, economical and
structurally possible to rehabilitate the structure to comply with this code.
2.Â Â Â No stay granted shall be effective, however, unless and until such person
signs a written agreement with the City wherein the person agrees:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â To make all of the necessary repairs to bring the structure to current
code standards within a time not to exceed 60 days of the date the stay is
granted.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â To grant the City the right to award a contract and to enter in and
upon such premises for the purposes of demolishing same upon the failure of the
person to make such necessary repairs within the agreed upon time period; and
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Agrees to pay the City a per diem, in an agreed upon amount, which
shall serve as reimbursement to the City for administrative and monitoring
expenses for each day such person requests a delay in City demolition beyond
the period of time established for the repair of the structure under the
agreement; and such person files a performance bond with the City in the
estimated cost of demolition, as determined by the inspecting official, and in
an amount sufficient to assure payment of the per diem reimbursement to the
City. In no event shall the portion of the bond attributable to the cost of
demolition be less than $1,000.00, nor shall the portion of the bond
attributable to the per diem reimbursement be less than $1,000.00. The bond
shall be conditioned upon the person performing the repairs within the agreed
upon time period, together with, written extensions thereto, and conditioned
upon payment of the per diem reimbursement as same shall become due. Upon such
personâ€™s failure to make all of the repairs in a manner acceptable to the City
within the agreed upon time period, together with written extensions thereto,
the inspecting official may proceed to demolish the structure without further
notice.
3.Â Â Â The proceeds of the bond given pursuant to this section, if any, shall be
applied by the City Treasurer first against any unpaid per diem reimbursement
and then against the assessment for demolition.
145.13 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES.
Whenever the inspecting official determines that any structure in the City is
an imminently dangerous structure, the inspecting official shall notify the
owner of said structure by any reasonable means, including telephonic means,
and allow the owner a reasonable period of time, as determined by the
inspecting official, in which to make the structure safe or to commence and
complete demolition of the structure. Upon the failure or refusal of the owner
to make the structure safe or to commence or complete demolition within the
time period provided, the inspecting official shall proceed at once to make
safe the structure or to demolish the structure. In the event the work is
performed by the City, the costs of same shall be assessed against the
property.
145.14 ASSESSMENT OF COSTS.
Upon completion of demolition the inspecting official shall report to the
Council the actual cost of demolition, grading, extermination, serving of
notices, plus twenty percent of the total of said amounts to compensate for the
cost of supervision and administration by the City. The Council may then
proceed to assess said costs against the property pursuant to the provisions of
Section 364.12 of the Code of the State of Iowa.

safety, public welfare, character and environment of the City and its
inhabitants. The City also recognizes that facilitating the development of
wireless service technology can be an economic development asset to the City
and of significant benefit to the City and its residents. In order to insure
that the placement, construction or modification of wireless telecommunications
facilities is consistent with the Cityâ€™s land use policies, the City is
adopting a single, comprehensive, wireless telecommunications facilities
application and permit process. The intent of this local ordinance is to
minimize impact of wireless telecommunications facilities, establish a fair and
efficient process for review and approval of applications, assure an
integrated, comprehensive review of environmental impacts of such facilities,
and establish fair leases and protect the health, safety and welfare of the
City of Le Mars, Iowa.

wireless telecommunications facilities protects the Cityâ€™s health, safety,
public welfare, environmental features, the nature and character of the
community and neighborhood and other aspects of the quality of life
specifically listed elsewhere in this chapter, the City hereby adopts an
overall policy with respect to a special use permit for wireless
telecommunications facilities for the express purpose of achieving the
following goals:
1.Â Â Â Requiring a special use permit for any new, co-location or modification of
a Wireless Telecommunications Facility.
2.Â Â Â Implementing an application process for person(s) seeking a special use
permit for wireless telecommunications facilities;
3.Â Â Â Establishing a policy for examining an application for and issuing a
special use permit for wireless telecommunications facilities that is both fair
and consistent.
4.Â Â Â Promoting and encouraging, wherever possible, the sharing and/or co-
location of wireless telecommunications facilities among service providers.
5.Â Â Â Promoting and encouraging, wherever possible, the placement, height and
quantity of wireless telecommunications facilities in such a manner, including
but not limited to the use of stealth technology, to minimize adverse aesthetic
and visual impacts on the land, property, buildings, and other facilities
adjacent to, surrounding, and in generally the same area as the requested
location of such Wireless Telecommunications Facilities, which shall mean using
the least visually and physically intrusive facility that is not
technologically or commercially impracticable under the facts and
circumstances.
6.Â Â Â That in granting a special use permit, the City has found that the
facility shall be the most appropriate site as regards being the least visually
intrusive among those available in the City.

obtaining a lease from the City.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â No lease for the use of public property shall be granted without
requiring the lessee thereof to pay a reasonable and competitively neutral fee
for the use of that public property.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â No lease for the use of public property shall be granted for a term of
more than one year or as approved by the Council.
2.Â Â Â Placement of Facilities and Related Lease Fees. The placement and
maintenance of communications antennas or towers on City-owned sites, such as
water towers and parks, will be allowed when the following additional
requirements are met.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Water Tower or Reservoir Sites. The Cityâ€™s water tower and reservoir
represent a large public investment in water pressure stabilization and peak
capacity reserves. Therefore, its protection is of prime importance. As access
to the Cityâ€™s water storage system increases, so does the potential for
contamination of the public water supply. For these reasons, the placement of
communications towers or antennas on water towers or reservoir sites will be
allowed only when the following requirements are met:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The applicant must have written approval from the Water
Superintendent each time access to the facility is desired. This will minimize
the risk of contamination to the water supply.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â There is sufficient room on the structure and/or the grounds to
accommodate the applicantâ€™s facility.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The presence of the facility will not increase the water tower or
reservoir maintenance cost to the City.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The presence of the facility will not be harmful to the health or
safety of the workers maintaining the water tower or reservoir.
The fees assessed for placing facilities on a City water tower shall be as set
by resolution of the Council.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Parks. The presence of certain communications antennas or towers
represents a potential conflict with the purpose of certain City-owned parks
and recreational facilities. Towers shall be prohibited in designated
conservation areas. Communications antennas or towers will be considered only
in the following parks after the recommendation of the Parks and Recreation
Committee and approval of the Council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Public parks of a sufficient scale and character that are adjacent
to an existing commercial or industrial use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Commercial recreational areas and major ball fields.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Park maintenance facilities.
The fees assessed for placing facilities on park property shall be as set by
resolution of the Council.
3.Â Â Â Termination. The Council may terminate any lease if it is determined that
any one of the following conditions exist.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A potential user with a higher priority cannot find another adequate
location and the potential use would be incompatible with the existing use.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A userâ€™s frequency broadcast unreasonably interferes with other users
of higher priority, regardless of whether or not this interference was
adequately predicted in the technical analysis.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â A user violates any of the standards in this chapter or the conditions
attached to the Cityâ€™s lease agreement.
Before taking action, the City will provide notice to the user of the intended
termination and the reasons for it, and provide an opportunity for a hearing
before the Council regarding the proposed action. This procedure need not be
followed in emergency situations.
154.12 HEIGHT OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWER(S).
1.Â Â Â The applicant shall submit documentation justifying the total height of
any tower, facility and/or antenna requested and the basis therefor.
Documentation in the form of propagation studies must include all backup data
used to perform at requested height and a minimum of 10 feet lower height to
allow verification of this height need. Such documentation will be analyzed in
the context of the justification of the height needed to provide service
primarily and essentially within the City, to the extent practicable, unless
good cause is shown.
2.Â Â Â No tower constructed after the effective date of this chapter, including
allowing for all attachments, shall exceed that height which shall permit
operation without required artificial lighting of any kind in accordance with
City, State, and/or any federal statute, law, local law, City Ordinance, code,
rule or regulation.
154.13 VISIBILITY OF WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.
1.Â Â Â Wireless telecommunications facilities shall not be artificially lighted
or marked, except as required by law.

such a manner that they are readily accessible only to persons authorized to
operate or service them.
154.15 SIGNAGE.
Wireless telecommunications facilities shall contain a sign no larger than four
square feet in order to provide adequate notification to persons in the
immediate area of the presence of RF radiation or to control exposure to RF
radiation within a given area. A sign of the same size is also to be installed
to contain the name(s) of the owner(s) and operator(s) of the antenna(s) as
well as emergency phone number(s). The sign shall be on the equipment shelter
or cabinet of the applicant and be visible from the access point of the site
and must identify the equipment owner of the shelter or cabinet. On tower
sites, an FCC registration site as applicable is also to be present. The signs
shall not be lighted, unless applicable law, rule or regulation requires
lighting. No other signage, including advertising, shall be permitted.
154.16 LOT SIZE AND SETBACKS.
All proposed towers and any other proposed wireless telecommunications facility
structures shall be set back from abutting parcels, recorded rights-of- way and

160.02 STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
1.Â Â Â The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 414, Code of Iowa, as
amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure
safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
2.Â Â Â Findings of Fact.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation
which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of
the community.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by:
(i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
3.Â Â Â Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Paragraph 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows so
that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
1.Â Â Â Lands to Which Chapter Applies. The provisions of this chapter shall apply
to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City shown on the Official
Floodplain Zoning Map as being within the boundaries of the Floodway, Floodway
Fringe, and General Floodplain, (Overlay) Districts, as established in this
section.
2.Â Â Â Establishment of Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The Flood Insurance Rate
Maps (FIRM) for Plymouth County and Incorporated Areas, the City of Le Mars,
Panels 19149C0284E, 0287E, 0288E, 0289E, 0291E, 0292E, 0293E, 0294E, 0477E,
dated October 27, 2022, which were prepared as part of the Flood Insurance
Study for Plymouth County are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be
the Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The flood profiles and all explanatory

to flood damage.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â No development shall affect the capacity or conveyance of the channel
or floodway of any tributary to the main stream, drainage ditch, or any other
drainage facility or system.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Structures, buildings, recreational vehicles and sanitary and utility
systems, if permitted, shall meet the applicable performance standards of the
Floodway Fringe District and shall be constructed or aligned to present the
minimum possible resistance to flood flows.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Structures, if permitted, shall have a low flood damage potential and
shall not be for human habitation.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Storage of materials or equipment that are buoyant, flammable,
explosive or injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited. Storage of
other material may be allowed if readily removable from the Floodway District
within the time available after flood warning.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Watercourse alterations or relocations (channel changes and
modifications) must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within
the altered or relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations
must be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Any fill allowed in the floodway must be shown to have some beneficial
purpose and shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Pipeline river or stream crossings shall be buried in the streambed and
banks or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due to channel
degradation and meandering or due to the action of flood flows.
160.07 FLOODWAY FRINGE (OVERLAY) DISTRICT FF.
1.Â Â Â Permitted Uses. All development within the Floodway Fringe District shall
be permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance
(or underlying zoning district) and provided they meet applicable performance
standards of the Floodway Fringe District.
2.Â Â Â Performance Standards. All development must be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance standards.
Where base flood elevation data has not been provided on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to
compute such data. Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no development
may increase the base flood elevation more than one (1) foot. The applicant
will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with
sufficient technical information to make such determination.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All development shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood

to flood damage.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the base flood elevation. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed where existing topography,
street grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the
methods used must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the
various forces and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential
structures located in areas that would become isolated due to flooding of
surrounding ground shall be provided with a means of access that will be
passable by wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this criterion
shall not apply where the Floodplain Administrator determines there is
sufficient flood warning time for the protection of life and property. When
estimating flood warning time, consideration shall be given to the criteria
listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa Administrative Code.

elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Storage of Equipment and Materials. Storage of equipment and materials
that are flammable, explosive, or injurious to human, animal, or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or:
(i) not subject to major flood damage and anchored to prevent movement due to
flood waters; or (ii) readily removable from the area within the time available
after flood warning.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as
levees, flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the base
flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for
adequate interior drainage. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources
shall approve structural flood control works.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must be
designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources must
approve such alterations or relocations.

subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the base flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50 lots
(whichever is less) shall include base flood elevation data for those areas
located within the Floodway Fringe (Overlay) District.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Accessory Structures to Residential Uses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Detached garages, sheds, and similar structures that are incidental
to a residential use are exempt from the base flood elevation requirements
where the following criteria are satisfied.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential. Its size shall not exceed 600 square feet in size. Those portions of
the structure located less than one foot above the base flood elevation must be
constructed of flood-resistant materials.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage potential
purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure shall not
be used for human habitation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building
site so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The structure shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation,

hereinafter referred to as the Board, is hereby established which shall hear
and decide: (i) appeals; and (ii) requests for variances to the provisions of
this chapter, and shall take any other action which is required of the Board.
2.Â Â Â Appeals. Where it is alleged there is any error in any order, requirement,
decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the
enforcement of this chapter, the aggrieved party may appeal such action. The
notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board and with the official from whom
the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason for the appeal. The
official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to the Board all the
documents constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was
taken.
3.Â Â Â Variance. The Board may authorize upon request in specific cases such
variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances
granted must meet the following applicable standards.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection
for structures than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the applicant
shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Floodplain Administrator
that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance
coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
4.Â Â Â Hearings and Decisions of the Board.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Hearings. Upon the filing with the Board of an appeal or a request for
a variance, the Board shall hold a public hearing. The Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the hearing and give public notice thereof, as well as due
notice to parties in interest. At the hearing, any party may appear in person
or by agent or attorney and present written or oral evidence. The Board may
require the appellant or applicant to provide such information as is reasonably
deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or evaluation of
a professional engineer or other expert person or agency, including the
Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal or
variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an appeal, the Board may, so
long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter,
reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in
writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision.
In granting a variance, the Board shall consider such factors as contained in
this section and all other relevant sections of this chapter and may prescribe
such conditions as contained in Subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board Shall Be Based. In
passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all relevant
factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability
of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the City.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â h.Â Â Â The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development
and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â i.Â Â Â The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for the area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â j.Â Â Â The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â k.Â Â Â The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â l.Â Â Â The cost of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer,
gas, electrical, and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â m.Â Â Â Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors

restrictions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the
flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration,
rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated
with the regulatory flood. The Board shall require that the applicant submit a
plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
5.Â Â Â Appeals to the Court. Any person or persons, jointly or severally,
aggrieved by any decision of the Board may present to a court of record a
petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole

consisting of City staff, two Planning and Zoning Commission members, and one
City Council member.
2.Â Â Â The subdivider shall prepare and file with the City four copies of a
preliminary plat and four copies of restrictive covenants conforming to the
requirements set forth in this chapter. Six copies of the preliminary plat and
restrictive covenants shall be submitted for a subdivision outside the
corporate limits of the City. Said plat shall be accompanied by a fee, as set
by Council resolution, for each lot in the subdivision, providing said
subdivision does not consist of less than 10 lots, in which case a minimum
filing fee, as set by Council resolution, is required.
3.Â Â Â The City shall forthwith refer two copies of the preliminary plat to the
Commission. In the case of subdivisions outside the corporate limits of the
City, the City shall refer two copies of the preliminary plat to the County
Board of Supervisors and keep the County Engineer advised of the status of the
plat and actions taken thereon.
4.Â Â Â A hearing on the proposal will be held before the Commission at a regular
or special meeting following the filing. No hearing shall be held by the
Commission until notice thereof, which shall include the time and place, shall
be given in behalf of the Commission by mailing a notice to the person who
filed the preliminary plat to the address set forth in the filing papers and to
such other interested parties as may be deemed necessary.
5.Â Â Â The City shall carefully examine said preliminary plat as to its
compliance with the laws and regulations of the City, the existing street
system, and good engineering practices and shall, within 15 days, submit
findings in duplicate to the Commission, together with one copy of the plat
received.
6.Â Â Â The Commission, upon receiving the findings, shall, within a reasonable
time, consider said report and pass upon the preliminary plat. It shall then
set forth its recommendations in writing, whether of approval, modification, or
disapproval. In case of modification or disapproval, it shall give its reasons
therefor. The Commission shall forthwith return one copy of the approved
preliminary plat to the subdivider.
7.Â Â Â Upon approval of the preliminary plat by the Commission, the subdivider
may proceed with the preparation of the final plat and detailed construction
drawing and specifications for the improvements required under this chapter.
8.Â Â Â The approval of the preliminary plat by the Commission is revocable and
does not constitute final approval or acceptance of the subdivision by the
Council or authorization to proceed with construction of improvements within
the subdivision, but shall constitute approval of layout and general
engineering proposals and plans.
9.Â Â Â Before submitting the final plat to the Commission for approval, the
subdivider shall furnish all plans and information required by this chapter and
necessary for the detailed engineering consideration for the improvements
required and obtain the approval of the City, which shall be endorsed thereon.
10.Â Â Â For final plat approval, the subdivider shall submit to the Commission:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Six paper copies and one digital copy of the final plat and six copies
of restrictive covenants.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A performance bond as required and approved by the City.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Six paper copies and one digital copy of the certified approved plans,
profiles, cross sections and specifications.
11.Â Â Â When the final plat has been passed upon by the Commission, six copies of
the final plat, and the performance bond, shall forthwith be transmitted to the
Council, together with a certificate showing the action of the Commission.
12.Â Â Â When the final plat has been approved by the Council, the performance
bond accepted and all seven copies duly certified, one copy shall be delivered
to the Clerk and one copy to the Code Enforcement Office for their respective
files, and four copies to the subdivider for filing with the County Recorder.
If said plat is disapproved by the Council, such disapproval shall point out in
writing wherein said proposed plat is objectionable.
13.Â Â Â The passage of the resolution accepting the plat shall constitute final
approval of the platting of the area shown on the final plat, but the owner
shall cause such plat to be recorded in the office of the County Recorder and
shall file satisfactory evidence of such recording in the office of the Clerk
before the City shall recognize the plat as being in full force and effect.
Approval by the Council of the final plat or of a final development plan
subject to the provisions of this chapter governing the subdivision of land
shall be null and void if the plat or final development plan is not recorded
within 180 days after the date of such approval, unless application for an
extension of time is made to the Council, in writing, during said 180-day
period and said application is approved.
14.Â Â Â The final plat shall also be accompanied by the following at the time it
is presented for filing:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A certificate by the owner and spouse, if any, that the subdivision is
with their free consent and is in accordance with the desire of the owner and
spouse. This certificate must be signed and acknowledged by the owner and
spouse before some officer authorized to take the acknowledgments of deeds;

of deeds. An affidavit and bond as provided for in Section 354.12 of the Code
of Iowa may be recorded in lieu of the consent of the mortgage or lienholder.
When a mortgage or lienholder consents to the subdivision, a release of
mortgage or lien shall be recorded for any areas conveyed to the City or

Â 
166.01 DEFINITIONS.
The following definitions shall be utilized for terms as appropriate to the
Ordinance.
1.Â Â Â â€œAir trafficâ€ (FAA FAR Sec. 1.1) means an aircraft operating in the air or
on an airport surface, exclusive of loading ramps and parking areas.
2.Â Â Â â€œAirportâ€ (FAA FAR Sec. 152.3) means any areas of land or water that are
used, or intended for use, for the landing and takeoff of aircraft. Any
appurtenant areas that are used, or intended for use, for airport buildings,
other airport facilities, or rights-of-way; and all airport buildings and
facilities located on the areas specified in this definition. The Le Mars
Municipal Airport is owned by the City of Le Mars.
3.Â Â Â â€œAirport elevationâ€ (FAA AC 150/5190-4A) means the highest point on an
airportâ€™s usable landing area measured in feet from sea level.
4.Â Â Â â€œAirport environsâ€ Means the land use and people in the areas surrounding
an airport which can be directly affected by the operation of the airport.
5.Â Â Â â€œAirport hazardâ€ (FAA FAR Sec. 152.3) means any structure or object of
natural growth located on or in the vicinity of a public airport, or any use of
land near a public airport that obstructs the airspace required for the flight
of aircraft landing or talking off at the airport; or is otherwise hazardous to
aircraft landing or taking off at the airport.
6.Â Â Â â€œAirport layout plan (ALP)â€ (FAA FAR Sec. 152.3) means the plan of an
airport showing the layout of existing and proposed airport facilities.
7.Â Â Â â€œAirport overlay zonesâ€ means a zone intended to place additional land use
conditions on land impacted by the airport while retaining the existing
underlying zone. The FAR Part 77 Surfaces and RPZs have been combined to create
five airport overlay zones. The five specific zones create a comprehensive area
focused on maintaining compatible land use around airports.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Zone A- is intended to provide a clear area that is free of above
ground obstructions and structures. This zone is closest to the individual
runway ends.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Zone B- is a critical overlay surface that reflects the approach and
departure areas for each runway at an airport. The size of Zone B is predicated

166.02 TITLE AND INTRODUCTION.
Le Mars Municipal Airport Land Use & Height Overlay Zoning Ordinance created by
the City of Le Mars and Plymouth County.
This chapter shall regulate and restrict the height of structures, objects, and
growth of natural vegetation, as well as land uses; otherwise regulating the
use of property, within the vicinity of the Le Mars Municipal Airport. Creation
of appropriate zones and establishing the boundaries thereof, as well as
providing for changes in the restrictions and boundaries of such zones is
vested in this chapter. Le Mars Municipal Airport Land Use & Height Zoning Maps
are incorporated into and made part of this chapter. This chapter establishes
the Building Official as first point of contact. Overall oversight and
enforcement of this chapter will be by the City Planning and Zoning Commission.
Variances will be ruled on by the Board of Zoning Adjustment upon review by the
Planning and Zoning Commission.
This chapter amends and replaces the previous airport zoning chapters on file
with the City of Le Mars and Plymouth County associated with the Le Mars
Municipal Airport.
166.03 AUTHORITY.
Iowa Code Section 329.3 Airport Zoning empowers local municipalities to zone
airports including height restrictions and land uses.
166.04 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
The Le Mars Municipal Airport is acknowledged as an essential public facility
to the State of Iowa and the local community. The creation or establishment of
an airport hazard is a public nuisance and poses a potential concern to the
surrounding communities served by the Le Mars Municipal Airport. There shall be
no creation or establishment of a hazard that endangers public health, safety,
welfare, and impacts an individualâ€™s quality of life nor prevents the safe
movement of aircraft at the Le Mars Municipal Airport. For the protection of
the public health, safety and general welfare, and for the promotion of the
most appropriate use of land, it is necessary to prevent the creation or
establishment of airport hazards. The prevention of airport hazards shall be
accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by proper exercise of the police
power. The prevention of new airport hazards, and the elimination, removal,
alteration, mitigation, or marking and lighting of existing airport hazards,
are considered to be a public purpose for which the City of Le Mars may raise
and expend public funds, as an incident to the operation of airports, to
acquire or property interest therein.
166.05 SHORT TITLE.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as Le Mars Municipal Airport Land
Use & Height Overlay Zoning Ordinance, and it is referred to as â€œthe Ordinanceâ€
within the following sections.
166.06 APPLICABILITY.
This ordinance encompasses a general area around the Le Mars Municipal Airport.
Specific dimensions associated with the zoning boundary are shown in the
Airport Land Use & Height Overlay Zoning Maps.
166.07 AIR SPACE OBSTRUCTION ZONES.
The Airport Height Overlay Zoning Districts established by an ordinance adopted
on 7th day of November, 2017 is illustrated on the official Le Mars Municipal
Airport Height Overlay Zoning Map consisting of one sheet and dated June 2,
2014 and is made part of this ordinance by reference. Such Official Height
Overlay Zoning Map may be amended and all notations, references, elevations,
data, zone boundaries and other information thereon, is hereby adopted as part
of this ordinance.
166.08 LAND USE SAFETY ZONES.
FAR Part 77 Surfaces and RPZs have been combined to create five airport overlay
zones. These five zones are designed to maintain compatible land uses around
The Le Mars Municipal Airport. The Airport Land Use Overlay Zoning Districts
established by an ordinance adopted on 7th day of November, 2017, is
illustrated on the official Le Mars Municipal Airport Land Use Zoning Map
consisting of one sheet and dated June 2, 2014, and is made part of this
ordinance by reference. The zones shall be evaluated for compatible land uses.
1.Â Â Â DEFINITION OF ZONES.
Five airport overlay zoning districts are prescribed within this chapter.
Specific dimensions for the individual zones for each runway end are noted in
the following tables and text.
The Airport Land Use & Height Overlay Zoning Maps should be evaluated to
determine the specific area of impact associated with each zone.
Zone A - Runway Protection Zone (RPZ)
Zone A is intended to provide a clear area that is free of aboveground
obstructions and structures. This zone is closest to the individual runway
ends. The dimensional standards for this zone are the same as those described
in the Airport Design AC (AC 150/5300- 13 Change 11) and are shown in the
following table.
Table: Zone A Dimensional Requirements

Â 
Zone B - Approach Surface
Zone B is a critical airport overlay zoning surface that reflects the approach
and departure areas for each runway at an airport. The size of Zone B is
predicated upon the type of approach (visual, non precision, or precision) that
a specific runway has and the type/size of aircraft utilizing the runway. The
following table illustrates the various sizes of Zone B based upon the specific
runway criteria. A portion of Zone B is overlain by Zone A because the approach
surface and RPZ overlap the entire length of the RPZ.

Zone E width                           4,000     4,000
Â 
Zone C - Transitional Surface
Zone C includes those areas that are parallel to the runway pavement and extend
1,050 feet from the edge of the primary surface paralleling the runway and
extended runway centerline until they reach the end of Zone A at a 90 degree
angle. The specific dimensions for Zone C are based upon various options for
the primary surface that is predicated upon the type of approach and critical
aircraft.
Zone D - Horizontal Surface
Zone D is typically elliptical in shape, depending upon the runway types and
configurations at individual airports.
Zone E - Conical Surface
Zone E is the outermost zone of the airport overlay zoning areas and has the
least number of land use restriction considerations. The zone begins at the
edge of the horizontal surface and is 4,000 feet in width paralleling the
horizontal surface.
2.Â Â Â ZONE COMPATIBILITY.
The following tables shall be utilized to evaluate land use compatibility for
various land use classifications.
Â Â Â âˆ™Â Â Â Uses identified as compatible shall not require additional review,
however, consideration should be given to the following five areas of concerns:
Â Â Â Â Â Â oÂ Â Â Noise sensitive related issues
Â Â Â Â Â Â oÂ Â Â High concentrations of people
Â Â Â Â Â Â oÂ Â Â Tall structures
Â Â Â Â Â Â oÂ Â Â Visual obstructions
Â Â Â Â Â Â oÂ Â Â Wildlife and bird attractants
Â Â Â âˆ™Â Â Â Uses found to be NOT compatible shall be precluded from development
within the specific zones.
Â Â Â âˆ™Â Â Â Uses found to require additional review shall be evaluated for general
compatibility utilizing the Compatible Land Use Planning Checklist as a
guideline and the five primary areas of concern noted above.
Â Â Â âˆ™Â Â Â Objects of growth, structures or land uses existing on the effective
date of this ordinance shall be considered legal preexisting non-conforming
uses and shall be allowed to remain. Preexisting nonconforming structures shall
not be replaced, rebuilt, altered, allowed to grow higher or replanted, so as
to constitute a greater airport hazard than it was when the airport zoning
regulations or amendments to the regulations were adopted without receiving a
variance from the restrictions of this ordinance as laid out in Section
166.14 of this Chapter.

These regulations may be referred to as the â€œZoning Ordinance of the City of Le
Mars, Iowa.â€ These regulations have been based upon the comprehensive plan for
the City, which was adopted by the Council on March 20, 1962. Said
comprehensive plan included estimates of population growth, land use surveys, a
land use plan, plans for major thoroughfares, other transportation facilities,
community facilities, public services and utilities, and a public works
program.
1.Â Â Â Need for public services and facilities in both size and location depends
upon the character and intensity of land use. Regulation of the use of land is
thus fundamental to a coordinated optimum physical development of the
community. The land use regulations are intended to be the foundation of the
entire process of improvement of the physical environment.
2.Â Â Â The regulations are intended to preserve and protect existing property
uses and values against adverse or unharmonious adjacent uses.
3.Â Â Â The land use regulations divide the area into a number of zoning
districts.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Because of poor drainage, steep slopes and other adverse natural
conditions some land areas should be kept in their natural state. These would
be placed in a conservation district.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The comprehensive plan included careful estimates of the land area
requirements for the various land uses such as commerce, residence, industry,
transportation and public uses. These urban uses should be directed into that
land area where they may be most efficiently served by public services and
facilities such as sewers, water, schools, parks, and the like. Remaining lands
should be reserved for rural uses. Consequently, the regulations include a
rural district for nonurban land uses.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â In the past, residential neighborhoods have deteriorated because they
were invaded by small isolated commercial uses and by more intensive
residential uses. The great majority of our population desire to, and do, live
in single-family homes which they own and which are located on fairly large
lots. The regulations establish residential districts particularly designed to
provide maximum protection for single-family homes.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Other residential districts are established for two-family homes and
for apartments. Density, yard, and parking regulations would insure good living
conditions in these areas. Much of the present day building is by large
projects instead of lot by lot. The regulations provide for â€œlarge-scale
developmentsâ€ (two acres or more) which may be located in any residential
district with approval of the site plan and with conformity of the plan to the
overall density standards of the district. This introduces an important measure
of flexibility into the regulations.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Commercial districts recognize the different types of commercial areas
that will be needed by the future growth of the community. There is a zoning
district for the neighborhood commercial area, i.e., the grocery store-drug
store complex serving the adjacent residential neighborhoods. For the more
widely used commercial areas along major streets and highways, there is a
general commercial district. There is a central commercial district for the
downtown area.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â For industry there are three districts-a light industrial district for
the modern organized industrial area with landscaped frontage yards and no open
storage, a general industrial district which allows more freedom in the use of
space and a heavy industrial district with its unrestricted use.
4.Â Â Â It is not the law or policy of the City to disallow plans and
specifications of a proposed residential structure solely because the proposed
structure is a manufactured home as defined by Section 414.28 of the Code of
Iowa and manufactured or constructed under the authority of 42 U.S.C. Section
5403. Further, the City shall not adopt or enforce zoning regulations or other
ordinances which disallow the plans and specifications of a proposed
residential structure solely because the proposed structure is a manufactured
home. This statement of intent and purpose shall be construed as the adoption
by the City of the requirements of said Section 414.28 of the Code of Iowa and
the adoption of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety
Standards Act, 42 U.S.C. Sections 5401- 5426.

shall be determined by the requirements and procedures set out below, which
shall prevail over conflicting requirements of this chapter or
Chapter 165 governing the subdivision of land.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The final development plan shall follow all applicable procedures,
standards and requirements of
Chapter 165 governing the subdivision of land. The final development plan shall

of the proposed development is approved and recorded.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review the conformity of
the proposed development with the standards of the official City plan and
recognized principles of civic design, land use planning and landscape
architecture. The minimum yard and maximum height requirements of the district

shall be provided around the boundaries of the area being developed. The
Planning and Zoning Commission may impose conditions regarding the layout,

Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The buildings may be used for single-family dwellings, two- family
dwellings or multiple dwellings and the usual accessory uses. The number of
dwelling units permitted shall be determined by dividing the net development
area by the minimum lot area per family required by the district or districts

subtracting the area set aside for churches, schools or other nonresidential
uses from the gross development area and deducting 20 percent of the remainder
for streets, regardless of the amount of land actually required for streets.
The area of land set aside for common open space or recreational use shall be
included in determining the number of dwelling units permitted.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The Commission may hold one or more public hearings on a final
development plan. The recommendations of the Commission shall be forwarded to
the Council which shall approve or disapprove the action of the Commission with
or without modification and after public hearing. After approval by Council and
after any required restrictions are in effect, the Building Official may issue
permits enabling the approved final development plan to be carried out.
2.Â Â Â Accessory buildings and uses are permitted when in accordance with the
following:

Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Accessory buildings may not be used for dwelling purposes.
3.Â Â Â Regulations regarding screening and vision clearance shall be as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Statement of Purpose. This subsection is established to recognize the
public and private benefits accrued from functional and aesthetic screening
between areas of incompatible land uses, the increasing demand for active and
passive recreational area, the desirability of providing visual screening of
certain parking lot, commercial, and manufacture areas, and the necessity of
providing adequate vehicular vision clearance.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Off-street Parking and Loading Areas. All open off-street parking areas
containing more than three spaces, and all open off-street loading areas shall
have effective screening on each side adjoining or fronting on any residence
district or any public or private street.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â District Boundary Lines. Any property located in a commercial or
manufacturing district shall have effective screening along lot lines adjoining
any residence district, said screening to be not less than six feet in height,
nor more than eight feet in height.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Fence Requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Permit Required. There will be a fee set by resolution of the
Council for a fence permit. Application for a fence permit shall include a
complete site plan of the lot and the proposed fence, with the height of
desired fence included.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â In any special or residential district, fences may be erected along
a lot line or adjacent thereto to a height not exceeding six feet above the
ground level. Fences erected in a required front or street side yard and
located less than four feet from the street lot line shall not exceed a height
greater than four feet above the ground level, provided, however, that within
10 feet of any driveway crossing of a street lot line, any fencing shall not
exceed two feet in height.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Fences will not be allowed in a drainage way. If a fence is
requested to be put on an easement, the property owner must have permission
from the Building Official and holder of the easement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â In any commercial or manufacturing district, no required fencing
shall be erected along a lot line or adjacent thereto to a height exceeding
eight feet above the ground level.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Exemptions. The Building Official may modify the provisions for the
requirement of screening when suitable screening exists on abutting property or
when such officer determines that such modifications for screening shall be in
harmony with the general purpose and intent of this subsection. The Building
Official may also modify the provisions for the requirement of vision clearance
when such officer determines that such modifications shall be consistent with
traffic safety and shall be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of
this subsection.
4.Â Â Â Regulations regarding mobile homes shall be as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All inhabited mobile homes shall be located in a mobile home court
which has received a conditional use permit and which conforms with the
requirements of the following paragraph. No mobile home outside of an approved
mobile home court shall be connected to utilities except those mobile homes
being offered for sale and then only on a lot so designated as a mobile home
sales business with such mobile home not inhabited.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Mobile home courts shall meet the following minimum standards:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Each lot provided for the occupancy of a single mobile home unit
shall have an area of not less than 5,000 square feet and a width of not less
than 50 feet, and no court shall be permitted an average density of mobile home
lots of more than eight per acre, and each mobile home court shall provide an
area of not less than 10 acres.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All mobile home courts shall provide lots sufficient in size that
no mobile home or any structure, addition or appurtenance thereto is located
less than 10 feet from the nearest adjacent court boundary.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Space between mobile homes may be used for the parking of motor
vehicles if the space is clearly designated and the vehicle is parked at least
10 feet from the nearest adjacent court boundary.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Each mobile home site shall abut or face a clear unoccupied space,
driveway, roadway, or street of not less than 20 feet in width, which shall
have unobstructed access to a public highway, street or alley.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The mobile home court shall be surrounded by a landscaped strip of
open space 50 feet wide along the street frontage of a major street and 25 feet
wide along all other lot lines or street frontage.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â All mobile homes located within the City limits of Le Mars, Iowa, shall
be required to have tiedowns to restrict over-turning and movement off their
piers to meet the following requirements and specifications:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Piers and Footings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â All piers shall be placed on footings of solid concrete with
minimum dimensions of 16 inches by 16 inches by 4 inches, or two 8-inch by 16-
inch solid concrete block.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Piers shall be constructed of standard 8-inch by 8- inch by 16-
inch celled concrete.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Piers shall be topped with a solid concrete cap 8 inches by 16
inches by 4 inches.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Treated shims shall be driven tight between the cap and the main
frame to provide uniform bearing. These shims shall be impervious to salt air
and to rot. They shall be 4 inches or less in thickness and be wide enough to
provide bearing over the top cap.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Other types of piers and foundations of equivalent permanence
and weight bearing ability may be approved. The use of a heavy metal adjustable
column, anchored to both frame and foundation, may also be approved.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Piers shall be centered under each main frame (or chassis)
member with a maximum spacing of 10 feet on centers. The end piers shall be no
farther than 5-feet from the ends of the mobile home.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Tiedown Anchorage Requirements. (Tie down components utilized
including anchor systems must be able to withstand at least 4,800 pounds
without failure.)
Â 
Â                 Â              Wind Velocity  Number of Frame Number of Over-
                                 Miles Per Hour Ties            the-Top Ties

Wide Mobile Homes
Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Over-the-top tiedowns shall be positioned at stud and rafter
locations near each end of the mobile home. Others, if needed, may be
positioned between them.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Wherever feasible, over-the-top tiedowns and frame ties directly
beneath them may use the same anchors. Mobile homes with clerestory roofs are
particularly vulnerable to high winds. Over-the-top tiedowns at each end of the
clerestory section are required in addition to the anchorage presented in the
above table.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â All ties shall be fastened to ground anchors as described in
subparagraph (3) below and be drawn tight with galvanized turnbuckles or with a
yoke-type fastener and tensioning device. Turnbuckles shall have a capacity to
withstand a 4,800 pound tension without failure and shall be ended with jaws or
forged or welded eyes. Turnbuckles with hook ends are not approved.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â All cable ends shall be secured with at least two U- bolt type
cable clamps or other fastening device as approved by the enforcing officials.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Cable used for this shall be of either galvanized steel or
stainless steel having a breaking strength greater than 4,800 pounds. Cable
shall be either seven-thirty-seconds inch diameter or greater (7 x 7) steel
cable or one-fourth inch diameter or greater (7 x 19) aircraft cable.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â When flat steel strapping is used, it must be in accordance with
Federal Specification QQ-S-781, i.e., 1Â¼ x .035", Type 1, Class B Grade 1 with
breaking strength of the strapping.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Steel strapping used for ties must terminate with a D- ring,
bolt, or other fastening device which will not cause distortion of the band or
reduce the breaking strength of the strapping.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â Wherever feasible, care should be taken to evenly space the
frame ties and over-the-top tiedowns. They should not be bunched together.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Sharp edges of the mobile home that would tend to cut the cable
or strap over-the-top tiedowns must be protected by a suitable device which
prevents such cutting when the mobile home is buffeted by the wind. Likewise,
special adapters need to be installed to prevent the cable or strap from
knifing through the mobile home.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (j)Â Â Â Connection of cable frame tie to the I-beam (or other shape)
main structural frame member should be by a 5/8- inch drop forged closed eye,
bolted through a hole drilled through the center of the I-beam. A washer, or
equivalent, should be used so that the beam is sufficiently fish-plated around
the hole. If steel strapping is used, care should be exercised to insure that
minimum bending radius is adhered to so that the breaking strength of the
strapping is not reduced.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (k)Â Â Â Frame ties should be the connection between the anchor and the
steel I-beam (or other shape) main structural frame member which runs
lengthwise beneath the mobile home. Frame ties should never be connected to any
of the steel outrigger beams which fasten to and intersect the main I- beams at
right angles. The outriggers do not have adequate structural strength to resist
the frame tie loadings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Anchors.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Ground anchors should be aligned so that they are close to a
pier. They should also be situated immediately below the outer wall to also
accommodate over-the-top ties as well as frame ties.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Anchors shall be capable of withstanding 4,800 pounds of pull
(in a vertical or diagonal direction) without failure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Augers shall have a minimum diameter of 6 inches (arrow-heads
8") and be sunk to a depth of at least 4-feet. Steel rods shall be at least 5/
8- inch diameter with a forged or welded eye at top or with a yoke-type
fastening and tensioning device.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Deadman anchors shall be sunk to a depth of 5-feet and have a
minimum length of 2-feet and a diameter of at least 6 inches. Celled concrete
blocks are not approved. Solid steel rods shall be at least 5/8- inch diameter
with the bottom nooked into the concrete deadman.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Anchors to reinforced concrete slabs must be of strength
comparable to that presented above.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Compliance. When it appears that a person is in noncompliance with
the provisions of this section said person shall be served with notice of
noncompliance and be given 60 days in which to achieve compliance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Penalty. Any person served with notice of noncompliance with the
provisions of this section and who fails to be in compliance with the provision
of said section within 60 days of the service of notice of noncompliance shall
be in violation of this Code of Ordinances.

necessary to simulate a minimum street right-of-way width of 80 feet regardless
of the actual street right-of-way. No buildings or structures may be placed
closer to the street right-of-way than that to meet the above requirement.
Whenever a lot abuts upon a public alley, one-half of the alley width may be
considered as a portion of the required rear yard, for the purpose of side yard
regulations, a two-family dwelling or multiple dwelling shall be considered as
one building occupying one lot.
2.Â Â Â Additional Requirements. The following additional yard requirements must
also be observed:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â On lots fronting on two nonintersecting streets, a front yard must be
provided on both streets.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â On corner lots there must be a front yard on both streets. On corner
lots that are lots of record the buildable width cannot be reduced to less than
28 feet, except that there shall be a yard along the side street side of such a
lot of at least 5-feet.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Where a frontage is divided among districts with different front yard
requirements, the deepest front yard required shall apply to the entire
frontage.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â In the business and industrial districts there may be more than one
building on a lot provided that the required yards be maintained around the
group of buildings.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â There may be two or more related multi-family buildings on a lot;
provided that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The required yards be maintained around the group of buildings; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Buildings that are parallel or that are within 45 degrees of being
parallel be separated by a horizontal distance that is at least equal to the
height of the highest building.

repaired and remodeled, but not reconstructed or structurally altered.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Required front yard shall be devoted entirely to landscaped area except
for guest parking and the necessary paving of driveways and sidewalks to reach
parking or loading areas in the side or rear yard.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Where an official line has been established for the future widening or
opening of a street or major thoroughfare upon which a lot abuts, then the
depth of a front or side yard shall be measured from such official line to the
nearest line of the building.
3.Â Â Â Exceptions to Yard Requirements. The following exceptions may be made to
the yard requirements:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where, on the effective date of this chapter, 30 percent or more of a
block front was occupied by two or more buildings, then the front yard is
established in the following manner:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Where the building farthermost from the street provides a front
yard not more than 10 feet deeper than the building closest to the street, then
the front yard for the frontage is and remains an average of the then existing
front yards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Where this Subsection 1 above is not the case and a lot is within
one 100 feet of a building on each side, then the front yard is a line drawn
from the closest front corners of these two adjacent buildings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Where neither Subsections 1 nor 2 above is the case, and the lot is
within 100 feet of an existing building on one side only, then the front yard
is the same as that of the existing adjacent building.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Sills, belt courses, window air-conditioning units, chimneys, cornices,
and ornamental features may project into a required yard a distance not to
exceed 24 inches.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Filling station pumps and pump islands may occupy required yards,
provided, however, that they are not less than 15 feet from all lot lines.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Open fire escapes, fireproof outside stairways and balconies opening
upon fire towers, and the ordinary projections of chimneys and flues into a
rear yard for a distance of not more than 3 Â½ feet when so placed as to not
obstruct light and ventilation may be permitted by the Building Official.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â No side yards are required where dwellings are erected above commercial

lot width requirements established above may be modified as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where a lot of record at the time of the effective date of this chapter
has less area or width than herein required in the district in which it is
located, and the owner of such lot does not own any other parcel or tract
adjacent thereto, said lot may nevertheless be used for a one- family dwelling
or for any nondwelling use permitted in the district in which it is located.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Existing buildings that are in violation of lot area requirements may
be remodeled or repaired, but may not be reconstructed or structurally altered

20,000 square feet and the lot width to 100 feet where public water service is
available but where there is no public sewer service or to 15,000 square feet
and 80 feet, respectively, where both public water and public sewer services
are available.
167.19 OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING REGULATIONS.
1.Â Â Â Off-street Parking Requirements. Off-street parking spaces shall be
provided as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Dwellings:

Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Multiple dwellings: one and one-half (1Â½) spaces for each dwelling
unit. In the event of an uneven number of dwelling units, the number of

Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Restaurant: one space for each 100 square feet of floor area or one
space for each three permanent seats whichever is greater.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Rooming and boardinghouses, sororities and fraternities: one space for

100 square feet of the gross area used for this purpose.
Â Â Â N.Â Â Â Manufacturing of industrial establishment, research or testing
laboratory, creamery, bottling plant, warehouse or other similar

space to accommodate all trucks and other vehicles used in connection
therewith.
Â Â Â O.Â Â Â All nonresidential buildings, except those above specified: one space
for each 200 square feet of floor area.
2.Â Â Â Rules for Computing Parking Spaces. In computing the number of required
parking spaces, the following rules shall apply:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Floor area shall mean the gross floor area of the specific use,
excluding any floor or portion thereof used for parking, as herein defined.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where fractional spaces result, the parking spaces required shall be
the nearest whole number.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â In the case of mixed uses, the parking spaces required shall equal the
sum of the requirements of the various uses computed separately.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Whenever a building or use constructed or established after January 1,
1960, is changed or enlarged in floor area, number of employees, number of
dwelling units, seating capacity or otherwise, parking spaces shall be provided
on the basis of the enlargement or change. Whenever a building or use existing
prior to January 1, 1960, is reconstructed or is enlarged to the extent of 20
percent or more in floor area said building or use in its entirety shall then
and thereafter comply with the parking requirements set forth herein. Any
enlargement or change in use of less than 20 percent of the gross floor area
shall be provided with parking based on the enlargement or change.
3.Â Â Â Location of Required Parking Spaces. All parking spaces required herein
shall be located as follows:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The parking spaces required for residential buildings or uses shall be
located on the same lot with the building or use served except within the B-
3 District which shall comply with the 300 foot requirement hereinafter set
forth. The parking spaces required for any other building or use may be located
on an area within 300 feet of said building and two or more owners of buildings
may join together in providing the required parking spaces. Where the required
parking spaces are not located on the same lot with the building or use served,
the usage of the lot or tract upon which said parking spaces are provided shall
be restricted by an instrument of record describing the premises for which said
parking is provided and assuring the retention of such parking so long as
required by this chapter.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â No parking spaces may be located in a front yard in any residential
district except on the paved driveway area where it leads directly into a
garage or where a garage would normally be located in the absence of a garage.
4.Â Â Â Minimum Improvement and Maintenance Standards. All open parking areas
provided in compliance with this chapter shall be surfaced with a durable,
dustproof surface consisting of concrete, bituminous concrete, or compacted
gravel or crushed stone properly sealed and surface treated as approved by
designated engineering personnel of the City. The parking areas shall be
maintained in a usable dustproof condition and graded and drained to dispose of
all surface water. Whenever lighting is provided, it shall be so hooded or
shielded as to reflect the light away from abutting or neighboring property
including public rights-of- way. One standard tree of at least 3-inch diameter
shall be planted on the lot for each 10 parking spaces. The location of each
parking space and the direction of movement along the access driveways shall be
indicated by painting upon the surface of the lot. A structurally sound wall or
other abutment shall be installed and so placed around each side of the parking
lot to insure that no part of an automobile either extends over or is capable
of accidentally rolling across the property line of the parking lot.
5.Â Â Â Off-street Loading Requirements. There shall be provided at the time any
building is erected or structurally altered off-street loading space in
accordance with the following requirements:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Office buildings, apartments, apartment hotels, motels and hotels. One
space for each 5,000 to 50,000 square feet of gross floor area; two spaces for
each 50,000 to 200,000 square feet of gross floor area; one additional space
for each 75,000 square feet of gross floor area above 200,000 square feet.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Retail or service establishment or wholesale commercial use. One space
for each 2,000 to 20,000 square feet of gross floor area; two spaces for each
20,000 to 100,000 square feet of gross floor area; one additional space for
each 75,000 square feet of gross floor area above 100,000 square feet.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Manufacturing or industrial use. One space for each 10,000 square feet
of floor area or fraction thereof in excess of 5,000 square feet.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â In all cases where the off-street loading space is located in a manner
that a truck must back directly from a major street into a loading space, a
maneuvering space of not less than 50 feet shall be provided on the lot on
which the industrial use is located.
6.Â Â Â Exception to Parking and Loading Requirements. The above off-street
parking and loading requirements shall not be required for any use in the â€œB-3â€
Central Business District, except residential dwellings, in which case off-
street parking shall be provided on the basis of one parking space per dwelling
unit.
167.20 NONCONFORMING USES.
1.Â Â Â The lawful use of a building existing at the time of the adoption of the
original zoning ordinance (March 8, 1962) or at the time of a change in the
district classification may be continued even though such use does not conform
with the provisions thereof. If no structural alterations are made, a
nonconforming use of a building may be changed to another nonconforming use of
the same or more restricted classification, but whenever a nonconforming use is
changed to a more restricted use or to a conforming use, it shall not
thereafter be changed to a less restricted use.
2.Â Â Â The nonconforming use of a building may be extended throughout those parts
thereof which were manifestly arranged or designed therefor prior to adoption
of this chapter.
3.Â Â Â No building which has been damaged by fire, explosion, act of God, or the
public enemy to the extent of more than sixty percent of its reproduction value
shall be restored except in conformity with the district regulations.
4.Â Â Â In the event that the nonconforming use of a building or premises in a
residence district is discontinued for a period of two years or more, such
building or premises shall thereafter be used only in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which it is located.
5.Â Â Â The casual, intermittent, temporary, or illegal use of land or buildings
shall not be sufficient to establish the existence of a nonconforming use and
the existence of a nonconforming use on a part of a lot or tract shall not be
construed to establish a nonconforming use on the entire lot or tract.
6.Â Â Â Whether a nonconforming use exists shall be a question of fact and shall
be decided by the Zoning Board of Adjustment after public notice and hearing
and in accordance with the rules of the Board.
167.21 ZONING BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
1.Â Â Â A Zoning Board of Adjustment is hereby created. The Zoning Board of
Adjustment shall consist of five members appointed by the Mayor and approved by
the Council, each to be appointed for a term of five years, excepting that when
the Board shall first be created one member shall be appointed for a term of
five years, one for a term of four years, one for a term of three years, one
for a term of two years, and one for a term of one year. Members shall be
removable for cause by the Mayor and Council upon written charges and after
public hearing. Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term of any member
whose term becomes vacant.
2.Â Â Â The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall adopt rules for the conduct of its
business, establish a quorum and procedure, and keep a public record of all
findings and decisions. Meetings of the Board shall be held at the call of the
Chairperson and at such other times as the Board may determine. Each session of
the Zoning Board of Adjustment, at which is exercised any powers granted under
this section, shall be a public meeting with public notice of said meeting and
business to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City, at
least one time seven days prior to the meeting. Not less than seven days before
said meeting, the City Clerk shall send a copy of the notice of said meeting
and business, by certified mail, to the owners of the property included in any
proposed change and to those owners immediately adjacent in the rear thereof
extending the depth of one lot or not to exceed 200 feet therefrom and to those
owners directly opposite thereto, extending the depth of one lot or not to
exceed 200 feet from the street frontage of such opposite lots, at the address
as shown by the records of the County Auditor. If a property is shown to be in
the name of more than one owner at the same mailing address, a single notice
may be mailed, addressed to all owners at that address. Failure to receive a
mailed notice is not a defense to the proposed change.
3.Â Â Â An appeal may be taken to the Zoning Board of Adjustment by any person,
group or organization, public or private, affected by a decision of the
Building Official. Such appeal shall be taken within such time as prescribed by
the Board by general rule, by filing with the Building Official a notice of
appeal, specifying the grounds thereof. A fee set by resolution of the Council,
plus publication cost, shall accompany all notices of appeals. The Building
Official shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the
record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
4.Â Â Â The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â To hear and decide appeals, where it is alleged there is an error in
any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Building Official
in the enforcement of this chapter, and may affirm or reverse, in whole or
part, said decision of the enforcement officer.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â To hear requests for variances from the literal provisions of the
zoning regulations in instances where strict enforcement of the zoning
regulations would cause undue hardship due to circumstances unique to the
individual property under consideration, and grant such variances only when it
is demonstrated that such action will be in keeping with the spirit and intent
of the provisions of the zoning regulations. The Zoning Board of Adjustment
shall not permit, as a variance, any use in a zone that is not permitted under
the chapter. The Zoning Board of Adjustment may impose conditions in the
granting of a variance to insure compliance and to protect adjacent property.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â To hold public hearings on and decide the following exceptions to or
variations of this chapter:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â To permit the extension of a district where the boundary line
thereof divides a lot held in a single ownership at the time of adoption of
this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Interpret the provisions of this chapter in such a way as to carry
out the intent and purpose of the plan, as shown upon the zoning district map
where the street layout on the ground varies from the street layout as shown on
this map.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Classify commercial or industrial uses not specifically listed in
this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Permit reconstruction of a nonconforming building otherwise
prohibited by Subsection 167.20(3) where such action would not constitute
continuation of a monopoly.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Vary the yard regulations where there is an exceptional or unusual
physical condition of a lot, not generally prevalent in the neighborhood, which
condition when related to the yard regulations of this chapter would prevent a
reasonable or sensible arrangement of buildings on the lot.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Vary the parking regulations by not more than 50 percent where it
is conclusively shown that the specific use of a building would make
unnecessary the parking spaces otherwise required by this chapter.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â To hear and decide upon applications for conditional use permits
specifically listed in the district regulations of this chapter. Before
authorizing the issuance of such a conditional use permit, the Board may impose
such conditions as will, in the Boardâ€™s judgment, insure that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The establishment, maintenance or operation of the conditional use
will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals,
comfort or general welfare.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The conditional use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment
of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted,
nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The establishment of the conditional use will not impede the normal
and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, and/or other necessary
facilities will be provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Adequate measures will be taken to provide ingress and egress so
designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â The conditional use shall in all other respects conform to the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located and the Board
shall find that there is a public necessity for the conditional use.
5.Â Â Â Decisions of the Board in respect to the above shall be subject to appeal
to the District Court of Plymouth County within 30 days after the filing of the
decision in the office of the Board.
167.22 ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
1.Â Â Â It shall be the duty of the person designated by the Mayor as Building
Official to administer and enforce the regulations contained herein.
2.Â Â Â No building shall be undertaken without a building permit and without an
occupancy permit as required by this section. Application for a building permit
shall be accompanied by a lot plat in duplicate, drawn to scale, showing the
name of applicant, the actual dimensions of the lot to be built upon as shown
by a survey, the size, shape and location of the building to be erected, and
such other information as may be necessary for the enforcement of this chapter.
A record of applications and lot plats shall be kept in the office of the
Building Official.
Subsequent to the effective date of this chapter no change in the use or
occupancy of land, or in the use or occupancy of an existing building other
than for single-family dwelling purposes, shall be made, nor shall any new
building be occupied until a certificate of occupancy has been issued by the
Building Official. Such certificate of occupancy shall state that the new
occupancy complies with all provisions of this chapter.
No permit for excavation for, or the erection or alteration of, any building,
except for farm buildings, shall be issued before application has been made and
approved for a certificate of occupancy and compliance, and no such building or
premises shall be occupied until such certificate and permit is issued.
A record of all certificates of occupancy shall be kept on file in the office
of the Building Official.
167.23 AMENDMENTS.
1.Â Â Â The City Council may from time to time, on its own motion or on petition,
amend, supplement, change, modify or repeal by ordinance the boundaries of
districts or regulations, or restrictions herein established. Any proposed
amendment, supplement, change, modification or repeal shall first be submitted
to the City Planning and Zoning Commission for its recommendations and report.
If the City Planning and Zoning Commission makes no written report to the City
Council within 30 days, it shall be considered to have made a report approving
the proposed amendment, supplement, modifications or change. After the written
recommendations and report of the City Planning and Zoning Commission have been
filed, the City Council shall before enacting any proposed amendment,
supplement, change, modification or repeal, hold a public hearing in relation
thereto, giving at least seven and no more than 20 daysâ€™ notice of the time and
place of such hearing, which notice shall first be published in a newspaper
having a general circulation in the City of Le Mars, Iowa. In addition thereto,
the City Clerk shall send a copy of the proposed amendment, supplement, change,
modification or repeal by certified mail to the owners of the properties
included in such proposed change and to those owners of properties immediately
adjacent to the properties included in such proposed change extending the depth
of one lot or not to exceed 200 feet therefrom and to those owners directly
opposite thereto, extending the depth of one lot or not to exceed 200 feet from
the street frontage of said property included in such proposed change to said
opposite property. The mailings to the above said property owners shall be
addressed as shown by the records of the Plymouth County, Iowa, Auditor, and
they shall be placed by the City Clerk in a U.S. mail depository in Le Mars,
Iowa, not less than seven and no more than 20 days before the above said public
hearing. If a property is shown to be in the name more than one owner at the
same mailing address, a single notice may be mailed addressed to all owners at
that address. Failure to receive a mailed notice is not a defense to the
proposed change.
If the City Planning and Zoning Commission recommends against, or if a protest
against such proposed amendment, supplement, change, modification or repeal
shall be presented in writing to the City Clerk, duly signed and acknowledged
by the owners of 20 percent or more, either of the area of the lot included in
such proposed change, or of those immediately adjacent thereto extending the
depth of one lot or not to exceed 200 feet therefrom or of those directly
opposite thereto, extending the depth of one lot or not to exceed 200 feet from
the street frontage of the property included in the proposed change to such
opposite lots such amendment, supplement, change, modification or repeal shall
not become effective except by the favorable vote of three-fourths of the
members of the City Council.
2.Â Â Â Before an action shall be taken as provided in this section, any private
party or parties proposing a change in the zoning regulations or district
boundaries shall deposit with the City Treasurer a sum set by Council
resolution to cover the approximate cost of this procedure, and under no
condition shall said sum or any part thereof be refunded for failure of said
change to be adopted by the City Council.
167.24 INTERPRETATION.
1.Â Â Â In interpreting and applying the provisions of this chapter, they shall be
held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public safety,
health, convenience, comfort, morals, prosperity and general welfare. It is not
intended by this chapter to interfere with or abrogate or annul any easements,
covenants or other agreements between parties, except that if this chapter
imposes a greater restriction, this chapter shall control.
2.Â Â Â A district name or letter-number combination shown on the district map
indicates that the regulations pertaining to the district designated by that
name or letter-number combination extend throughout the whole area in the
municipality bounded by the district boundary lines within which such name or
letter-number combination is shown or indicated, except as otherwise provided
by this section.
3.Â Â Â Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various
districts as shown on the map accompanying and made a part of this chapter, the
following rules shall apply:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â In cases where a boundary line is given a position within a street or
alley or nonnavigable stream, it shall be deemed to be in the center of the
street, alley or stream and if the actual location of such street, alley or
stream varies slightly from the location as shown on the district map, then the
actual location shall control.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In cases where a boundary line is shown as being located a specific
distance from a street line or other physical feature, this distance shall
control.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â In cases where a boundary line is shown adjoining or coincident with a
railroad, it shall be deemed to be in the center of the railroad right-of-way
and distances measured from the nearest rail of the designated track.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Where the district boundaries are not otherwise indicated and where the
property has been or may hereafter be divided into blocks and lots, the
district boundaries shall be construed to be the lot lines, and where the
districts designated on the map accompanying and made a part of this chapter
are bounded approximately by lot lines, said lot lines shall be construed to be
the boundary of such districts unless said boundaries are otherwise indicated
on the map.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â In unsubdivided property, unless otherwise indicated, the district
boundary line on the maps accompanying and made a part of this chapter shall be
determined by the use of the scale contained on such map.
167.25 VIOLATIONS AND PENALTY.
1.Â Â Â Any person, firm or corporation who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects,
or refuses to comply with, or who resists the enforcement of any of the
provisions of this chapter, shall be in violation of this Code of Ordinances.
Each day that such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.
2.Â Â Â In case any building or structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed,
altered, repaired, converted or maintained, or any building, structure or land
is used in violation of this chapter, the appropriate authorities of the City,
in addition to other remedies, may institute appropriate action or proceeding
to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration,
repair, conversion, maintenance, or use to restrain, or to correct or abate
such violation, or to prevent any illegal act, conduct business or use in or
about such premises.
