storage of petroleum products, or used for the retail sale of goods.
   3.   “New construction” means new buildings and structures and includes new
buildings and structures that are constructed as additions to existing

required due to economic obsolescence and the reconstruction is necessary to
implement recognized industry standards for the manufacturing and processing of
specific products and the reconstruction is required for the owner of the
building or structure to continue competitively to manufacture or process those
products, which determination shall receive prior approval from the City

   4.   “Research-service facilities” means a building or group of buildings
devoted primarily to research and development activities, including (but not

7.03 PERIOD OF PARTIAL EXEMPTION.
The actual value added to industrial real estate by the new construction of

distribution centers is eligible to receive a partial exemption from taxation
for a period of five years. The exemption shall also apply to the acquisition
of or improvement to machinery and equipment assessed as real estate pursuant
to Section 427A.1[1e] of the Code of Iowa, unless the machinery or equipment is
part of the normal replacement or operating process to maintain or expand the
existing operational status.

The granting of the exemption under this chapter for new construction
constituting complete replacement of an existing building or structure shall
not result in the assessed value of the industrial real estate being reduced
below the assessed value of the industrial real estate before the start of the
new construction added.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 427B.3)
7.06 APPLICATIONS.
An application shall be filed for each project resulting in actual value added

the improvement, its cost, and other information deemed necessary by the
Director of Revenue.
7.07 APPROVAL.
A person may submit a proposal to the City Council to receive prior approval
for eligibility for a tax exemption on new construction. If the City Council
resolves to consider such proposal, it shall publish notice and hold a public
hearing thereon. Thereafter, at least 30 days after such hearing, the City
Council, by ordinance, may give its prior approval of a tax exemption for new
construction if the new construction is in conformance with City zoning. Such
prior approval shall not entitle the owner to exemption from taxation until the
new construction has been completed and found to be qualified real estate.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 427B.4)
7.08 EXEMPTION REPEALED.
When in the opinion of the City Council continuation of the exemption granted
by this chapter ceases to be of benefit to the City, the City Council may
repeal this chapter, but all existing exemptions shall continue until their
expiration.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 427B.5)
7.09 DUAL EXEMPTIONS PROHIBITED.

property for which the exemption is claimed has received any other property tax
exemption authorized by law.

substance.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 455B.381[1])

Whenever a hazardous condition is created by the deposit, injection, dumping,

waters, the responsible person shall cause the condition to be remedied by a
cleanup, as defined in the preceding section, as rapidly as feasible to an
acceptable, safe condition. The costs of cleanup shall be borne by the

the present danger to the public health, safety and welfare, then no notice
shall be required and the City may proceed to procure the cleanup and bill the
responsible person for all costs associated with the cleanup. If the bill for
those services is not paid within 30 days, the City Attorney shall proceed to

MINORS
 
46.01 Curfew                 46.03 Contributing to Delinquency
46.02 Cigarettes and Tobacco
 
46.01 CURFEW.
The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote the
public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and specifically
to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults responsible for
minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors committed after
the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences and criminal
activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.
   1.   Definitions. For use in this section, the following terms are defined:
      A.   “Emergency errand” means, but is not limited to, an errand relating
to a fire, a natural disaster, an automobile accident or any other situation
requiring immediate action to prevent serious illness, bodily injury or loss of
life.
      B.   “Home” means the minor’s dwelling place. It need not be the minor’s
permanent dwelling place.
      C.   “Knowingly” means knowledge which a responsible adult should
reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that
responsible adult’s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful
or careless adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult
responsibility through an objective test. It is therefore no defense that an
adult responsible for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or
conduct or whereabouts of the minor.
      D.   “Minor” means any unemancipated person under the age of 18 years.
      E.   “Nonsecured custody” means custody in an unlocked multipurpose area,
such as a lobby, office or interrogation room which is not designed, set aside
or used as a secure detention area, and the person arrested is not physically
secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically
accompanied by a peace officer or a person employed by the facility where the
person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to providing
nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate juvenile
facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the person’s parents or
other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but not for
longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or
magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
      F.   “Public place” includes shopping centers, parking lots, parks,
playgrounds, streets, alleys and sidewalks dedicated to public use; and also
includes such parts of buildings and other premises whether publicly or
privately owned which are used by the general public or to which the general
public is invited commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the
general public is permitted without specific invitation; or to which the
general public has access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other
conveyance is considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.
      G.   “Responsible adult” means a parent, guardian or other adult
specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have
custody or control of a minor.
      H.   “Unemancipated” means unmarried and still under the custody or
control of a responsible adult.
   2.   Hours. It is unlawful for any minor to remain in or upon any public
place in the City between the hours of 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. of each day.
   3.   Exceptions. The following are exceptions to the curfew hours:
      A.   The minor is accompanied by a responsible adult.
      B.   The minor is on the sidewalk or property where the minor resides or
on either side of the place where the minor resides and the adult responsible
for the minor has given permission for the minor to be there.
      C.   The minor is present at or is traveling between home and one of the
following:
         (1)   Minor’s place of employment in a business, trade or occupation
in which the minor is permitted by law to be engaged or, if traveling, within
30 minutes after the end of work or within 30 minutes before the beginning of
work;
         (2)   Minor’s place of religious activity or, if traveling, within 30
minutes after the end of the religious activity or 30 minutes before beginning
such activity;
         (3)   Governmental or political activity or, if traveling, within 30
minutes after the end of the activity or 30 minutes before beginning such
activity;
         (4)   School activity or, if traveling, within 30 minutes after the
end of the activity or 30 minutes before beginning such activity;
         (5)   Assembly such as a march, protest, demonstration, sit-in or
meeting of an association for the advancement of economic, political, religious
or cultural matters, or for any other activity protected by the First Amendment
of the U.S. Constitution guarantees of free exercise of religion, freedom of
speech, freedom of assembly or, if traveling, within 30 minutes after the end
of the activity or 30 minutes before beginning such activity.
      D.   The minor is on an emergency errand for a responsible adult;
      E.   The minor is engaged in interstate travel through the City
beginning, ending or passing through the City when such travel is by direct
route.
   4.   Responsibility of Adults. It is unlawful for any responsible adult
knowingly to permit or to allow a minor to be in any public place in the City
within the time periods prohibited by this section unless the minor’s presence
falls within one of the above exceptions.
   5.   Enforcement Procedures.
      A.   Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in
the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driver’s
license, a peace officer on the street shall, in the first instance, use his or
her best judgment in determining age.
      B.   Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody. Grounds for arrest are
that the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the curfew; refuses to provide proper identification or to identify
himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the person’s own
safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who arrests a
minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in a shelter
care facility or in any non-secured setting. The officer shall not place bodily
restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor physically resists
or threatens physical violence when being taken into custody. A minor shall not
be placed in detention following a curfew violation unless by legal order from
a court with proper jurisdiction.
      C.   Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into
custody, the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the
minor as soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible
for the minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at
such time as the court may direct.
      D.   Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a peace officer determines that
a minor does not have adult supervision because the peace officer cannot locate
the minor’s parent, guardian or other person legally responsible for the care
of the minor, within a reasonable time, the peace officer shall attempt to
place the minor with an adult relative of the minor, an adult person who cares
for the child or another adult person who is known to the child.
   6.   Penalties.
      A.   Responsible Adult’s First Violation. In the case of a first
violation by a minor, the Police Chief shall, by certified mail, send to the
adult responsible for the minor, written notice of the violation with a warning
that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew
ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with applicable
penalties.
      B.   Responsible Adult’s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as
defined in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows
the minor to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a
simple misdemeanor.
      C.   Minor’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a
minor, the peace officer shall give the minor a written warning, which states
that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew
ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with applicable
penalties.
      D.   Minor’s Second Violation. For the minor’s second and subsequent
violations of any of the provisions of this section, the minor is guilty of a
simple misdemeanor.

department in order that the public may be constantly informed of the existence
of this section and its regulations.

purchase, or attempt to purchase any tobacco, tobacco products, alternative
nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes. Possession of tobacco,
tobacco products, alternative nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes
by an individual under 21 years of age shall not constitute a violation of this
section if the individual under 21 years of age possesses the tobacco, tobacco
products, alternative nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes as part
of the person's employment and said person is employed by a person who holds a
valid permit under Chapter 453A of the Code of Iowa or who lawfully offers for

Notes
  † EDITOR’S NOTE: A suggested form of notice for the abatement of nuisances is
  included in the Appendix of this Code of Ordinances. Caution is urged in the use
  of this administrative abatement procedure, particularly where cost of abatement

  in fact exist. If compliance is not secured following notice and hearings, we
  recommend you review the situation with your attorney before proceeding with

the premises or in any parking lots or areas, including but not limited to
public rights-of-way, adjacent to the premises:

not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes
employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage
treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having
jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.
97.05 RESTRICTED DISCHARGES; POWERS OF SUPERINTENDENT.
If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the
public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in Section 97.04 and which in the judgment of the
Superintendent may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes,
equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or
constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent may:
   1.   Rejection. Reject the wastes by requiring disconnection from the public
sewage system;
   2.   Pretreatment. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for
discharge to the public sewers;
   3.   Controls Imposed. Require control over the quantities and rates of
discharge; and/or
   4.   Special Charges. Require payment to cover the added cost of handling
and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under
the provisions of Chapter 99.
97.06 SPECIAL FACILITIES.
If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows,
the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the Superintendent and subject to the requirements of
all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws. Where preliminary treatment or
flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be
maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at
the owner’s expense.
97.07 CONTROL MANHOLES.
When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner’s
expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
97.08 TESTING OF WASTES.
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from
periodic grab samples).

99.01 PURPOSE.
It is determined and declared to be necessary and conducive to the protection
of the public health, safety, welfare and convenience of the City to collect
charges from all users who contribute wastewater to the City’s treatment works.
The proceeds of such charges so derived will be used for the purpose of
operating, maintaining and retiring the sewer revenue bond debt for said
treatment works.
99.02 DEFINITIONS.
For use in this chapter, the following additional terms are defined:
   1.   “Normal domestic wastewater” means wastewater that has a BOD
concentration of not more than 300 milligrams per liter and a suspended solids
concentration of not more than 350 milligrams per liter.
   2.   “Operation and maintenance” means all expenditures during the useful
life of the wastewater treatment works for materials, labor, utilities and
other items which are necessary for the management and maintenance of the
treatment works to achieve the capacity and performance for which such works
were designed and constructed.
   3.   “Replacement” means expenditures for obtaining and installing
equipment, accessories or appurtenances which are necessary during the useful
life of the treatment works to maintain the capacity and performance for which
such works were designed and constructed. “Replacement,” as referred to in this
chapter, is provided for under “(d) Improvement Fund” in the sewer revenue bond
resolution adopted by the Council on June 5, 1978.
   4.   “Treatment works” means any devices and systems used for the storage,
treatment, recycling and reclamation of municipal sewage, domestic sewage or
liquid industrial wastes. These include intercepting sewers, outfall sewers,
sewage collection systems, individual systems, pumping, power and other
equipment and their appurtenances; extensions, improvements, remodeling,
additions and alterations thereof; elements essential to provide a reliable
recycled supply such as standby treatment units and clear well facilities; and
any works, including site acquisition of the land, that will be an integral
part of the treatment process or used for ultimate disposal of residues
resulting from such treatment (including land for composting sludge, temporary
storage of such compost, and land used for the storage of treated wastewater in
land treatment systems before land application); or any other method or system
for preventing, abating, reducing, storing, treating, separating or disposing
of municipal waste or industrial waste discharged to the municipal sanitary
sewer system.
   5.   “Useful life” means the estimated period during which the treatment
works will be operated.
   6.   “User charge” means that portion of the total wastewater service charge
which is levied in a proportional and adequate manner for the cost of operation
and maintenance, replacement and retirement of sewer revenue bonds of the
treatment works.
   7.   “Water meter” means a water volume measuring and recording device,
furnished and/or installed by the City or furnished and/or installed by a user
and approved by the City.
99.03 APPLICABILITY.
The user rates established in this chapter apply to all users, regardless of
their location, of the City’s treatment works. However, the user charge rates
established in this chapter do not apply to permanent underground residential
sprinkler systems which are separately metered.
99.04 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING USER CHARGES; WATER METERS.
Each user shall pay monthly for the services provided by the City based on said
person’s use of the treatment works as determined by water meters acceptable to
the City. If a commercial or industrial contributor has a consumptive use of
water, or in some other manner uses water which is not returned to the
wastewater collection system, the user charge for that contributor may be based
on use of the treatment works as determined by wastewater meters or separate
water meters installed and maintained at the contributor’s expense, and in a
manner acceptable to the City.
99.05 USER CHARGES.
User Charges Effective June 1, 2020.
   1.   Each contributor of normal domestic wastewater shall pay a user charge
rate for operation and maintenance, including replacement and sewer revenue
bond debt service, of $26.00 for the first 1,000 gallons of water and $12.50
for each 1,000 gallons of water thereafter as determined in Section 99.04.
Regardless of the charge as calculated, each contributor shall pay a minimum
monthly charge of $26.00.
   2.   Each contributor of wastewater, the strength of which is greater than
normal domestic wastewater, shall pay a user charge rate for operation and
maintenance, including replacement and sewer revenue bond debt service, of
$26.00 for the first one thousand (1,000) gallons of water and $15.63 per one
thousand (1,000) additional gallons of water as determined in Section 99.04.
The $15.63 per 1,000 gallon rate is the normal domestic wastewater rate of
$12.50 per 1,000 gallons multiplied by a surcharge factor of 1.25. Regardless
of the charge as calculated, each contributor shall pay a minimum monthly
charge of $26.00.
(Ord. 1769 – Jun. 25 Supp.)
   3.   Each contributor who has a residential or commercial footing tile or
sump pump connection to the City sanitary sewer system or a leaking sanitary
sewer service shall pay an additional user charge as described in the City of
Indianola’s Infiltration and Inflow Policy. By this reference the City of
Indianola’s Infiltration and Inflow Policy, as it may be amended from time to
time, is hereby incorporated into this subsection and made a part of this
chapter as if fully set forth herein.
99.06 DISCHARGES INCREASING CITY’S TREATMENT COSTS TO BE PAID FOR BY USER.
Any user who discharges any toxic pollutants which cause an increase in the
cost of managing the effluent or the sludge from the City’s treatment works, or
any user who discharges any substance which singly or by interaction with other
substances causes identifiable increases in the cost of operation, maintenance
or replacement of the treatment works, shall pay for such increased costs. The
charge to each such user shall be as determined by the City.
99.07 DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   1.   Use. The user charge system shall generate adequate annual revenues to
pay the costs of:
      A.   Annual operation and maintenance;
      B.   Replacement, as defined herein; and
      C.   Costs associated with sewer revenue bond debt retirement for
financing that portion of the treatment works which the City has, by
resolution, designated to be paid by the user charge system.
   2.   Deposit to Accounts. That portion of the total user charge collected
which is designated for operation and maintenance, including replacement, shall
be deposited in separate non-lapsing funds defined and provided for in said
bond resolution, as follows:
      A.   A fund, referred to in the bond resolution as “(a) Operation and
Maintenance Fund” shall be used to defray operation and maintenance costs.
      B.   A fund, referred to in said bond resolution as “(d) Improvement
Fund” shall be used for replacements to the treatment works, as defined herein.
In addition to the requirements of the bond resolution, said improvement fund
shall be continued throughout the useful life of the treatment works in the
required amounts shown in the bond resolution even though the resolution should
become null and void by virtue of the retirement of the bonds or for any other
reason.
   3.   Accounting System to Be Maintained. Should the bond resolution become
null and void for any reason, the same accounting system for operation and
maintenance and replacement will be maintained as set forth in said resolution.
   4.   Carry Forward of Year-End Balances; Use for Designated Purposes Only;
Exception. Fiscal year-end balances shall be carried over to the same funds as
provided for in the bond resolution and shall be used for no other purposes
than those designated. If revenue is taken from the improvement fund
established in the bond resolution for principal and interest payments or for
any other purpose, then the revenue will be returned, as stated in said
resolution, by either direct payment or from the proceeds from an adjustment in
user charges.
99.08 REVIEW OF USER CHARGE SYSTEM.
The City shall review the user charge system once every year and revise user
charge rates as necessary to ensure that the system generates adequate revenues
to pay the costs of operation, maintenance, replacement and sewer revenue bond
debt service and that the system continues to provide for the proportional
distribution of operation and maintenance costs, including replacement, among
users. The City shall notify each user, at least annually, of the user charge
rates.
99.09 BILLING FOR SEWER SERVICE.
Sewer service shall be billed as part of a combined service account, payable in
accordance with the following:

100.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish sewer connection charges for
certain properties within the City to recover the costs of designing and
constructing major sanitary sewer facilities from property owners who connect
to such facilities subsequent to their construction. In the event the Council
determines the necessity of constructing a major sanitary sewer facility and
determines that the utilization of a connection charge is the most equitable
manner in which to recover the City’s costs associated therewith, the Council
shall first hold a public hearing on the proposed adoption of an ordinance to
establish a benefited district and a connection charge.
100.02 DEFINITIONS.
The following terms are defined for use in this chapter:
   1.   “Benefited district” means that area of the City to which sanitary
sewer service can feasibly be provided by a major sanitary sewer facility of a
given design and capacity.
   2.   “Connection” means the act of connecting the building sewer of a
residential structure to a lateral sewer or manhole constituting a part of a
major sanitary sewer facility, or the act of connecting a lateral sewer serving
a subdivision to a trunk sewer or manhole constituting a part of a major
sanitary sewer facility.
   3.   “Major sanitary sewer facility or facilities” means and includes
sanitary sewer trunk lines and sanitary sewer interceptors equal to or greater
than eight inches in diameter, and sanitary sewer force mains, pumping stations
and detention basins.
100.03 CONNECTION CHARGE REQUIRED.
After the effective date of the ordinance establishing a benefited district and
a connection charge, no owner of property within the district, whose property
is eligible for connection to the sanitary sewer facility, shall make such
connection until the required connection charge has been paid. The sewer
connection charge required by this chapter is in addition to, and not in lieu
of, any other fees required under the plumbing code or other provisions of this
Code of Ordinances. In the event a property owner makes a connection to the
sanitary sewer facility without having paid the required connection charge, the

sanitary sewer utility until such time as the property owner has received a
permit for the connection and paid the required connection fee. In addition,
the City may pursue any other remedy allowed by law.

additional 0.1 ERU and shall be the smallest increment for billing purposes.
   6.   “Impervious surface area” means those areas which prevent or impede the
infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it enters in natural conditions
prior to development. Common impervious surface areas include, but are not
limited to, rooftops, sidewalks, driveways, patios, parking lots, storage areas
and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of
stormwater runoff which existed prior to development. “Impervious surface area”
does not mean gravel surfaces.

important factor being the amount of impervious surface area on each parcel of
developed property. The stormwater management fees shall be determined by
ordinance of the City Council.
   11.   “Stormwater management systems and facilities” address the issue of
drainage management (flooding) and environmental quality (pollution, erosion

adopted by the jurisdiction in which the FSE is located. Where no code is
adopted, the construction and installation shall be in accordance with the Iowa
State Plumbing Code and this chapter. Grease interceptors using materials other
than concrete require approval by the Building Official, and shall comply with
the conditions of such approval, if any.
   4.   The building official or other designated official of the governmental
subchapter within which the FSE is located shall inspect each grease
interceptor installation made pursuant to this chapter, shall review all
relevant information regarding the rated performance of the grease interceptor,
and the building plan and facility site plan for the building and site where
the grease interceptor has been installed, and shall approve such grease
interceptor installation upon determination that the grease interceptor meets
all applicable standards and requirements.
   5.   Grease interceptors shall have a minimum capacity of 1,000 gallons and
shall not exceed 5,000 gallons for a single unit. Where a capacity greater than

by maintaining a minimum flowline depth of 42" below finished grade.
107.08 OPERATION, MAINTENANCE AND CLEANING OF GREASE INTERCEPTORS AND GREASE
TRAPS AND GREASE HAULER CERTIFICATION.
   1.   The owner or operator of an FSE which is required to pass wastewater
through a grease interceptor or trap shall operate and maintain the grease
interceptor or trap so that wastewater exiting the grease interceptor or trap
shall not exceed 400 milligrams per liter of FOG.
   2.   The owner or operator of the FSE shall cause the grease interceptor or
trap to be cleaned as hereinafter required when FOG and solids reach 25 percent
of the design liquid level of the grease interceptor or trap, or sooner if
necessary to prevent carry over of FOG from the grease interceptor or trap into
the City sanitary sewer system. Interceptors and traps shall be cleaned at
three-month intervals or less. A longer cleaning interval must be approved by
the Superintendent or Building Official. If the owner or operator of the FSE,
or an employee of the owner or operator, has a grease hauler certification from
the WRA indicating satisfactory completion of the course of training offered by
the WRA on the cleaning of grease interceptors and traps, such person or
persons may clean the grease trap in the facility included in such grease
hauler's certification. Failure to adequately clean the grease trap, properly
dispose of all grease trap waste, or maintain certification pursuant to Section
107.08.
   3.   Any person who cleans a grease interceptor or trap shall do so in
accordance with the following procedures and requirements. The person cleaning
the grease interceptor or trap shall:
      A.   Completely empty and remove the contents (liquids and sludge) of all
vaults of the grease interceptor or trap, and remove the grease mat and
scrapings from the interior walls. As part of each cleaning of a grease
interceptor or trap, the owner or operator of the FSE or the licensed waste
hauler employed by the FSE owner or operator, shall perform the following
maintenance activities:
         (1)   Check that the sanitary "tees" on the inlet and outlet sides of
the grease interceptor are not obstructed, loose, or missing.
         (2)   Verify that the baffle is secure and in place.
         (3)   Inspect the grease interceptor or trap for any cracks or other
defects.
         (4)   Check that lids are securely and properly seated after
completion of cleaning.
      B.   Not deposit waste and wastewater removed from a grease interceptor
or trap back into the grease interceptor or trap from which the waste or
wastewater was removed or into any other grease interceptor or trap, for the
purpose of reducing the volume of waste and wastewater to be disposed of.
      C.   Not introduce enzymes, emulsifying chemicals, hot water or other
agents into a grease interceptor or trap to dissolve or emulsify grease or as a
grease abatement method. Introduction of bacteria as a grease degradation agent
is permitted with prior written approval by the Superintendent or Building
Official.
      D.   Dispose of waste and wastewater removed from a grease interceptor or
trap at a facility approved for disposal of such waste by the Superintendent or
Building Official. Waste and wastewater removed from a grease interceptor or
trap shall not be discharged to any private sanitary or storm sewer or to the
City sanitary or storm sewer system. The waste hauler shall provide a copy of
the disposal receipt for all waste and wastewater removed from a grease
interceptor or trap to the owner or operator of the FSE.
      E.   Not use an automatic grease removal system to clean a grease
interceptor without prior written approval of the Superintendent or Building
Official, and, if the use of an automatic grease removal system is approved,
shall operate same in a manner that the grease wastewater discharge limit, as
measured from the system's outlet, is consistently achieved.
         (1)   The WRRD Superintendent or Building Official may make exceptions
to the above requirements or may approve alternative operational requirements
or cleaning and maintenance methods, provided that such exceptions or approvals
shall be made in writing by the Superintendent or Building Official.
         (2)   The WRRD Superintendent or Building Official may issue a grease
hauler certification upon satisfactory completion of the course of training
offered by the WRA on the proper maintenance and cleaning of grease
interceptors and traps, disposal procedures and record keeping. Such
certification shall be for a period of five years and shall be in effect for
the person receiving such training and for the FSE site for which such person
is the owner, operator or employee thereof.
107.09 RECORDS AND RECORD KEEPING.
The owner or operator of an FSE which is required to pass wastewater through a
grease interceptor or trap:
   1.   Shall provide, operate and maintain, at its expense, safe and
accessible monitoring facilities (such as a suitable manhole), and shall make
such monitoring facilities available for inspection, and for sampling and flow
measurement of the building sewer or internal drainage systems. There shall be
ample room in or near such monitoring facility to allow accurate sampling and
preparation of samples for analysis.
   2.   Shall allow personnel authorized by the Superintendent or Building
Official or by the City building official or designee, bearing proper

same shall be so placed as not to unreasonably interfere with the construction
of any water pipes, drain or sewer or the flow of water therefrom, which have
been or may hereafter be located by authority of the City.
110.04 LOCATION AND RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.
The Company shall, excluding facilities located in private easements (whether
titled in Company exclusively or in Company and other entities), in accordance
with Iowa law including Company’s tariff on file with and made effective by the
Iowa Utilities Board as may subsequently be amended (“Tariff”), at its cost and
expense, locate and relocate its existing facilities or equipment in, on, over
or under any public street or alley in the City in such a manner as the City
may reasonably require for the purposes of facilitating the construction
reconstruction, maintenance or repair of the street or alley. If the City has a
reasonable alternative route for the street, alley or public improvements or an
alternative construction method, which would not cause the relocation of the
Company installations, the City shall select said alternative route, or
construction method. The City shall be responsible for surveying and staking
the right-of-way for City projects that require the Company to relocate Company
facilities. If requested, the City shall provide, at no cost to the Company,
copies of its relocation plan and profile and cross section drawings. If tree
removals must be completed by the City as part of the City's project and are
necessary whether or not utility facilities must be relocated, the City at its
own cost shall be responsible for said removals. If the timing of the tree
removals does not coincide with the Company facilities relocation schedule and
Company must remove trees that are included in the City's portion of the

Company for the expenses incurred to remove said trees. If project funds from a
source other than the City are available to pay for the relocation of utility
facilities, the City shall attempt to secure said funds and provide them to the
Company to compensate the Company for the costs of relocation.
110.05 EXCAVATIONS.
In making excavations in any streets, avenues, alleys and public places for the
installation of gas pipes, conduits or apparatus, Company shall not
unreasonably obstruct the use of the streets and shall replace the surface,
restoring it to the condition as existed immediately prior to excavation.
Company agrees any replacement of road surface shall conform to current City
code regarding its depth and composition. The Company shall not be required to
restore or modify public right of way, sidewalks or other area in or adjacent
to the Company project to a condition superior to its immediate previously
existing condition or to a condition exceeding its previously existing
condition to the extent any alterations are required for the City to comply
with City, State or federal rules, regulations or law.
110.06 UTILITY EASEMENTS.
Vacating a street, avenue, alley, public ground or public right-of-way shall
not deprive the Company of its right to operate and maintain existing
facilities on, below, above, or beneath the vacated property. Prior to the City
abandoning or vacating any street, avenue, alley or public ground where the
Company has facilities in the vicinity, the City shall grant the Company
easements for said facilities.

its existing facilities or equipment in order to directly or indirectly
facilitate the project of a commercial or private developer or other non-public
entity, City shall reimburse or the City shall require the developer or non-
public entity to reimburse the Company for the cost of such relocation as a
precondition to relocation. The Company shall not be required to relocate in
order to facilitate such private project at its expense.

The Company shall indemnify and save harmless the City from any and all claims,
suits, losses, damages, costs or expenses, on account of injury or damage to
any person or property, to the extent caused or occasioned by the Company’s
negligence in construction, reconstruction, excavation, operation or
maintenance of the natural gas facilities authorized by this franchise;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to defend, indemnity
and save harmless the City for any costs or damages to the extent arising from
the negligence of the City, its officers, employees or agents.
110.10 INFORMATION.
Upon reasonable request the Company shall provide the City, on a project
specific basis, information indicating the horizontal location, relative to
boundaries of the right-of-way, of all equipment which it owns or over which it
has control that is located in City right-of-way, including documents, maps and
other information in paper or electronic or other forms (“information”). The
Company and City recognize the information may in whole or part be considered a
confidential record under state or federal law or both. Therefore, the City
shall not release any information without prior consent of the Company and
shall return the information to Company upon request. City recognizes that
Company claims the information may constitute a trade secret or is otherwise
protected from public disclosure by state or federal law on other grounds and
agrees to retain the information in its non-public files. Furthermore, the City

required to assist the City in identifying customers or calculating any
franchise fee refunds for groups of or individual customers, the Company shall
provide such information.
110.18 OTHER FRANCHISE FEES.
At any time after the City enters into a franchise agreement with another
person to sell natural gas at retail to City consumers and a franchise fee or
its lawful equivalent is imposed at zero or a lesser rate than provided in this
ordinance, either City or Company may provide written notice to the other to
amend the franchise agreement to address the level of the franchise fees then
imposed or scheduled to take effect during the term of this franchise
agreement. The parties shall have a six-month period after the date of the
written notice to negotiate such an amendment to the franchise agreement. The
parties may negotiate changes in the levels of fees during this period, or, if
they cannot agree upon such an amendment, either party shall have the
unilateral right to terminate the franchise.
110.19 HOME RULE POWER.
The City reserves to itself all home rule power and authority.
110.20 TERMINATION.

deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented
entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of
this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials.

      F.   Proof of registration with the Iowa One-Call system.
   2.   Each right-of-way user registration, and registration by the City,
shall be accompanied by such registration fee as shall be set from time to time

particular utility, or that utility is tax exempt.
   3.   All new utility extensions, feeders, loops or other means of service or
distribution of electric, communication, or cable television shall be placed
underground whether within a public utility easement or public right-of-way,
unless an exemption has been granted as provided in Section
134.03. This subsection does not apply to those existing systems that have been
damaged, relocated for public improvement projects, or the upgrading of a
system that does not consist of more than 50 percent of existing poles.
   4.   The purpose of the registration required by this section is to assist
the City in enforcement of its regulations and to assist the City in the
abatement of dangerous conditions or conditions that threaten to interfere with
the property of others by reason of the registrant’s facilities.
134.03 COUNCIL EXEMPTION.
Whenever, because of unusual circumstances, or practical difficulties involved
in carrying out the provisions of this chapter, the Council may grant a
specific exemption for individual situations. Any person, firm or corporation
requesting an exemption from the strict application of this chapter may make
application to the Council for the granting of such application, provided that:
   1.   A written request for such an exemption is submitted indicating the
section of this chapter from which the applicant requests the exemption and
stating the grounds on which it is requested.
   2.   No such exemption shall be granted by the Council without a public
hearing. Notice thereof shall be given at least four days but no more than 20
days in advance of the hearing by a single publication in a newspaper of
general circulation within the City.
   3.   The Council may grant the exemption with such safeguards as it feels
are necessary in order to conform with the intents and purposes of this chapter

affect the public interest.
134.04 RIGHT-OF-WAY INSTALLATION PERMITS.
   1.   A right-of-way user shall obtain, by application to the Building and
Zoning Department, a permit for installation in the City right-of-way whenever
the right-of-way user desires to place, construct, or bury anything in the City
right-of-way. No permit is required if the Building and Zoning Official
determines that the work is routine maintenance. Such application shall be
accompanied by:
      A.   Written and graphic material that states and shows the particular
part of or point on the City right-of-way where placement, construction, or
excavation is proposed to occur.
      B.   A statement of the beginning and ending dates for the time during

      C.   Notification to all other registered right-of-way users, the City of
Indianola, with facilities (adjacent to/within 30 feet) in the vicinity of the
proposed installation or repair work have reviewed the plan for the proposed
work and have no objection. So as not to have undue delay, the right-of-way
user making application for the permit need only wait ten working days from the
time of submitting its plans to the other right-of-way users. Failure by a
right-of-way user to respond to Building and Zoning Official such requested
plan review within ten days shall constitute an expression of no objection. If
there is a dispute between right-of-way users as to location of the respective
facilities in a manner reasonably consistent with how various kinds of
facilities of each segment of City right-of-way, the Building and Zoning
Official shall determine the placement of such facilities in a manner
reasonable.
      D.   Plans and specifications for the proposed work in such detail as the
Building and Zoning Official shall reasonably require to show that the work as
proposed conforms to City ordinances, regulations, and policies.
      E.   A fee for a permit required by this section shall be as set by
Resolution of the City Council.
(Ord. 1646 - Sep. 20 Supp.)
   2.   In making excavations in the City right-of-way, the right-of-way user
shall do the work in a manner devised to cause the least possible inconvenience
to the public.
   3.   The right-of-way user shall properly protect, according to safety
standards generally accepted at the time that the installation in the City
right-of-way occurs, all excavations and obstructions by proper placement of
barricades, warning lights, and such other or additional devices in accordance
with The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, as circumstances may
warrant. If, in the opinion of the Building and Zoning Official, such
excavation or obstruction is not properly and safely protected, the Building
and Zoning Official shall notify the right-of-way user and the right-of-way
user shall comply immediately with the instructions of the Building and Zoning
Official. Failure or refusal by the right-of-way user to follow such
instructions shall constitute a violation of this section.
   4.   Any trenches or excavations opened by a right-of-way user in the City
right-of-way shall be filled by the right-of-way user. All backfilling in the
City right-of-way shall be done in accordance with City specifications.
   5.   Temporary street surfacing shall be placed in excavations in a City
street as soon as the same has been backfilled. Pavements, sidewalks, curbs and
gutters, or other portions of streets and public places opened, disturbed, or
damaged shall be promptly restored and replaced with like materials at the
expense of the right-of-way user and left in as good a condition as before the
opening, disturbance, or damage occurred. In the event that like materials for
replacement are not available, the Building and Zoning Official may approve the
use of an alternative material that is reasonably close in effect to the
original material. The Building and Zoning Official will consider and evaluate
for approved use, on a case by case basis, such alternative methods that meet
standards of good engineering practice.
   6.   Where a cut or disturbance is made by a right-of-way user to a section
of a street or a sidewalk paving, rather than replacing only the area cut, the
right-of-way user shall replace the full width of the existing sidewalk or
street paving and the full length of the section or sections cut, a section
being that area marked by expansion joints or scoring, or as directed by the
City.
   7.   Right-of-way users shall maintain, repair, and keep in good condition
for a period of two years following such disturbance all portions of the City
street surface disturbed by a right-of-way user.
   8.   No right-of-way user or any person acting on the right-of-way user’s
behalf shall commence any non-emergency work on the City right-of-way without
five working days’ advance notice to the City. In the event of an emergency
involving public safety, the Building and Zoning Official may issue the permit
orally, but the written documentation of the application for and issuance of
the permit shall be completed as soon as practicable after the work has
started.
   9.   Street crossings and sidewalk crossings by right-of-way user facilities
shall be bored at those locations where reasonably required by the Building and
Zoning Official. Some examples of where such boring may be required are: major
streets, new streets, and locations of major events that conflict with
construction.
   10.   No permit shall be issued for the installation of right-of-way user
facilities in the City right-of-way unless the right-of-way user has filed with
the City a registration statement in accordance with Section 134.02 above.
   11.   No permit for installation of right-of-way user facilities in the City
right-of-way shall be issued by the Building and Zoning Official unless the
right-of-way user has paid such installation permit fee as shall be established
from time to time by resolution of the City Council.
   12.   All trees, landscaping and grounds removed, damaged or disturbed as a
result of installations by a right-of-way user in the City right-of-way shall
be replaced or restored as soon as reasonably possible, unless it is determined
by the Building and Zoning Official to be unnecessary or landscaping is in
violation of this Code of Ordinances.
134.05 COMPLETION OF INSTALLATIONS.
A right-of-way user shall promptly complete all installations in the City
right-of-way so as to minimize disruption of the City ways and other public and
private property. All installation work authorized by permit within the City
right-of-way, including restoration work, shall be completed as soon as
possible but not later than 180 days of the date the Building and Zoning
Official issued a permit for the installation. An extension may be granted for
good cause due to circumstances beyond the control of the right-of-way user.
134.06 AS-BUILT DRAWINGS.
A right-of-way user shall, within 60 days of making an installation of
facilities in the City right-of-way, furnish the City with one complete set of
as-built drawings, in an electronic format compatible with the City’s mapping
system, drawn to scale and certified by the contact person for the right-of-way
user as accurately depicting the location of the facilities installed pursuant
to the permit. When the Building and Zoning Official has issued a single
installation permit document relative to multiple installations linked in a
single project, the as-built drawings pertaining to those installations are not
required as aforesaid until 60 days after completion of all installations to be
done for the project.
134.07 INTERFERENCE WITH THE CITY.
A right-of-way user shall so construct, maintain, operate, and locate its
facilities in the City right-of-way so as not to interfere with the
construction, location, maintenance, and operation of City sanitary sewer,
drainage, communication, signal and fiber optic facilities, or any other
operations or facilities of the City. The City shall have the right and power
by resolution of its City Council, or by order of the Building and Zoning
Official, to specifically direct the location of right-of-way user facilities
with reference to City facilities, existing or proposed, in such a manner as
shall serve the public use and convenience. Failure or refusal by a right-of-
way user to promptly follow such directions shall be a violation of this
section.
134.08 NEW SUBDIVISION AND SCENIC AREAS.
To minimize interference and conflict with the City and other utility
locations, the following utility locations shall be required:
   1.   Electric lines shall be placed on public utility easement within five
feet of the private property line furthest from the right-of-way.
   2.   Electronic communication or any form of telecommunications lines shall
be placed within the public utility easement no closer than five feet from the
electric lines or five feet from the right-of-way line.

four feet on either side of the curb line when possible.
   6.   Gas mains shall be placed along the south and east right-of-way no
closer than four feet or further than seven feet from existing or proposed curb
line.
   7.   Distances from curb will be modified along cul-de-sacs and paving
widths in excess of 25 feet.

Within 60 days following written notice from the City, a right-of-way user
shall, at its own expense, temporarily or permanently relocate, change or alter
the position of any facilities within the City right-of-way whenever the City
shall have determined that such relocation, change or alteration is reasonably
necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any
City public improvement, or for the operations of the City in or upon the City
right-of-way.
134.10 REMOVAL OF UNAUTHORIZED FACILITIES.
Within 30 days following written notice from the City, a right-of-way user that
owns, controls or maintains any unauthorized facility within the City right-of-
way shall remove such facilities from the City right-of-way at the right-of-way
users sole expense. A facility is unauthorized if:
   1.   Any license, permit, or authorization required by federal, State or
City regulations with respect to the facilities has not been obtained, or has
been revoked, or allowed to expire.
   2.   The facilities are not installed in accordance with the permit for
installation or other requirements of this chapter.
134.11 COMPLIANCE WITH PERMIT.
All installation work and activities for right-of-way user facilities in the
City right-of-way shall be in accordance with the installation permit issued by
the Building and Zoning Official. Any work done that is not in accordance with
an applicable installation permit shall be a violation of this section by the
right-of-way user; and, failure to do work required by an installation permit
shall be a violation by the right-of-way user, regardless of involvement of
agents or contractors of the right-of-way user. The Building and Zoning
Official is not responsible for on site inspections.
134.12 EMERGENCY REMOVAL OR RELOCATION.
The City shall have the right and power to cut or move any right-of-way
facilities in the City right-of-way as the City may determine to be necessary,
appropriate or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. The
City shall endeavor to give notice of such emergency disruption, but nothing in
this chapter shall be deemed to create a duty to such notice. Restoration of
right-of-way facilities that have been cut or moved as aforesaid shall be done
by the right-of-way user at its own expense.
134.13 COORDINATION OF INSTALLATIONS.
All right-of-way users with facilities in the City right-of-way or who expect
to install facilities in the City right-of-way shall coordinate such activities
with the City and with each other right-of-way user.
134.14 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   1.   A right-of-way user that has or expects to install facilities within
the City right-of-way shall maintain in effect such insurance appropriate to
the nature of the facilities installed or to be installed and to the location
of such installations. This subsection does not apply to the City, its
utilities, or franchised utilities, which are covered under other ordinances.
   2.   The Building and Zoning Official may require performance security in an
amount commensurate with the scope of the work, to secure satisfactory
installation in accordance with the installation permit, by means of an
irrevocable letter of credit in a form approved by the City Attorney, or by
cash deposit.
134.15 POLE ATTACHMENTS.
   1.   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a right-of-way user
to attach its facilities to the poles of the City municipal electric utility,
or to the utility poles of any other right-of-way user. Installation of right-
of-way user facilities underground in the same places where other right-of-way
user facilities are attached to an existing set of utility poles shall be
permitted.
   2.   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to confer upon any right-of-way
user any right or entitlement to make any attachment to the utility poles of
the City municipal electric utility or to the utility poles of any other right-
of-way user.
   3.   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the City municipal
electric utility from requiring any right-of-way user to make a payment of a
pole attachment fee and “make ready” charges for attachment of facilities to
the utility poles of the City municipal electric utility and to enter into and
abide by the terms and conditions of a pole attachment agreement.
   4.   At those locations on the City right-of-way where there are already
existing utility poles of either the City municipal electric utility or of some
other right-of-way user, a second set of permanent poles is strictly
prohibited, except when done by or at the request of the City. If there is not
sufficient space on the existing utility poles for attachment of the proposed
additional right-of-way user facilities, or if the right-of-way user proposing
to install right-of-way user facilities at the site of the existing poles
cannot reach an agreement with the owner of the poles to allow attachment of
those facilities, then those facilities shall be installed underground.
134.16 APPEAL TO CITY COUNCIL.
A right-of-way user that is denied registration, denied a right-of-way
installation permit, that has its right-of-way installation permit revoked, or
that believes that the fees imposed do not conform to the requirements of
Chapter 480A, Code of Iowa, may request in writing that such denial, revocation
or fee imposition be reviewed by the City Council. The City Council shall act
within 60 days of a timely written request. A decision by the City Council
affirming the denial, revocation, or fee imposition must be in writing and
supported by a written finding establishing the reasonableness of the decision.
134.17 NO EASEMENT; PERMISSION ONLY; NOT ASSIGNABLE.
The provisions of this chapter, and the permits and authorizations granted
pursuant to this chapter, shall not be deemed to create or grant to anyone any
easement, estate, or interest in the property of the City. A permit to install
right-of-way user facilities in the City right-of-way is a mere license, that
is, an authorization to the stated entity to go onto the land of the City to do
only that which is explicitly stated by the permit, that may be revoked by the
City as provided in this chapter, and that cannot be assigned to another. A
right-of-way user that occupies City right-of-way or makes an installation of
facilities in the City right-of-way on the basis of a purported assignment of
an installation permit granted to another entity, shall be in violation of this
section.

not prevent any person from washing or cleaning his or her own vehicle or
equipment when it is lawfully parked in the street or alley.
135.08 BURNING PROHIBITED.
No person shall burn any trash, leaves, rubbish, or other combustible material
in any curb and gutter or on any paved or surfaced street or alley.
135.09 EXCAVATIONS.
No person shall dig, excavate or in any manner disturb any street, parking or
alley except in accordance with the following:
   1.   Permit Required. No excavation shall be commenced without first
obtaining a permit therefor. A written application for such permit shall be
filed with the City and shall contain the following:
      A.   An exact description of the property, by lot and street number, in
front of or along which it is desired to excavate.
      B.   A statement of the purpose, for whom and by whom the excavation is
to be made.
      C.   The person responsible for the refilling of said excavation and
restoration of the street or alley surface.
      D.   Date of commencement of the work and estimated completion date.
No permit shall be issued unless the contractor or the property owner desiring
the work to be done gives three hours’ notice of the proposed excavation to the
Street Superintendent.
   2.   Public Convenience. Streets and alleys shall be opened in the manner
which will cause the least inconvenience to the public and admit the
uninterrupted passage of water along the gutter on the street.
   3.   Barricades, Fencing and Lighting. Adequate barricades, fencing and
warning lights meeting standards specified by the City shall be so placed as to
protect the public from hazard. Any costs incurred by the City in providing or
maintaining adequate barricades, fencing or warning lights shall be paid to the
City by the permit holder/property owner.
   4.   Bond or Cash Deposit Required.
      A.   The application for a permit shall be accompanied by a surety bond
in the amount of $1,000.00, or in the event that the applicant desires, the
applicant may procure a blanket bond in an amount of not less than $5,000.00.
The blanket bond can be used for any number of permits, so long as the bond is
in effect for the entire duration of the maintenance period, and the cost of
all projects for which the bond stands as security does not exceed the amount
of the blanket bond. For these purposes, costs shall be computed at $10.00 per
square foot for the area excavated and replaced. Any bond issued under this
section shall be drawn on a surety company authorized to do business in the
State of Iowa, and shall guarantee to the City that the streets so excavated
shall be replaced to the City’s specifications, and shall further guarantee
that if the replacement area should require any maintenance within two years
after its completion and acceptance by the City’s Street Superintendent, the
maintenance shall be done at the owner’s or contractor’s expense.
      B.   In lieu of either of the bonds permitted by Paragraph A, the
applicant for the permit may make a cash deposit in the amount of $10.00 per
square foot of the proposed excavation. The return of the cash deposit shall be
conditioned upon the replacement of the streets to the City’s specifications,
and shall be further conditioned on the excavated street not requiring any
repair for a period of two years after its completion and acceptance by the
City’s Street Superintendent.
      C.   In the event the street is not replaced to the City’s satisfaction,
or in the event that the replacement requires repairs within two years after
its acceptance by the Street Superintendent, the City may make the replacement
or repair at the owner’s or contractor’s expense. After a period of two years
has passed since the final approval of the relaying and repairing of the
surface of a street or alley, the Street Superintendent, if no repair is
required, may then order the deposit or bond required by this section, or any
part thereof, to be returned to the owner or contractor.
   5.   Insurance Required. Each applicant shall also file a certificate of
insurance indicating that the applicant is carrying public liability insurance
in effect for the duration of the permit covering the applicant and all agents
and employees for the following minimum amounts:
      A.   Bodily Injury - $50,000.00 per person; $100,000.00 per accident.
      B.   Property Damage - $50,000.00 per accident.
   6.   Restoration of Public Property. Streets, sidewalks, alleys and other
public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored to the
condition of the property prior to the commencement of the work, or in a manner
satisfactory to the City, at the expense of the permit holder/property owner.
   7.   Inspection. All work shall be subject to inspection by the City.
Backfill shall not be deemed completed, nor resurfacing of any improved street
or alley surface begun, until such backfill is inspected and approved by the
City. The permit holder/property owner shall provide the City with notice at
least 24 hours prior to the time when inspection of backfill is desired.
   8.   Completion by the City. Should any excavation in any street or alley be
discontinued or left open and unfinished for a period of 24 hours after the
approved completion date, or in the event the work is improperly done, the City
has the right to finish or correct the excavation work and charge any expenses
therefor to the permit holder/property owner.
   9.   Responsibility for Costs. All costs and expenses incident to the
excavation shall be borne by the permit holder and/or property owner. The
permit holder and owner shall indemnify the City from any loss or damage that
may directly or indirectly be occasioned by such excavation.
   10.   Notification. At least 48 hours prior to the commencement of the
excavation, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, the person
performing the excavation shall contact the Statewide Notification Center and
provide the center with the information required under Section 480.4 of the
Code of Iowa.
   11.   Permit Issued. Upon approval of the application and filing of bond and
insurance certificate, a permit shall be issued. The Street Superintendent
shall give directions for cutting the pavement or surface of the street or
alley. The permit, when issued, shall be signed by the contractor or property
owner, or both, if the Street Superintendent so directs, and shall provide that
the contractor or owner, or both, if the Street Superintendent directs, shall
guarantee to properly do the work and restore the surface of the street and
protect and save harmless the City from any and all liability. A separate
permit shall be required for each excavation.
135.10 PROPERTY OWNER’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAINTENANCE.
The abutting property owner shall maintain all property outside the lot and
property lines and inside the curb lines upon public streets and shall keep
such area in a safe condition, free from nuisances, obstructions, and hazards.
In the absence of a curb, such property shall extend from the property line to
that portion of the public street used or improved for vehicular purposes. The
abutting property owner shall not be required to remove diseased trees or dead
wood on the publicly owned property or right-of-way. Maintenance includes, but
is not limited to, timely mowing, trimming trees and shrubs, and picking up
litter and debris. The abutting property owner may be liable for damages caused
by failure to maintain the publicly owned property or right-of-way.† 7
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[2c])
 
Notes
7 † EDITOR’S NOTE: See also Section 136.04 relating to property owner’s
  responsibility for maintenance of sidewalks.
135.11 FAILURE TO MAINTAIN.
If the abutting property owner does not perform an action required under the
above section within a reasonable time, the City may perform the required
action and assess the cost against the abutting property for collection in the
same manner as a property tax.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[2e])
135.12 DUMPING OF SNOW.
It is unlawful for any person to throw, push, or place or cause to be thrown,
pushed or placed, any ice or snow from private property, sidewalks, or
driveways onto the traveled way of a street or alley so as to obstruct gutters,
or impede the passage of vehicles upon the street or alley or to create a
hazardous condition therein; except where, in the cleaning of large commercial
drives in the business district it is absolutely necessary to move the snow
onto the street or alley temporarily, such accumulation shall be removed
promptly by the property owner or agent. Arrangements for the prompt removal of
such accumulations shall be made prior to moving the snow.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[2])
135.13 DRIVEWAY CULVERTS.
The property owner shall, at the owner’s expense, install any culvert deemed
necessary under any driveway or any other access to the owner’s property, and
before installing a culvert, permission must first be obtained from the City.
In the event repairs are needed at any time with respect to culverts, it shall
be the responsibility of the property owner to make such repairs, and, in the
event the owner fails to do so, the City shall have the right to make the
repairs. If the property owner fails to reimburse the City for the cost of said
repairs, the cost shall be certified to the County Treasurer and specially
assessed against the property as by law provided.
135.14 DRIVEWAY AND CURB CUT STANDARDS.
   1.   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to ensure safe and efficient
access to or from the public street network by establishing standards to
protect the capacity for handling peak traffic volumes of public streets, to
maintain smooth traffic flow, to control the location and number of access
points, to separate and control intersection conflict areas, and to provide
adequate spacing between driveways. These standards help to ensure that the
city's street network is designed to balance the functions of access to
adjoining property, pedestrian circulation, and vehicular traffic circulation.
This chapter has been established to meet the following objectives:
      A.   To provide maximum safety and protection to the public through the
regulation of vehicles entering and exiting public streets;
      B.   To provide a uniform ordinance for the design, location, operation,
and construction of driveways throughout the City of Indianola; and
      C.   To provide owners of abutting property with the maximum service
feasible, consistent with the safe and efficient use of the public streets.
   2.   Definitions.
      A.   The word "shall" is mandatory and the word "may" is permissive.
      B.   As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the
definitions set out below:

for through traffic and which is designed to carry large volumes of traffic.
Arterial streets, as referenced in this title, are those streets shown and
defined on the City of Indianola's Comprehensive Plan, as amended, and Iowa
Department of Transportation's federal functional classification.
      Collector Street: A street, the principal function of which is carrying
traffic from local streets to arterial streets. Collector streets, as
referenced in this title, are those streets shown and defined on the City of
Indianola's Comprehensive Plan, as amended, and Iowa Department of
Transportation's federal functional classification.
      Circle driveway: A private drive, one-way driveway which enters and
leaves private property at two points within the same frontage.
       Clear vision area: Land acquired or used by and in accordance with
standard practices of the agency having jurisdiction over the road for the
purpose of maintaining unobstructed vision.
      Commercial driveway: A driveway serving a commercial establishment,
industry, government or educational institution, hospital, church, multifamily
residential building, mobile home park, and all other facilities not included
in the definitions for residential, field or utility structure driveways.
       Controlled access: A road right-of-way in which owners or occupants of
abutting lands, and other persons, have no legal right to access those abutting
lands except at such point only, and in such manner as determined by the city.
      Culvert: Closed conduit used for the passage of surface drainage under
the driveway(s).
      Driveway width: The narrowest distance of the driveway running parallel
with the edge of pavement.
      Field driveway: Any driveway serving a farm yard, cultivated or
uncultivated field, timberland or undeveloped land not used for industrial,
commercial or residential purposes.
      Frontage: The private lot line that abuts the road right(s)-of-way.
      Local Streets: A street used primarily for access to abutting property

      Residential driveway: A driveway serving a private single-family or two-
family dwelling.
      Right-of-way: That property owned by the governmental body on which the
roadway system exists and which may be accessed with the construction of
driveways.
      Utility structure driveway: Any driveway serving a structure or utility
installation, such as a pump house or substation, which operates automatically
and requires only occasional access.
   3.   Driveway/curb-cut permit required.
      A.   Permit Required:
         (1)   The construction of any new driveway or the creation of any new
curb-cut for an access point to private property shall require that a permit be
obtained from the Zoning Administrator or designee.
         (2)   When a driveway permit is issued, existing curb cuts that are no
longer in use shall be filled in with curb and gutter pursuant to city
standards. Curb and gutter shall be installed together as one unit.
         (3)   For access to a state highway, an access permit must be approved
by the Iowa department of transportation (IDOT), with a recommendation from the
city. A recommendation from the city is required prior to filing an application
with the IDOT. However, a separate city access permit is not required.
         (4)   The Public Works Director or designee may waive or vary this
driveway requirement where unique circumstances exist.
      B.   Fee. The fee for a permit required by this section shall be as set
by Resolution of the City Council.
      C.   Failure to Reconstruct Pavement. If, after 30 days after the
breaking out or removal of any concrete curb or pavement, the person doing the
work fails or refuses to pave the driveway as required by this section, the
City shall have the right to do so without notice, and assess the cost thereof
as a special tax against the abutting property and collect the tax according to
law.
   4.   Driveway Spacing Standards 
      A.   Purpose. Driveway spacing simplifies driving by reducing the amount
of information a driver must process and react to. Adequate spacing between
driveways and roadways or other driveways can reduce confusion, decreases the
potential for congestion and accidents for both through traffic and vehicles
using the driveway. Inadequate spacing requires drivers to watch for ingress
and egress traffic at several points, while simultaneously trying to control
their vehicle and monitor other traffic ahead of and behind them.
      B.   Driveway spacing:
         (1)   Driveways shall be located to limit undue interference with the
free movement of road traffic and to provide the required sight distance.
         (2)   Driveways, including the radii and tapers, shall be located
entirely within the subject property's right-of-way frontage. This right-of-way
frontage is determined by projecting the lot lines to the edge of pavement of
the road. Encroachment of curb and radii on adjacent right-of-way frontage
shall be permitted only upon written certifications from the adjacent property
owner(s) (agreeing to such encroachment) and/or when the city has determined
that such encroachment is necessary to preserve safe roadway conditions.
         (3)   Access points to the property shall be limited based on the
adjacent public roadway's functional classification as identified in the
Indianola Comprehensive Plan.
         (4)   Driveway spacing from street intersections and between driveways
shall be one hundred fifty feet (150') on arterial streets, one hundred feet
(100') on collector streets, and fifty feet (50') on all other streets.
            a.   The driveway spacing between a driveway and a street
intersection will be measured at the curb line from the beginning of the radius
of a street intersection to the beginning of a driveway curb cut.
            b.   The driveway spacing between two driveways will be measured at
the curb line between driveway curb cuts.
         (5)   The city may adjust the driveway spacing standards so that
driveways line up with existing driveways across the street.
         (6)   To reduce left-turn conflicts, new driveways shall be aligned
with those across the roadway where possible. If alignment is not possible,
driveways should be offset to meet the minimum spacing requirements on Section
135.14-4-B-4 from those on the opposite side of the roadway. Longer offsets may
be required depending on the expected, inbound left-turn volumes of the
driveways.
   5.   Driveway Design Standards
      A.   Purpose: The design features described herein shall be used by the
applicant in designing proposed driveways or driveway systems. These standard
dimensions shall be used, unless the city determines that conditions require a
deviation or the applicant can demonstrate cause for deviation. The city
reserves the right to determine whether this deviation shall be granted. In
addition, based upon anticipated traffic volumes on the driveway(s) and the
roadway, type of traffic to use the driveway, type of development, and other
safety and operational considerations, the city may request changes or specify
particular dimensions to ensure safe operations.
      B.   Single-family residential, Two-family residential, Utility, and
Field driveways:
         (1)   Number of access points allowed:
            a.   One residential driveway shall be permitted for each platted
lot or for unplatted residential property with less than one hundred feet
(100') of frontage.
            b.   One additional residential driveway may be permitted along a
local street for residential property with more than one hundred feet (100') of
frontage. If two (2) access points are approved for a single lot, the primary
access drive must be from the lower classified street.
            c.   In lieu of the above, two residential driveways may be
permitted on the same property to serve as a one-way circle driveway if the
frontage of the property is one hundred feet (100') or more along a local
street.
            d.   Field entrance and utility structure driveways will be
reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The city review will take into the proximity
of the adjacent driveways and intersecting streets, as well as traffic volumes
along the roadway.
         (2)   Shared Driveways: Dwellings may, and are encouraged to, share
drives and aisles; provided, that a shared access easement is secured from the
owners of each property sharing the drive or aisle. The easement must be
recorded and proof of such recording must be submitted prior to issuance of a
driveway permit.
         (3)   Paving Standards:
            a.   All residential and utility driveways shall be paved in their
entirety, using either concrete, asphalt, or permeable pavers.
            b.   Field driveways shall only be required to be paved from the
roadway edge of pavement to the roadway right-of-way line.
         (4)   Dimensional Standards:
            a.   For alley or rear lane access, the driveway is allowed to be
as wide as necessary to provide access to the garage or parking space(s).
            b.   For properties with a single access point, the maximum
driveway width is twenty-four feet (24') measured at the property line and
thirty feet (30') measured at the curb line.
            c.   If two (2) access points are approved on a single frontage
lot, the maximum dimension for each driveway is twelve feet (12') measured at
the property line and eighteen feet (18') measured at the curb line.
            d.   For single-family uses, if two (2) access points are approved,
one from an alley or private rear lane, and one from a street, the primary
access drive must be from the alley or private rear lane. In such a case, the
maximum driveway width for the secondary driveway from the street is twelve
feet (12') measured at the property line and eighteen feet (18') measured at
the curb line. The access drive from the alley or rear lane is allowed to be as
wide as necessary to provide access to the garage or parking space(s).
            e.   For single-family uses, if two (2) access points are approved
on a double frontage or corner lot, one on each frontage, maximum driveway
width for the primary driveway is twenty-four feet (24') measured at the
property line and thirty feet (30') measured at the curb line. The maximum
driveway width for the secondary driveway is twelve feet (12') measured at the
property line and eighteen feet (18') measured at the curb line.
            f.   For two-family uses, if two (2) access points are approved,
one from an alley or private rear lane, and one from a street, the maximum
driveway width for the driveway from the street is twenty feet (20') at the
property line and twenty-six feet (26') at the curb line. The access drive from
the alley or rear lane is allowed to be as wide as necessary to provide access
to the garage or parking space(s).
            g.   For two-family uses, if two (2) access points are approved on
a double frontage or corner lot, one on each frontage, the maximum driveway
width for each driveway is twenty feet (20') at the property line and twenty-
six feet (26') at the curb line.
            h.   The maximum width for shared driveways is twenty-four feet
(24') measured at the property line and thirty feet (30') measured at the curb
line.
         (5)   Visibility Standard: Clear vision areas (triangular in shape)
shall be maintained on both sides of all residential, utility, and field
drives. A clear vision area shall be determined using the following three
points:
            a.   The point of intersection of the side line of a driveway
projected to the roadway edge of pavement, and
            b.   Two points, fifteen feet (15') in distance from that point of
intersection. One shall be measured outward from the driveway along the edge of
pavement. The other shall be measured along the side driveway line leading onto
the subject property.
      C.   Multi-family, Group living, and Nonresidential driveways:
         (1)   Number of access points allowed:
            a.   For lots or parcels existing prior to the adoption of this
ordinance, one driveway may be permitted for each separately owned parcel with
less than 100 feet of frontage, provided that the parcel is wide enough for the
minimum driveway width, plus the required radii. Where parcel size is
insufficient, a shared driveway or other means of access may be required.
            b.   Additional driveways may be permitted as follows:
               i.   One additional driveway may be allowed for a site with
continuous frontage of one hundred fifty feet (150') or more if no other access
opportunities are available; or
               ii.   Two additional driveways may be allowed for a site with
continuous frontage of three hundred feet (300') or more if no other access
opportunities are available.
            c.   Additional access such as that outlined above may be allowed
if the applicant provides justification based upon standard traffic engineering
criteria that encompass analyses of trip generation, distribution, and level of
service. The city has the final decision regardless of conclusions drawn from
these analyses.
            d.   Two driveways may be permitted, in lieu of the above, to serve
as a one-way circle drive if the frontage is one hundred twenty five feet
(125') or more.
         (2)   Shared driveways: Adjacent property owners may, and are
encouraged to, consolidate their driveways by using either a joint driveway
system or a frontage road. All frontage roads are to be placed on private
property outside of the right-of-way. The easements from participating property
owners must be recorded and proof of such recording must be submitted prior to
issuance of an access permit.
         (3)   Paving Standards:
            a.   All commercial driveways shall be paved in their entirety,
using either concrete, asphalt, or permeable pavers.
            b.   All commercial driveways shall be constructed with concrete
curb and gutter along the entire required-entry and exit radii for the
driveway.
         (4)   Dimensional Standards:
            a.   The city will determine driveway specifications, including
width and configuration of lanes, for multi-family, group living, and
nonresidential uses based on the size of the development, the anticipated
traffic generated by the use, the location, the surrounding land uses, and the
functional classification of the street to which the driveway provides access.
            b.   Multi-family and Group living uses: Driveway widths for multi-
family and group living uses may not exceed twenty-four feet (24') measured at
the property line and thirty-two feet (32') at the curb line, except as
required by the city for high traffic volume situations.
            c.   Nonresidential Uses: Driveway widths for non-residential uses
may not exceed thirty-four feet (34') measured at the property line and forty
two feet (42') at the curb line, except as required by the city for high
traffic volume situations and for commercial and industrial properties that
need to accommodate large truck traffic.
         (5)   Visibility Standard: Clear vision areas (triangular in shape)
shall be maintained on both sides of all commercial drives. A clear vision area
shall be determined using the following three points:
            a.   The point of intersection of the side line of a driveway
projected to the roadway edge of pavement, and
            b.   Two points, twenty-five (25) feet in distance from that point
of intersection. One shall be measured outward from the driveway along the edge
of pavement. The other shall be measured along the side driveway line leading
onto the subject property.
   6.   Appeals.
      A.   After reviewing a driveway design, the Zoning Administrator or
designee may:
         (1)   Approve design as submitted; or
         (2)   Approve design with corrections to conform the design to the
requirements of this Chapter; or
         (3)   Approve design with variations from the requirements of this
Chapter, provided that the roadway drainage can still be designed without
adversely affecting private properties and driveway design with variations will
not adversely affect public safety.
      B.   If the applicant disagrees with the final decision of the Zoning
Administrator or designee, the applicant shall have the right to appeal such
decision in writing, along with the appropriate studies and justification to
support the variance request. The variance request will be submitted to the
Board of Adjustment created under the Zoning Code. The appeal shall be made by
the applicant within five business days of the final decision and filed with
the City of Indianola Community Development Department. Procedures for
administrative hearings as provided in Section 165.02-3(B) of the City of
Indianola Zoning Code shall govern appeals made pursuant to this paragraph. The
decision of the Board of Adjustment shall be the final decision of the City of
Indianola.
   7.   Penalties. Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or
refuses to comply with or who resists the enforcement of any of the provisions
of this chapter shall, upon conviction, be fined for each offense up to the
maximum amount as allowed by the Code of Iowa. Each day that a violation is
permitted to exist constitutes a separate offense.

136.03 REMOVAL OF SNOW, ICE AND ACCUMULATIONS.
It is the responsibility of the abutting property owners to remove snow, ice
and accumulations promptly from sidewalks. If a property owner does not remove
snow, ice or accumulations within a reasonable time, the City may do so and
assess the costs against the property owner for collection in the same manner
as a property tax. The abutting property owner may be liable for damages caused
by the failure of the abutting property owner to use reasonable care in the
removal of the snow or ice. If damages are to be awarded under this section
against the abutting property owner, the claimant has the burden of proving the
amount of the damages. To authorize recovery of more than a nominal amount,
facts must exist and be shown by the evidence which afford a reasonable basis
for measuring the amount of the claimant’s actual damages, and the amount of
actual damages shall not be determined by speculation, conjecture or surmise.
All legal or equitable defenses are available to the abutting property owner in
an action brought pursuant to this section. The City’s general duty under this
section does not include a duty to remove natural accumulations of snow or ice
from the sidewalks. However, when the City is the abutting property owner it
has the specific duty of the abutting property owner set forth in this section.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[2b & e])
136.04 RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAINTENANCE.
The abutting property owner shall repair, replace, or reconstruct, or cause to
be repaired, replaced, or reconstructed, all broken or defective sidewalks and
maintain in a safe and hazard-free condition any sidewalk outside the lot and
property lines and inside the curb lines or, in the absence of a curb, any
sidewalk between the property line and that portion of the public street used
or improved for vehicular purposes.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12 [2c])
(Ord. 1754 - Jan. 25 Supp.)
136.05 CITY MAY ORDER REPAIRS.
If the abutting property owner does not maintain sidewalks as required, the
Council, Code Enforcement Officer or other authorized municipal officer may
serve notice on such owner, by certified mail, requiring the owner to repair,
replace or reconstruct sidewalks within a reasonable time and if such action is
not completed within the time stated in the notice, the Council, or their
designee, may require the work to be done and assess the costs against the
abutting property for collection in the same manner as a property tax.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[2d & e])
(Ord. 1771 – Jun. 25 Supp.)
136.06 SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION REQUIRED.
   1.   Before any new dwelling, business building or commercial building is
occupied or put into its ultimate use, or when any existing dwelling, business
building or commercial building, including the real estate on which the
dwelling or building is located, is improved, reconstructed or replaced by
$7,500.00 or more as determined by the Building Official’s most current
valuation data, a permanent sidewalk shall be built in front of the building
for the entire width of the lot and where the lot in question is a corner lot,
the sidewalk shall be built for the entire length of the lot along the side
which abuts the street. However, sidewalks shall not be required on improved
property where the improvements are only accessory building or structures.
   2.   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code of Ordinances, all
dwellings, business buildings and commercial buildings, whether occupied or
unoccupied, shall have, after January 1, 1996, a permanent sidewalk built for
the entire width and/or length of the lot or lots upon which the dwelling,
business building or commercial building is located, and the sidewalks shall be
built for the entire width and/or length of all sides of the lot or lots which
abut a street. This subsection applies only to the sidewalk installations
recommended in the School Route Sidewalk Study performed by JBM Engineers and
Planners in 1994 and approved by the City Council in 1994.
   3.   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code of Ordinances, all
dwellings, business buildings and commercial buildings, whether occupied or
unoccupied, shall have, after January 1, 1999, a permanent sidewalk built for
the entire width and/or length of the lot or lots upon which the dwelling,
business building or commercial building is located, and the sidewalks shall be
built for the entire width and/or length of all sides of the lot or lots which
abut a street.
   4.   In the event that no grade has been set or there is no curb and gutter
on the street upon which the sidewalk, is to be placed, the Council may waive
the sidewalk requirement on application of the affected property owner and upon
the affected property owner signing an agreement to install such a sidewalk
within 120 days after the property owner has been notified that a curb and
gutter has been installed and/or that the grade has been set. The agreement
shall be verified and placed on record in the office of the Warren County
Recorder, and shall be a covenant running with the land binding the heirs and
assigns of the property owner.
   5.   When the strict application of standards or requirements established by
this section would cause substantial hardship or impose unreasonable
restrictions regarding the installation of a sidewalk because of natural or
physical conditions or limitations not created by the owner or developer, the
Council may grant such waivers and/or variances from these standards or
requirements as may be necessary pursuant to the following procedure. At such
time when the conditions or limitations are eliminated, the owner or developer
will be required to install such sidewalk within 120 days after notification by
the City.
      A.   The applicant under this subsection shall prepare an application to
the Planning and Zoning Commission for review of the required sidewalk. The
applicant may request a waiver of the sidewalk requirement or a variance of the
sidewalk requirement. Within 45 days after receiving the application, the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend to the Council to either
approve, approve subject to conditions, or disapprove the request. Failure by
the Commission to act within 45 days shall be deemed a recommendation for
approval of the request.
      B.   The Council shall establish criteria and specific design standards
to assist it and the Planning and Zoning Commission when considering
applications for waivers and/or variances. All such criteria and specific
design standards shall be established in such a way as to ensure the orderly
and harmonious development of a City-wide sidewalk system in such a manner as
will safeguard the public’s health, safety and general welfare.
      C.   Upon recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission to the
Council, the applicant’s request will be put on the agenda for the next
regularly scheduled Council meeting for final approval or disapproval by the
Council. If the Council rejects the request, the Council will advise the
applicant of any changes which are desired or that should have consideration
before approval will be given. The applicant shall then submit the revised
original for certification by the Council. The Commission and the Council, in
approving or disapproving any requests and in making requests for alterations
or amendments to the request as presented, shall be governed by the general
policies as set out by this chapter and by the criteria and specific design
standards established by the Council.
   6.   The Council may order the construction of permanent sidewalks upon any
street or court in the City and may specially assess the cost of such
improvement to abutting property owners in accordance with the provisions of
Chapter 384 of the Code of Iowa.
136.07 PERMIT REQUIRED.
No person shall remove, reconstruct, or install a sidewalk unless such person
has obtained a permit from the City and has agreed in writing that said
removal, reconstruction, or installation will comply with all ordinances and
requirements of the City for such work. A written application for such permit
shall be filed with the City. The fee for a permit required by this section
shall be as set by Resolution of the City Council.

of the Clerk, full and complete plans and specifications for the construction
of sidewalks and driving crossings over the sidewalks. All sidewalks, whether

constructed under the supervision and inspection of the Building Official or
other person authorized by the Council, and shall be in strict accordance with
the plans and specifications approved by the Council and on file in the office
of the Clerk.
   2.   It is the duty of the City Engineer, or other employee so authorized by
the Council, to give to any property owner desiring to lay a sidewalk, the
proper grade and to establish the lot line immediately adjacent thereto.
   3.   Unless otherwise provided by resolution of the Council, all sidewalks
in the residential areas shall be located one foot outside of the lot line. All
sidewalks in the business district shall extend from the lot line to the curb
line. The business district, for the purposes of this section, shall be as
follows:
The sidewalks on and around the public square and the sidewalks running along
both sides of the streets intersecting with the public square, a distance of
approximately one-half block from the intersection of the streets with the
public square to the alley line closest to the intersection, except Salem
Avenue, which shall include sidewalks one block from the intersection of Salem
Avenue with the public square.
In other areas, as defined by the Zoning Ordinance, the Council shall by
resolution establish the location of the sidewalk.

each end of such sidewalk and at each end of any pile of material deposited in
the street, a sufficient number of approved warning lights or flares, and to
keep them lighted during the entire night and to erect sufficient barricades
both at night and in the daytime to secure the same. The party or parties using
the street for any of the purposes specified in this chapter shall be liable

or negligence of the party or parties, or their agents or employees or for any
misuse of the privileges conferred by this chapter or of any failure to comply
with provisions hereof.
136.10 FAILURE TO REPAIR OR BARRICADE.

141.01 DEFINITIONS.
As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise indicates, the following
terms have the meanings ascribed herein:
   1.   “Street trees” means trees on land lying between property lines on
either side of all streets, avenues, or ways within the City.
   2.   “Street parking” means that portion of the public land located between
property line (usually the outside edge of the public sidewalk) and the inside
edge of the curb and/or driving surface.
   3.   “Boulevard parking” means the open land area between two hard-surfaced
streets that have the same name.
   4.   “Cul-de-sac island” means the open land area located in the center of a
hard-surfaced street turn-around.
   5.   “Flowers” means annual and perennial plants which consist of a
shortened axis bearing modified leaves.
   6.   “Shrubs” means a low-growing, woody plant or bush.
141.02 PERMIT REQUIRED.
No person shall plant, move, or remove any tree in any street parking,
boulevard, parking, or public place in the City or cause such action to be done
by others without first obtaining a written permit from the Building Official
in accordance with the following:
   1.   Exemption. A permit is not required for planting flowers in parkings.
Only flowers with a maximum height of 30 inches or less may be planted in any
street parking, boulevard or cul-de-sac. However, flowers planted in the 25-
foot radius of intersections shall not exceed 24 inches above the centerline.
   2.   Residential or Agricultural Permits. An application for a residential
or agricultural permit shall be accompanied by a plan or drawing which shall
accurately show:
      A.   The property of the applicant adjacent to the street parking upon
which a permit to plant is sought, along with the existing public sidewalk,
street, parking area, and curb located between the applicant’s property line
and the outside edge of the curb, all of which shall be to a definite indicated
scale.
      B.   The species and location of each tree proposed to be planted and of
those trees already existing in the street parking and within 20 feet of the
proposed tree planting, also in definite scale.
      C.   The location of any fire hydrant, utility pole, traffic sign, street
light pole, mail box and/or other obstructions located upon the street parking,
all of which shall be in scaled relation to the other information required.
   3.   Commercial or Industrial Permits. Street trees may be planted in hard-
surfaced (e.g. concrete) street parkings provided they are a minimum of three
feet from the inside edge of the curb, and that before any street tree may be
planted, the owner of the property abutting said parking must first make
application for and secure a permit from the Building Official as hereinafter
provided. A conceptual plan showing planting design in relation to the
surrounding area, i.e. City Square, shopping mall, may also be required. If
concrete or other hard surface does not run continuously from the curb to the
sidewalk, then the provisions governing residential or agricultural permits
shall apply. The City may plant trees in this area at the direction of the
Council. Application data shall include:
      A.   Local address of the applicant’s property which abuts the street
parking upon which a permit to plant is sought.
      B.   The species, number, height and trunk diameter of each tree proposed
to be planted.
      C.   Any additional information which the Building Official shall deem is
reasonably necessary to enable the making of a fair determination of whether or
not a permit should be issued hereunder.
141.03 ISSUANCE OF PERMIT.
The Building Official may, after review and consideration of any application as
above required, issue a permit to an applicant. Any such permit issued shall be
to plant trees in strict compliance with terms and provisions of this chapter.
A copy of the application and plan or drawing as finally approved by the
Building Official shall be kept on file in the office of the Building Official.
All such permits shall be issued upon the express condition that they may be
revoked at any time by the Building Official and that all trees planted
pursuant to said permit may be removed by the City without liability to any
person or property for such removal. Further, no such permit shall be issued
until the applicant shall have executed and filed with the Building Official an
indemnification agreement whereby said applicant agrees to save and hold
harmless the City from any and all liability for damage or injury to person or
property proximately caused by trees planted, moved or removed pursuant to said
permit. All street trees shall be planted within 120 days after approval unless
an extension is requested in writing by the applicant and approved by the
Building Official. An extension of one year can be granted for good reasons. If
the 120 days elapses, a new permit with fee shall be required to plant street
trees. The fee for a permit required by this section shall be as set by
Resolution of the City Council and shall be paid prior to application approval.
(Ord. 1646 - Sep. 20 Supp.)
141.04 PLANTING REGULATIONS.
   1.   Trees should be spaced so there will be little or no interference with
their full development. The minimum spacing shall be 25 feet for Category A; 40
feet for Category B; and 60 feet for Category C, measured from center to center
on each street tree.
   2.   Trees shall not be planted closer than one-half of the minimum spacing
requirement per category to the neighboring property owner’s side or rear lot
line, i.e. Category A = 12.5 feet; Category B = 20 feet; Category C = 30 feet.
   3.   No impervious material shall be placed nearer than 24 inches to the
trunk of the tree.
   4.   No street tree shall be planted nearer than two and one-half feet from
the curb or the inside existing or potential sidewalk line and centered in
parkings if possible. This eliminates all tree plantings in the parkings under
nine feet in width.
   5.   No street tree shall be planted closer than 25 feet from the ends of
the street radii at intersections, or closer than 10 feet to the edge of a
driveway. No street tree shall be planted within 10 feet of any fire hydrant.
   6.   The minimum spacing from a light standard or transmission pole shall be
10 feet for Category A; 20 feet for Category B, and 30 feet for Category C
measured from center of street tree to standard or pole.
   7.   The City shall not allow the planting of street trees in the City
parking within five horizontal feet of the exterior dimension of any sanitary
sewer, storm sewer or water lines; and it may only be the type listed in this
chapter under Category A.
   8.   Street trees planted under power lines may only be the type listed in
this chapter under Category A.
   9.   The City reserves the right to restrict the planting of trees if there
are too many other underground utilities in the parking such as gas, phone,
etc.
   10.   Category A and B trees may be used in Category C plantings as can
Category A be planted in Category B.
   11.   As new tree species are introduced, they will be added to these lists.

CHAPTER 160A
FALSE FIRE ALARM
 
160A.01 Definitions                    160A.04  Review of False Alarm Charge
160A.02 False Alarm Procedure and User 160A.05 Malicious Fire Alarm Charge
Fee
160A.03 Evidence of Repair Accepted in  
Lieu of Fee
 
160A.01 DEFINITIONS.
The following terms are defined for use in this chapter:
   1.   "False alarm" means the activation of a fire alarm system through
mechanical failure, malfunction, improper installation, improper maintenance,
or the negligence of the owner or lessee of the fire alarm system or of his or
her employees or agents. This does not include alarms caused by unauthorized
tampering with a fire alarm system by anyone other than the fire alarm user or
his or her agent.
   2.   "Fire alarm system" means any assembly of equipment, mechanical or
electrical, installed by a fire alarm business, arranged to signal the
occurrence of a fire, smoke, water flow, or other condition to which the Fire
Department may be expected to respond.
   3.   "Fire alarm user" means a person who is in control of any building,
structure, or facility where a fire alarm system is present.
   4.   "Malicious fire alarm" refers to a false or intentionally triggered
fire alarm intended to cause disruption, panic, or harm rather than to alert
occupants of a genuine fire emergency.
   5.   "Testing and maintenance" means when an alarm service technician or
alarm company conducts fire alarm system testing.
   6.   "Year" means a twelve-month period beginning with the first day of July
and ending on the last day of June of each year.
160A.02 FALSE ALARM PROCEDURE AND USER FEE.
   1.   Whenever Fire Department personnel respond to an activated fire alarm
system the fire official in charge of the incident shall determine if the
response was caused by a false alarm and shall indicate that fact upon the
incident report.
   2.   The Fire Department shall regularly review incident reports to monitor
the accumulation of false alarms at any one location. When two false alarms
have occurred at the same location within one year, and the location is within
the incorporated area of the City of Indianola, the Fire Department shall
notify the fire alarm user by letter, citing the location and date of each
false alarm. The letter shall recommend that appropriate action be taken on the
part of the fire alarm user to alleviate the causes of false alarms. It shall
include a statement that an accumulation of more than three (3) false alarms
within a year shall result in a charge for services. Another similar letter
shall be sent when three false alarms have occurred at the same location within
the year.
   3.   When four false alarms have occurred at one location within a year, a
user fee for service for false alarm response shall be billed to the property
owner. Each additional false alarm within the year shall require the billing of
an additional fee. However, no fire alarm user shall be charged with
accumulating more than one false alarm in any 24-hour period. In the event that
payment of the fee is not made within thirty (30) days of billing, an
administrative charge for collection shall be assessed. All fees shall be
established by resolution of the Council, as adopted from time to time. The fee
hereby established affords only partial recovery of the expenses incurred in
responding to the false alarm.
   4.   Whenever Fire Department personnel respond to a fire alarm that has
been activated due to testing and maintenance, the fire official in charge of
the incident shall determine if the response resulted from failure to make the
proper notification to the Warren County Communication Center and shall so
indicate on the incident report. Notwithstanding anything contained in any
other section of this chapter, if a fire alarm is activated due to testing and
maintenance and the Warren County Communication Center was not given proper
notification, a user fee established by resolution will be imposed upon each
false alarm. The responsible party will be the agency, testing or maintenance
company representative, or individual who initiated the alarm testing or
maintenance.
160A.03 EVIDENCE OF REPAIR ACCEPTED IN LIEU OF FEE.
An alarm user may submit evidence that a malfunctioning system has been
repaired in lieu of paying a user fee within ten (10) days of the date of
notification of the fee. Evidence such as a receipt from a licensed alarm
business with a statement of repairs made to the system is acceptable. For a
repeated problem with a system after a repair is alleged to have been made, the
City Manager may decide not to accept an alternative to paying the fee.
160A.04 REVIEW OF FALSE ALARM CHARGE.
Any person may appeal the imposition of the fee to the City Manager. A false
alarm user shall appeal in writing and such appeal shall be made to the City
Manager within ten (10) days of the date of notification of the fee.
160A.05 MALICIOUS FIRE ALARM CHARGE.
Whenever Fire Department personnel determine a malicious fire alarm has
occurred, the malicious fire alarm charge shall be treated as a Municipal
Infraction in accordance with Chapter 4 of this Code.

161.01 PURPOSE.
It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and preserve the rights,
privileges and property of the City and its residents and to preserve and
improve the peace, safety, health, welfare and comfort and convenience of its
residents by minimizing flood losses with provisions designed to:
   1.   Reserve sufficient flood plain area for the conveyance of flood flows
so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
   2.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
   3.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public utilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
   4.   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
   5.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
161.02 DEFINITIONS.

means either the first placement or permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of pile, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a factory-built home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of

satisfies either of the following criteria:
      A.   Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost
of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure
either: (i) before the start of construction of the improvement; or (ii) if the
structure has been substantially damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred. The term does not, however, include any project for
improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of State or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions. The term also does not include any alteration of
a historic structure, provided the alteration will not preclude the structure’s
designation as a historic structure.
      B.   Any addition which increases the original floor area of a building
by 25 percent or more. All additions constructed after November 20, 1998, of
the floodplain management regulations adopted by the community, shall be added
to any proposed addition in determining whether the total increase in original
floor space would exceed 25 percent.
   34.   “Variance” means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of

the Administrator, who shall forward such to the Board of Adjustment for
consideration. Such requests shall include information ordinarily submitted
with applications as well as any additional information deemed necessary by the
Board of Adjustment.
   2.   Appeals. Where it is alleged there is any error in any order,
requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in
the enforcement of this chapter, the aggrieved party may appeal such action.
The notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board of Adjustment and with the
official from whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason
for the appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to
the Board of Adjustment all the documents constituting the record upon which
the action appealed from was taken.
   3.   Variances. The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in
specific cases such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be
contrary to the public interest, where owing to special conditions a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary
hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.
      A.   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
      B.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the 100-year flood would result. Consideration
of the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
      C.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      D.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance
coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
      E.   All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.

an application for a conditional use or a request for a variance, the Board
shall hold a public hearing. The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the
hearing and give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to parties in
interest. At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or
attorney and present written or oral evidence. The Board may require the
appellant or applicant to provide such information as is reasonably deemed
necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or evaluation of a
professional engineer or other expert person or agency, including the
Department of Natural Resources.
      B.   Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal,
conditional use or variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an
appeal, the Board may, so long as such action is in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter, reverse or affirm wholly or in part, or modify the
order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make
its decision, in writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons
for its decision. In granting a conditional use or variance, the Board shall
consider such factors as contained in this section and all other relevant
sections of this chapter and may prescribe such conditions as contained in
Section 161.21.
161.19 FACTORS UPON WHICH THE DECISION TO GRANT VARIANCES IS BASED.
In passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:

connection with the enforcement of any provisions of this chapter may request,
and shall be granted a hearing on the matter before the Board of Appeals,
provided that such person shall file in the office of the Building Inspector a
written petition requesting such hearing and setting forth a brief statement of
the grounds therefor within 10 days after the date the notice was served. Upon
receipt of such petition, the Building Inspector shall set a time and place for
such hearing, shall give the Petitioner written notice thereof, and shall take
no further enforcement action pending the outcome of the hearing. At such
hearing, the Petitioner shall be given an opportunity to be heard and to show
why such notice should be modified or withdrawn. The hearing shall commence not
later than 30 days after the date on which the petition was filed, provided
that, upon application of the Petitioner, the Building Inspector may postpone
the date of the hearing for a reasonable time beyond such 30-day period if, in
the Building Inspector’s judgment, the Petitioner has submitted a good and
sufficient reason for such postponement.
   2.   Action by Board. After such hearing, the Board of Appeals shall by
written order sustain, modify, or withdraw the violations cited in the Building
Inspector’s notice, and reinstate or revoke the permit accordingly in said
order, after consideration of whether the provisions of this chapter have been
complied with.

Inspector. Such record shall also include a copy of every notice or order
issued in connection with the matter. No hearing shall be valid unless a
majority of the board if present and no decision at a hearing shall be valid
and binding unless reached by a majority of the whole Board. Any person

to meet the emergency. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter,
such order shall be effective immediately. Any person to whom such order is
directed shall comply therewith immediately, but, upon petition to the Building
Inspector, shall be afforded a hearing at the earliest expedient time. After
such hearing, depending upon its findings as to whether the provisions of this
chapter have been complied with, the Board of Appeals shall continue such order

   5.   Conflict. Enforcement of the Building Code shall not be construed for
the particular benefit of any individual or group of persons, other than the

person or property as a result of any act or failure to act in the enforcement
of the Building Code. The Building Code shall be construed to relieve from or
lessen the responsibility of any person owning, operating or controlling any
equipment or structure regulated herein for damages to a person or property
caused by its defects, nor shall the city or any city employee be held as
assuming any such liability by reason of the inspections by this Code or any
approvals issued under this Code.
163.09 ENFORCEMENT.
   1.   General. After any order of the Building Inspector or the Board of
Appeals made pursuant to this chapter shall have become final, no person to
whom any such order is directed shall fail, neglect or refuse to obey any such
order. Any such person who fails to comply with any such order is guilty of a
violation of this Code of Ordinances.
   2.   Failure to Obey Order. If, after any order of the Building Inspector or
Board of Appeals made pursuant of this chapter has become final, the person to
whom such order is directed shall fail, neglect or refuse to obey such order,
the Building Inspector may: (i) cause such person to be prosecuted under this
Code of Ordinances; or (ii) institute any appropriate action to abate such
building as a public nuisance.
   3.   Failure to Commence Work. Whenever the required repair or demolition is
not commenced within 30 days after any final notice and order issued under this
chapter becomes effective:

notice and order to be vacated by posting at each entrance thereto the notice
described Section
163.07 of this chapter.
      B.   No person shall occupy any building that has been posted as

posted until the repair, demolition, or removal ordered by the Building
Inspector has been completed and a certificate of occupancy issued pursuant to
the provisions of the Building Code.
      C.   The Building Inspector may, in addition to any other remedy herein
provided, cause the building to be repaired to the extent necessary to correct
the conditions which render the building unsafe or abandoned as set forth in
the notice and order; or, if the notice and order required repair and/or
demolition, to cause the building to be demolished, and the materials, rubble,
and debris there from removed and the lot cleaned. Any such repair of
demolition work shall be accomplished and the cost thereof paid and recovered
in the manner provided in this chapter.
   4.   Extension of Time to Perform Work. Upon receipt of an application in
writing and an acceptable performance guarantee from the person required to
conform to the order and by agreement of such person to comply with the order
of allowed additional time, the Building Inspector may grant an extension of
time, not to exceed an additional 120 days, within which to complete said
repair, rehabilitation or demolition, if the Building Inspector determines that
such an extension of time will not create or perpetuate a situation imminently
dangerous to life or property. The Building Inspector's authority to extend
time is limited to the physical repair, rehabilitation or demolition of the
premises and will not in any way affect the time to appeal the notice and
order.
   5.   Interference with Repair or Demolition Work Prohibited. No person shall
obstruct, impede or interfere with any officer, employee, contractor or
authorized representative of the City or with any person who owns or holds any
estate or interest in any building which has been ordered repaired, vacated, or
demolished under the provisions of the chapter, or with any person to whom such
building has been lawfully sold pursuant to the provisions of this chapter,
whenever such officer, employee, contractor or authorized representative of the
City, person having an interest or estate in such building or structure, or
purchaser is engaged in the work of repairing, vacating, or demolishing any
such building, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, or in performing any
necessary act preliminary to or incidental to such work or authorized or
directed pursuant to this chapter.

165.01 TITLE, PURPOSE, JURISDICTION AND ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS AND MAP.
   1.   Title and Statement of Purpose. The ordinance codified in this chapter
is entitled “An ordinance to regulate and restrict the location and use of
buildings, structures, and land for trade, industry, residence and other
purposes; to regulate and restrict the height of buildings and structures, the
number and size of buildings and other structures; to establish the size of
yards, courts, and other open spaces; to establish minimum lot areas; and
regulate the density of population and the percentage of lot that may be
occupied; to require off-street parking; to regulate the location, size and
number of signs, to divide the City into districts for such purposes; to
provide for the administration and enforcement of its provisions; to create a
Board of Adjustment; to prescribe penalties for the violation of its
provisions, all in accordance with Chapter 414, Code of Iowa,” and may be known
and cited as “The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Indianola, Iowa.”
   The purpose of this chapter is to prevent and to lessen congestion in the
streets and highways; to secure safety from fire, flood, panic and other
dangers; to protect the public health and general welfare; to provide adequate
light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue
concentration of population; to facilitate the adequate provision of
transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other public requirements;
to conserve the value of buildings and encourage the most appropriate use of
land throughout the City, all in accordance with a comprehensive plan.
   2.   Jurisdiction. These regulations apply to development of any parcel of
land located within the corporate limits of the City of Indianola or outside
the corporate limits of the city as provided by law. No building permit or
certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any parcel of land or development
after the effective date of this Chapter that is not in conformance with the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. No excavation of land or construction of
any public or private improvements shall take place or be commenced except in
conformity with the Zoning Ordinance.
   3.   Interpretation of Standards. In their interpretation and application,
the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance shall be held to be minimum
requirements. Where the Zoning Ordinance imposes a greater restriction than is
imposed or required by other provisions of law or by other rules or regulations
or ordinances, the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance shall control. Where
uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the official
zoning map, the following rules shall apply:
      A.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerline of
streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow such centerlines.
      B.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines
shall be construed as following such lot lines.
      C.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following township lines or
section lines shall be construed as following township lines or section lines.
      D.   Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed
to be midway between the main tracks.
      E.   Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to
follow such shorelines and in the event of change in the shoreline, shall be
construed as moving with the actual shoreline; boundaries indicated as
approximately following the centerlines of streams or other bodies of water
shall be construed to follow such centerlines.
      F.   Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features
indicated in Subsections 1 through 5 above shall be so construed. Distances not
specifically indicated on the official zoning map shall be determined by the
scale of the map.
      G.   Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at
variance with those shown on the official zoning map, or in other circumstances

district in which the building or land is located.
   2.   Building Permit and Site Plan Required. No building, structure,
foundation, tower, fence, or wall shall be constructed or erected without prior

and site plans shall be kept in the office of the Zoning Administrator.
   3.   Administration and Enforcement.
      A.   Zoning Administrator. There is hereby created the position of Zoning
Administrator, who shall be named by the City Manager. The Zoning Administrator
shall administer and enforce the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and shall
have the following powers and duties in connection therewith:
         (1)   To issue all permits and certificates required by the Zoning
Ordinance.
         (2)   To notify in writing the person responsible for any violations
of any of the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, indicating the nature of the
violation and ordering the action necessary to correct it.
         (3)   To order discontinuance of illegal use of land, buildings, or
structures or of additions, alterations or structural changes thereto;
discontinuance of any illegal work being done, or take any other action
authorized by the Zoning Ordinance to ensure compliance with or to prevent
violation of its provisions.
      The City Manager may delegate the powers and duties of the office of
Zoning Administrator to any other officer or employee of the City or may
combine the powers and duties of this office with any other office or position.
      B.   Board of Adjustment. A Board of Adjustment is hereby established
which shall consist of five (5) members appointed by the Mayor subject to
confirmation by the Council for staggered terms of five years. The terms of
office of the members of the Board of Adjustment and the manner of their
appointment shall be as provided by statute. Vacancies will occur in said Board
on the death, resignation, or failure to meet residency requirements of any
member of said board. If any member fails to attend at least 75% of the
official meetings in one year an automatic vacancy will exist on said board. A
member may have only one excused absence per year. The excused absence shall
only be granted by the Chairperson of the Board. When a vacancy occurs, the
vacancy will then be filled in the same manner as the original appointment for
the remainder of the unexpired term.
         (1)   Meetings: The meetings of the Board shall be held at the call of
the Chairperson and at such other times as the Board may determine. Such
Chairperson or, in the absence of the Chairperson, the acting Chairperson may
administer oaths, subpoena witnesses and compel the attendance of witnesses.
All meetings of the Board shall be open to the public. The Board shall keep
minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member on each question,
or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records
of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be
immediately filed in the office of the City Clerk and shall be a public record.
The presence of three (3) members is necessary to constitute a quorum.
         (2)   Appeals: Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person
aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the City affected
by any decision of the Zoning Administrator. Such appeal shall be taken within
ten (10) days by filing with the Zoning Administrator and with the Board a
notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The Zoning Administrator shall
forthwith transmit to the Board all papers constituting the record upon which
the action appealed from is taken. An appeal stays all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Zoning Administrator
certifies to the Board, after notice of appeal shall have been filed with the
Zoning Administrator, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate, a
stay would, in the Administrator’s opinion, cause imminent peril to life or
property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a
restraining order which may be granted by the Board or by a court of record on
application, on notice to the Zoning Administrator and on due cause shown. The
Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing on the appeal, give public
notice thereof as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the
same within a reasonable time. At the hearing any party may appear in person or
by agent, or by attorney. Before an appeal is filed with the Board of
Adjustment, the appellant shall pay to the City Clerk the fee as established by
resolution of the City Council.
         (3)   Power and Duties: The Board shall have the following powers and
duties:
            a.   Appeals - To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there
is an error in any order, requirements, decision or determination made by the
Zoning Administrator in enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance.
            b.   Variances - To grant a variance from the terms of the Zoning
Ordinance when a property owner can show that the owner’s property was acquired
in good faith and where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or
shape of a specific piece of property, or where by reason of exceptional
topographical conditions or other extraordinary or exceptional situation, the
strict application of the terms of the Zoning Ordinance actually prohibits the
use of such property in a manner reasonably similar to that of other property
in the same district, and where the Board is satisfied under the evidence
before it that a literal enforcement of the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance
would result in unnecessary hardship; provided, however, all variations granted
under this clause shall be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of
the Zoning Ordinance. Furthermore, the following findings shall be made in
order to grant a variance:
               i.   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not
applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district;
               ii.   That literal interpretation of the provisions of this
ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other
properties in the same district under the terms of this ordinance;
               iii.   That the special conditions and circumstances do not
result from the actions of the applicant;
               iv.   That granting the variance requested will not confer on
the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this ordinance to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district. No nonconforming use of
neighboring lands, structures or buildings in other districts shall be
considered grounds for the issuance of a variance.
               In granting any variance, the Board may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Ordinance. Violation of any
such conditions and safeguards shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance.
Under no circumstances shall the Board grant a variance to allow a use not
permissible under the terms of the Zoning Ordinance in the district involved,
or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of the Zoning
Ordinance in said district.
               If relevant and applicable, the Board may prescribe a time limit
within which the action for which the variance is required shall begin or be
completed, or both. Failure to begin or complete, or both, such action within
the time limit shall void the variance. If no time limit is set by the Board
and if relevant to the variance, then the granted variances shall become void
eighteen months after the date of the Board approval unless a building permit
has been issued for the construction provided for by the variance. In the event
the building permit for the construction provided for by the variance expires
or is canceled, then the variance approval shall become void.
            c.   Special Use Permits - To review and consider approval of a
Special Use Permit for a Special Use as identified Permitted and Special Uses
Table contained in Section
165.05 of the Zoning Regulations. The following shall be required:
               i.   Special Use Permit Application - A site plan (including
number of copies), application form, and any additional information and details
as specified and required by the Zoning Administrator as necessary to determine
compliance with all applicable codes and requirements shall be submitted to the
Zoning Administrator along with the Special Use Permit Application fee as
established by resolution of the City Council.
               ii.   Special Use Permit Procedure - The Special Use Permit
Application shall be reviewed by the Zoning Administrator, or their designee,
for completeness. Incomplete applications shall be returned to the applicant
with a list of the missing items or details. Applications deemed completed
shall be distributed to other city departments and other agencies as necessary
for review and comment as to its compliance with all zoning regulations and
other pertinent city codes, regulations, and policies.
               iii.   Special Use Permit Review by Board of Adjustment -
Subsequent to review by the Zoning Administrator and other city departments and
agencies, the Zoning Administrator, or their designee, shall submit to all
members of the Board a copy of the Special Use Permit Application along with a
written recommendation as to the application’s conformity with the rules and
regulations of the city.
               iv.   The Board shall subsequently hold a duly noticed public
hearing as prescribed by their rules of procedures, and the noticing
requirements contained herein, and review the Application for conformity with
the zoning regulations and standards. The Board may approve, approve with
conditions, or deny the Special Use Permit Application.
               v.   Findings for Approval - In order to approve a Special Use
Permit, the Board shall make the following findings:
                  1 - The proposed use, site improvements, and site plan comply
with the minimum requirements of the zoning district in which it is proposed to
be located;
                  2 - The property is of adequate size to accommodate the
proposed use and site improvements including setbacks, open space, stormwater
management, and off-street parking;
                  3 - The proposed use and site improvements will not unduly
impact the health, safety, and general welfare of persons residing or working
in adjoining property or surrounding area;
                  4 - The proposed use and site improvements shall not unduly
increase traffic congestion;
                  5 - The proposed use and site improvements will not unduly
burden public utilities or increase risk to flooding;
                  6 - The proposed use and site improvements are compatible
with the surrounding neighborhood and shall not diminish or impair established
property values in adjoining or surrounding property; and,
                  7 - The issuance of the Special Use Permit will not endanger,
jeopardize or harm the health, safety or welfare of the properties and the
community.
            vi.   Expiration of Special Use Permit Approval - All Special Use
Permit approvals shall expire and terminate 24-months after the date of the
Board approval unless a building permit has been issued for the construction
provided for in the related site plan. In the event the building permit for the
construction provided for in the related site plan expires or is canceled, then
such site plan approval shall thereupon terminate.
            d.   Public Hearing Noticing. Notice of each Board of Adjustment
public hearing shall be mailed by first class mail 10 days prior to the meeting
to all property owners within 200 feet of the boundary of the property
requesting a Variance or Special Use Permit.
            e.   Decisions of the Board.
               i.   In exercising the above powers, the Board may, in
conformity with the provisions of law, reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or
modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and
make such order, requirement, decision or determination as it believes proper,
and to that end shall have all of the powers of the Zoning Administrator. The
concurring vote of three (3) of the members of the Board shall be necessary to
reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the Zoning
Administrator, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter on which it
is required to pass under this chapter.
               ii.   No act of the Board shall become effective until after the

minutes of the Board.

               iv.   Every appeal, variance, or Special Use Permit granted or
denied by the Board shall be supported by a written testimony or evidence
submitted in connection therewith.
               v.   Any taxpayer, or any officer, department, board or bureau
of the City, or any person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved by any
decision of the Board may present to a court of record a petition, pursuant to
Iowa Code 17A.19, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal,
in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition
shall be presented to the court within thirty (30) days after the filing of the
decision in the office of the Board.
   4.   Certificate of Occupancy. No land shall be occupied or used, and no
building hereafter erected or structurally altered shall be occupied or used in
whole or in part for any purpose whatsoever, until a certificate is issued by
the Zoning Administrator, stating that the building and use comply with the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. No change of use shall be made in any
building or part thereof, now or hereafter erected or structurally altered,
without a permit being issued therefor by the Zoning Administrator. No permit
shall be issued to make a change unless the changes are in conformity with
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. Nothing in this section shall prevent the
continuance of a nonconforming use as authorized in the Zoning Ordinance,
unless discontinuance is necessary for the safety of life or property.
      A.   Construction Compliance Certificate. Subsequent to the adoption of
this chapter a construction compliance certificate shall be obtained from the
Administrative Officer before any building or structure shall be erected,
reconstructed, or structurally altered to increase the exterior dimensions,
height, or floor area, or remodeled to increase the exterior dimensions,
height, or floor area, or remodeled to increase the number of dwelling units or
accommodate a change in use of the building and/or premises or part thereof.
The construction compliance certificate shall state that the proposed
construction complies with all provisions of this chapter, and no subsequent
modifications shall be made to plans or to actual construction that would be in
violation of this chapter. A construction compliance certificate issued under
this section shall lapse six months from the date of its issuance unless
construction has begun within that period and shall also lapse if construction
is stopped after it is initiated for a period of time in excess of 120 days. In
the event that a construction compliance certificate lapses for either of the
above reasons, a new certificate shall be required before construction can
resume. This amendment shall apply to all outstanding building permits at the
time of its adoption so that if construction is not commenced within six months
after the date of this amendment, the rights under the building permit shall
lapse.
      B.   Multiple-Dwelling Construction Compliance Certificates. Requests for
construction of multiple-dwelling compliance certificates shall be examined by
the Fire Chief who shall make a recommendation for approval or disapproval to
the Zoning Administrator who shall finally either approve or disapprove the
request.
      C.   Occupancy Compliance Certificate. Subsequent to the effective date
of this chapter, no change in the use or occupancy of land nor any change in
use or occupancy in an existing building, other than for single-family dwelling
purposes, shall be made, nor shall any new building be occupied for any purpose
other than a single-family dwelling until an occupancy compliance certificate
has been issued by the Administrative Officer. Every occupancy compliance
certificate shall state that the new occupancy complies with all provisions of
this chapter and no subsequent modifications shall be made to the occupancy,
use, or method of operation that would be in violation of this chapter. No
single-, two-, or multiple-family dwelling or other structure designed for
human use or occupancy shall be occupied nor shall any occupancy compliance
certificate be issued for any of the foregoing until and unless all
improvements and installations required by Chapter 170 of this Code of
Ordinances have been made and accepted by the City.
      D.   Application for Compliance Certificates. Applications for compliance
certificates shall be made prior to beginning construction or assuming
occupancy on fully completed application forms obtained from the Administrative
Officer, accompanied by such plans and information necessary to determine that
the proposed construction or occupancy complies with all applicable provisions
of this chapter.

or on petition, after public notice and hearings as provided by law, and after
report by the Zoning Commission, amend, supplement, or change the boundaries or
regulations herein or subsequently established, and such amendment shall not
become effective except by the favorable vote of a majority of all the members
of the Council. The procedures for amendment are as follows:
      A.   Request by Petition. Whenever any person desires that any amendment,
or change be made in the Zoning Ordinance, including the text and/or map, as to
any property covered by the Zoning Ordinance, and there is presented to the
Council a petition requesting such change or amendment and clearly describing
the property and its boundaries as to which the change or amendment is desired,

      B.   City Council Referral. The owner of a property may submit a written
request to the Zoning Administrator for their property to be rezoned. If the
requested rezoning is not consistent with the adopted Comprehensive Plan, the
property owner may further request the Comprehensive Plan be amended as part of
the requested rezoning. The Zoning Administrator will then present this request
to the City Council, who, at their discretion, may adopt a motion to refer the
request to the Zoning Commission for consideration at a duly noticed public
meeting in accordance with their procedures and the noticing requirements
contained herein. The findings and recommendations of the Zoning Commission
shall then be forwarded to the City Council for consideration and action. The
City Council may further by motion forward their own request to the Zoning

depth of one lot or not to exceed two hundred (200) feet therefrom, or of those
directly opposite thereto, extending the depth of one lot or not to exceed two
hundred (200) feet from the street frontage of such opposite lots, such
amendment shall not become effective except by the favorable vote of at least
three-fourths (¾) of all members of the Council. Whenever any petition for
amendment, supplement or change of the zoning districts or regulations herein
contained or subsequently established has been denied by the Council, then no
new petition covering the same property or the same property and additional
property shall be filed with or considered by the Council until one year shall
have elapsed from the date of filing of the first petition.

         (2)   Prohibited Materials. A fence or wall may not be designed to
cause pain or injury to humans or animals. Therefore, the use of spikes, broken
glass, barbed wire, razor wire, nails, electrical charge or other similar
materials shall be prohibited.
         (3)   Construction and Maintenance. All fences shall be constructed in
a sound and sturdy manner and shall be maintained in a good state of repair,
including the replacement of defective parts, painting, and other acts required
for maintenance. The Zoning Administrator after ten (10) days' notice to the
owner of the fence, may order the removal of any fence that is not maintained
in accordance with the provisions of this Code, and the cost assessed against
the property where said fence is located. An extension of time may be granted,
upon filing a verified statement that the delay is not a result of any act of
the owner.
      J.   Measuring Fence or Wall Height. The height of a fence or wall shall
be determined by a measurement from the ground beneath the fence or wall as
follows:
         (1)   In a yard abutting a street, the total effective fence or wall
height above the finished grade shall be measured on the side nearest the
street. Notwithstanding, if a property or premises is lower than an adjacent
street, then the height of the fence or wall shall be determined by a
measurement from the street grade at a ninety degree (90°) angle from the fence
or wall; provided the total vertical measurement from the ground beneath the
fence or wall to the top of the fence or wall shall not exceed eight feet (8').
         (2)   In any other required yard, the total effective fence or wall
height above the finished grade shall be measured on the side nearest the
adjacent property.
         (3)   On a property line, the fence or wall height shall be measured
from the finished grade of the side of the adjacent property.
         (4)   Swales and other earth depressions up to six feet (6') wide
shall not be used when measuring the fence or wall height.
         (5)   Manmade earth berms, terraces, and retaining walls that elevate
the fence or wall shall be considered a part of the fence or wall, except in
the case of a fence or wall constructed within an industrial zoning district or
as otherwise may be required by the City for the purposes of screening.
      K.   Overland Flowage Easements.
         (1)   Fences may encroach into an overland flowage easement providing

subject to a minimum setback of ten (10) feet for the purpose of containing
livestock.
         (2)   Industrial Districts. In industrial districts, fences topped

Adjustment, provided the barbed wire is not less than six (6) feet above the
ground.
         (3)   Recreational Purposes. Fences associated with the uses of a
sports or recreational facility or other similar area, shall not be subject to
the height restrictions specified elsewhere in this section, provided that such
fence is constructed to maintain a consistency of at least seventy five percent
(75%) open space for the full length of the fence and does not impede the
required vision clearance. Any such fence is subject to design review and
approval of the Zoning Administrator.
         (4)   Governmental Properties. Fences associated with governmental
(federal, state, county, city) facilities and properties.
         (5)   Temporary Fences. Temporary or seasonal fences, e.g., snow
fence, garden fence, are exempt from permitting requirements providing they are
not more than four (4) feet in height. Snow fence shall be allowed to be placed
from the first day of November through the first day of April of the following
year. Snow fence shall not be allowed at any other time of the year, unless it
is being placed as safety or construction fencing in accordance with the
temporary construction fence requirements of this Chapter.
         (6)   Temporary Construction Fence. Temporary construction fences,
barricades, railings, or other similar fences installed to provide temporary
site security and/or safety in conjunction with construction work may be
allowed in any district during periods of construction. Any such temporary
fences shall be removed upon completion of the construction work.
         (7)   Existing Fence. Repair of existing, legal but nonconforming
fences shall not be subject to the setback or height regulations, if the repair
or replacement coincides with the location and height of the existing fence.
Complete replacement of an existing fence requires compliance with the terms of
this Chapter. Complete replacement shall be defined as the removal or
replacement of forty (40) percent or more of the existing fence.
   5.   Nonconformities.
      A.   Nonconforming Uses. Within the districts established by this chapter
or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures and uses
of land and structures which were lawful before the Zoning Ordinance was passed
or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the
terms of this chapter or future amendment. It is the intent of this chapter to
permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to
encourage their survival. Such uses are declared by this chapter to be
incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the
intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon,
expanded or extended, or be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses
prohibited elsewhere in the same district. A nonconforming use of a structure,
a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land
shall not be extended or enlarged by attachment on a building or premises of
additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition
of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district
involved. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter and upon which actual building
construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby
defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position
and fastened in a permanent manner, except that where demolition or removal of
an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding,
such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided
that work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building
involved.
      B.   Nonconforming Lots of Record. In any district in which single-family
dwellings are permitted the single-family dwelling and customary accessory
buildings may be erected as a variance on a single lot of record at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, notwithstanding that
such fails to meet the requirements for area or width or both that are
generally applicable in the district where it is located. Yard dimensions and
other requirements not involving area or width shall conform to the regulations
for the district in which the lot is located. Such variance of area or width
shall be permitted only after approval by the Board of Adjustment.
      C.   Nonconforming Uses of Land. Where, at the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this chapter, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer
permissible under the terms of this chapter as enacted or amended, such use may
be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
         (1)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased or
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
         (2)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to
any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.
         (3)   If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for
a period of more than six months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform
to the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which such
land is located.
      D.   Nonconforming Structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that could not be built
under the terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot
coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or its
location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
         (1)   No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which
increases its nonconformity.
         (2)   Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of
more than 50 percent of its replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall
not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter,
unless the following exception is met:
            a.   Except for the provisions in Section 161.22, an exception will
be given to single-family detached residential uses in nonresidential
districts, where the residential building or detached accessory structure is
damaged by catastrophe or natural disaster. Reconstruction of the structure or
building shall be permitted provided that there is no increase in the number of
dwelling units. The reconstruction of the building or structure shall not
increase in the degree of nonconformity and shall be within the same building
line as the original structure, as determined by the Zoning Administrator. The
reconstruction of the building or structure shall meet all other pertinent
codes and regulations existing at the time of reconstruction. Reconstruction
must begin within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of damage, or the
use will be deemed discontinued, abandoned, or vacated. At the desecration of
the Zoning Administrator, an extension may be granted to the one hundred eighty
(180) days if there is evidence that efforts are being made to reconstruct the
structure, but unavoidable delays beyond the owners’ control are occurring.
This exception will not be granted when nonaccidental causes, intentional acts
by the owner, lessee, or other person such as arson, or by circumstances of
neglect where the building runs down or becomes dilapidated are in evidence.
(Ord. 1774 – Jun. 25 Supp.)
      E.   Nonconforming Uses of Structures. If a lawful use of a structure, or
of structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter, that would not be allowed in the
district under the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may be continued so
long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
         (1)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this
chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
         (2)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building.
         (3)   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of
a structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming
use provided that the Board of Adjustment, either by general rule or by making
findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally
appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming
use. In permitting such change, the Board of Adjustment may require appropriate
conditions and safeguards in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
         (4)   Any structure or structure and land in combination, in or on
which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter
conform to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located
and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
         (5)   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and
premises in combination is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months
or for 18 months during any three-year period, the structure, thereafter, shall
not be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which
it is located.
         (6)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and
premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall
eliminate the nonconforming status of the land.
      F.   Repairs and Maintenance. On any building devoted in whole or in part
to any nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive
months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls,
fixtures, wiring or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding 10 percent of the
current replacement value of the building provided that the cubic content of
the building as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter
shall not be increased. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening of or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part
thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the
public safety, upon order of such official.

      K.   Planned Unit Development (PUD).
         (1)   Intent: The PUD District is intended to provide for the
development or redevelopment of land under the control and in accordance with
an approved Master Plan. The development guidelines and standards in which land
uses, transportation facilities, building densities, arrangements, and types
are set out in a unified Master Plan in order to provide greater flexibility of
land use, development densities, and building locations than other zoning
districts may allow.
         The PUD District is intended to maximize benefits from the use of open
spaces, preserve natural areas and existing tree cover, protect steep slopes,
maximize aesthetics, encourage certain architectural standards for buildings,
and permit mixed uses and diversity of bulk regulations without endangering the
general health, safety, welfare, and land value of surrounding and internal
properties. A PUD may consist of a single use or a mix of residential,
commercial, and limited industrial uses, provided such PUD is compatible with
the Future Land Use Map and Comprehensive Plan of the City. It is not the
intent of the PUD district to be utilized to reduce or provide relief from an
existing zoning regulation or requirement.
         (2)   Procedures:
            a.   Application: The owner or owners of a parcel of land within
the zoning jurisdiction of the City may submit to the Zoning Administrator an
application accompanied by a PUD Master Plan requesting a rezoning to the PUD
Zoning District. The application form, Master Plan (including number of
copies), proposed development rules and regulations, design guidelines, and
other submittal details and requirements shall be as determined by the Zoning
Administrator as necessary to review the request. The required application fee
shall be as determined by resolution of the City Council.
            b.   Review Process: The PUD Application shall be reviewed by the
Zoning Administrator for completeness. Applications deemed incomplete shall be
returned to the applicant with a list of the missing or incomplete items.
Applications deemed complete shall be distributed by the Zoning Administrator
to other City departments and agencies as necessary for review and comment as
to its compliance with all zoning regulations and other pertinent City codes,
regulations, standards, and policies.
            c.   Subsequent to review by the Zoning Administrator and other
City departments and agencies, the Zoning Administrator shall submit to all
members of the Planning and Zoning Commission a copy of the PUD Application
along with a written recommendation as to the request’s conformity with the
rules and regulations of the City and may include a recommendation for
approval, approval with conditions, or denial of the application.
            d.   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall subsequently hold a
public meeting for a rezoning as prescribed by their rules of procedures and
the Zoning Ordinance and review the PUD Application for conformity with the
zoning regulations and standards and may confer with the applicant on changes
to their requested as may be deemed advisable. The Planning and Zoning
Commission shall consider the following as part of their deliberation:
               i.   Compatibility with the Future Land Use Map and the
Comprehensive Plan.
               ii.   Land uses, building sizes and densities, and number of
dwelling units.
               iii.   Building types, functions, architecture, and building
placement and setbacks.
               iv.   Provisions for open space, landscaping, buffers,
pedestrian circulation, and storm water management.
               v.   Preservation and protection of natural features,
drainageways, steep slopes, and existing tree cover.
               vi.   Provisions for adequate public infrastructure including
sanitary sewer and water service, storm water run-off, public parks, and public
safety services.
               vii.   Traffic circulation and congestions including access to
and from the site.
               viii.   General relationship to and impact on the surrounding
area and neighboring properties.
            After completion of its deliberation, the Planning and Zoning
Commission may adopt a recommendation for approval or denial of the PUD Master
Plan and associated development rules, regulations, and guidelines as
submitted. The Planning and Zoning Commission may also request the developer
agree to certain conditions or agree to make certain modifications,
alterations, adjustments, or amendments to the proposed Master Plan and
associated rules, regulations, and guidelines in order to secure a
recommendation of approval from the Planning and Zoning Commission.
            The Planning and Zoning Commission shall forward its recommendation
to the City Council within 60 days of the receipt of a PUD Application deemed
complete by the Zoning Administrator. If the Planning and Zoning Commission
does not act within the 60 days as prescribed above, the PUD Application shall
be deemed to have received a recommendation of approval by the Planning and
Zoning Commission unless the applicant agrees to an extension of time.
            Within 60 days of receiving a recommendation from the Planning and
Zoning Commission, the City Council shall hold a public hearing for a rezoning
as prescribed by their rules of procedures and the Zoning Ordinance and review
the PUD Application for conformity with the zoning regulations and standards.
During this hearing, the City Council may confer with the applicant on changes
to their request as may be deemed advisable in order to secure the approval by
the City Council. The City Council may approve, approve with conditions or
modifications as agreed to by the applicant, or deny the application. If the
City Council fails to act within the herein prescribed 60- day period, the PUD
Application shall be deemed to have been denied, unless both the applicant and
the City Council agree to an extension of time.
            Whenever any PUD Application has been denied by the City Council,
no new application covering the same property, or the same property and
additional property, shall be filed with or considered by the City Council
until one year has elapsed from the date of the filing of the first
application.
            e.   Recording of the Master Plan and Associated Regulations and
Guidelines: The ordinance providing for the rezoning of the property to the PUD
Zoning District and the associated Master Plan, Regulations, and Guidelines as
approved by the City Council shall be recorded at the Office of the Warren
County Recorder and shall be binding on the property owners, their heirs,
successors, or assigns. No phase of the PUD shall be started, and no building
permits shall be issued until all documents have been recorded.
            f.   Modifications: Any application by the property owner or owners
for modification to an approved PUD shall first be reviewed by the Planning and
Zoning Commission. Said proposed modification along with a report from the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall then be forwarded to the City Council with
appropriate recommendations. The City Council shall then take such appropriate
action on the proposed modification and their decision shall be final.
            No modification may be considered that is more than a ten percent
(10%) increase in density or change of uses of the site without a public
hearing by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council as required for
a rezoning. A public hearing may be held by the Planning and Zoning Commission
or City Council on any requested modification. All modifications and
adjustments shall be recorded at the Office of the Warren County Recorder.
            g.   Platting and Development: Prior to development within the PUD,
applications for Preliminary and Final Plats, Site Plans, and Building Permits
that are in conformance with the provisions of the PUD shall be submit for
review in accordance with the City’s regulations. At the applicant’s own risk,
Preliminary Plats, Final Plats, and Sites Plans may be submitted and reviewed
concurrently with the PUD Application process.

differs than that required for the specific residential zoning district and
excluding non-residential structures and dwellings within the A-1 Zoning
District, the front yard setback for the subject lot shall be equal to the
average of the front yard depths of any existing immediate adjacent dwellings
on the same side of the street.
         (1)   The front yard setback measured from the face of any garage
accessed from the street shall be a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet,
regardless of the averaged front yard depth.

contained within Section 165.03 of the Zoning Code, second as may be defined
elsewhere in the City Code, and finally the commonly understood definition as
determined by the Zoning Administrator.
   A proposed use may follow under more than one category; however, for the
purposes of this section, the proposed use shall follow the closest, most
similar or specific use as listed in the Use Matrix.
   It shall be the sole discretion of the Zoning Administrator to make the
determine as to where a proposed use falls within the Uses Table, whether it
fits within or is similar to a use listed within the Uses Table or is otherwise
not listed and therefore not permitted. The determination by the Zoning
Administrator is appealable to the Board of Adjustment per the procedures as
provided in city code.

   5.   Standards For All Zoning Districts.
      A.   Small Wind Energy Conversion Systems
         (1)   Intent. The intent of this section is to balance the need for
clean, renewable energy resources and the necessity to protect the public
health, safety and welfare of the community. The City finds these regulations
are necessary to ensure that Small Wind Energy Conversion Systems are
appropriately designed, sited and installed.
         (2)   Definitions. The following terms are defined for this section:
            a.   “Height, total system” means the height above grade of the
system, including the generating unit and the highest vertical extension of any
blades or rotors.
            b.   “Lot” (or parcel) means any legally established lot or parcel
which contains or could contain a permitted or special use as provided by
Chapter 165 of this Code of Ordinances.
            c.   “Off grid” means an electrical system that is not connected to
utility distribution and transmission facilities or to any building or
structure that is connected.
            d.   “Shadow flicker” means changing light intensity caused by
sunlight through the moving blades of a wind energy conversion system.
            e.   “Small Wind Energy Conversion System (SWECS)” means a wind
energy conversion system which has a nameplate rated capacity of up to 15
kilowatts for residential uses and districts and up to 100 kilowatts for
commercial and industrial districts and which is incidental and subordinate to
a principal use on the same parcel. A system is considered a SWECS only if it
supplies electrical power solely for use by the owner on the site, except that
when a parcel on which the system is installed also receives electrical power
supplied by a utility company, excess electrical power generated and not
presently needed by the owner for on site use may be used by the utility
company in accordance with Section 199, Chapter 15.11(5) of the Iowa
Administrative Code, as amended from time to time.
            f.   “Small Wind Energy Conversion System, free standing” means a
SWECS which is elevated by means of a monopole tower only and is not located on
another supporting structure except that the tower shall have an appropriately
constructed concrete base. Guyed, lattice, or other non- monopole style towers
shall not meet this definition.
            g.   “Small Wind Energy Conversion System, horizontal axis” means a
small wind energy conversion system that has blades which rotate through a
horizontal plane.
            h.   “Small Wind Energy Conversion System, building mounted” means
a SWECS which is securely fastened to any portion of a principal building in
order to achieve desired elevation, whether attached directly to the principal
building or attached to a tower structure which is in turn fastened to the
principal building. These systems are prohibited by this chapter.
            i.   “Small Wind Energy Conversion System, vertical axis” means a
small wind energy conversion system that has blades which rotate through a
vertical plane.
            j.   “Tower” means the vertical component of a wind energy
conversion system that elevates the wind turbine generator and attached blades
above the ground.
            k.   “Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS)” means an aggregation of
parts including the foundation, base, tower, generator, rotor, blades,
supports, guy wires and accessory equipment such as utility interconnect and
battery banks, etc., in such configuration as necessary to convert the power of
wind into mechanical or electrical energy, e.g., wind charger, windmill or wind
turbine.
            l.   “Wind turbine generator” means the component of a wind energy
conversion system that transforms mechanical energy from the wind into
electrical energy.
         (3)   General Regulations.
            a.   Special Use Permit. A Small Wind Energy Conversion System
(SWECS) shall be allowed only as an accessory use to a permitted principal use
and with approval of a special use permit from the Board of Adjustment.
            b.   Zoning. SWECS may be allowed in any zoning district subject to
the provisions contained herein and elsewhere within this City Code.
            c.   Permit Required. It shall be unlawful to construct, erect,
install, alter or locate any SWECS within the City, unless a special use permit
has been obtained from the Board of Adjustment. The special use permit may be
revoked by resolution of the Board of Adjustment any time the approved system
does not comply with the rules set forth in this chapter and the conditions
imposed by the Board of Adjustment. The owner/operator of the SWECS must also
obtain any other permits required by other federal, state and local agencies/
departments prior to constructing the system. Application for SWECS shall be
made on forms provided by the City. No action may be taken regarding requests
for SWECS until completed applications have been filed and fees paid.
            d.   Number of Systems per Zoning Lot. No more than one
freestanding SWECS may be placed on any parcel or lot. Additional freestanding
SWECS are prohibited.
            e.   Tower. Only monopole towers shall be permitted for
freestanding SWECS. Lattice, guyed or towers of any other type shall not be
considered to be in compliance with this chapter.
            f.   Color. Freestanding SWECS shall be a neutral color such as
white, sky blue or light gray. Other colors may be allowed at the discretion of
the Board of Adjustment. The surface shall be non-reflective.
            g.   Lighting. No lights shall be installed on the tower, unless
required to meet FAA regulations.
            h.   Signage. No signage or advertising of any kind shall be
permitted on the tower or any associated structures.
            i.   Climbing Apparatus. The tower must be designed to prevent
climbing within the first 10 feet.
            j.   Maintenance. Facilities shall be well maintained in accordance
with manufacturer’s specifications and shall remain in an operational condition
that poses no potential safety hazard nor is in violation of any provisions
contained within this chapter or elsewhere within this City Code.
            k.   Displacement of Parking Prohibited. The location of the SWECS
shall not result in the net loss of required parking as specified elsewhere in
the City Zoning Code.
            l.   Utility Notification. The City shall notify the utility of
receipt of an application to install an interconnected customer-owned
generator. Off- grid systems shall be exempt from this notification
requirement.
            m.   Interconnection. The SWECS, if not off-grid, shall meet the
requirements for interconnection and operation as set forth by the utility and
the Iowa Utilities Board. No permit of any kind shall be issued until the City
has been provided with a copy of an executed interconnection agreement. Off-
grid systems shall be exempt from this requirement.
            n.   Restriction on Use of Electricity Generated. A SWECS shall be
used exclusively to supply electrical power to the owner for on site
consumption, except that excess electrical power generated by the SWECS and not
presently needed for use by the owner may be used by the utility company in
accordance with Section 199, Chapter 15.11(5) of the Iowa Administrative Code,
as may be subsequently amended.
            o.   Noise. A SWECS shall be designed, installed and operated so
that the noise generated does not exceed the maximum noise levels established
elsewhere in this City Code.
            p.   Shadow Flicker. No SWECS shall be installed and operated so to
cause a shadow flicker to fall on or in any existing residential structure.
            q.   Safety Controls. Each SWECS shall be equipped with both an
automatic and manual braking, governing, or feathering system to prevent
uncontrolled rotation, over- speeding, and excessive pressure on the tower
structure, rotor blades, or turbine components. Said automatic braking system
shall also be capable of stopping turbine rotation in the event of a power
outage so as to prevent back feeding of the grid.
            r.   Shut Off. A clearly marked and easily accessible shut off for
the wind turbine will be required as determined by the Community Development
Director.
            s.   Electromagnetic Interference. All SWECS shall be designed and
constructed so as not to cause radio and television interference. If it is
determined that the SWECS is causing electromagnetic interference, the owner/
operator shall take the necessary corrective action to eliminate this
interference including relocation or removal of the facilities, subject to the

chapter, may refuse to grant approval to a site plan even though it complies
with the specific design standards if, in the opinion of the relevant approval
authority, it does not comply with the general design policies as hereinafter
enumerated. Any site plan presented shall be designed in such a way as to
insure the orderly and harmonious development of property in such a manner as
will safeguard the public’s health, safety and general welfare, as hereinafter
set out.
         (1)   The design of the proposed improvements shall make adequate
provisions for surface and subsurface drainage, for connections to water and
sanitary sewer lines, each so designed as to neither overload existing public
utility lines for what they were designed nor increase the danger of erosion,
flooding, landslide or other endangerment of adjoining or surrounding property.
         (2)   The proposed improvements shall be designed and located within
the property in such manner as not to unduly diminish or impair the use and
enjoyment of adjoining property, and to this end shall minimize the adverse
effects on such adjoining property from automobile headlights, illuminations of
required perimeter yards, refuse containers and impairment of natural light and
impairment or pollution of air. For the purpose of this section, the term “use
and enjoyment of adjoining property” means the use and enjoyment presently
being made of such adjoining property, unless such property is vacant. If
vacant, the term “use and enjoyment of adjoining property” means those uses
permitted under the zoning districts in which such adjoining property is
located.

chapter, building permits may be issued, as long as all other requirements of
the City, State and County are met, and construction may commence. In order for
the relevant review authority to approve a site plan application, the following
specific design standards must be met:
         (1)   Storm Water Management Required.
            a.   Site plans must provide for adequate routing of all storm
water run-off including but not limited to downspout discharge, footing drain
discharge and parking lot runoff.
            b.   Storm water may not be directed out driveways into the City
right-of-way, except where permitted by the City. Storm water shall be
collected and piped to a storm sewer where a storm sewer is available within
300 feet from the property line. The storm sewer system’s pipes and intakes
shall be capable of conveying runoff from a five-year recurrence interval storm
from the site and tributary upstream areas.
            c.   Storm water runoff calculations shall be made utilizing the
Soil Conservation Service methods as presented in Technical Release No. 55,
Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, Soil Conservation Service, U.S.
Department of Agriculture. The Zoning Administrator may waive this requirement,
provided the area to be developed is less than 10,000 square feet.
            d.   Existing overland drainage courses must be maintained and
improved to provide capacity to convey the runoff from a 100-year recurrence
interval storm across the site. Storm water runoff shall be computed on the
basis of a fully developed drainage basin, using the method prescribed in
Paragraph B of this subsection. No reduction in the required overland drainage
course capacity will be made due to use of storm sewers or storm water
detention facilities. Easements for the overland drainage course must be
prepared by the developer and conveyed to the City.
            e.   Storm water detention is required for all sites larger than
one acre in size, unless it is determined by the Zoning Administrator to be
unnecessary or impractical. The maximum allowable discharge rate from the storm
water detention facility will be limited to that from a five-year return
frequency storm after development of the site. Storm water runoff and storm
water detention facilities shall be determined using the method prescribed in
this subsection, in accordance with the provisions of Iowa Code Section 364.3
(18). The discharge rate shall be controlled at the detention facilities
outlets and not in the storm sewer size serving the site.
(Ord. 1742 - Oct. 24 Supp.)
         (2)   Storm Water Management Plans. Unless otherwise not required as
determined by the Zoning Administrator, a storm water management plan in
compliance with this section shall be included as part of the site plan
application. This storm water management plan shall include storm water
calculations certified by an engineer registered in the State of Iowa and
familiar with such calculations. This plan shall further follow recognized best
practices for storm water management including those outlined in the Iowa
Stormwater Management Manual as prepared by the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources.
(Ord. 1775 – Jun. 25 Supp.)
         (3)   Grading. To help alleviate erosion and maintenance problems,
ground slope should not exceed 4:1. However, the approval authority may approve
a maximum ground slope of 3:1 for special reasons.
         (4)   Paving Standards. Parking lots and access drives shall be hard-
surfaced, limited to a maximum slope of six percent in a direction
perpendicular to the car. Driveways shall not exceed a 10 percent slope. Except
for the individual driveways for Single-Family, Two-Family, and Townhouse or
Row Dwellings, an integral six- inch Portland cement concrete (PCC) curb shall
be provided along the edges of all parking lots, drive aisles, loading area,
access drives, and driveways. Openings within the required curbing may be
permitted for the purposes of conveying storm water.
            a.   Where Portland cement concrete pavement is used, the pavement
shall comply with the materials and be constructed in such a manner as to
provide an equivalent finished product as specified in the most current
Standard Specifications for Highway and Bridge Construction, Iowa Department of
Transportation, utilizing a “Class C Concrete” mix Class 2 or 3 durability
coarse aggregate.
            b.   Where asphaltic cement concrete pavement is used, the pavement
shall comply with the materials and be constructed in such a manner as to
provide an equivalent finished product as specified in the Standard
Specifications for Highway and Bridge Construction, Iowa Department of
Transportation. The pavement shall utilize nonrecycled virgin material which
shall include Type B base and Type A surface courses and which shall comply
with the most current Iowa Department of Transportation job-mix formula.
            c.   Where asphaltic cement concrete is placed on a crushed stone
base, the base shall comply with an approved Iowa Department of Transportation
Class A or B crushed stone base material and gradation.

165.07 OFF-STREET PARKING REGULATIONS.
   1.   Statement of Intent. It is the intent of this article to prevent
traffic congestion and to provide for proper traffic safety by preserving the
public thoroughfares for the unimpaired movement of pedestrian and vehicular
traffic. In all districts, there shall be provided at the time any new building
or structure is erected, off-street parking spaces in accordance with the
requirements set forth herein. The requirements of this Article are minimum
standards, and in certain uses these requirements may be inadequate. Where
review of the site plans and intended land use indicate through the application
of proven standards or experienced statistics that the requirements herein are
inadequate for the specific land use adaptation, a different requirement for
off-street parking may be required or approved to preserve the intent of this
ordinance.
   2.   Off-Street Loading and Parking Spaces Required.
      A.   Off-Street Loading Spaces.
         (1)   In any district, in connection with every building or part
thereof hereafter erected, having a gross floor area of 10,000 square feet or
more, which is to be occupied by manufacturing, storage, warehouse, goods
display, retail store, wholesale store, market, hotel, hospital, mortuary,
laundry, dry cleaning or other uses similarly requiring the receipt or
distribution by vehicles of material or merchandise, there shall be provided
and maintained on the same lot with such building, at least one off-street
loading space plus one additional such loading space for each 20,000 square
feet, or major fraction thereof, of gross floor area, so used, in excess of
10,000 square feet.
         (2)   Each loading space shall be not less than 12 feet in width and
40 feet in length.
         (3)   Such space may occupy all or any part of any required rear or
side yard, except where adjoining a residentially zoning property, and shall be
setback and screened as required within this chapter and elsewhere within the
Zoning Regulations.
         (4)   All loading yards and access drives to loading yards and loading
docks shall be paved with asphaltic or Portland cement concrete pavement in
accordance with surfacing requirements set forth in this section.
      B.   Off-Street Parking Spaces.
         (1)   All parking and storage of vehicles, trailers, recreational
vehicles, campers, boats and similar recreation equipment shall occur only upon
paved surfaces designed and constructed per the regulations contained herein
this Chapter. Unlicensed or inoperable vehicles and equipment shall not be
stored outside unless part of an approved storage area on a property located
within the M-1 or M-2 zoning districts. In all zoning districts space for
parking and storage of vehicles and trailers shall be provided in accordance
with the Off-Street Parking Required Table and the standards contained herein
this Chapter. Required off-street parking facilities shall be primarily for the
parking of private passenger automobiles of occupants, patrons, or employees of
the principal use served.
         (2)   Off-Street Parking Required Table: The following table
identifies the minimum number of parking spaces required for the specified use.
In no case shall the parking provided on a site be more than 150% of the
minimum that is required. The intent of these standards is to provide the
appropriate number of parking spaces on site for the given use and to
accommodate changes in uses over time. No off-street parking shall be required
in the C-3 Zoning District. At the discretion of the Zoning Administrator, the
City may require the amount of parking required for a site be based on the
parking standards contained within the latest edition of the ITE Parking
Generation manual or by an alternative parking study and analysis.

         (3)   Calculating of Parking Required. In computing the number of
parking spaces required, the following rules shall govern:
            a.   Uses Not Specifically Mentioned. In the case of any building,
structure or premises, the use of which is not specifically mentioned herein,
the provisions for a use which is so mentioned, and to which said use is
similar, shall apply.
            b.   Unknown Uses. Where new buildings are proposed but the owner
or developer does not wish to designate the type of use that will occupy the
building, the most intensive use possible (recognizing the use imitations of
the zoning on the property) shall determine the parking requirements.
            c.   Fractional Spaces. Any space 0.5 or more shall be considered a
whole space.
            d.   Seating Capacity. When the unit of measurement determining the
number of required parking spaces is based upon the seating capacity of a
structure or use, each 24 inches of pew, bench or other seating shall count as
one seat.
            e.   Employees. When the unit of measure determining the number of
required parking spaces is based on the number of employees, the maximum shift
or employment period during which the greatest number of employees is present
at the structure or use shall be used in the computation.
            f.   Two or More Different Uses. If a building contains two or more
differing uses, the parking requirement shall be determined by the addition of
the parking requirements for each use. This calculation may be modified at the
discretion of the Zoning Administrator.
         (4)   Accessibility parking. Accessibility parking (handicapped
parking) shall be provided in accordance with State and Federal law
requirements, the Statewide Urban Design and Specifications (SUDAS) as
maintained by the Institute for Transportation at Iowa State University, and
provided spaces shall count towards the total parking requirement.
         (5)   Gross Floor Area. The term "gross floor area" (GFA) means the
area included within the exterior walls of a building or portion thereof,
exclusive of vent shaft and courts and any portion of a structure above or
below ground used for off- street parking, loading areas, or mechanical
equipment.
         (6)   Off-Site Parking. Off-street parking areas for residential uses
shall be provided on the same lot. Non-residential uses may be permitted off-
site parking areas at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator.
         (7)   Garages and Structured Parking. Each parking space within a
residential garage that is directly connected to an individual dwelling unit
may count towards the fulfillment of the parking space requirement. In all
other situations, each parking space within a residential garage or parking
structure shall count as 0.5 (one-half) of a parking space for the purposes of
calculating the fulfillment of the parking space requirement.
         (8)   Tandem Parking. Tandem parking spaces, defined as a parking
space that is only accessed by passing through another parking space from a
street, lane, drive aisle or driveway, are not permitted and shall not be
counted towards the fulfillment of the parking space requirement except when
within the individual driveway of a single-family residence or manufactured
home, within the individual driveway that is directly in front of a garage that
is connected to an individual townhome or apartment unit, or within a parking
facility when an attendant is on duty during the hours when the facility is
being used. The minimum required depth of a tandem parking space is 20-feet.
         (9)   Alternate Calculations and Deferrals. At their full discretion,
the Zoning Administrator may approve an alternate method for calculating the
required parking for a given site including credit for shared parking between
off-peak uses and parking shared at multi-tenant retail centers. The Zoning
Administrator may further defer the construction of required parking to a date
certain, as part of a future phases, or upon determination of need. Deferred
parking must be identified upon the site plan and accommodated as part of the
site plan design including storm water management.
         (10)   Bicycle Parking. Every building greater than 5,000 square feet
in gross floor area that contains a retail or office use shall provide or have
access to a shared or common bike parking facility, such as a bike rack or bike
lock boxes or an indoor bike storage area.
   3.   Parking Area Design Requirements. Every lot or parcel of land hereafter
used as a public or private parking area, including a commercial parking lot,
shall be developed and maintained in accordance with the following
requirements. At the discretion of the Zoning Administrator, any design
standard contained herein may be superseded by the standards contained in the
Statewide Urban Design and Specifications (SUDAS) as maintained by the
Institute for Transportation at Iowa State University.
      A.   Access Drive and Driveways. An access drives (or driveway) is

of a driveway. Driveway tapers, as may be necessary to transition the driveway
to meet the maximum allowable driveway width as measured at the right-of-way
line, shall begin no less than 10-feet from said right-of-way line. The design
of the driveway apron within the public street right-of-way shall be in
accordance with the design standards as established by the City.
            b.   All other access drives and driveways shall be a minimum 24-
feet wide for two-way drives and 16-feet wide for one-way drives.
         (3)   Parking lot interconnections required. In order to provide
mutually beneficial cross circulation and access, the parking lots for
adjoining similar commercial and office uses shall be interconnected unless
impractical due to topography or other physical constraints of either site.
         (4)   Paving. All driveways, access drives, and off-street parking and
loading areas shall be paved with hot mix asphalt (HMA), Portland cement
concrete (PCC), or pavers (including permeable pavement and paver systems).
            a.   The design and construction of said pavement or pavers shall
be of sufficient thickness, reinforcement, and sub-base necessary to provide a
durable, dustless surface designed and rated for the traffic it is anticipated
to carry.
            b.   All paved areas shall be so graded and drained as to dispose
of all surface water accumulation within the area and shall be so arranged and
marked as to provide for orderly and safe loading or unloading and parking and
storage of self-propelled vehicles.
            c.   On properties zoned agricultural that have a minimum lot size
of 15 acres, aggregate may be used for driveways given that the driveway
approaches are paved through the right-of-way line.
            d.   No vehicles or trailers shall be parked or stored upon an
unpaved surface except as may be permitted within a designated and approved
outdoor storage area. See Section 165.06, Section 4 for specific design
standards.
(Ord. 1737 - Oct. 24 Supp.)
         (5)   Curbing. Except for the individual driveways for Single-Family,
Two- Family, and Townhouse or Row Dwellings, an integral six-inch Portland
cement concrete (PCC) curb shall be provided along the edges of all parking
lots, drive aisles, loading area, access drives, and driveways. Openings within
the required curbing may be permitted for the purposes of conveying storm
water. Prefabricated curbs or wheel stops are prohibited unless specifically
approved by the Zoning Administer at their discretion.
         (6)   Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be required as necessary to connect
parking areas to the building entrances. In addition, at least one sidewalk
connection shall be made to the public sidewalk. All sidewalks shall be a
minimum 5-feet in width. Sidewalk adjoining parking stalls shall be widened a
minimum 2-feet in width as necessary to accommodate vehicle overhang.
         (7)   Parking Lot Markings and Traffic Control Signage. Parking lots,
drive aisles, and driveways shall be marked and signed per the standards within
the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). The location of each
parking space shall be identified by surface markings or other effective means
and shall be maintained so as to be readily visible at all times.
         (8)   Maintenance Required. All paved areas shall be properly

165.08 OPEN SPACE, LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERING.
   1.   Statement of Intent. Landscaping and landscaped open spaces provide
multiple benefits including energy conservation, increased property values, and
an enhanced aesthetic quality throughout the City. Combined, these benefits
promote the health and general welfare of the citizens of Indianola. The
purpose of this section is to establish minimum standards to achieve the
following objectives: preservation of existing vegetation and topsoil;
protection of water quality and wildlife habitat; reduction of heat generated
from paved surfaces, buffering of incompatible land uses and screening negative
site elements; and, enhancement of the overall appearance and natural beauty of
the community.
   2.   Applicability. These regulations shall apply to new development, the
redevelopment of existing sites, all site modifications including building
additions and expansions, new parking lots and paved area expansions, and the
subdivision of land within all zoning districts. The approval authority can
approve alternative landscaping standards in order to address special or unique
circumstances provided the overall intent of this section is met.
   3.   Definitions. The following terms are defined for this section:
      A.   Deciduous Ornamental Tree. A deciduous tree (often an ornamental
type tree) that reaches a mature height of less than 30 feet.
      B.   Deciduous Shade Tree. Defined as a deciduous tree with one vertical
stem or trunk which begins branching at a height of six (6) feet or more and
has a distinct crown that reaches a mature height of at least 30 feet.
      C.   Evergreen / Coniferous Tree. Defined as a tree that has needle-
shaped or scale like leaves that remain green throughout the year; commonly
referred to as pine, fir, and spruce trees. These trees generally reach a
mature height of over 25 feet.
      D.   Invasive Plant Species. A plant reproducing outside its native range
and outside cultivation that disrupts naturally occurring native plant
communities by altering structure, composition, natural processes or habitat
quality. Invasive plants are those plants recognized by the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources (Iowa Code; Chapter 317.1A Noxious weeds).
      E.   No Mow and Low Maintenance Grasses. Defined as cultivated grasses
that do not grow taller than 12 inches or require limited mowing to maintain a
height of 12 inches or less.

over 24-inches at mature height, that are specifically grown and cultivated for
their decorative properties. Most of the commonly used ornamental grasses are
non-native, introduced species such as: Feather Reed Grass, Blue Oat Grass,
Silvergrass, and Fountain Grass.
      H.   Prairie Grass Plantings. Native grasses and forbs (flowering plants)
found within the native prairie environment typical for the area prior to
clearance and cultivation of the land by European settlers. For the purposes of
this Chapter, prairie plantings may contain native grasses without forbs to
simplify prairie plant installation and maintenance.
      I.   Turf Grass. A continuous plant coverage consisting of a grass
species that is mowed or maintained at an established height of 6 inches or
less and can include native and non-native vegetation, e.g., Kentucky Blue

within a required buffer. Fences, sidewalks, and trails may be permitted within
a required buffer except that no fence may be constructed within a buffer that
fronts along a street.
         (3)   Buffer plantings should be in small groupings to appear more
natural versus evenly spaced in a line.
         (4)   Earth berming required within a buffer may vary and undulate to
accommodate drainage and to provide a more nature appearance.
      D.   Buffer Options. The following buffer options may be utilized to meet
the buffering requirements of this chapter, unless an alternate standard is
established by the Board of Adjustment as a condition for approval of a Special
Use Permit conditional use or by the City Council as a condition of a rezoning
or site plan approval to mitigate conditions that may otherwise be detrimental
to adjoining residential properties.
         (1)   30-Foot Wide Buffer.
            a.   Minimum Width: 30 feet.
            b.   Landscape Requirements: For every 25 linear feet of required

            c.   Earth Berming: three (3) foot tall.
         (3)   Buffer Reduction. Should the burden of a buffer requirement
cause a property to become practically undevelopable, at the sole discretion of
the Zoning Administrator, the width of a required buffer may be reduced in lieu
of the installation of additional landscaping, a minimum six (6) foot tall
privacy fence or masonry screen wall, and other measures necessary to mitigate
the impact on the property to be buffered.
   6.   Plant Materials Standards.
      A.   Plant Materials. All plants shall be of the type and species

the same ratio at which the credit was originally given. Failure to maintain
the landscaping in accordance with this provision shall constitute a violation
of the site’s site plan and/or building permit approval and certificate of
occupancy.
165.09 BUILDING DESIGN STANDARDS.
   1.   Statement of Intent. It is the intent of this section to establish
building design standards to enhance the general appearance, maintain and
improve the quality of life of residents and visitors, and protect the value of
properties within the City of Indianola. Building design and construction of
all buildings shall employing good design principals and quality building
materials to be long-lasting and in harmony with the neighboring properties and
the City. All buildings shall employ recognized architectural styles and design
principals on all sides and be proportional, with elements in scale. Building
exterior materials shall be applied in an authentic and honest manner
reflecting the material’s purpose, weight, and typical use in order to convey a
sense of strength and durability.
   2.   Applicability. With the exception of agriculturally related buildings,
these regulations shall apply to new development, the redevelopment of existing
sites and buildings, and all site and building modifications including building
additions and expansions and changes or modifications to building facades. All
new buildings, including accessory structures, and additions to existing
buildings shall be subject to the standards of this section. However, building
expansions or additions, including successive additions, totaling less than
twenty percent (20%) of the gross floor area of the existing building may use
the same or superior exterior building materials and building design that
matches that of the existing building.
   3.   Exceptions. The regulations of this section do apply to changes in
building facades but do not apply to building façade maintenance and repair
including repainting of existing painted surfaces, window, door, siding and
roof replacement with identical or similar materials. At the full discretion of
the City, deviations from these standards may be granted in order to ensure the
building addition is aesthetically compatible with the existing building design
and appearance.
   4.   Definitions. The following terms are defined for this section:
      A.   Primary Façade. All street-facing façades (i.e., all building
façades that face or front along a public or private street including
highways), and façades with a building’s main customer entrance. Buildings may
have more than one primary façade as is the case with buildings located on
corner lots and double frontage lots. All other façades shall be “secondary”
façades.
      B.   Street Facing Façade. All building façades that have frontage along
or face a public or private street at an angle of 45 degrees or less from the
street line. This definition includes those building façades separated from the
street by a parking lot or open space. This definition does not include
frontage along an internal drive that is not classified as a private street.
      C.   Major Façade Materials. Exterior finish materials that cover at
least 5% of a building’s façade area. Any material that covers less than 5% of
a building façade area shall not be considered a “major” façade material and
will not count towards meeting any requirement for use of multiple class 1, 2,
and/or 3 materials. A distinctly different color of fired clay brick (full
brick or brick veneer) may be considered as an additional Class 1 or Class 2
material for the purposes of meeting the required minimum number of different
major façade materials.
      D.   Façade Area. The total exterior wall area of all vertical or near-
vertical faces of a building wall four (4) feet in width or greater when viewed
in elevation. Façade area shall be calculated to exclude the wall area
resulting from minor projections and recessions from the predominant wall plane
less than four (4) feet in depth. Façade area shall be calculated to include
the area of parapets, cornices, and similar wall extensions and trim.
      E.   Accessory Building Standards. Accessory buildings in all non-
residential zoning districts, except for temporary and small movable structures
including ATMs and donation boxes, shall comply with the building design
requirements for the principal building of the lot or parcel on which the
accessory building is located. Garages and structured parking shall follow the
standards required of the primary building.
   5.   General Provisions. The following provisions shall not apply to
agricultural buildings, single-family and two-family dwellings, townhomes,
rowhouses, and multi-family residential buildings with 12 or fewer units.

      A.   Building Facadism. Building facadism, defined as the application of
false or fake building façades or elements over an existing building façade or
roof, is discouraged. Windows or dormers should be in proportion with and match
the adjoining roof pitch and have the appearance of being functional and
operational. Hip or mansard roofs that only partially conceal a roof well or
low slope roof area are also discouraged. Roof parapets and roof top screen
walls must have returns along the sides to conceal the edges. Building towers
and other above roof building elements must be multi-sided and finished on all
sides.
      B.   Application of Exterior Building Materials on Primary Facades.
         (1)   Application of Brick and Stone. Heavy exterior materials, such
as any type of brick and stone, shall be applied so as to acknowledge its
historic use as a building foundation and structure material. Brick or stone
that appears to be unsupported or ‘float’ within a façade shall not be
permitted, e.g., stone applied to a roof dormer.
         (2)   Painting of Brick and Stone. Brick and stone exterior finishes
should not be painted, except as may be determined by the Zoning Administrator,
at their full discretion, as appropriate based on the building design and
architectural style.

the finished floor elevation of the façade on which it is located.
         (4)   Thin Brick and Stone Veneer. Thin brick and stone veneer shall
comply with the following:
            a.   Thin brick and stone veneer shall only be used in applications
where the actual brick or stone thickness will not be distinguishable or is
otherwise addressed by adjustments in the wall plane to provide the appearance
of full depth brick or real stone.
            b.   ‘L’ shaped brick corner pieces and full-depth brick caps shall
be utilized at all corners and edges to maintain the appearance of full-depth
brick.
            c.   Thin brick and stone veneer shall be continued (returned) a
minimum of 12-inches around wall corners to further maintain the appearance of
full-depth brick or real stone.
      C.   Use of Trim on Primary Façades. Except where architecturally
unsuitable, appropriately scaled trim shall be included around all window and
door openings, building corners, roof lines, and façade material transitions
located on primary façades.
      D.   Shutters. If used, shutters must be in scale with the adjoining
opening and be operational or have the appearance of being operational and
functional as a true shade or shutter. Each shutter shall be equal to the

   8.   Building Design Alternatives.
      A.   Intent and Purpose. The building design alternative provisions of
this section are intended to allow flexibility and grant relief from strict
compliance with the regulations outlined in Chapter 165.09 titled 'Building
Design Standards', as part of the site plan review process when specific site
features or characteristics of the subject property creates conditions that
make strict compliance to the applicable zoning regulations impractical or
undesirable. It is the intent of this section to recognize that alternative
design solutions may result in increased or maximized aesthetics and diversity
of building design, while remaining consistent with the general intent and
purpose of the City of Indianola Zoning Code and Comprehensive Plan. It is not
the intent of the design alternative provisions to be utilized to reduce or
provide relief from general building design requirements. The design
alternatives are not intended to provide relief to other applicable zoning
procedures outside of Chapter 165.09 or those code sections explicitly stated
hereinafter.
      B.   Applicability. With the exception of buildings within the C-
3 'Downtown Mixed-Use' Zoning District, Planned Unit Developments (PUD), or any
special overlay district or zone with specific building design requirements,
these building design alternatives may be considered for new development and
redevelopment of existing sites and buildings, and all site and building
modifications to building facades.
      C.   Procedure. Requests for design alternatives to the regulations
outlined in Chapter 165.09 titled 'Building Design Standards' shall require
review by the Zoning Administrator. Requested design alternatives must be noted
on the required application for site plan or alternate design documentation
review, as applicable. The application must include a written narrative stating
why the design alternative is necessary and all efforts that will be employed
to mitigate adverse impacts resulting from approval of the design alternative
request. The Zoning Administrator shall submit to all members of the Zoning
Commission a copy of the request, along with a written recommendation as to the
request's conformity with the rules and regulations of the city. The Commission
shall subsequently hold a meeting as prescribed by their rules of procedures
and review the request with conformity to the zoning regulations and standards
and may confer with the applicant on changes deemed advisable in such request.
The Commission shall forward its recommendation to the City Council for
approval, approval with conditions, or denial of the request. The following may
be considered as part of deliberation of the request:
         (1)   Consistency and compatibility with the Future Land Use Map, the
Comprehensive Plan, and other adopted and applicable long-term planning
policies.
         (2)   Surrounding land uses, building sizes, architectural style,
building types and function, and building placement, orientation, and setbacks.
         (3)   General relationship to and impact on the surrounding area and
neighboring properties.

      A.   Permanent Signs. The following regulations are established for all
permanent signs as may be permitted by this article.
         (1)   Building Sign Regulations.
            a.   Prior to installation of any building signage, all multi-
tenant buildings and multi-building commercial centers shall provide a signage
plan detailing how and where signage will be allocated to each individual
tenant space. This plan shall be adhered to unless an alternate plan is
provided to the City by the building owner. In the case of commercial
condominium or horizontal property regime, each owner shall be allocated an
amount of signage proportional to the size of their unit.
            b.   No wall sign shall cover wholly or partially any wall opening,
nor project beyond the ends of the wall to which it is attached.
            c.   All building signs, including projecting signs but not
including awning and window signs, shall consist of solid individual letters
and symbols that have a three-dimensional appearance with a minimum dimensional
depth of one (1) inch. The dimensional depth may be achieved by individual
dimension letters or symbols, cut out, push through, engraved, embossed, pin
mounted with stand-offs, or alternative acceptable to the Zoning Administrator.
Said individual letters and symbols shall be made of anodized aluminum or
similar corrosion-resistant materials or should consist of individual
illuminated self-contained letters and symbols made of anodized aluminum or
similar corrosion-resistant materials with translucent plastic faces.

greater than six (6) feet from the wall to which it is attached, measuring from
the point of the sign nearest thereto. Every projecting sign to be erected over
public or private driveways or thoroughfares shall be placed not less than
fifteen (15) feet above the level of same.
            f.   Obstructions and Traffic Hazards. Every projecting sign shall
be erected in a manner which does not constitute an obstruction or traffic
hazard regulated by this chapter.

unlawful for any projecting sign to be located over public property or road
right-of-way unless approval is granted by the City Council or agency that owns
or controls said public property or right-of-way.
         (3)   Ground Sign Regulations.
            a.   Ground signs shall be restricted to monument grounds signs.
Pole signs are prohibited.

(Ord. 1737 - Oct. 24 Supp.)
   16.   PERMIT ISSUANCE; EXPIRATION. It is the duty of the Zoning
Administrator, upon the filing of an application for an erection permit, to
examine such plans and specifications and other data and the premises upon
which it is proposed to erect the sign or other advertising structure, and if

City are complied with, the Zoning Administrator shall then issue the erection
permit. If the work authorized under an erection permit has not been completed
within six months after date of issuance, the said permit shall become null and
void.
   17.   REVOCABILITY OF PERMIT. All rights and privileges acquired under the
provisions of this chapter, or any amendment thereto, are mere permits
revocable by the Council, and all sign permits shall contain this provision. In
the event that by action of the Council any permit is revoked, it shall be

and it is the duty of the owner, agent, or person in possession of said
premises, and each of them, to remove such sign forthwith.
   18.   RIGHT OF ENTRY. Subject to constitutional limitations and upon

sign or other advertising structure regulated herein is unsafe or insecure, or
is a menace to the public, or has been constructed or erected or is being
maintained in violation of the provisions of this chapter, the Zoning
Administrator shall give written notice to the permittee thereof. If the
permittee fails to remove or alter the structure so as to comply with the
standards herein set forth within 10 days after such notice, such sign or other
advertising structure may be removed or altered to comply, by the Zoning
Administrator at the expense of the permittee or owner of the property upon
which it is located. The Zoning Administrator shall recommend to the City
Manager the revocation of the permit covering such sign or other structure
regulated herein, and thereupon said permit may be revoked by order of the
Council. The Zoning Administrator may cause any sign or other advertising
structure which is an immediate peril to persons or property to be removed
summarily and without notice. Existing signs shall comply with the provisions
of this section.
   21.   NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
      A.   Intent: It is the intent of this chapter to allow existing legal,
nonconforming signs to continue to be maintained and used until they are
removed under the terms of this chapter, while encouraging legal, nonconforming
signs to be brought into conformity. Every sign or other advertising structure
lawfully in existence on December 31, 2022, but which is prohibited by the
terms and conditions of this chapter, shall not be altered or moved except in
compliance with this chapter.
      B.   Modification: A legal nonconforming sign or sign structure shall be
brought into conformity with this chapter if it is altered, reconstructed,
replaced, expanded, or relocated. A change in sign copy, or the replacement of
a sign face, is not an alteration or replacement for purposes of this section,
but conditions may be placed on the approval to bring the sign closer to
compliance with the intent of the provisions of this chapter.
      C.   Maintenance: Legal nonconforming signs must be maintained in good
condition. Maintenance required by this subsection shall include replacing or
repairing of worn or damaged parts of a sign or sign structure in order to
return it to its original state, and it is not a change or modification for
purposes of subsection D1 of this section.
      D.   Removal: Removal of a nonconforming sign or replacement of a
nonconforming sign with a conforming sign is required when:
         (1)   Fifty percent (50%) or more of the entire sign structure of a
legal nonconforming sign is damaged, destroyed, or for any reason or by any
means taken down; or
         (2)   The condition of the legal nonconforming sign or legal
nonconforming sign structure has deteriorated without maintenance as required
by this section; or the legal nonconforming sign structure or building it is
mounted on is destroyed or damaged by a fire, flood, windstorm, or similar
abnormal event; and the cost of restoration of the sign to its condition
immediately prior to such deterioration or event exceeds fifty percent (50%) of
the cost of reconstruction of the sign structure; or
         (3)   The use of the legal nonconforming sign, or the property on
which it is located, has ceased, become vacant, or been unoccupied for a period
of thirty (30) consecutive days or more. An intent to abandon is not required
as the basis for removal under this subsection.
      E.   Sign Permit Application: For any new sign permit applications filed
under this chapter, the City may review all signs within the subject property
for compliance with this chapter. Should it be determined that there are legal
nonconforming signs on the premises, the City may require that any
nonconforming sign displayed on the premises that would affect the compliance
of the new sign with this chapter be altered or removed before a new permit may
be issued under the provisions of this chapter.
      F.   Site Plan Application: Any site that is the subject of a Major Site
Plan application shall be required as a condition of approval to bring all
nonconforming signs on the premises into conformity with the provisions of this
chapter.
   22.   REMOVAL OF IRRELEVANT SIGNS. Any sign now or hereafter existing which
no longer advertises a bona fide business conducted, or a product sold, shall
be taken down and removed by the owner, agent or person having the use of the
building or structure upon which such sign may be found, within 10 days after
written notification from the Zoning Administrator, and upon failure to comply
with such notice within the time specified in such order, the Zoning
Administrator is hereby authorized to cause removal of such sign, and any
expense incident thereto shall be paid by the owner of the building or
structure to which such sign is attached.
   23.   VARIANCES AND APPEALS.
      A.   Variances. The Board of Adjustment shall have jurisdiction for any
requests for variances involving sign location, sign height, or sign size not
consistent with this chapter. The Board shall rule on any request in accordance
with Chapter
165.02.
      B.   Appeals. Any person aggrieved by an order, requirement, decision or
determination of the Zoning Administrator in the enforcement of this chapter
may file an appeal with the Board of Adjustment in accordance with Chapter
165.02. The Board of Appeals shall have jurisdiction for any requests for an
appeal related to the application of the City’s adopted Building Code
regulations in accordance with Chapter
163.08.

170.05 PROCEDURES..
   1.   Preliminary Plat Application Required.
      A.   Pre-Application Meeting. Prior to the submission of any preliminary
plat application, the applicant shall request a pre-application meeting with
the Zoning Administrator to review the plat proposal and confirm the
appropriate process and application requirements. For preliminary plats within
two miles of the corporate limits of the City, a plat application should first
be submitted to the County and then to the City. The applicant may request a
joint pre-application meeting be held with the City and Warren County to
coordinate platting requirements, conditions, and timing of the review and
approval process.
      B.   Application and Review. Whenever the owner or their designee of any
tract or parcel of land within the jurisdiction of this chapter wishes to
subdivide or plat the same into two (2) or more lots, said owner shall cause to
be prepared a preliminary plat of said subdivision, and shall submit to the
Zoning Administrator a completed preliminary plat application form, required
number of copies of the preliminary plat, preliminary plat application fee, and
any other information and details as specified and required by the Zoning
Administrator as necessary to determine compliance with all applicable codes
and requirements. The preliminary plat shall contain such information and data
as is outlined in herein this chapter.
      The Zoning Administrator or their designee shall examine said preliminary
plat application as to its completeness. If determined incomplete, the
application shall be returned to the owner or their designee with a list of
missing information and items. If determined complete by the Zoning
Administrator or their designee, the application shall be distributed to
applicable City departments and utility companies for review and comment to its
completeness. The Zoning Ordinance Administrator or their designee shall
compile all City and utility comments and complete a review of the plat as to
its compliance with these Subdivision Regulations, the Zoning Ordinance, the
Comprehensive Plan and Future Transportation Network map, and other local,
state, and federal requirements and shall provide the findings to the
subdivider. If determined incomplete, the application shall be returned to the
owner or their designee with a list of missing information and items.
(Ord. 1777 – Jun. 25 Supp.)
      C.   Review by Planning Commission. Once the preliminary plat has been
deemed complete by the Zoning Administrator or their designee, the Zoning
Administrator or their designee shall provide a written report to the
Commission within thirty (30) days. After receiving the Zoning Administrator’s
report, the Commission shall review the preliminary plat and other material for
conformity to regulations. The Commission may confer with the subdivider on
changes deemed advisable and the kind and extent of such improvements to be
made.
      Before reviewing a preliminary plat, notice of the Commission’s meeting
shall be placed on a sign prepared and posted by the applicant. The sign shall
be of such design that is approved by the zoning administrator and be in a
location that is visible from all rights-of-way. The sign shall be posted at
least 10 days prior to the Commission meeting and shall remain in place until
the City Council has taken final action.
(Ord. 1778 – Jun. 25 Supp.)
      D.   Review by City Council. The Commission shall submit a report to the
City Council with recommendations for approval, approval with conditions, or
rejection of such preliminary plat within thirty (30) days after the date of
review of said plat to the Commission. Upon receiving recommendations from the
Commission, the Council shall consider the same and if the plat is found to
conform to the provisions of this chapter, the Council may then approve or deny
the preliminary plat.
      If the preliminary plat is rejected, the Council will advise the owner or
developer of any changes which are desired or should have consideration before
approval will be given. Upon making such changes, the developer may resubmit
the preliminary plat for approval by the Commission and the Council.
Approval of the preliminary plat by the Council shall constitute approval to
proceed with the preparation of the final plat but shall not be deemed approval
of the subdivision.
      E.   Preliminary Plat Expiration. The approval of the preliminary plat by
the Council shall be null and void unless the final plat is presented to the
Council within two (2) years after the date of said preliminary plat approval
by the Council, unless an extension is approved by resolution of the City
Council. In the case of a subdivision that is proposed to be platted and
developed in multiple phases, final plat applications for all phases must be
presented to the Council within four (4) years of the date of approval of the
final plat for the first phase. The preliminary plat for phases not submitted
within this time frame shall become null and void, unless an extension is
approved by resolution of the City Council.
      The preliminary plat application, if not presented to the Commission and
Council for review within one (1) year from the date of its initial submittal
due to a lack of response by the applicant, shall be deemed withdrawn by the
applicant and the application fees forfeited.
      F.   Modifications to an Approved Preliminary Plat. Any significant
modifications to an approved preliminary plat as determined by the Zoning
Administrator, including an increase in number of lots, shall require the
application and approval of a revised preliminary plat following the
preliminary plat application process as detailed herein above. Minor changes to
the preliminary plat may be administratively approved by the Zoning
Administrator at their sole discretion.
   2.   Final Plat Application Required.
      A.   Application and Review. Upon receipt of a final plat application
form, required number of copies of the final plat, final plat application fee,
and any other information and details as specified and required by the Zoning
Administrator as necessary to determine compliance with all applicable codes
and requirements. The Zoning Administrator or their designee shall examine said
final plat application as to its completeness. If determined incomplete, the
application shall be returned to the owner or their designee with a list of
missing information and items. If determined complete by the Zoning
Administrator or their designee, the application shall be distributed to
applicable City departments and utility companies for review and comment to its
completeness. The Zoning Administrator or their designee shall compile all City
and utility comments and complete a review of the plat as to its compliance
with these Subdivision Regulations, the Zoning Ordinance, the Comprehensive
Plan and Future Transportation Network map, and other local, state, and federal
requirements and shall provide the findings to the subdivider. If determined
incomplete, the application shall be returned to the owner or their designee
with a list of missing information and items.
      At the request of the owner or designee, the final plat shall be
forwarded to the Council for its review, regardless of the Zoning Administrator
determination that the final plat is complete.
      B.   Review by City Council. Once the final plat has been deemed complete
by the Zoning Administrator or their designee, or if the owner or their
designee has requested the final plat be forwarded to the Council, the Zoning
Administrator or their designee shall provide a written report to the Council
within thirty (30) days. Upon receiving a report and recommendations from the
Zoning Administrator or their designee for approval or rejection of the final
plat, the City Council shall review and consider the final plat. Approval of
the final plat and final acceptance of improvements shall be given by
resolution of the Council which shall be affixed to the plat. Procedure for
approval of the final plat shall be as outlined herein this chapter.

consistency with the Indianola comprehensive plan, zoning ordinance, and any
specific adopted district plans, and take into consideration the natural
features of the site and patterns of adjacent development.
   1.   Streets.
      A.   SUDAS. Street design must comply with the Statewide Urban Design and
Specifications Standards for Public Improvements ("SUDAS"), as adopted, and
amended by the city and all other applicable city and state regulations, except
as amended herein below.
      B.   Consistency to Community Visioning Plans. All proposed plats and
subdivisions shall conform to the City of Indianola Comprehensive Plan, the
Future Transportation Network map, and other adopted Community Visioning Plans.
      C.   Continuation of Existing or Planned Streets. Proposed streets shall
provide for continuation or completion of any existing streets (constructed or
recorded) or any streets which are a part of an approved preliminary
subdivision plat, in adjoining property, at equal or greater width, and in
similar alignment, unless variations are recommended by the Commission and
approved by the Council.
      D.   Paved Access Required. All subdivisions shall be connected to a
paved street. The City Council may require a subdivider pave or reconstruct all
or part of any unimproved or gravel streets adjoining the proposed subdivision.
      E.   Circulation. The street pattern shall provide ease of circulation
within the subdivision as well as convenient access to adjoining streets,
trailways, thoroughfares, or unsubdivided land as may be required by the
Council.
      F.   Temporary Dead-Ends. In a case where a street will eventually be
extended beyond the plat but is temporarily dead-ended for no more than a 24-
month time period, a temporary turnaround with a 45-ft radius and designed and
constructed to support 75,000 lbs. gross vehicle weight may be permitted. If
the length of the dead-end segment of street is less than 150-ft and contains
no driveways, this temporary turnaround requirement may be waived by the City
Council. Temporary dead-end lengths shall not exceed 500 feet.
      G.   Street Intersections. Street intersections shall intersect at ninety
degrees or as closely thereto as possible, and in no case shall streets
intersect at less than seventy-five degrees.

      I.   Street jogs of less than 300 feet shall be avoided.
      J.   Cul-de-sacs and other roadways with a single point of access should
be avoided. Cul-de-sacs will be considered where it can be clearly demonstrated
that environmental constraints, existing development, access limitations along
arterial streets, or other unusual features prevent the extension of the street
to the property line or to interconnect with other streets within or abutting
the subdivision or to create lots in conformance this chapter and the Zoning
Code regulations. In such situations cul-de-sacs should not exceed 700 feet in
length and additional public sidewalks or trail connections may be required to
ensure adequate pedestrian and bike circulation.
      K.   Street knuckles and eyebrows (a widening of the street at a corner
or bend that is not required by a design standard) shall be prohibited.
      L.   New subdivisions shall make provisions for continuation and
extension of thoroughfares and collector streets and roads.

Council may apply special standards for the design of such parkways or streets.
      Q.   Proposed streets that are extensions of or in alignment with
existing streets shall bear the name of the existing street. Names of new
streets shall avoid duplication of or similarity to existing names of streets,
or public and semi-public buildings and areas.

curving           drives       lanes
      S.   Minimum Standards for Street Rights Of Way are summarized in the
following table. The information in this table is intended to provide guidance
for the design of the street network within a subdivision. When designing a
subdivision, street types should be chosen based on the intended function of
the street and anticipated level of traffic. The city will review the proposed
streets and determine the appropriate street type based on the factors set
forth in this section.

facility approved by the Council. The sewers shall extend to the subdivision
boundaries as necessary to provide for the extension of the sewers by adjacent
property.
      I.   Water Service. The subdivider shall at the subdivider's expense
provide the subdivision with a complete water main supply system including
hydrants, valves and other appurtenances which shall be extended into and
through the subdivision to the boundary lines, and which shall provide a water
connection for each lot, and shall be connected to the City water system. Fire
hydrants shall be uniform throughout the subdivision and shall meet the
standards and design approved by the Fire Chief and Utilities Board of
Trustees. Water mains shall extend to the boundaries of the subdivision to
provide for extension by adjoining properties.
      J.   Stormwater. The subdivider shall, at the subdivider's expense,
provide the subdivision with a storm sewer system to adequately handle a five-
year rainstorm. The system shall include basins, culverts, ditches, intakes,
manholes, or any structure deemed necessary. All such structures shall meet the
City of Indianola Standard Specifications. In addition, the subdivider shall,
at the subdivider's expense, provide the subdivision with overland drainage
courses and easements to adequately handle stormwater in excess of a five-year
rainstorm and up to a 100-year rainstorm, in accordance with the provisions of
Iowa Code Section 364.3(18). For any subdivision containing new streets, the
system shall be designed by a licensed engineer registered to practice in the
State of Iowa.
         (1)   Each lot shall be provided with minimum six-inch diameter storm
sewer service line that is a minimum of four feet below ground level, stubbed
to the property line, unless the Zoning Administrator determines that sump
lines can be taken to an existing overland drainage area. The sump pump line
shall be a minimum of one and one-half inches in diameter.
         (2)   The storm sewer system line shall be made of reinforced concrete
pipe or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe. The sump pump lines shall be made of
PVC, PVC Truss, or PVC corrugated pipe. All structures shall be built in
accordance with City of Indianola Standard Construction Specifications for
Subdivisions.
         (3)   The storm sewer system shall be large enough to provide for
anticipated extension of use to serve additional areas, as set out in Indianola
Comprehensive Plan.
         (4)   Storm sewer service lines shall be connected to the City storm
sewer system at intakes, manholes, or directly into the City storm sewer pipe.
         (5)   Tapping storm sewer service lines into the City storm sewers
shall be by using approved methods. Should it not be possible to install a
storm sewer service, as described above, alternative plans may be submitted for
review by the City. No stormwater, surface water, ground water, roof runoff,
swimming pool, subsurface drainage, cooling water or unpolluted water shall be
discharged into the City sanitary sewer system. Any such discharge into the
City sanitary sewer system shall be deemed a public nuisance and a municipal
infraction.
      K.   Grades. All streets, alleys, and sidewalks within the platted area
which are dedicated for public use shall be brought to the grade per SUDAS and
approved by the Council after receiving the report and recommendations of the
Zoning Administrator or their designee. The minimum percent slope of all
stormwater drainageways and swales shall be two percent (2%).
      L.   Public Streetlights. The proposed development shall provide a
streetlight plan for review and approval by the electrical utility with
jurisdiction. The subdivider shall coordinate with and pay said utility for the
cost of the installation of public streetlights.
      M.   Traffic Control Signs and Street Name Signs. The proposed
development shall be responsible for the installation and cost of traffic
control signs and street name signs as required by the City.

install cluster mailboxes as required by the US Postal Service.
      O.   Underground Utilities. Improvements such as cable TV, telephone and
electric lines, streetlights, gas mains, and similar facilities in any
subdivision shall be installed underground outside the street pavement limits.
The subdivider shall be responsible for making the necessary arrangements with
the utility companies for installation of such facilities. Said utility lines
shall be installed in accordance with SUDAS and in such a manner so as not to
interfere with other underground utilities and in no case shall be buried less
than 18-inches below the surface. Underground utility lines which cross
underneath the right-of-way of any street, alley or way shall be installed
prior to the improvement of any such street, alley, or way in the subdivision.
Incidental appurtenances, such as transformers and their enclosures, pedestal
mounted terminal boxes, meters and meter cabinets may be placed above ground
but shall not be located within any street or driveway clear vision area as
defined within Chapter 135 of the City Code.
      P.   Homeowners Association. A Homeowners Association shall be created
for any development with privately owned streets, utilities, open space,
buffers, stormwater facilities, storm sewer, drainage tile, or other private
service which is utilized by more than one homeowner. The covenants of the
Homeowners Association shall properly identify how maintenance of the private
infrastructure is handled in the event the Homeowners Association dissolves.
Any changes in the responsibilities of the Homeowners Association shall require
approval of City Council.
      Q.   Timing of Installation. All underground utilities, water lines,
sanitary sewers, and storm drains installed in streets, shall be constructed
before the streets are surfaced. Connections to all underground utilities,
water lines, and sanitary sewers from approved parcels shall be laid to
sufficient lengths, as determined by the city engineer, to avoid the need for
disturbing the street improvements when service connections are made.
   7.   Planned Unit Developments. As part of a Planned Unit Development (PUD)
approval process, as outlined in Chapter 165.05, section 1, subsection K, the
City Council may, after receiving a recommendation from the Planning and Zoning
Commission, approve innovative concepts in the subdivision design, layout and
development that allow for cluster development techniques, for the purpose of
preservation of natural areas, provision of parks or open space, or urban
agricultural neighborhoods. It is not the intent of this provision to lessen
the number, size, extent, or type of infrastructure improvements required by
this chapter, but to permit the reasonable and necessary modification of the
design requirements in order to allow development of subdivisions which do not
utilize a conventional layout for blocks, lots, streets and other features. It
is the intent of this provision that any such modification or change in
requirements be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter and the
adopted Comprehensive Plan.
170.11 MARKERS.
The subdivider shall at the subdivider's expense place an iron rod not less
than one-half inch in diameter and 24 inches in length as follows:
   1.   Set in concrete three feet deep at the intersection of all lines
forming angles in the boundary of the subdivision, and at all street
intersections.
   2.   At lot corners and changes in direction of block and lot boundaries.
170.12 EROSION CONTROL.
The subdivider shall be responsible for controlling soil erosion and surface
water runoff within the subdivision during its construction and development and
shall provide erosion and runoff control measures as work progresses on site
grading, the installation of sewers or other improvements or phases of work.
Insofar as practical, erosion control measures shall be undertaken prior to any
other development within the subdivision which will contribute to runoff or
erosion.
170.13 SPECIFICATIONS.
The type of construction, the materials, the methods, the standards of
subdivision improvements and the maintenance bonds shall be in accordance with
the specifications found in a bound volume which is entitled Iowa Statewide
Urban Design and Specification for Public Improvements which is on file in the
Clerk's office. The Council may from time to time amend by resolution the
standard construction specifications for subdivisions found in the volume. The
Clerk shall keep a record of all amendments made to the specifications. Plans
and specifications for subdivisions shall be submitted to the Community
Development Department for approval prior to construction, accompanied by a fee
as set by resolution of the City Council, and construction shall not be started
until the plans and specifications have been approved.
170.14 APPROVAL OF PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
The approval of plans and specifications relative to improvements required by
this chapter shall be effective for a period of two years after the approval.
This time period may be extended by the City Engineer, at their sole
discretion. If the required improvements are not in place and accepted by the
City within the times specified, the approval shall lapse, and construction
shall not be started and construction under way shall cease until resubmitted
plans and specifications have been approved. The City shall have the right, at
the time of the new request for approval, to require the subdivider to use the
type of construction, the materials, the methods and standard of subdivision
improvements equal to the specifications of the City for like work which are in
effect at that time. The City may also require that the subdivider comply with
any amended ordinance or ordinances relative to improvements under this chapter
or any successor chapter relative to subdivision improvements which have been
adopted between the time of initial approval and the renewed approval as herein
required. The reapproval as required by this section specifically applies only
to the plans and specifications relative to subdivision improvements and has no
application as to lot sizes, setbacks, lot boundaries, street location or other
platting requirements which shall be final on Council approval unless changed
by some other method permitted by law.
170.15 PRECONSTRUCTION MEETING.
Prior to the beginning of construction of any improvements, the applicant shall
request a pre- construction meeting with the Zoning Administrator to review the
approved plans, requirements, conditions, and timing for improvement
construction. For developments within two miles of the corporate limits of the
City, a joint pre-application meeting shall be held with the City and Warren
County to coordinate approved plans, requirements, conditions, and timing of
the improvement construction.
170.16 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND CONTROL VERIFICATION.
All public improvements which at any time shall be deeded to the City,
including all streets, alleys, sanitary or storm sewers or water works, shall
be subject to quality assurance and control (QAQC) verification prior to
acceptance. Such QAQC verification shall be performed by an engineering firm,
furnished by the City, to ensure that such improvements are in compliance with
the approved subdivision plans and specifications; Statewide Urban Design and
Specifications (SUDAS) as adopted and amended by the city; and all other
applicable city and state regulations. All costs for said QAQC verification
shall be paid by the developer, prior to approval of the final plat, including,
but not limited to, City contractors and subconsultants, the cost of employee
salaries and benefits, administrative costs and laboratory testing fees or
charges. The engineer, employed by the engineering firm and furnished by the
City, shall certify to the City that the improvement was constructed in
accordance with the plans as approved by the City. Said engineer shall furnish
all inspection reports and record drawings for the improvements for use in
locating sanitary or storm sewers and water lines in the future. Inspection
reports and record drawings include, but are not limited to:
   1.   Laboratory and field tests taken in accordance with SUDAS as adopted
and amended by the city, and in addition thereto whenever deemed necessary by
the engineer to determine compliance with city specifications and with
professional standards.
   2.   Record Drawings requirements per Section 170.09(3) of this Chapter. An
improvement shall not be accepted or approved for public use if improvement has
not been properly verified using QAQC processes; or is otherwise determined by
the engineer to potentially not be fully compliant with the approved
subdivisions improvement plans and specifications, SUDAS as amended and adopted
by the city, this Code, or other required standards and specifications. It
shall be the developer's duty to document and demonstrate, by whatever means
may be necessary that the improvement in question does in fact fully comply
with this Code and all other applicable codes and regulations.
Should improvements be found deficient or defective, Owner of development,
prior to acceptance, will correct all said deficiencies or defects in order to
be in compliance with approved subdivision plans and specifications; Statewide
Urban Design and Specifications (SUDAS) as adopted and amended by the city; and
all other applicable city and state regulations. The Owner of the Development
will be notified in writing by City staff of the specific deficiencies or
defects. Withing 30 calendar days of the City's notice, the Owner of the
Development must submit a written plan and schedule outlining steps to correct
said deficiencies or defects.
170.17 ACCEPTANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   1.   Construction of Improvements or Posting of Bond. Before the Council
approves the final plat, all of the foregoing improvements shall be constructed
and accepted by formal resolution of the Council. Before passage of said
resolution of acceptance, the City Engineer or their designee shall report that
said improvements meet all City specifications and ordinances or other
requirements. The requirement for the construction of all improvements may be
waived if the subdivider will post a performance bond or certified check
guaranteeing that said improvements will be constructed within a period of one
(1) year from final acceptance of the plat. However, if a performance bond is
posted, final acceptance of the plat will not constitute final acceptance by
the City of any improvements to be constructed. Improvements will be accepted
only after their construction has been completed all in accordance with the
rules above outlined. No maintenance work will be done by the City and no
public funds will be expended in the subdivision until such improvements have
been completed and accepted by the City.
   Performance bond or certified check shall be for an amount equal to one and
one-half times the cost estimated to complete the improvements as certified by
the subdivider's engineer or as otherwise may be estimated by the City
Engineer.
   2.   Maintenance Bonds. The developer shall warrant the design, material,
workmanship, installation and construction of all of the public improvements
for a minimum of four years from and after satisfactory completion and City
Council acceptance of roadway payment, sanitary sewers, storm sewers and other
improvements that are related to drainage, and park infrastructure, and shall
cause the warranty to be ensured by independent bond or by other collateral
that is found to be acceptable by City Legal Counsel (herein "bond"). The bond
shall specifically ensure the expedient repair or replacement of any and all
improvements that the City finds to be defective following completion and
acceptance and shall indemnify and hold the city harmless from any and all
costs or losses resulting from, attributed to, or otherwise arising from the
defective improvements.
170.18 ELECTRIC SERVICE.
When inside Indianola Municipal Utilities Electrical territory, Indianola
Municipal Utilities shall extend electric service to the subdivision and shall
make electric service available to each lot in the subdivision that is within
Indianola Municipal Utilities' assigned area of service pursuant to Code of
Iowa Chapter 476. The City, by and through Indianola Municipal Utilities, shall
install street lighting that is within Indianola Municipal Utilities' assigned
area of service pursuant to Code of Iowa Chapter 476 to current Indianola
Municipal Utilities' standards and specifications. In residential subdivisions,
all electric lines, including individual house service lines installed by the
owner or developer, shall be placed underground.
170.19 CHARGE FOR INSTALLATION OF ELECTRICAL SERVICE.
Indianola Municipal Utilities reserves the right to make a reasonable charge to
be paid by the developer, builder or owner for any service extended as provided
by Section 170.33 above. Said charges may be changed from time to time but
shall be in accordance with a schedule of charges set by the Indianola
Municipal Utilities Board of Trustees.
170.20 IMPROVEMENTS WITHIN THE TWO-MILE CONTROL AREA.
   1.   Improvements in the two-mile control area shall be the same as required
above, provided they are not less than that required by the County subdivision
policy, and provided further that all road and drainage construction plans
shall be approved by the County Engineer, and completed roads shall be accepted
by the Board of Supervisors for Public Maintenance. This subsection does not
apply to plats of survey.
   2.   Where the subdivision contains sewers, sewage treatment plants, water
supply systems, park areas, street trees or other physical facilities necessary
or desirable for the welfare of the area and which are of common use or benefit
and are not or cannot be satisfactorily maintained by an existing public
agency, provision shall be made by trust agreements, made a part of the deed
restrictions acceptable to any agency having jurisdiction over the location and
improvement of such facilities, for the proper and continuous maintenance and
supervision of such facilities. This subsection does not apply to plats of
survey.
   3.   In situations where the County does not agree to accept the dedication
of right-of-way by fee title for a proposed public street or future public
street corridor, the City shall request a public street easement be executed
for the benefit of both the County and the City. The City shall further request
the executing of easements for future public utility corridors as may be
necessary to ensure the provision of services in area likely to be annexed into
the City at some point in the future.
170.21 FEES.
Each plat of survey, preliminary plat and final plat submitted for approval
shall be accompanied by a fee as set by Resolution of the City Council.
170.22 WAIVERS BY COUNCIL.
Where the strict application of standards or requirements established by this
chapter would cause substantial hardship or impose unreasonable restrictions on
the development of a tract of land because of natural or physical conditions or
limitations not created by the owner or developer, the Commission may recommend
and the Council may grant such waivers from these standards or requirements as
may be necessary to permit the reasonable development of the land while

Per Resident
171.05 Parkland Dedication Minimum    
Design Standards
 
171.01 TITLE.
This chapter shall be known and cited as the "Parkland Dedication Ordinance of
the City of Indianola, Iowa."
171.02 PURPOSE.
The purpose of this Parkland Dedication ordinance is to ensure that new
developments support the health, safety, and welfare of future residents by
providing land for public parks within the City and within areas being newly
developed or redeveloped for residential purposes.
171.03 APPLICATION.
When a preliminary plat for new single-family development (detached or semi-
detached), two-family, and/or townhouse development is proposed or a site plan
or building permit is submitted for a new multi-family residential development,
including manufacture housing community, parkland dedication in a manner
consistent with this ordnance shall be required.
Any developer who, after the effective date of the ordinance seeks to develop
land for residential purposes within the City shall be required to dedicate
public parkland as prescribed herein. No new plats or site plans for
residential development shall be approved unless and until the provisions of
this chapter are complied with.
171.04 STANDARD FOR PUBLIC PARKLAND PER RESIDENT.
The standard for the amount of neighborhood parkland required is 16-acres per
1,000 residents or 0.016 acres per resident. Based on the estimated persons per
household number, as determined by the last decennial census, the following
calculations shall be applied for new residential developments.
   Number of lots or dwelling units) x (Census estimated persons per household)
x (0.016 acres/resident) = required parkland dedication (Decimals rounded up
the nearest hundredth)
   Examples (assuming 2.4 estimated persons per household):
      A 100-lot single family subdivision would be required to dedicate 3.84
acres of parkland.
      (100 lots) x (2.4 residents) x (0.016 acres/resident) = 3.84 acres
      A 120-unit apartment complex would be required to dedicate 4.61 acres of
parkland
      (120-units) x (2.4 residents) x (0.016 acres/resident) = 4.61 acres
171.05 PARKLAND DEDICATION MINIMUM DESIGN STANDARDS.
   1.   Land dedicated for parkland shall be located within ½ mile of the
proposed development. The specific location of the land to be dedicated shall
be acceptable to the City and shall be located and planned with future parkland
dedications to create a neighborhood park site that will be no less than 1 acre
in size.
      A.   Public Recreational Trail corridors deeded to the City or dedicated
by easements may be included in this calculation of land dedication.
   2.   All land to be dedicated to meet this parkland dedication requirement
shall be useable park space and shall not be located within any floodway,
delineated wetlands, shall not contain any areas for storm water detention, and
shall have cross slopes no greater than 5%. An exception may be granted by the
City Council to accept parkland that includes wetlands, ponds, and/or storm
water retention areas that provide a recreational benefit.
   3.   The dedicator of parkland shall be responsible for rough grading,
stabilization, and seeding of the parkland and providing paved public street
access, sanitary sewer services, and water service to the property.
   4.   The developer shall designate on the plat map or site plan the proposed
number of dwelling units by type. Designation shall be for park dedication
calculation purposes only.
   5.   The developer shall be required to prepare the parkland prior to
dedication in a manner acceptable to the City. This includes:
      A.   The site shall be located adjacent to an improved street with
sidewalks and utilities, as required by the City. The site shall have access to
such a fully improve street across at least ten (10) percent of the distance of
its perimeter. Any access route shall be at least thirty (30) feet wide for
trails and fifty (50) feet for roadway access.
      B.   On-site drainage patterns shall be designed and constructed by the
developer with the approval of the City.
      C.   Grading shall comply with approved plans.
      D.   Top-soil shall be spread evenly and lightly compacted to an adequate
depth for turf growth.
      E.   Seeding shall occur during the fall or spring, in accordance with
standard specifications of the City. A maintainable stand of grass shall be
established prior to acceptancy by the city.
171.06 ALTERNATIVES TO DEDICATION OF PARKLAND.
   1.   When all or a portion of the required parkland cannot be dedicated, the
developer shall construct or otherwise complete park improvements and/or trail
improvements within ½ mile of the proposed development. The value of the
improvements shall be equal to the value of the required parkland dedication.
The value of these improvements shall be based on the fair market value of the
land to be dedicated. Subject to approval by the City, park improvements may
include construction and installation of trails, parking lots, playground
equipment, park shelters, tennis courts, basketball courts, ball fields and
appurtenances, and landscaping and the dedication of land or easements
necessary for planned trails. The developer shall provide written proof of the
land's value and written estimates of the costs of the park improvements.
   2.   The City may further allow a portion of the parkland dedication
requirement be satisfied by the dedication of greenways and stream buffers as
may be desired by the City. Because this land has a reduced value as
neighborhood park space, the following dedication conversation rate should be
applied: 1-acre of greenway or stream buffer dedicated to the City shall be
equivalent and worth 0.10-acre of required parkland.
   3.   In lieu of dedicating parkland, the developer may request the ability
to make a cash payment into a fund to be used for future park improvements or
park land acquisition for a park facility that is within ½ mile of the proposed
development. The City Council shall evaluate this request giving due
consideration to all of the factors listed in Section 171.05. The donation
shall be no less than the minimum number of acres required. A mutually
appointed Appraiser will determine parkland Fair Market Value. The Developer
shall pay any expenses accrued in the determination of the payment amount.
Payment in lieu shall be completed prior to development recording or issuance
of building permits.
171.07 PARKLAND DEDICATION CREDIT.
Should a new development desire to dedicate more parkland than is required, the
dedicator may sell or transfer the parkland credit to another developer or
apply as credit for a current or future parkland dedication requirement.
Written notice and copies of a transfer agreement shall be provided to the City
as record of all credits transferred or sold to another party.
171.08 PARKLAND DEDICATION AGREEMENT AND SURETY.
At the time of development, the developer shall enter into a written agreement
with the City to detail the parkland dedication and/or park improvement.
Depending on the timing of the dedication or park improvement, the developer
may propose, and/or the City may require the developer to provide adequate
surety to the City to ensure completion of the dedication or improvement. The
form and amount of surety shall be determined by the City at its full
discretion.
171.09 EXEMPTIONS.
The following shall be exempted from the requirements this chapter:
   1.   The construction of any non-residential building or structure.
   2.   Alterations or expansion of an existing building where no additional
residential units are created.
   3.   The construction of an accessory dwelling unit.
   4.   The replacement of a destroyed or partially destroyed building or
structure with a new building or structure where there are no additional
residential units created.
   5.   The installation of a replacement mobile home.
   6.   The division of a parcel into no more than two (2) lots.
   7.   The replat of an existing subdivision where no additional residential
lots are created.
   8.   Any claim of exemption shall be made no later than the time of
application for a preliminary plat approval. Any claim not so made shall be
deemed waived.

172.01 TITLE.
This chapter shall be known and cited as the "Stream Buffer Protection
Ordinance of the City of Indianola, Iowa."
172.02 PURPOSE.
In order to help reduce the impact from flooding and erosion, the City has
adopted these regulations to ensure new homes and structures are not built near
streams and waterways. In addition to periodic flooding, streams and waterways
can experience streambank erosion and stream channels can move impacting
structures and site improvements. Providing a minimum setback or buffer from
streams and waterways can lessen these risks while also preserving open space
and natural greenways. Stream buffers may be privately owned or dedicated to
the City as a public greenway.
172.03 DEFINITIONS.
   1.   Best Management Practices (BMP's) means a schedule of activities,
maintenance procedures, and other management practices to prevent or reduce the
pollution of waters of the United States. Common BMPs are described in the Iowa
Stormwater Management Manual and SUDAS. The BMPs covered are not meant to be a
comprehensive list of acceptable BMPs.
   2.   Buffer is a vegetative area, including trees, shrubs, and herbaceous
vegetation, that exists or is established to protect a stream system, lake, or
reservoir area. Alteration of this natural area is strictly limited.
   3.   Floodway are mapped streams within the boundaries of the City of
Indianola that are identified as 'floodway' on the City's Flood Insurance Rate
Map.
   4.   Streams are perennial and intermittent watercourses identified through
site inspection and United States Geological Survey (USGS) maps and further
defined and categorized as follows:
      A.   Type I Streams are defined as perennial streams shown as solid blue
lines on the United States Geological Survey seven and one-half minutes series
topological map and have a drainage area of greater than 50 acres.
      B.   Type II Streams are defined as intermittent streams shown as dashed
blue lines on the United States Geological Survey seven and one-half minutes
series topological map and have a drainage area of greater than 50 acres.
   5.   Stream Bank is the area between the stream channel and the break in the
stream bank slope or the highest point of the stream channel.
   6.   Stream Channel is part of the watercourse either naturally or
artificially created that contains an intermittent or perennial base flow of
groundwater origin. Base flows of groundwater origin can be distinguished by
any of the following physical indicators:
      A.   Hydrophytic vegetation, hydric soil, or other hydrologic indicators
in the area(s) where groundwater enters the stream channel in the vicinity of
the stream headwaters, channel bed, or channel banks.
      B.   Flowing water not directly related to a storm event.
      C.   Historical records of a local high groundwater table, such as well
and stream gauge records.
   7.   SUDAS means the current Standard Urban Design and Specifications
Manual, as locally amended, that specifies the stormwater guidelines and
stormwater controls deemed by SUDAS to meet the goals of the U.S. Environmental

   8.   Wetland is defined as areas that are inundated or saturated by surface
or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that
normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted
for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps,
marshes, bogs, and similar areas.
172.04 APPLICATION.
This chapter shall apply to proposed improvements associated with all land
development activity requiring a site plan, construction drawings, or
subdivision on property containing a stream, near a stream, or drainage swale
draining greater than 50 acres. These requirements are in addition to, and do
not replace or supersede, any other applicable buffer requirements established
by other regulatory avenues.
172.05 BUFFER STANDARDS AND DESIGN.
   1.   A stream buffer for a stream system shall consist of a native
vegetative strip of land extending along both sides of a stream and its
adjacent wetlands, floodplain, or slopes. The stream buffer width shall be
adjusted to include contiguous sensitive areas, such as steep slopes or
erodible soils, where development or disturbance may adversely affect water
quality, streams, wetlands, or other water bodies.
   2.   The required base width for all buffers shall be determined based on
the type of stream being protected, as specified herein below:
      A.   Streams with floodways as identified by FEMA Flood Insurance Rate
Maps (FIRM) should have a buffer that is 50-ft wide on each side of the
floodway boundary.
      B.   USGS identified Type I Streams with no identified floodway should
have a buffer that is 50-ft wide on each side of the stream's total width.
      C.   USGS identified Type II Streams with no identified floodway should
have a buffer that is 30-ft wide on each side of the centerline of the stream's
channel.
   3.   A comprehensive map of all existing stream buffer areas within the
jurisdiction of the City of Indianola has been established and is on file with
the City Clerk.
   4.   The Zoning Administrator or their designee may consider buffer design
modifications in unique cases of topography or other hardship provided that the
project can meet the goals outline in the purpose and intent of this chapter.
   5.   A stream buffer shall not be required for the portions of a stream that
are enclosed within a pipe or box structure.
   6.   Impervious surfaces, septic systems and all associated equipment are
prohibited within the buffer.
   7.   Dominant vegetation shall consist of existing or seeded/planted native
trees, shrubs, perennial grasses and forbs suited to the soil and hydrology of
the site and the intended purpose. No single species shall make up more than
50% of the total number of species planted. Turf grass (lawn) is not permitted.
   8.   Overland flow through the stream buffer area will be maintained as
sheet flow.
172.06 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   1.   Buffer Dedication. At the full discretion of the City, any stream
buffer may be required to be deeded to the City as part of the final plat or
site plan approval process, and/or park land dedication requirement. In special
circumstances, the City may accept a permanent easement for the purpose of
protecting the land in and around the established stream buffer and impose any
and all restrictions as determined in this chapter.
   2.   Limitations of Public Access, Responsibility, and Maintenance. The
dedication of a stream buffer area in any form to the City of Indianola shall
not be interpreted to mean that this automatically conveys to the general
public the right of access to this area. Furthermore, the City of Indianola
shall only be responsible for the management and maintenance of City-owned
stream buffers.
   3.   The following structures, practices, and activities are permitted in
the stream buffer, with specific design or maintenance features, subject to the
review of the City:
      A.   Roads, bridges, paths, and utilities:
         (1)   The right-of-way should be the minimum width needed to allow for
maintenance access and installation.
         (2)   The angle of the crossing shall be as close to perpendicular as
feasible to the stream or buffer in order to minimize clearing requirements.
      B.   Stream restoration projects, facilities and activities approved by
the City are permitted within the buffer.
      C.   Water quality monitoring and stream gauging are permitted within the
stream buffer, as approved by the City.
   4.   The following practices and activities are prohibited within the
buffer, except with approval by the City:
      A.   Clearing of existing vegetation.
      B.   Grading, stripping, or other soil disturbing practices.
      C.   Filling or dumping.
      D.   Draining the buffer area by ditching, underdrains, or other systems.
      E.   Use, storage, or application of pesticides, except for the spot
spraying of noxious weeds or nonnative species consistent with recommendations
of the Warren County Soil and Water Conservation District.
172.07 BUFFER MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE.
   1.   Management Plan Required. As part of establishing any stream buffer, a
basic management plan shall be developed along with details on ownership
(private individual, homeowner's association, or City) and easements or
agreements to ensure that it is properly managed and maintained. This may
include a plan to armor eroding banks, construction of let-down structures to
maintain a stable stream slope and bank, restoring or preserving natural
vegetation, and constructing or planning the construction of trails.
   2.   A buffer management plan shall be submitted in conjunction with the
required grading plan for any development, and the buffer should be clearly
delineated on the final grading plan.
   3.   Boundary markers will be installed by the applicant prior to commencing
clearing and grading operations. Markers will be placed at the outside edge of
the buffer prior to the start of any activity adjacent to the buffer. Markers
shall be clearly visible and shall be spaced at a maximum of 100 feet. The
markers may be joined by marking tape or fencing.
   4.   The plan shall contain an informative, conceptual, and schematic
representation of the proposed development activity by means of maps, graphs,
charts, or other written or drawn documents so as to enable an informed
decision regarding the proposed development activity.
   5.   The plan shall be developed by an Iowa licensed Professional Engineer
or Iowa licensed Landscape Architect.
   6.   The plan shall outline the maintenance procedures established by the
owner, to ensure the proper management of the stream buffer.
   7.   If a maintenance procedure consists of a controlled burn, an approved
burn plan for the native areas shall also be included in the management plan.
   8.   The plan shall contain the following specific information:
      A.   A location or vicinity map to include maximum two feet contour
intervals and scale of no greater than one-inch equals 100 feet.
      B.   Field delineated streams, springs, seeps, bodies of water, wetlands,
and waterway buffer.
      C.   Stream buffer ownership information and information on the entity
responsible for buffer maintenance.
      D.   The location and general measurements of established stream buffer
and maintenance easements.
      E.   A list of prohibited activities, uses, or items within the buffer.
      F.   Language addressing the existing and planned vegetation maintenance
within the buffer.
      G.   A general maintenance timeline of the stream buffer.
      H.   Information explaining the location and right of access for stream
buffer maintenance including maintenance access points and routes.
      I.   Information on easement or access rights in and around stream
buffer.

clearly:
      A.   Show the extent of any stream buffer on the subject property.
      B.   Label the stream buffer.
      C.   Provide a note to reference any stream buffer stating: "There shall
be no clearing, grading, construction or disturbance of vegetation except as
permitted by the City of Indianola."
172.08 ENFORCEMENT.
   1.   The Zoning Administrator or their designee is authorized and empowered
to enforce the requirements of this chapter in accordance with the procedures
of this section.

chapter, they shall with reasonable promptness issue a notice of the violations
identified while conducting an inspection or investigation. Each notice shall
be in writing and shall describe the nature of the violation, including a
reference to the provision within this chapter that has been violated. In
addition, the notice shall set a reasonable time for the abatement and
correction of the violation.
   3.   If the property owner fails to take corrective action, following notice
prescribed for the service of civil process by the Iowa Rules of Civil
Procedure, the City may do so by its own crews or by persons under its hire and
assess against the property owner the City's cost therefore. The cost shall
include the salaries and benefits earned by the City employees during such
corrective action, a charge for City machinery used and such other costs and
expenses as the City actually incurred. To the extent allowed by Iowa law, such
costs and expenses may be assessed against the property owner and collected in
the same manner as a property tax.
   4.   Each day that a municipal infraction occurs and/or is permitted to
exist constitutes a separate offense.
