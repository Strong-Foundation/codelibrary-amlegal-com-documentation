unlawful, an offense, or a misdemeanor by the city code or any ordinance or
code herein adopted by reference, or the omission or failure to perform any act
or duty required by this city code or any ordinance or code or any ordinance or
code herein adopted by reference is, unless another penalty is specified,
punishable in accordance with Iowa Code § 903.1(1)(a). No violation of the city
code shall subject an individual to incarceration.
(Prior Code, § 1-3-1)
   (B)   Civil penalty; municipal infraction.
      (1)   Definitions. For the purpose of this division (B), the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates, or requires, a
different meaning.
         MUNICIPAL INFRACTION. Except those provisions specifically provided
under state law as a felony, an aggravated misdemeanor, or a serious
misdemeanor or a simple misdemeanor under Chapters 690 through 747 of the Iowa
Code, the doing of any act prohibited or declared to be unlawful, an offense or
a misdemeanor by the code of ordinances of the city, or any ordinance or code
herein adopted by reference, or omission or failure to perform any act or duty
required by the code of ordinances of the city, or any ordinance or code herein
adopted by reference, is a MUNICIPAL INFRACTION and is punishable by civil
penalty as provided herein.
         OFFICER. Any employee or official authorized to enforce the code of
ordinances of the city.
         REPEAT OFFENSE. A recurring violation of the same section of the code
of ordinances.
      (2)   Violations, penalties, and alternative relief. 
         (a)   A municipal infraction is punishable by a civil penalty as
provided in the following schedule, unless a specific schedule of civil
penalties is provided for specific offenses elsewhere in this code.
 
Schedule of Civil Penalties
First offense  Not more than $750
Repeat offense Not more than $1,000
 
         (b)   Each day that a violation occurs or is permitted to exist by the
violator constitutes a separate offense.
         (c)   Seeking a civil penalty as authorized in this chapter does not
preclude the city from seeking alternative relief from the court in the same
action.
      (3)   Civil citations.
         (a)   Any officer authorized by the city to enforce the code of
ordinances may issue a civil citation to a person who commits a municipal
infraction.
         (b)   The citation may be served by personal service, substituted
service, or by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by publication as
provided in the State Rules of Civil Procedure.
         (c)   The original of the citation shall be sent to the Clerk of the
district court. If the infraction involves real property, a copy of the
citation shall be filed with the County Treasurer.
         (d)   The citation shall serve as notification that a civil offense
has been committed and shall contain the following information:
            1.   The name and address of the defendant.
            2.   The name or description of the infraction attested to by the
officer issuing the citation.
            3.   The location and time of the infraction.
            4.   The amount of civil penalty to be assessed or the alternative
relief sought, or both.

paid.

            7.   The penalty for failure to appear in court.
            8.   The legal description of the affected property, if applicable.
      (4)   Seeking alternative relief. Seeking a civil penalty as authorized
in Iowa Code § 364.22, does not preclude the city from seeking alternative
relief from the court in the same action. Such relief may include the
imposition of a civil penalty by entry of a personal judgment against the
defendant, directing that the payment of the civil penalty be suspended or
deferred under conditions imposed by the court, ordering the defendant to abate
or cease the violation or authorizing the city to abate or correct the
violation, or ordering that the city’s cost for abatement or correction of the
violation be entered as a personal judgment against the defendant or assessed
against the property where the violation occurred, or both. If a defendant
willfully violates the terms of an order imposed by the court, the failure is
contempt.
      (5)   Peace officer. This section does not preclude a peace officer from
issuing a criminal citation for violation of a city code or regulation if
criminal penalties are also provided for the violation, nor does it preclude or
limit the authority of the city to enforce the provisions of the code of
ordinances by criminal sanctions or other lawful means. Each day that a
violation occurs or is permitted to exist by the defendant constitutes a
separate offense. The violation of any provision of this code of ordinances or
any regulation promulgated thereunder shall also constitute a simple
misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than $65 but not to exceed $625.
No violation of the city code shall subject an individual to incarceration. A
simple misdemeanor criminal charge filed pursuant to this code of ordinances
shall only subject an individual to a monetary fine.
(Prior Code, § 1-3-2)
   (C)   Scheduled fines. The scheduled fine for a violation of any provision
of the city code shall be in accordance with Iowa Code Chapter 805, unless
another scheduled amount is provided in the city code or state code.

economic obsolescence and the reconstruction is necessary to implement
recognized industry standards for the manufacturing and processing of specific
products, and the reconstruction is required for the owner of the building or

against it by reason of the breaking of any mains or service pipes, or by
reason of any other interruption of the service caused by the breaking of
machinery or stoppage for necessary repairs; and no person shall be entitled to
damages nor have any portion of a payment refunded for any interruption.
   (M)   The premises receiving sanitary sewer service shall, at all reasonable
hours, be subject to inspection by duly authorized personnel of the city.
   (N)   (1)   The owner of the property served by a building sewer shall be
responsible for the operation, maintenance, repair, blockage, surface
replacement, and any damage resulting from operation, maintenance, repair, and
blockage of said building sewer from the point of connection with the building
drain to the public sewer. If the operation, maintenance, repair, and/or
blockage requires street removal, the city will be responsible for the removal
and replacement of asphalt, concrete, oil, and base rock.
      (2)   The property owner shall be responsible for removal and disposal of
all excavation materials, and shall be responsible for placement and proper
compaction of imported crushed stone backfill. The city must approve and

or
         (d)   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provision
of division (J) below.

waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be
subject to the review and approval of the Superintendent, and subject to the
requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws.
   (F)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of
liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes,
sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall
be of a type and capacity approved by the Superintendent, and shall be located
as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
   (G)   Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided
for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory
and effective operation by the owner at the owner’s expense.
   (H)   (1)   When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property
serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a
suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and
measurement of the wastes.
      (2)   Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely
located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner’s
expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible
at all times and agree to the terms of DNR approved pre-treatment agreement and
related testing.

waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health
Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon
suitable samples taken at said control manhole.
      (2)   In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control
manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public
sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be
carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of
constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to
life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine
whether a 24 hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate, or
whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD
and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24 hour composite of all
outfalls where pH’s are determined from periodic grab samples.)
   (J)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the
industrial concern.

CHAPTER 73: SNOW REMOVAL
Section
   
73.01   Purpose
   
73.02   Snow emergency declaration
   
73.03   Snow removal routes
   
73.04   Driveways and snow from private properties
   
73.05   Removal of snow and ice accumulating on sidewalks
   
73.06   Vehicle parking during snow emergency
   
73.07   Pushing snow into streets
 
   
73.99   Penalty
§ 73.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to establish and maintain uniform
definitions and procedures concerning snow and ice removal for the city. The
city will provide snow and ice removal in a safe and cost-effective manner,
taking into account safety, budget, personnel, and environmental concerns.
   (B)   This chapter does not guarantee that the streets, public parking lots,
city maintained sidewalk, and other public areas will be free of snow and ice;
but rather attempts to maintain an adequate traveling surface for properly
equipped vehicles and pedestrians during winter conditions.
   (C)   Snow and ice removal from public streets, public parking areas, city
maintained sidewalks, and other public areas is an emergency operation that
takes precedence over other non-emergency work for the Public Works Department.
(Prior Code, § 3-12-1)
§ 73.02 SNOW EMERGENCY DECLARATION.
   A SNOW EMERGENCY is defined as any amount of snow. Snow combined with ice,
rain, and/or wind may also constitute a snow emergency. The Mayor, and/or his
or her designee, may declare a snow emergency. A snow emergency may be declared
in advance of an anticipated storm, during a storm, or after a storm. A snow
emergency will normally not last more than 24 hours past the end of the last
snowfall, but may be extended or shortened when conditions warrant. The public
will be informed of a snow emergency through mass media outlets as deemed
necessary by the Mayor.
(Prior Code, § 3-12-2)
§ 73.03 SNOW REMOVAL ROUTES.
   The City Council shall establish and maintain a priority list of streets,
public parking areas, city-maintained sidewalks, and other public areas for
snow and ice removal by resolution.
(Prior Code, § 3-12-3)
§ 73.04 DRIVEWAYS AND SNOW FROM PRIVATE PROPERTIES.
   City snowplows will not clear private driveways. The snow placed in
driveways by the city plows is an unavoidable consequence of removing snow from
the streets, and it is the responsibility of the property owner to remove. Snow
from private driveways, private parking lots, and sidewalks may not be placed
on city streets.
(Prior Code, § 3-12-4)
§ 73.05 REMOVAL OF SNOW AND ICE ACCUMULATING ON SIDEWALKS.
   It is the responsibility of the abutting property owners to remove snow and
ice accumulations from sidewalks. If a property owner does not remove snow and
ice accumulations within 24 hours after deposit of accumulation, the city will
attempt to notify the resident and give an additional 24 hours to clear or the
city may do so and assess the costs against the property owner for collection
in the same manner as a property tax, as provided in §
151.42.
(Prior Code, § 3-12-5)
§ 73.06 VEHICLE PARKING DURING SNOW EMERGENCY.
   (A)   No person shall park, abandon or leave unattended any vehicle on any
public street, alley, or city-owned off-street parking area during a snow
emergency proclaimed by the Mayor unless the snow has been removed or plowed
from said street, alley, or parking area and the snow has ceased to fall.
Vehicles parked on the street during a snow emergency are subject to tow
without notice to the owners at the owner’s expense.
   (B)   A snow emergency parking ban shall continue from its proclamation
through the duration of the snow or ice storm, and the 24-hour period after
cessation of the storm, except as above provided upon streets that have been
fully opened. The ban shall be of uniform application and the Police Chief is
directed to publicize the requirements, using all available news media, in
early November each year. The emergency may be extended or shortened when
conditions warrant.
(Prior Code, § 3-12-6) Penalty, see §
73.99
§ 73.07 PUSHING SNOW INTO STREETS.
   A person or entity shall not push, plow, or place any snow into, onto, or
across any public street.
(Prior Code, § 3-12-7) (Ord. 2014-04, passed 9-9-2014)
§ 73.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person violating any provisions of this chapter, for which no
specific penalty is prescribed, shall be subject to §
10.99.
   (B)   Penalties per violation of §
73.07 in a 12-month period are as follows:
 
Offense        Penalty
First offense  Warning
Second offense Warning
Third offense  $25 civil penalty, plus court costs

   It shall be unlawful for any person or persons to harbor or keep a vicious
animal within the city.
   (A)   Vicious animal defined. A potentially VICIOUS ANIMAL is an animal
that:
      (1)   When unprovoked, on two separate occasions, has engaged in any
behavior that has required a defensive action by any person to prevent bodily
injury when the person and animal were off of the property of the owner or
keeper of the animal;

      (3)   When unprovoked, has inflicted a serious injury or caused the death
of a domestic animal, either on public or private property other than the

      (4)   When unprovoked, chases or approaches a person or domestic animal
upon the streets, sidewalks, or any public or private property other than the
property of the owner or keeper, in a menacing fashion or apparent attitude of
attack.
   (B)   Procedure for declaration of potentially vicious animal.
      (1)   The Police Chief, City Clerk, or designee may find and declare an
animal potentially vicious based upon the following:
         (a)   The written complaint of a citizen that the animal has acted in
a manner set forth in division (A) above;
         (b)   Animal bite reports filed with the Health Services Department;
         (c)   Actions of the animal witnessed by any animal control officer or
law enforcement officer; or
         (d)   Other substantial evidence.
      (2)   The declaration of a potentially vicious animal shall be in writing
and shall be served on the owner or keeper in one of the following methods:
personally, by certified mail to the owner at the owner’s or keeper’s last
known address, or if the owner or keeper cannot be served personally or by
mail, by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.
      (3)   (a)   The declaration shall state:
            1.   The description of the animal;
            2.   The name and address of the owner or keeper of the animal, if
known;
            3.   The whereabouts of the animal, if not in the custody of the
owner or keeper;
            4.   The facts upon which the declaration of potentially vicious
animal is based;
            5.   The owner’s or keeper’s right to a hearing if the person

declaration of potentially vicious animal; and
            7.   The penalties for a violation of such restrictions.
         (b)   If the Police Chief, City Clerk, or other designee so determines
that the owner or keeper be required to have microchip identification implanted
in the animal.

vicious animal by requesting a hearing before the City Council by submitting a
written request to the City Clerk within four days per service, seven days of
the date of mailing of the declaration via certified mail, or within 10 days of
the publication of the declaration.
         (a)   If the City Council finds that there is insufficient evidence to
support the declaration, it shall be rescinded, and the restrictions imposed
thereby annulled.
         (b)   If the City Council finds sufficient evidence to support the
declaration, the City Council shall provide the owner with written notice of
such determination within ten working days after the hearing.
         (c)   Prior to the hearing, the owner or keeper shall confine the
animal in a fenced enclosure on the owner’s or keeper’s premises. It shall be
unlawful for the owner or keeper of the potentially vicious animal to allow or
permit such animal to go beyond the premises of the owner or keeper unless such
animal is securely leashed and humanely muzzled, or otherwise securely
restrained.
         (d)   If it is determined by the animal control officer or law
enforcement officer that probable cause exists to believe the dog in question
poses an immediate threat to public safety, then the animal control officer or
law enforcement officer may seize and impound the animal pending the hearing to
be held pursuant to this section. The owner or keeper of the animal shall be
liable to the city or county where the animal is impounded for the costs and
expenses of keeping the animal if the animal is later determined to be
potentially vicious. When an animal has been impounded and it is not contrary

confined at the owner’s expense in a health services department approved kennel
or veterinary facility.

owner or keeper shall provide the name, address, and telephone number of the
new owner or keeper to the Health Services Department. The new owner or keeper
shall comply with all the requirements of this chapter.
   (D)   Exceptions to classification.

of the injury or damage was sustained, was committing a willful trespass or
other tort upon premises occupied by the owner or keeper of the animal, or was
teasing, tormenting, abusing, or assaulting the animal, or was committing or

the control of, its owner or keeper, and the damage or injury was to a species
or type of domestic animal appropriate to the work of the animal.
   (E)   Disposition of potentially vicious animal pending compliance with this

which the animal cannot escape, and into which children cannot trespass. A
potentially vicious animal may be off the owner’s or keeper’s premises only if
restrained by a substantial leash of appropriate length, and if the animal is
under the control of a responsible adult and is humanely muzzled.

to protect and preserve the health, safety, and welfare of the patrons of such

   (B)   Adult-oriented establishments, because of their very nature, have a
detrimental effect on both existing establishments around them and surrounding

concern of the city that demands reasonable regulation of adult-oriented

objectionable operational characteristics, thereby contributing to blight and

the health, safety, and welfare of its residents; protect residents from
increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property values and
character of the surrounding neighborhoods; and deter the spread of blight; and
   (F)   It is not the intent of this chapter to suppress any speech activities
protected by the First Amendment, but to enact content neutral regulations that
address the secondary effects of adult-oriented establishments, as well as the
health problems associated with such establishments.

§ 115.01 PURPOSE.
   The city (hereinafter referred to as the “municipality”) hereby establishes
a franchise fee on every natural gas or electric company, and every other
person, firm, or corporation, their successors and assigns, owning, operating,
controlling, leasing, or managing a natural gas or electric plant or system,
and/or generating, manufacturing, selling, distributing, or transporting
natural gas or electric (hereinafter referred to, collectively, as “energy
providers,” each, individually, an “energy provider”). Energy providers shall
collect from their customers located within the corporate limits of the
municipality as depicted on the map (as defined in § 115.05) including the
city, and pay to the city an amount equal to 1% of gross receipts energy
providers derive from the sale, distribution, or transportation of natural gas
or electric delivered within the present limits of the municipality. Gross
receipts as used herein are revenues received from the sale, distribution, or
transportation of natural gas or electric, after adjustment for the net write-
off of uncollectible accounts and corrections of bills theretofore rendered.
(Prior Code, § 7-7-1)
§ 115.02 EXEMPT FROM OTHER FEES.
   The amount paid by energy providers shall be in lieu of, and energy
providers shall be exempt from, all other fees, charges, taxes, or assessments
which the municipality may impose for the privilege of doing business within
the municipality, including, without limitation, excise taxes, occupation
taxes, licensing fees, or right-of-way permit fees, and in the event the
municipality imposes any such fee, charge, tax, or assessment, the payment to
be made by energy providers in accordance with this chapter shall be reduced in
an amount equal to any such fee, charge, tax, or assessment imposed upon the
energy providers. Ad valorem property taxes imposed generally upon all real and
personal property within the municipality shall not be deemed to affect energy
providers’ obligations under this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 7-7-2)
§ 115.03 PAYMENTS.
   Energy providers shall report and pay any amount payable under this chapter
on a monthly basis. Such payment shall be made no more than 30 days following
the close of the period for which payment is due. Initial and final payments
shall be prorated for the portions of the periods at the beginning and end of
any franchise granted by the city to an energy provider.
(Prior Code, § 7-7-3)
§ 115.04 FRANCHISE FEE.
   Energy providers shall list the franchise fee collected from customers as a
separate item on bills for utility service issued to their customers. If at any
time the State Utilities Board or other authority having proper jurisdiction
prohibits such recovery, energy providers will no longer be obligated to
collect and pay the franchise fee until an alternate lawful franchise fee can
be negotiated and implemented. In addition, with prior approval of the city,
energy providers may reduce the franchise fee payable for natural gas or
electric delivered to a specific customer when such reduction is required to
attract or retain the business of that customer.
(Prior Code, § 7-7-4)
§ 115.05 MAP.
   (A)   Within ten days of the date of this chapter, the municipality shall
provide the energy providers with a map of its corporate limits (the “map”).
The map shall be of sufficient detail to assist energy providers in determining
whether their customers reside within the municipality’s corporate limits. The

representatives, find that the work described in an application for a permit
and the plans, specifications, and other data filed therewith conform to the
requirements of this code and other pertinent laws and ordinances, and that the
fees specified in §
150.047 have been paid, a permit shall be issued therefor to the applicant.
      (2)   When the Building Official, or his or her authorized

representatives, and all work shall be done in accordance with the approved
plans.
      (3)   The Building Official, or his or her authorized representatives,
may issue a permit for the construction of part of an electrical system before
the entire plans and specifications for the whole system have been submitted or
approved, provided adequate information and detailed statements have been filed
complying with all pertinent requirements of this code. The holder of such
permit shall proceed at personal risk without assurance that the permit for the
entire building, structure, or building service will be granted.
   (B)   Retention of plans. One set of approved plans and specifications shall
be returned to the applicant and shall be kept on the site of the building work
at all times during which the work authorized thereby is in progress. One set
of approved plans, specifications, and computations shall be retained by the
Building Official, or his or her authorized representatives, for purposes of
public record until final approval of the work.
   (C)   Validity of permit.
      (1)   The issuance of a permit or approval of plans and specifications

any of the provisions of this code, or of any other ordinance of the city. No
permit presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of these
codes shall be valid.
      (2)   The issuance of a permit based upon plans, specifications and other
data shall not prevent the Building Official, or his or her authorized
representatives, from thereafter requiring the correction of errors in said
plans, specifications, and other data, or from preventing building operations
being carried on thereunder when in violation of these codes, or of any other
ordinances of the city.
   (D)   Expiration.
      (1)   Every permit issued by the Building Official, or his or her
authorized representatives, under the provisions of this code shall expire by
limitation and become null and void if the building or work authorized by such
permit is not commenced within 180 days from the date of such permit, or if the
work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of 180
days following the last inspection of said work. Before such work can be
recommenced, a new permit shall be first obtained to do so, and the fee
therefor shall be one-half the amount required for a new permit for such work,
provided no changes have been made or will be made in the original plans and
specifications for such work; and provided further, that such suspension or
abandonment has not exceeded one year. In order to renew action on a permit
after expiration, the permittee shall pay a new full permit fee.
      (2)   Any permittee holding an unexpired permit may apply for an
extension of the time within which work may commence under that permit when
unable to commence work within the time required by this section for good and
satisfactory reasons. The Building Official, or his or her authorized
representatives, may extend the time for action by the permittee for a period
not exceeding 180 days upon written request by the permittee showing that
circumstances beyond the control of the permittee have prevented action from
being taken. No permit shall be extended more than once.
   (E)   Suspension or revocation. The Building Official may, in writing,

review, an additional plan review fee shall be charged at the rate set by
resolution of the Council.
   (C)   Expiration of plan review. Applications for which no permit is issued
within 180 days following the date of application shall expire by limitation,
and plans and other data submitted for review may thereafter be returned to the
applicant or destroyed by the Building Official, or his or her authorized
representatives. The Building Official may extend the time for action by the
applicant for a period not exceeding 180 days upon request by the applicant
showing that circumstances beyond the control of the applicant have prevented
action from being taken. No application shall be extended more than once. In
order to renew action, on an application after expiration, the applicant shall
resubmit plans and pay a new plan review fee.
   (D)   Investigation fees; work without a permit.
      (1)   Whenever any work for which a permit is required by this code has
been commenced without first obtaining said permit, a special investigation
shall be made before a permit may be issued for such work.
      (2)   An investigation fee, in addition to the permit fee, shall be
collected whether or not a permit is then or subsequently issued. The
investigation fee shall be equal to the amount of the permit fee that would be
required by this code if a permit were to be issued. The payment of such
investigation fee shall not exempt any person from compliance with all other
provisions of either this code nor from any penalty prescribed by law.

at least one working day before such inspection is desired. Such request may be
in writing or by telephone at the option of the Building Inspector.

      (1)   A reinspection fee may be assessed for each inspection or
reinspection when such portion of work for which inspection is called is not
complete or when corrections called for are not made.
      (2)   This provision is not to be interpreted as requiring reinspection
fees the first time a job is rejected for failure to comply with the
requirements of this code, but as controlling the practice of calling for
inspections before the job is ready for such inspection or reinspection.
      (3)   Reinspection fees may be assessed when the approved plans are not
readily available to the inspector, for failure to provide access on the date
for which inspection is requested, or for deviating from plans requiring the
approval of the Building Inspector.
      (4)   To obtain a reinspection, the applicant shall file an application
therefor in writing upon a form furnished for that purpose, and pay the
reinspection fee as set by resolution of the Council.

         (b)   Fire-resisting qualities or characteristics; or
         (c)   Weather-resisting qualities or characteristics required by law
in the case of a newly constructed building of like area, height, and occupancy
in the same location.
      (15)   Any building or structure, used or intended to be used for
dwelling purposes, is determined by the Health Officer to be unsanitary, unfit
for human habitation, or in such a condition that is likely to cause sickness
or disease because of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, decay, damage,
faulty construction, or arrangement, inadequate light, air, or sanitation
facilities, or otherwise.

safeguard life, health, property, and public welfare by regulating and
controlling the design, quality of materials, construction, location,
electrification, and maintenance of all signs and sign structures not located
within a building. The sign regulations in this chapter are not intended to
censor speech or to regulate viewpoints, but instead are intended to address
the secondary effects that may adversely impact aesthetics and traffic and
pedestrian safety. The sign regulations are designed to serve substantial
government interest and, in some cases, compelling government interests such as
traffic safety and warning signs of threats to bodily injury or death. This
chapter is intended to create content-neutral sign regulations which balance
the legitimate needs of individuals, entities, and organizations to convey
messages with the legitimate objectives of the city to promote public safety,
enhance community character, and enhance private property values. This chapter
is not intended to extend its regulatory regime to objects that are not
traditionally considered signs for purpose of government regulation.
      (2)   This chapter establishes sign regulations, including provisions to
control the type, design, size, location, and maintenance of signs, to achieve
the following purposes:
         (a)   To enable the public to locate goods, services, and facilities
without difficulty or confusion;
         (b)   To protect property values, public investment, and overall
neighborhood character by
preventing conditions that have undesirable impacts on surrounding properties;
         (c)   To promote the development of attractive and harmonious
residential districts, and viable retail and commercial districts;
         (d)   To ensure signs are designed and located to reduce distraction
and confusion that may be contributing factors to traffic congestion or
accidents and maintain a safe and orderly pedestrian and vehicular environment;
and
         (e)   To enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign
regulations and to provide standards regarding the non-communicative aspects of
signs.
   (B)   Application. Signs shall be designed, erected, altered, moved,
displayed, and maintained in accordance with the regulations set forth in this
chapter.
      (1)   The provisions in this chapter shall not amend or in any way
interfere with other codes, rules, or regulations governing traffic signs
within the city.
      (2)   The regulations contained in this chapter shall apply to signs
outside of the public right-of-way, except when specifically stated otherwise.
      (3)   The owner of any sign, which is otherwise permitted by this
chapter, may substitute noncommercial copy or message in lieu of any other
commercial or noncommercial sign copy of message.
   (C)   Conflicts. This chapter is not meant to repeal or interfere with the
enforcement of other chapters or sections of this code of ordinances. In cases
of conflicts between local, state, or federal regulations, the more restrictive
regulations shall apply.

the writing, emblem, illustrations, or other display, together with any
background material or color forming an integral part of the display, but not
including the supporting framework. On a multi-face sign the area is computed
only from one face. Where the frame or cabinet is not in the shape of a
rectangle, square, triangle or circle, the sign face area shall be determined
by calculating the area of an imaginary rectangle drawn around the frame or
cabinet.
   (B)   Height. Height shall be measured from the average ground level
exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavat ing solely for locating
the sign, to the highest point of the sign, or support structure, whichever is
taller.
   (C)   Projection. Any building sign extending more than six inches from the
wall to which it is attached shall allow a minimu m of ten feet of clearance
from the average ground level, as measur ed in division (B) above.
   (D)   Setback. The setback of a sign is measured from the propert y line to
the line projected to the ground plane of the nearest portion of the sign.
   (E)    Number of faces. No sign shall have more than two faces. Sign faces
shall be parallel, unless determined by the city to be consistent with the
architectural character of the building.

follows the same process as review of a PUD District.
(Ord. 2023-13, passed 7-25-2023)
§ 152.13 NON-CONFORMING SIGNS.
   Except as may be hereinafter specified, no sign shall be erected, placed,

chapter.
   (C)   Continuing non-conformance. Where a sign exists at the effective date
or adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance that could not be built under
the terms of this title by reason of restrictions on area, use, height,
setback, or other characteristics of the sign or its location on the lot, such
sign may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
following provisions:
      (1)   No such sign may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases
its nonconformity; and
      (2)   Should such a sign be destroyed by any means to an extent of 60% or
more of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall not be
reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this section.
   (D)   Removal. The Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to revoke
any permit which has been granted when the Zoning Administrator has determined
that the sign authorized by the permit has been constructed or maintained in
violation of the permit. Written notice shall be given to the owner of the
illegal sign and/or the owner of the property on which the sign is located. The
notice shall state the reasons and grounds for removal, specifying the
deficiencies or defects in such sign, and the violations charged; such notice
shall specify what repairs, if any, will make the sign conform to the
requirements of this section, and specify that the sign be removed or made to
conform with the requirements of this section with the notice period provided
below:
      (1)   The notice period for a permanent sign is 30 days; and
      (2)   The notice period for a portable sign is five days.

Administrator, the city’s officials, or its employees any responsibility or
liability by reason of the approval of any signs under the provisions of this

STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSE
§ 155.001 STATUTORY AUTHORITY.
   The legislature of the state has in Iowa Code Chapter 364, as amended,
delegated the power to cities to exercise any power and perform any function it
deems appropriate to protect and preserve the rights, privileges, and property
of the city or of its residents, and to preserve and improve the peace, safety,
health, welfare, comfort, and convenience of its residents.
(Prior Code, § 6-15-1)
§ 155.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which can result in loss of life and property, health, and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community.
   (B)   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by:
      (1)   The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood
damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately
elevated or otherwise protected from flooding; and
      (2)   The cumulative effect of obstructions on the floodplain causing
increases in flood heights and velocities.
(Prior Code, § 6-15-2)
§ 155.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and preserve the rights,
privileges, and property of the city and its residents, and to preserve and
improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and convenience of its
residents by minimizing those flood losses described in §
155.002(A) with provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood, or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement;
   (C)   Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard; and
   (D)   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
(Prior Code, § 6-15-3)
GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 155.015 LANDS TO WHICH CHAPTER APPLIES.
   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all lands and development
which have special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the city. For the
purpose of this chapter, the special flood hazard areas are those areas
designated as Zone A on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for the county and
incorporated areas, within the city, Panel 19061C0330F and 0340F, dated August
10, 2021, which were prepared as part of the County Flood Insurance Study,
shall be used to identify such flood hazard areas and all areas shown there to
be within the boundaries of the base flood shall be considered as having
significant flood hazards. The County Flood Insurance Study is hereby adopted
and made a part of this chapter for the purpose of administering floodplain
management regulations.
(Prior Code, § 6-15-4)
§ 155.016 RULES FOR INTERPRETATION OF FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARIES.
   The boundaries of the special flood hazard areas shall be determined by
scaling distances on the official flood insurance rate map. When an
interpretation is needed as to the exact location of a boundary, the Floodplain

§ 155.062 VARIANCE.
   (A)   The City Council may authorize upon request in specific cases such
variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship.
   (B)   Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.
      (1)   Variances shall only be granted upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of the variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local codes or ordinances.
      (2)   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (3)   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood
protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the
applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator
that:
         (a)   The issuance of a variance will result in increased premium
rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance
coverage; and
         (b)   Such construction increases risks to life and property.
   (C)   In passing upon applications for variances, the Council shall consider
all relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter, and:

that runs off land under construction within the city.
(Prior Code, § 6-21-1)
§ 156.002 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to help protect the city’s surface waters and
quality of life by reducing the negative impacts of sediment, rainfall, melting
snow, and other water runoff. This chapter seeks to meet that purpose through
the following objectives:
   (A)   Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from development within the
city limits and fringe area in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases
in stream temperature, and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of
stream channels;
   (B)   Minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater
runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality;
   (C)   Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows
from any specific development project site after completion to not exceed the
predevelopment hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable; and
   (D)   Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, and nonpoint
source pollution, wherever possible, through the establishment of appropriate
minimum stormwater management standards and BMPs and to ensure that BMPs are
properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety.

(Prior Code, § 6-21-4)
§ 156.005 ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY.
   The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this chapter are
minimum standards; therefore, if any provision of this chapter imposes
restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, or

      (3)   Unified stormwater sizing criteria. Summary of the city unified
stormwater sizing criteria for management of stormwater quality and quantity is
as follows:
 
Table 1
Sizing Criteria               Recommended Method
                              Evaluate the effects of the 100-year storm on the
                              stormwater management system, adjacent property,
Extreme Flood Protection (Qf) and downstream facilities and property. Manage
                              the impacts of the extreme storm event through
                              detention controls and/or floodplain management.
                              The runoff resulting from a rainfall depth of
                              1.25 inches or less. Equal to Rev. Goal is to
                              reduce average annual post-development total
Water Quality Volume (WQv)    suspended solids loadings by 80%. Goal is met if
                              Rev is completely infiltrated. WQv = (Rv)(A)(P)/
                              12; Rv = site runoff volume coefficient, A = site
                              drainage area (acres), P = design rainfall depth
                              = 1.25 inches.
 
      (4)   Intakes. Storm sewer intake points (inlet grates, endwalls, and the
like) should have a minimum capacity to convey the post-development condition
ten-year peak flow rate. Intakes shall be designed in such manner that the
flooded street width shall not exceed the following:
 
Table 2: Allowable Pavement Encroachment and Depth of Flow
Street Classification                  Maximum Encroachment
                                       No curb overtopping. Flow spread must
                                       not encroach to within eight feet of the
                                       centerline of a two-lane street. The
                                       flow spread for more than two-lane
Collector/Minor Arterial               streets must leave the equivalent of two
                                       12-foot driving lanes clear of water;
                                       one lane in each direction. For one- way
                                       streets, a single 12-foot lane is
                                       allowed.
Local                                  No curb overtopping. Flow may spread to
                                       crown of street.
                                       No curb overtopping. Flow spread must
                                       not exceed ten feet from the face of the
                                       curb of the outside lane. The flow
                                       spread for streets with more than two
                                       lanes must leave the equivalent of two
                                       12-foot driving lanes clear of water;
Major Arterials (four, or more, lanes) one lane in each direction. For one-way
                                       streets, two 12-foot lanes are required.
                                       For special conditions, when an intake
                                       is necessary in a raised median, the
                                       flow spread should not exceed four feet
                                       from the face of the median curb for an
                                       inside lane.
 
      (5)   Storm sewers. Storm sewers should have a minimum capacity to convey
the post-development condition ten-year peak flow rate. Provisions should be
made for the 25- and 100-year peak flow rate when overland flow is not allowed
or available. A minimum cleaning velocity of three fps should be used for the
design storm. Storm sewer and surface water conveyance easements should be
dedicated to the public. For those storm sewers that will handle footing
drains, the following additional discharge (Q) values should be used.
         (a)   For less than 50 houses, Q = five gpm (0.011 cfs) per house.
         (b)   For greater than 50 houses, Q = 250 gpm (0.556 cfs), plus 2.5
gpm (0.0056 cfs) per house for each additional house over 50.
      (6)   Culverts. Culverts should have capacity to convey the following:
         (a)   Post-development condition 25-year peak flow rate without the
headwater depth exceeding the diameter of the culvert.
         (b)   Post-development condition 50-year peak flow rate without the
headwater depth exceeding one foot over the top of the culvert.
         (c)   Post-development condition 100-year peak flow rate without the
headwater depth exceeding one foot below the low point of the roadway/
embankment, unless there are other, more restrictive elevations.
         (d)   Private culverts should be designed with an overflow so that no
damage is caused upstream of the proposed culvert.
      (7)   Ditches. Ditches should have capacity to convey the post-
development condition 50-year peak flow rate within the ditch banks. Provisions
should be made for the post-development condition 100-year peak flow rate to
flow overland. Surface water flowage easements should be provided to the
general public for all designed drainage ways and overland flow paths.
      (8)   Outlet stabilization. Stable outlets must have the capacity to
handle the designed outflow from the pond outlet or pipe conveyance structures
they serve. If the outlet is to be vegetated, it should be constructed and
established before installation of other stormwater or erosion control
structures. Outlet stabilization shall be designed based on the expected outlet
discharge from the ten-year, 24-hour storm event.
      (9)   Open channel stabilization. To prevent channels from eroding, the
channel lining must be adequate to carry the design velocity and volume. Where
velocities are higher than five feet per section or where the channel must
carry prolonged flow, the channel should be lined with riprap or other armoring
material. Channel linings shall be designed based on the expected channel
velocity from the ten-year, 24-hour storm event.
      (10)   Low impact tools, BMPs. In addition to the previously described
stormwater detention and conveyance requirements previously described, the
stormwater management systems designed as part of this chapter shall be
developed using one or more of the low impact development tools or other best
management practices identified in the Iowa Stormwater Manual, as approved by
the city, or their designated representative.
(Prior Code, § 6-21-8)
§ 156.021 MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   (A)   A comprehensive guide to managing stormwater on post-development sites
has been developed by the State Department of Natural Resources. The Iowa
Stormwater Management Manual can be found on the Internet at: http://
www.ctre.iastate.edu/pubs/stormwater/index.cfm. Rate control measures listed in
this guide include dry detention basins, wet detention basins, low-impact
development (LID) and DCIA minimization strategies, infiltration systems, and
constructed wetlands. Conveyance design measures listed in this guide include
street flow, intake capacity, storm sewer sizing, culvert hydraulics and
sizing, open channel flow design, groundwater barriers, and stormwater swale
systems. Stormwater infiltration measures listed in this guide include
infiltration basins, bioretention systems, infiltration trenches, soil quality
restoration, and native landscaping.
   (B)   Stormwater quality measures listed in this guide include wet detention
basins, stormwater swale systems, bioretention systems, constructed wetlands,
and native landscaping. Contractors and developers are required to stockpile
and redistribute a minimum of four inches of topsoil as part of the final
grading for the project or development. The guide contains figures and tables
summarizing the appropriate use of each of the measures listed, as well as
providing specifications and installation guidelines for each. The use of this
guide is strongly encouraged when choosing management practices for post
development stormwater. Other guides may be used to design outlet stabilization
measures. Acceptable guidelines include the Denver Urban Drainage and Flood
Control District publication Design of Low Tailwater Riprap Basins for Storm
Sewer Pipe Outlets, the FHWA publication HEC-14, and other practices found in
Iowa, Wisconsin, Nebraska, and Minnesota Department of Transportation design
standards.
(Prior Code, § 6-21-9)
§ 156.022 POST-CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SUBMITTAL.
   A DNR issued general permit No. 2 will continue to be necessary prior to the
beginning of any construction activity that disturbs more than one or more
acres, or which is part of a larger project that disturbs one or more acres in
total. The submittal of a site development project will require a descriptive
narrative of the site, a site plan, and other supporting documents. They are
provided as a minimum guide and are not to be construed as the specific
information to be supplied on every project drainage report, and other
information may be required. Pre-settlement, pre-development, and post-
development conditions for any given site will require analysis unique to that
area.
   (A)   A project report narrative shall include the following items.
      (1)   A cover sheet with project name and location, name of firm or
agency preparing the report, professional engineer’s signed and sealed
certification, and table of contents. Number each page of the report.
      (2)   The nature of the construction activity (for example, roadway
construction, utility construction, single-family residential construction, and
the like), an estimate of the total area of the project site, and the total
anticipated impervious area.
      (3)   Watershed size for each drainage area (both on-site and off-site)
to determine how much of the area to be developed is affected by other drainage
flowing through the site and to design appropriately sized storm sewer,
culverts, and drainage channels.
      (4)   Describe pre-settlement/pre-development land use, topography,
drainage patterns (including overland conveyance of the 100-year storm event),
and natural and human-made features. Describe pre-development ground coverage,
soil type, and physical properties, such as hydrologic soil group and
infiltration. Pre-settlement ground coverage should be assumed as open prairie
in any non-wooded area.
      (5)   Describe post-developed land use and proposed grading, change in
percent of impervious area, and change in drainage patterns. If an existing
drainage way is filled, the runoff otherwise stored by the drainage way will be
mitigated with stormwater detention, in addition to the post-development
runoff.
      (6)   Describe contributing off-site drainage patterns, land use, and
stormwater conveyance. Identify undeveloped contributing areas with development
potential, and list assumptions about future development runoff contributed to
the site.
      (7)   Discussion of soils located on site and their suitability for
infiltration. If infiltration meets the exclusion criteria, state why.
      (8)   Describe the features that will be installed to control rate of
runoff, pollutants in stormwater, and infiltration in the post-development
condition.
      (9)   Describe the maintenance and repair plan for all stormwater BMPs
including detailed maintenance and repair procedures to ensure their continued
efficient function. These plans will identify the parts or components of a
stormwater BMP that need to be maintained and the equipment and skills or
training necessary.
      (10)   Indicate what permits have been applied for and received,
including, but not limited to, IDNR notice of intent, flood permit for sites
affecting FEMA FIRM Zone A or Zone AE, ACOE Section 401 and/or 404 permits for
work in waterways or wetlands.
   (B)   Pre-settlement and pre-development runoff analysis, including:
      (1)   Describe overall watershed area and relationship between other
watersheds or sub-areas. Include a pre-settlement/pre-development watershed map
in the report appendix.
      (2)   The typical method used to predict runoff and peak discharge is the
NRCS TR-55 method. Other methods may be used only with the preapproval of the
City Engineer. If other methods are used, describe the method and provide
documentation of correspondence with the City Engineer regarding the method.
      (3)   Describe the method used to calculate the time of concentration.
Describe runoff paths and travel times through sub-areas. Show and label the
runoff paths on the pre-settlement/pre-development watershed map. Pre-
settlement runoff paths should be assumed to match predevelopment with respect
to location and slope.
      (4)   List runoff coefficients or curve numbers applied to the drainage
areas. The RCNs listed in
Table 3a shall be used in all hydrologic calculations for pre-settlement
conditions required for determining Qp limits (two-, ten-, and 25-year events).
These RCNs have been selected with the intent to mimic hydrologic conditions
that existed in the state prior to settlement and farming. The RCNs listed in
Table 3b shall be used in all hydrologic calculations for pre-development
conditions required for determining Qf limits (100-year event). These RCNs have
been selected with the intent to reflect hydrologic conditions that exist after
settlement and farming. If a geotechnical study of the site was used to
determine HSG, provide boring logs and locations in the appendix of the report.
If a soil survey was used to determine HSG, cite it in the references.

mowed farm pasture, and other areas with short grass.
5.   Areas include roofs, sidewalks, paved streets and roads (excluding the
right-of-way), curbs, paved parking lots, and driveways.
 
      (5)   The typical precipitation model and rainfall duration used for the
design storm is the NRCS Type II 24-hour distribution. Total 24-hour rainfall
amounts for given frequency shall reflect data from NOAA Atlas 14, Volume 8 as
displayed in
Table 4 below. Other methods (such as a user-defined model based on collected
precipitation data) or durations (such as a critical duration analysis) may be
used only with the preapproval of the City Engineer. If other methods are used,
describe the method and provide documentation of correspondence with the
engineer regarding the method.

      (6)   Provide summary table(s) of model results including drainage area,
time of concentration, frequency, peak discharge, and accumulative routed flows
at critical points within the development (if any) and at development
boundaries. At a minimum, flow rates for pre-settlement two-, ten-, and 25-year
storms and pre-development 100-year storm must be provided.
   (C)   Post-development runoff analysis, including:
      (1)   Describe overall watershed area and sub-areas. Discuss if the post-
development drainage area differs from the pre-development drainage area.
Include a post development watershed map in the report appendix.
      (2)   The method used to predict runoff and peak discharge will be the
same as used in the pre-development analysis, except for variables changed to
account for the developed conditions.
      (3)   The time of concentration method used will be the same as used in
the pre-development analysis. Describe change in times of concentration due to
development (for example, change in drainage patterns). Show and label the
runoff paths on the post-development watershed map.
      (4)   List runoff coefficients or curve numbers applied to the drainage
areas. The RCNs listed in
Table 3b above shall be used in all hydrologic calculations for post-
development conditions. Include an analysis of the proposed increase in
impervious area and describe the change in runoff volume due to development.
Directly connected impervious area (roads, front of houses, and the like) shall
be separated out from the pervious area and unconnected impervious areas (backs
of houses, and the like) in the determination of a weighted RCN. Provide a
summary of the total directly connected impervious area and the total
unconnected impervious area for each sub-watershed/catchment.
      (5)   The precipitation model storm event, total rainfall, and total
storm duration will be the same as used for the pre-development model.
      (6)   Provide summary table(s) of model results including drainage area,
time of concentration, frequency, peak discharge, and accumulative routed flows
at critical points within the development (if any) and at development
boundaries. At a minimum, flow rates for one-, two-, ten-, 25-, and 100-year
storms must be provided.
      (7)   Summary of post-development runoff shall include the following:
         (a)   Description of BMP including water quality practices
(methodology);
         (b)   Provide table(s) including drainage area, time of concentration,
frequency, duration, and peak discharge. Summarize in narrative form the change
in hydrologic conditions due to the development; and
         (c)   Post-developed discharge should take into account any upstream
offsite detention basins and undeveloped offsite areas assumed to be developed
in the future with stormwater detention.
   (D)   Rate control structure and conveyance system analysis, including:
      (1)   Describe any detention basin locations by discussing existing
topography and relationship to basin grading. Determine if rock deposits will
affect construction and if a high water table precludes basin storage.
Floodplain locations should be avoided.
      (2)   The detention basin size in final design should be based upon
actual hydrograph routing for the design storms controlled by the basin. Note
the TR-55 approximate method of sizing detention basins (TR-55 Chapter 6) may
result in storage errors of 25%, and should not be used in final design.
      (3)   The top of any dike used in forming a detention basin should be a
minimum of one foot above the 100-year storage elevation. Large detention basin
design may require IDNR approval (see Iowa Administrative Code Title V, Chapter
70).
      (4)   Discuss the basin outlet design in terms of performance during low
and high flows and downstream impact. Note that a single-stage outlet (for
example, one culvert pipe) may not be appropriate because of its inability to
detain post-developed runoff from storms less than the ten-year interval. A
more desirable outlet has two or more stages (such as a riser structure with an
orifice) which will serve to detain runoff for low-flow events of a two-year
storm, and pass greater storm events via the riser outlet.
      (5)   Design the spillway for high flows using weir and/or spillway
design methods. The steady-state open channel flow equation is not intended for
use in spillway design.
      (6)   Describe methods to protect the basin during overtopping flow.
      (7)   Describe channel protection/lining and velocity dissipation at
outlets.
      (8)   Provide a summary table of the respective volumes and discharge
rates for the project area after routing though rate control structures, and a
comparison to the calculated allowable release rate from the site for the two-,
ten-, 25-, and 100-year storm events.
   (E)   A site map (or maps) including the following items.
      (1)   (a)   A preliminary plat (with pre- and post-development
topography) may be used to show the proposed development. Minimum scale of one
inch equals 500 feet or larger to ensure legibility should be used for all
drainage areas. (Drawings no larger than 24 inches by 36 inches should be
inserted in eight and one-half-inch by 11-inch sleeves in the back of the bound
report). The plat is to show street layout and/or building location on a
contour interval not to exceed two feet.
         (b)   The map must show on- and off-site conditions. Label flow
patterns used to determine times of concentration. Drainage plans (preliminary
plat or topography map) must extend a minimum of 250 feet from the edge of the
proposed preliminary plat boundary, or a distance specified by jurisdiction.
         (c)   The limits of swale and ditch easements should be established
based upon the required design frequency. This includes 100-year overflow
easements from stormwater controlled structures.
      (2)   Identify areas of the site located within the floodway or
floodplain boundaries as delineated on flood insurance rate maps, or as
determined by other engineering analysis. Identify wetland areas on the site,
as delineated by the National Wetlands Inventory, or as determined by a
specific wetland study.
      (3)   Soil map or geotechnical information.
      (4)   Location and elevations of jurisdictional benchmarks. All
elevations should be on jurisdictional datum.
      (5)   Proposed property lines (if known).
      (6)   Existing drainage facilities and structures, including existing
roadside ditches, drainage ways, gutter flow directions, culverts, and the
like. All pertinent information such as size, shape, slope location, 100-year
flood elevation, and floodway fringe line (where applicable), should also be
included to facilitate review and approval of drainage plans.
      (7)   Proposed drainage facilities and structures, including storm sewers
and open drainage ways, right-of-way and easement width requirements, 100-year
overland flow easement, proposed inlets, manholes, culverts, erosion and
sediment control, water quality (pollution) control, infiltration basins,
energy dissipation devices, and other appurtenances.
      (8)   Cross sections and profiles of road ditches designed to carry storm
flows and to ensure non-erosive velocities.
      (9)   Proposed outfall point(s) for runoff from the study area.
      (10)   The 100-year flood elevation and major storm floodway fringe
(where applicable) are to be shown on the plans, report drawings, and plats
(preliminary and final). In addition, the report should demonstrate that the
stormwater system has adequate capacity to handle a 100-year storm event, or
provisions are made for overland flow.
      (11)   Show the critical minimum lowest opening elevation of buildings
for protection from major and minor storm runoff.
   (F)   Supporting computations. Computations may be done by hand or with
computer software (P8, WinSLAMM, or other DNR approved models). If software was
used, attach computer-generated reports and output and underline and label
results, such as the peak discharge. Provided computations must include:
      (1)   Runoff coefficients and curve numbers for each sub-watershed;
      (2)   Total impervious area (square feet and percentage of total drainage
area);
      (3)   Times of concentration for each sub-watershed;
      (4)   Storm sewer design summaries;
      (5)   Peak runoff calculations (show results in tabular format and pre-
and post-developed hydrographs);
      (6)   Detention basin design (show tabular stage-storage-discharge
results and inflow/outflow hydrographs. Include both extended-detention and
rate control results);
      (7)   Water quality volume calculations;
      (8)   Infiltration basin design calculations;
      (9)   Open channel flow calculations. For ditches that drain areas over
two square miles in urban areas and over ten square miles in rural areas,
design may require the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) approval
(see Iowa Administrative Code Chapter 567.71);
      (10)   Culvert design calculations or nomographs. For culverts that drain
areas over two square miles in urban areas and over ten square miles in rural
areas, design may require the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR)
approval (see Iowa Administrative Code Chapter 567.71); and
      (11)   Erosion protection design.
   (G)   Before the recording of final plat and issuance of a permit, or as
condition of approval of final plat and issuance of a permit, the Commission
and city shall require the following guarantees to ensure that the stormwater
BMPs are installed by the permit holder as required by the approved stormwater
management final plan.
      (1)   The amount of the performance guarantee shall be the total
estimated construction cost of the stormwater BMPs approved under the permit,
plus 10%. The performance guarantee shall be posted by the subdivider or
subdivider’s contractor under §
157.024 with the City Council guaranteeing the improvements will be constructed
and shall remain in full force and effect until final acceptance of the
improvements by the city. Final acceptance of the plat will not constitute
final acceptance by the city of any improvements to be constructed.
Improvements will be accepted only after their construction has been completed,
and no public funds will be expended in the subdivision until such improvements
have been completed and accepted by the City Council resolution.
      (2)   The performance guarantee shall contain forfeiture provisions for
failure to complete work specified in the stormwater management final plan.
      (3)   The performance guarantee shall be released in full only upon
submission of “as built plans” of all stormwater BMPs specified in the
stormwater management final plan and written certification by a professional
engineer that the stormwater BMPs have been installed in accordance with the
approved stormwater management final plan and other applicable provisions of
this chapter. The city will make a final inspection of stormwater BMPs to
ensure compliance with the approved stormwater management final plan and the
provisions of this chapter. Provisions for a partial pro-rata release of the
performance guarantee based on the completion of various development stages can
be made at the discretion of the city.
   (H)   The city shall also require the submittal of a maintenance performance
guarantee prior to issuance of a permit in order to ensure that the stormwater
BMPs are maintained in an effective state for a minimum of two years.

a formal maintenance covenant that must be approved by the city and recorded
prior to the stormwater management final plan approval. As part of the
covenant, a schedule shall be developed for when and how often maintenance will
occur to ensure proper function of the stormwater BMPs. The covenant shall also
include plans for periodic inspections to ensure proper performance of the BMPs
between scheduled cleanouts. The city, in lieu of a maintenance covenant, may
but is not required to accept dedication of any existing or future stormwater
BMP to include the city responsibility for maintenance and repair, provided
that the maintenance and repair of such element will not impose an undue burden
on other city taxpayers who enjoy little if any benefit from the BMP, the BMP
meets all the requirements of this chapter, and the dedication includes
adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or otherwise,
for inspection and regular maintenance.
(Prior Code, § 6-21-19)
§ 156.042 REQUIREMENTS FOR MAINTENANCE COVENANTS.
   All stormwater BMPs must undergo, at the minimum, an annual inspection to

   (A)   The city will work with applicants for consistent enforcement of the
city minimum standards. If a responsible party fails or refuses to meet the
requirements of the maintenance covenant or any provision of this chapter, the
city, after reasonable notice, may correct a violation by performing all
necessary work to place the BMP in proper working condition. In the event that
the stormwater BMP becomes a danger to public safety or public health, the city
shall notify the party responsible for maintenance of the stormwater BMP in
writing.
   (B)   Upon receipt of that notice, the responsible person shall have 30 days
to effect maintenance and repair of the stormwater BMP in an approved manner.
After proper notice, the city may assess, jointly and severally, the owner(s)
of the stormwater BMP, or the property owners or the parties responsible for
maintenance under any applicable written agreement, for the cost of repair work
and any penalties; and the cost of the work shall be a lien on the property, or
prorated against the beneficial users of the property, and may be placed on the
tax bill and collected as ordinary taxes.
(Prior Code, § 6-21-27)
§ 156.075 APPEAL.
   The determination by the city of a violation of this chapter may be appealed
by an aggrieved party to the City Council, provided written notice of appeal is
received by the city within 15 days from the date of the notice of violation.
Upon hearing, the City Council may rescind, modify, or affirm the notice of
violation.
(Prior Code, § 6-21-28)
§ 156.076 ENFORCEMENT.
   The City Engineer and/or Public Works Director, or their representative, may
enter upon any property where land disturbing activity is being conducted and
take any and all action necessary to abate any violation of this chapter and/or
remediate or restore the property to its condition prior to the land disturbing
activity. It shall be a violation of this chapter for any person to refuse to
allow the City Engineer and/or City Inspector to enter upon property for such
purposes.
(Prior Code, § 6-21-29)
§ 156.077 COST OF ABATEMENT OF VIOLATION.
   Within 30 days after abatement of a violation of this chapter, the owner of
the property shall be notified in writing by the city of the cost of abatement,
including administrative costs. The property owner may file a written protest
with the city objecting to the amount of the cost of abatement within 15 days
thereafter. If the cost of abatement is not paid to the city within 60 days
after the date of the notice, the cost of abatement shall be certified by the
city in the manner of a special assessment against the property, and shall
constitute a lien on the property.
(Prior Code, § 6-21-30)
§ 156.078 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.

(Prior Code, § 6-7-7) (Ord. 2008-03, passed 8-26-2008)
§ 157.022 MINIMUM IMPROVEMENTS.
   The improvements set forth below shall be considered the minimum
improvements necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare (per
Iowa Code § 364.1).
   (A)   Streets and alleys. All streets and alleys within the platted area
which are dedicated for public use shall be brought to the grade approved by
the governing body after receiving the report and recommendations of the City
Engineer.
   (B)   Roadways. All roadways shall be surfaced with Portland cement concrete
or with asphaltic concrete over a crushed stone base as the governing body may
require.

   (D)   Sidewalks.
      (1)   Sidewalks shall be required on all public street frontages and
constructed in accordance with the provisions of §§
151.40 through
151.57. Sidewalks shall be shown on all final subdivision plats approved after
July 26, 2022.
      (2)   Sidewalks shall be placed four feet behind the curb parallel to the
street, unless an exception has been permitted by the city to preserve
topographical or natural features or to provide visual interest, or unless the
subdivider shows that an alternative pedestrian system provides safe and
convenient circulation.
       (3)   In planned developments, sidewalks (as used in this subsection)
may be located away from the road system to link dwelling units with other
dwelling units, and the street to on-site activity centers such as parking
areas and recreational areas. Developer may also be required to install
sidewalks parallel to the street.
      (4)   For all zoning districts, sidewalks must be installed before the
earliest of the following events:
         (a)   Sidewalks must be installed along the frontage of an improved
property before occupancy is permitted. The City Council has granted an
extension of time to install the required sidewalk.
         (b)   Upon 80% of lots in any subdivision being served by sidewalks,
the remaining properties, unserved by sidewalks, shall have sidewalks installed
within two years whether the remaining lots are developed or not. The mailing
of a letter to the property owner by the city that 80% of lots have sidewalks
shall serve as the starting point of the two-year period.
          (c)   All sidewalks in a subdivision must be installed within five
years (or suggestions of a date) of the date on which the City Council approved
the final plat.
          (d)   If an undeveloped lot is sold to an owner of an adjacent
developed lot for use as part of the adjacent developed lot or for a future
undetermined purpose, the undeveloped lot must have sidewalks installed within
30 days of the date of sale unless an extension is granted by the City Council,
which shall only be granted for good cause shown.
         (e)   Any undevelopable lots, lots on which stormwater detainage/
retainage is located, or lots to be used for other purposes, such as parks and/
or public areas, shall have sidewalks installed by the developer, at
developer’s expense, within one year of the City Council approval of the final
plat unless an extension is granted by the City Council which shall only be
granted for good cause shown.
   (E)   Water lines. Where a public water main is reasonably accessible, the
subdivider shall connect with such water main and provide a water connection
for each lot with service pipe installed to the property line in accordance
with the City Water Department standards, procedures, and supervision.
   (F)   Sewers.
      (1)   Where a public sanitary sewer is reasonably accessible, the
subdivider shall connect or provide for the connection with such sanitary sewer
and shall provide within the subdivision the sanitary sewer system as required
to make the sewer accessible to each lot in the subdivision. Sanitary sewers
shall be stubbed into each lot. Sewer systems shall be approved by the
governing body and the State Department of Health, and the construction subject
to the supervision of the Superintendent of Public Utilities.
      (2)   Where sanitary sewers are not available, other facilities, as
approved by the governing body and the State Department of Health, must be
provided for the adequate disposal of sanitary wastes.
      (3)   Adequate provisions shall be made for the disposal of stormwaters,
subject to the approval of the governing body and to the supervision of the
Superintendent of Public Utilities.
(Prior Code, § 6-7-8) (Ord. 2022-09, passed 7-26-2022)
§ 157.023 COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   Before the governing body shall approve the final plat, all of the foregoing
improvements shall be constructed and accepted by formal resolution of the
governing body. Before passage of said resolution of acceptance, the
Superintendent of Public Works shall report that said improvements meet all
city specifications and ordinances or other city requirements, and the
agreements between the subdivider and the city.
(Prior Code, § 6-7-9)
§ 157.024 PERFORMANCE BOND.
   The completion requirement may be waived in whole or in part if the
subdivider will post a performance bond with the governing body guaranteeing
that improvements not completed will be constructed within a period of one year
from final acceptance of the plat, but final acceptance of the plat will not
constitute final acceptance by the city of any improvements to be constructed.
Improvements will be accepted only after their construction has been completed,
and no public funds will be expended in the subdivision until such improvements
have been completed and accepted by the city.
(Prior Code, § 6-7-10)
MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR THE DESIGN OF SUBDIVISIONS
§ 157.035 MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   The following standards shall be considered the minimum standards necessary
to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (A)   Relation to existing streets. The arrangement, character, extent,
width, grade, and location of all streets shall be considered in their relation
to existing and planned streets, to topographic conditions, to public
convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses
of the land to be served by such streets. The arrangement of streets in a
subdivision shall either provide for the continuation of appropriate projection
of existing principal streets in surrounding areas or conform to a plat for the
neighborhood approved by the governing body to meet a particular situation
where topographical or other conditions made continuance or conformance to
existing streets impracticable.
   (B)   Acreage subdivisions.
      (1)   Where the plat submitted covers only a part of the subdivider’s
plat, a sketch of the prospective future system of the unsubmitted part shall
be furnished and the street system of the part submitted shall be considered in
the light of adjustments in connection with the street system of the part not
submitted.
      (2)   Where the parcel is subdivided into larger tracts than for building
lots such parcels shall be divided so as to allow for the opening of major
streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent minor streets.
      (3)   Subdivisions showing unplatted strips or private streets
controlling access to public ways will not receive approval.
   (C)   Local streets.
      (1)   Local streets shall be so planned as to discourage through traffic.
      (2)   Cul-de-sac streets are permitted where topography and other
conditions justify their use. Such street shall not be longer than 500 feet and
shall terminate with a turn-around, having an outside roadway diameter of at
least 80 feet and street property line diameter of at least 100 feet. The
right-of-way width of the straight portion of such streets shall be a minimum
of 60 feet. The property line at the intersection of the turn-around and the
straight portion of the street shall be rounded at a radius of not less than 20
feet.
   (D)   Frontage streets.
      (1)   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
arterial street, the governing body may require marginal access streets,
reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a non-access reservation
along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other
treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties
and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
      (2)   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way
or limited access highway right-of-way, the governing body may require a street
approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance
suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes
in residential districts. Such distances shall also be determined with due
regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations.
   (E)   Half-streets. Half-streets shall be prohibited except where essential
to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of these regulations, and where the governing body finds it will
be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining
property is subdivided. Wherever a half-street is adjacent to a tract to be
subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract.
   (F)   Street geometrics.
      (1)   Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be
avoided.
      (2)   A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between
reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
      (3)   When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one
point by more than ten degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a
radius adequate to ensure a sight distance of not less than 200 feet for minor
and collector streets, and of such greater radii as the governing body shall
determine for special cases.
   (G)   Intersections.
      (1)   Insofar as is practical, acute angles between streets at their
intersection are to be avoided.
      (2)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible
at right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at less than 60
degrees.
      (3)   Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a
radius of ten feet, or of a greater radius where the governing body may deem it
necessary. The governing body may permit comparable cutoffs or chords in place
of rounded corners.
   (H)   Street names. Streets that are in alignment with others already
existing and named shall bear the name of the existing streets. The proposed
names of new streets shall not duplicate or sound similar to existing street
names. Street names shall be subject to the approval of the governing body.
   (I)   Street grades.
      (1)   Street grades, wherever feasible, shall not exceed 5%, with due
allowance for reasonable vertical curves.
      (2)   No street grade shall be less than one-half of 1%.
   (J)   Alleys.
      (1)   Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts,
except that the governing body may waive this requirement where other definite
and assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading,
unloading, and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed.
      (2)   The width of an alley shall be 20 feet.
      (3)   Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be
avoided, but where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit
safe vehicular movements.
      (4)   Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if
unavoidable, shall be provided with adequate turn-around facilities at the
dead-end, as determined by the governing body.
   (K)   Blocks. No block may be more than 1,320 feet or less than 500 feet in
length between the centerlines of intersecting streets, except where, in the
opinion of the governing body, extraordinary conditions unquestionably justify
a departure from these limits. In blocks over 700 feet in length, the governing
body may require at or near the middle of the block a public way or easement of
not less than ten feet in width for use by pedestrians and/or as an easement
for public utilities.
   (L)   Lots.
      (1)   The lot size, width, depth, shape, and orientation shall be
appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development
and use contemplated.
      (2)   Minimum lot dimensions and sizes.
         (a)   Residential lots where not served by public sewer shall not be
less than 80 feet wide nor less than 10,000 square feet in area.
         (b)   Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for
commercial and industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-
street service and parking facilities required by the type of use and
development contemplated.
         (c)   Corner lots for residential use shall have an extra ten feet of
width to permit appropriate building setback from and orientation to both
streets.
      (3)   The subdividing of the land shall be such as to provide, by means
of public street, each lot with satisfactory access to an existing public
street.
      (4)   Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except
where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic
arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
      (5)   A planting screen easement of at least ten feet and across which
there shall be no right of access, shall be provided along the line of lots
abutting such a traffic artery or other disadvantageous use.
      (6)   Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles to straight

soon as possible, but not more than 30 days thereafter, consider said report,
negotiate with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the kind and
extent of improvements to be made by the subdivider, and pass upon the
preliminary plat as originally submitted or modified. If the governing body
does not act within 30 days, the preliminary plat shall be deemed to be
approved, provided, however, that the subdivider may agree to an extension of
the time for a period not to exceed an additional 60 days. It shall then set
forth its recommendations in writing, whether of approval, modification, or
disapproval.
   (A)   In the event that substantial changes or modifications are made by the

   (C)   Third-party review or technical consultation. The city may retain the
services of third-party entities of its choosing to provide review or technical
consultation of applications, including, but not limited to, attorneys,
surveyors, and engineers. Such third-party review may include without
limitation:
      (1)   The accuracy and completeness of applications, including items
submitted therewith;
      (2)   The validity of analysis, techniques, and methodologies proposed by
applicant;
      (3)   The validity of conclusion reached by applicant; and
      (4)   Whether the application satisfies applicable approval criteria set
forth in this chapter.
   (D)   Review process. The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall apply the
following criteria, as applicable, in approving, approving with conditions, or
denying a special use permit relative to an application:
      (1)   Height, setback, fall zone, and lot area requirements:
         (a)   No tower shall exceed a height of 150 feet above grade, unless
otherwise approved by the Zoning Board of Adjustment. A lightning rod, not to
exceed ten feet in height, shall be not be included within the height
limitation.
         (b)   No transmission equipment, wireless facilities, or base stations
installed upon or affixed to a wireless support structure shall exceed the
height of the wireless support structure, at its highest point, by more than 25
feet, unless otherwise approved by the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
         (c)   Towers and base stations shall be located so the distance from
the base of the tower (or distance from guy wires if used in conjunction with a
tower) and to any adjoining property satisfies the minimum building setback
requirement for the zoning district in which the tower is located. Base
stations shall similarly comply with such minimum building setbacks.
         (d)   Notwithstanding compliance with minimum building setback
requirements for the zoning district in which a tower is located, all towers
shall be situated to provide a sufficient fall zone such that the distance from
the base of the tower to the nearest occupied structure, public right-of-way,
residential zoning district, and/or property designated for residential use by
the city's comprehensive plan, exceeds the height of the tower. Provided, if
the tower is constructed utilizing breakpoint design technology, the minimum
distance for purposes of this division shall be equal to 110% the distance from
the top of the tower to the designed breakpoint. For example, on a 100-foot
monopole tower with a breakpoint at 80 feet, the minimum distance would be 22
feet (100% of 20 feet, the distance from the top of the tower to the
breakpoint).
         (e)   For the purposes of determining compliance with setbacks, lot
coverage, and other such requirements for the zoning district in which a tower
and base station are located, the dimensions of the entire lot or parcel shall
control, even if located on a leased area situated within such lot or parcel.
      (2)   Compliance with state and federal requirements. Towers,
transmission equipment, and base stations must meet or exceed current standards
and regulations of the FCC, FAA, and any other state or federal agency with the
authority to regulate towers.
      (3)   Compliance with applicable building codes/safety standards. Towers,
transmission equipment, and base stations shall be constructed, installed, and
maintained in compliance with standards set forth in applicable state or local
building codes and industry safety standards and subject to all applicable
permitting and approvals.
      (4)   Collocation. In furtherance of the city's objective of encouraging
collocation, towers exceeding 80 feet in height must be designed and
constructed to accommodate additional communication antennas when technically
feasible.
      (5)   Design and construction. All towers shall be of monopole
construction and equipped with anti-climbing devices, unless otherwise approved
by the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
      (6)   Fencing. Towers (and guy wires if used in conjunction with a tower)
shall be enclosed by a security fence not less than six feet in height,
provided this requirement shall not prevent fencing required to satisfy state
or federal requirements.
      (7)   Lighting. Towers and transmission equipment shall not be
illuminated unless required to conform to FCC, FAA, or other state or federal
requirements. If lighting is required, the lighting alternative or design
chosen must cause the least disturbance to surrounding views and/or surrounding
properties. Security lighting may be provided around the base of a tower if
zero cut-off luminaries with a maximum mounting height of 12 feet are used to
limit lighting to the tower site.
      (8)   Finishing. Towers shall be painted or coated silver or have a
galvanized finish or be painted a neutral color to reduce visual obtrusiveness
to the maximum extent possible, unless otherwise required by state or federal
requirements. Towers and transmission equipment shall not be painted in such a
manner as to convey a company identity, and all transmission equipment shall be
of a color that matches the tower, unless otherwise required by state or
federal requirements.
      (9)   Signage. No signage, logos, decals, symbols, or messages of a
commercial nature may be displayed upon a tower, base station, wireless support
structure, or required fencing, except for warning and identification signs and
notifications, and such other signs as may be required by local, state, or
federal requirements.
      (10)   Landscaping/buffering.
         (a)   Towers and associated base stations shall be landscaped with a
buffer of plant material that effectively screens from view the base of the
tower and base station from adjacent properties and/or streets. The plantings
installed shall be of a size and species that can achieve a height of six feet
and 75% opacity during at least three seasons.
         (b)   In locations where the visual impact of the tower and base
station would be minimal, as determined by the Zoning Board of Adjustment, the
landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived. Existing mature tree growth
and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent
possible. Natural growth around the perimeter of the site may be considered a
sufficient buffer for a tower and base station, as determined by the Zoning
Board of Adjustment.
      (11)   Concealment.
         (a)   Transmission equipment or base stations installed upon or
affixed to a wireless support structure shall be installed so as to camouflage,
disguise, or conceal them to make them closely compatible with and blend into
the setting and/or wireless support structure.
         (b)   Transmission equipment or base stations installed upon or
affixed to a building shall be concealed within existing architectural features
to the maximum extent feasible. Any new architectural features proposed to
conceal the transmission equipment shall be designed to mimic the architectural
features of the building, shall be proportional to the building, and shall
utilize materials of a similar quality finish, color, and texture as the
building.
         (c)   Roof-mounted transmission equipment or base stations shall be
set back from all roof edges to the maximum extent feasible with need for
light-of-sign transmission and reception of signals.
