resolves to consider such proposal, it shall publish notice and hold a public
hearing thereon. Thereafter, at least 30 days after such hearing, the City

46.02 Cigarettes and Tobacco
Â 
46.01Â Â Â CURFEW.
The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote the
public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and specifically
to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults responsible for
minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors committed after
the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences and criminal
activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.
1.Â Â Â Definitions. For use in this section, the following terms are defined:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â â€œEmergency errandâ€ means, but is not limited to, an errand relating to
a fire, a natural disaster, an automobile accident or any other situation
requiring immediate action to prevent serious illness, bodily injury, or loss
of life.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â â€œKnowinglyâ€ means knowledge that a responsible adult should reasonably
be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that responsible
adultâ€™s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful or careless
adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult responsibility
through an objective test. It is therefore no defense that an adult responsible
for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or
whereabouts of the minor.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â â€œMinorâ€ means any unemancipated person under the age of 18 years.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â â€œNonsecured custodyâ€ means custody in an unlocked multipurpose area,
such as a lobby, office or interrogation room that is not designed, set aside,
or used as a secure detention area, and the person arrested is not physically
secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically
accompanied by a law enforcement officer or a person employed by the facility
where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to
providing nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate
juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the personâ€™s
parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but
not for longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or
magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of
time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â â€œPublic placeâ€ includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds,
streets, alleys, and sidewalks dedicated to public use and also includes such
parts of buildings and other premises, whether publicly or privately owned,
that are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited
commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is
permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has
access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is
considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â â€œResponsible adultâ€ means a parent, guardian or other adult
specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have
custody or control of a minor.
2.Â Â Â Curfew Established. It is unlawful for any minor to be or remain upon any
of the alleys, streets, or public places or to be in places of business and
amusement in the City between the hours of 10:30 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. of the
following day on days commencing on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and
Thursday and between the hours of 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. on Friday and

3.Â Â Â Exceptions. The following are exceptions to the curfew:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The minor is accompanied by a responsible adult.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The minor is on the sidewalk or property where the minor resides or on
either side of the place where the minor resides and the adult responsible for
the minor has given permission for the minor to be there.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The minor is present at or is traveling between home and one of the
following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Minorâ€™s place of employment in a business, trade or occupation in
which the minor is permitted by law to be engaged or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of work;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Minorâ€™s place of religious activity or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of the religious activity;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Governmental or political activity or, if traveling, within one
hour after the end or before the beginning of the activity;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â School activity or, if traveling, within one hour after the end or

the U.S. Constitution guarantees of free exercise of religion, freedom of
speech, freedom of assembly or, if traveling, within one hour after the end or
before the beginning of the activity.

Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The minor is engaged in interstate travel through the City beginning,
ending or passing through the City when such travel is by direct route.
4.Â Â Â Responsibility of Adults. It is unlawful for any responsible adult
knowingly to permit or to allow a minor to be in any public place in the City

falls within one of the above exceptions.
5.Â Â Â Enforcement Procedures.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in the
absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driverâ€™s license,
a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance, use his
or her best judgment in determining age.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody. Grounds for arrest are that
the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in
violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to
identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the personâ€™s
own safety or to the safety of the public. A law enforcement officer who
arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in
a shelter care facility or in any nonsecured setting. The officer shall not
place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor
physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into
custody. A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into custody,
the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the minor as
soon as possible. The minor shall be released to the adult responsible for the
minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at such
time as the court may direct.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer
determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law
enforcement officer cannot locate the minorâ€™s parent, guardian or other person
legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the
law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative
of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person
who is known to the child.
6.Â Â Â Penalties.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Responsible Adultâ€™s First Violation. In the case of a first violation
by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall, by certified mail, send to the
adult responsible for the minor, written notice of the violation with a warning
that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew
ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with applicable
penalties.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Responsible Adultâ€™s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as defined
in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows the minor
to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a municipal
infraction.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Minorâ€™s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a minor,
the law enforcement officer shall give the minor a written warning, which
states that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the
curfew ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with applicable
penalties, or, at the law enforcement officerâ€™s discretion, may issue the minor
a citation for a first violation.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Minorâ€™s Second Violation. For the minorâ€™s second and subsequent
violations of any of the provisions of this section, the minor is guilty of a
municipal infraction.
46.02Â Â Â CIGARETTES AND TOBACCO.

purchase, or attempt to purchase any tobacco, tobacco products, alternative
nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes. Possession of tobacco,
tobacco products, alternative nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes
by an individual under 21 years of age shall not constitute a violation of this

products, alternative nicotine products, vapor products, or cigarettes as part
of the personâ€™s employment and said person is employed by a person who holds a
valid permit under Chapter 453A of the Code of Iowa or who lawfully offers for

  in fact exist. If compliance is not secured following notice and hearings, we
  recommend you review the situation with your attorney before proceeding with

accordance with the following:
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)
1.Â Â Â Notice. The Clerk shall notify each delinquent customer that service will
be discontinued or disconnected if payment of the combined service account,
including late payment charges, is not received by the date specified in the
notice of delinquency. Such notice shall be sent by ordinary mail to the
customer in whose name the delinquent charges were incurred and shall inform
the customer of the nature of the delinquency and afford the customer the
opportunity for a hearing prior to the discontinuance or disconnection. If a
24- hour notice is posted at the property, the customer will be assessed a
$15.00 disconnect fee.
2.Â Â Â Notice to Landlords. If the customer is a tenant, and if the owner or
landlord of the property or premises has made a written request for notice, the
notice of delinquency shall also be given to the owner or landlord. If the
customer is a tenant and requests a change of name for service under the
account, such request shall be sent to the owner or landlord of the property if
the owner or landlord has made a written request for notice of any change of
name for service under the account to the rental property.
3.Â Â Â Hearing. If a hearing is requested by noon of the day preceding the shut
off, the City Administrator shall conduct an informal hearing and shall make a
determination as to whether the discontinuance or disconnection is justified.
The customer has the right to appeal the City Administratorâ€™s decision to the
Council, and if the Council finds that discontinuance or disconnection is
justified, then such discontinuance or disconnection shall be made, unless
payment has been received.
4.Â Â Â Fees. A fee of $30.00 during regular office hours or $75.00 after regular

92.07Â Â Â LIEN EXEMPTION.Â Â 
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84)

charges for water service to a residential or commercial rental property where
water service is separately metered and the rates or charges for the water
service are paid directly to the City by the tenant, if the landlord gives
written notice to the City that the property is residential or commercial
rental property and that the tenant is liable for the rates or charges. The
City may require a deposit not exceeding the usual cost of 90 days of such
services to be paid to the City. When the tenant moves from the rental

93.01Â Â Â PURPOSE.
It is the purpose of this ordinance to protect the health, safety, and general
welfare of the people of the City by ensuring that the ground waters will not
be polluted or contaminated. Due to the serious potential of adverse
environmental impacts, this chapter will prohibit all open loop geothermal
systems. It is also the intent of this chapter to allow for closed loop systems
with the requirements contained in this chapter for the construction,

rock that will yield usable quantities of water to a well.
3.Â Â Â â€œBoreholeâ€ means a hole drilled or bored into the earth, usually for
exploratory or economic purposes; a hole into which casing, screen and other
materials may be installed to construct a well.
4.Â Â Â â€œCasingâ€ means an impervious, durable pipe placed in a borehole to prevent
the walls of the borehole from caving, and to seal off surface drainage or
undesirable water, gas, or other fluids and prevent entrance into a well.
5.Â Â Â â€œDrinking waterâ€ means water which is intended for human consumption and
other domestic uses, and is considered to be free of harmful chemicals and
disease-causing microorganisms.
6.Â Â Â â€œGeothermal boreholeâ€ means a hole drilled or bored into the earth into
which piping is inserted for use in a geothermal system.
7.Â Â Â â€œGeothermal systemâ€ means a geothermal system uses the Earthâ€™s thermal
propertied in conjunction with electricity to provide greater efficiency in the
heating and cooling of buildings. Geothermal system, a mechanism for heat
exchange which consists of the following basic elements: Underground loops of
piping; heat transfer fluid; a heat pump; an air distribution system. An
opening is made in the Earth. A series of pipes are installed into the opening
and connected to a heat exchange system in the building. The pipes form a
â€œclosed loopâ€ and are filled with a heat transfer fluid. The fluid is
circulated through the piping from the opening into the heat exchanger and
back. The system functions in the same manner as the open loop system except
there is no pumping of ground water.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Open Loop Geothermal System. Ground water is pumped from a water well
into a heat exchanger located in a surface building. The water drawn from the
Earth is then pumped back into the aquifer through a different well or, in some
cases, the same well; otherwise known as re-injection. Alternatively, the
ground water could be discharged to a surface water body also known as pump and
dump. In the heating mode, cooler water is returned to the Earth, while in the
cooling mode warmer water is returned to the surface water body.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Closed Vertical Loop or Horizontal Geothermal System. A borehole
extends beneath the surface. Pipes are installed with U-bends at the bottom of
the borehole. The pipes are connected to the heat exchanger and heat transfer
fluid is circulated through the pipes.

between the wall of the borehole and the casing of a well and or emplaced on
the wall of the borehole. The emplacement of grout is to prevent the migration
of water or fluid contaminants into and through the borehole. Grout shall
consist of neat cement, high solids bentonite slurry, or hydrated bentonite
chips.
10.Â Â Â â€œHeat exchangerâ€ means a device usually made of coils of pipe that
transfers heat from one medium to another; for example, from water to air or
water to water.

system that is located more than 20 feet below the ground surface.
14.Â Â Â â€œMinor geothermal systemâ€ means a horizontal closed loop system that is
placed no more than 20 feet below the ground surface.
15.Â Â Â â€œPermeabilityâ€ means the propensity of a material to allow fluid to move
through its pores or interstices. Permeability is an important soil parameter
when flow of water through soil or rock is a matter of concern.

contamination from a surface drinking water source, a ground water source
supply well, or any type of borehole.
17.Â Â Â â€œSurface waterâ€ means water located on the surface of the Earth in water
bodies such as lakes, rivers, streams, ponds, and reservoirs.
18.Â Â Â â€œTremieâ€ means a tubing string (typically about two to three inches in
diameter) that is temporarily installed into the borehole during well
construction. The tremie pipe is used for installing annular material such as
filter pack sand and grout.
19.Â Â Â â€œWater supply wellâ€ means a well used by public water systems, or non-
public use, for extracting ground water for human consumption.
20.Â Â Â â€œWellâ€ means any excavation that is drilled, cored, driven, dug, bored,
augured, jetted, washed or is otherwise construction for the purpose of
exploring for ground water, monitoring ground water, utilizing the geothermal
properties of the ground, or extracting water from or injecting water into the
aquifer. â€œWellâ€ does not include an open ditch, drain tiles, an excavation made
for obtaining or prospecting for oil, natural gas, minerals, or products mined
or quarried, lateral geothermal heat exchange systems nor temporary dewatering
wells such as those used during the construction of subsurface facilities only

Superintendent. Solvent-welded joints are not permitted.
12.Â Â Â Unstable Soil. No sewer connection shall be laid so that it is exposed
when crossing any watercourse. Where an old watercourse must of necessity be
crossed or where there is any danger of undermining or settlement, cast iron
soil pipe or vitrified clay sewer pipe thoroughly encased in concrete shall be
required for such crossings. Such encasement shall extend at least six inches
on all sides of the pipe. The cast iron pipe or encased clay pipe shall rest on
firm, solid material at either end.
13.Â Â Â Preparation of Basement or Crawl Space. No connection for any residence,
business or other structure with any sanitary sewer shall be made unless the
basement floor is poured, or in the case of a building with a slab or crawl
space, unless the ground floor is installed with the area adjacent to the
foundation of such building cleared of debris and backfilled. The backfill
shall be well compacted and graded so that the drainage is away from the
foundation. Prior to the time the basement floor is poured, or the first floor
is installed in buildings without basements, the sewer shall be plugged and the

ownerâ€™s expense and shall be kept in continuously efficient operations at all
times.
96.07Â Â Â SEWER TAP.
Connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the â€œYâ€
branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If no properly
located â€œYâ€ branch is available, a saddle â€œYâ€ shall be installed at the
location specified by the Superintendent. The public sewer shall be tapped with
a tapping machine and a saddle appropriate to the type of public sewer shall be
glued or attached with a gasket and stainless steel clamps to the sewer. At no
time shall a building sewer be constructed so as to enter a manhole unless
special written permission is received from the Superintendent and in
accordance with the Superintendentâ€™s direction if such connection is approved.
96.08Â Â Â INSPECTION REQUIRED.
All connections with the sanitary sewer system before being covered shall be
inspected and approved, in writing, by the Superintendent. As soon as all pipe
work from the public sewer to inside the building has been completed, and
before any backfilling is done, the Superintendent shall be notified and the
Superintendent shall inspect and test the work as to workmanship and material;
no sewer pipe laid underground shall be covered or trenches filled until after
the sewer has been so inspected and approved. If the Superintendent refuses to
approve the work, the plumber or owner must proceed immediately to correct the
work.

the ownerâ€™s expense.
97.07Â Â Â CONTROL MANHOLES.
When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the ownerâ€™s
expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
97.08Â Â Â TESTING OF WASTES.
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained
from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHâ€™s are determined from
periodic grab samples.)

111.01Â Â Â FRANCHISE GRANTED.
There is hereby granted to MidAmerican Energy Company, an Iowa corporation,
(hereinafter called the â€œCompanyâ€) the right and non- exclusive franchise to
acquire, construct, erect, maintain, and operate in the City of Sac City, Iowa,
(hereinafter called the â€œCity,â€) a system for the transmission and distribution
of electric energy and communications signals along, under, over and upon the
public streets, avenues, rights-of-way and alleys of the City (collectively
â€œpublic streetâ€ or â€œpublic streetsâ€) to serve customers within and without the
City, and to furnish and sell electric energy to the City and its inhabitants.
For the term of this franchise, the Company is granted the right of eminent
domain, the exercise of which is subject to Council approval upon application
by the Company. This franchise shall be effective for a 20-year period from and
after the effective date of this chapter provided, however, that either the
City or the Company may, during the first 90 days following the fifth, 10th and
15th anniversaries of the effective date of the franchise, provide written
notice to the other party of its desire to amend the franchise. The parties may
negotiate for a period of up to 90 days following the receipt of notice. If at
the conclusion of the negotiation period, the City determines in good faith
that the franchise, if continue without amendment, will have a material or
significant adverse impact on the City or the Companyâ€™s customers located
within the corporate limits of the City, the City may terminate the franchise.
The City shall have the burden to objectively determine the material or
significant adverse impact. Failure to amend the franchise on the option dates
does not render invalid the Cityâ€™s additional date options to amend or
terminate. If neither party requests such negotiations at year five, year 10,
or year 15, the franchise will continue through the conclusion from its initial
approval date. â€ 
Â 
Notes
â€â€  EDITORâ€™S NOTE: Ordinance No. 2020-306, adopting an electric system for the
  City, was passed, and adopted on July 14, 2020.
111.02Â Â Â RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES.
The rights and privileges hereby granted are subject to the restrictions and
limitations of Chapter 364 of the Code of Iowa, from time to time. Further, the

regarding reporting.
111.03Â Â Â PLACEMENT OF APPLIANCES.
The Company shall have the right to erect all necessary poles on public streets
and to place thereon the necessary wires, fixtures, and accessories as well as
to excavate and bury conduits or conductors in public streets for the
distribution of electric energy and communications signals in and through the
City, provided (i) the same shall be placed in accord with this franchise and
the regulations of the City, regarding the placement of equipment, structures,
facilities, accessories, or other objects in the public streets, including
ordinances that assign corridors or other placements to users of the right-of-
way and ordinances that may be adopted regarding separation of structures,
facilities, accessories, or other objects: (ii) the same shall be so placed as
not to unreasonably interfere with any above or below-ground utility services
or facilities that have been or may hereafter be located by or under authority
of the City; and (iii) the same shall be placed, when possibly and reasonable,
underground.
111.04Â Â Â CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE.
The Company shall, excluding facilities located in private easements (whether
titled in the Company exclusively or in the Company and other entities), in
accordance with Iowa law, including the Companyâ€™s tariff on file with and made
effective by the Iowa Utilities Board as may subsequently be amended
(â€œtariffâ€), at its cost and expense, locate and relocate its existing
facilities or equipment in, on, over, or under any public street in the City in
such a manner as the City may reasonably require for the purposes of
facilitating the use, construction, reconstruction, maintenance, or repair of
the public street or other public improvement. If the City has a reasonable
alternative route for the public street, or a reasonable alternative
construction method, that would not cause the relocation of Company
installations or would minimize the cost or expense of relocation of Company
installations, the City and the Company shall work together to consider said
alternative route or construction method. The City shall, in the extension or
modification of public streets, make provision for the placement of Company
service lines and facilities in, on, over, or under those public streets
without charge to the Company. In planning for the extension or modification of
public streets, the City shall, to the extent practicable design such changes
to limit the need for relocation of Company facilities. The City shall be
responsible for surveying and staking the public streets for City projects that
require the Company to relocate Company facilities. If requested, the City
shall provide, at no cost to the Company, copies of its relocation plan and
profile and cross section drawings. If tree/vegetation removal must be

be responsible for said removals. If the timing of tree/vegetation removal does
not coincide with the Companyâ€™s facilities relocation schedule and the Company
must remove tree/vegetation that are included in the Cityâ€™s portion of the
project, the City shall either remove tree/vegetation at its cost or reimburse
the Company for the reasonable expenses incurred to remove said tree/
vegetation. If project funds from a source other than the City are available to
pay for the relocation of utility facilities, the City shall attempt to secure
said funds and provide them to the Company to compensate the Company for the
costs of relocation.
111.05Â Â Â EXCAVATION.
All facilities and equipment comprising the Companyâ€™s electric distribution
system and located in the public streets shall be located so as to reasonably
cause minimum interference with the proper use of the public streets and to
cause minimum interference with reasonable rights or convenience of property
owners who adjoin the public streets. In making excavations in any public
streets for the installation, maintenance, or repair of conductors, conduits or
the erection of poles, wires, or other appliances, the Company shall not
unreasonably obstruct the use of the public streets. The Company in making such
excavations shall, if required by ordinance, obtain a City permit therefore and
provide City representatives with advance notice prior to the actual
commencement of the work. In emergencies that require immediate excavation, the
Company may proceed with the work without first applying for or obtaining the
permit, provided, however, that the Company shall apply for and obtain the
excavation permit as soon as possible after commencing such emergency work. The
Company shall comply with all provisions and requirements of the City in its
regulation of the use of public streets in performing all work. The Company
shall also comply with all City ordinances regarding paving cuts, placement of
facilities, and restoration of pavement, and other public infrastructure. In
the event of an excavation, the Company shall, in a commercially reasonable
manner approved by the City, replace the surface of the public street,
restoring the public street to the condition as existed prior to the Companyâ€™s
excavation. However, the Company shall not be required to improve or modify the
public streets, or other areas adjacent to the Company project to a condition
superior to its immediate previously existing condition, except that any
replacement of any surface shall conform to current City Code regarding its
depth and composition. The Company shall complete all repairs in a timely
manner. In the event that the Company does not timely comply with its
obligations under this section after receiving at least 48 hoursâ€™ notice from
the City, barring weather or other outside interferences, the City may perform
the work and recover its actual, verified cost from the Company upon notice to
the Company.
111.06Â Â Â UTILITY EASEMENT.
The Cityâ€™s vacation of a public street shall not deprive the Company of its
right to operate and maintain existing facilities on, below, above, or beneath
the vacated property. Prior to the City vacating any public street, where the
Company has facilities, the City shall provide the Company with not less than
30 daysâ€™ advance notice of the Cityâ€™s proposed action, and upon request, grant
the Company an utility easement covering existing and future facilities and
activities.
111.07Â Â Â RELOCATION NOT REQUIRED.
For five years after the Company has initiated construction to relocate, at its
costs and expense, Company facilities or equipment in a public street at the
direction of the City, the Company shall not be required to relocate, at its
cost and expense, Company facilities or equipment within the same portion of
the public street.
111.08Â Â Â RELOCATION REIMBURSEMENT.
If the City orders or requests the Company to relocate its existing facilities
or equipment in order to directly facilitate private portion of a project of a
commercial or private developer or other non-public entity, the City shall

145.01Â Â Â ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.
The Zoning Administrator is responsible for the enforcement of this chapter.
145.02Â Â Â GENERAL DEFINITION OF UNSAFE.
All buildings or structures that are structurally unsafe or not provided with
adequate egress, or that constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise dangerous
to human life, or that in relation to existing use constitute a hazard to
safety or health, or public welfare, by reason of inadequate maintenance,
dilapidation, obsolescence, or abandonment, are, for the purpose of this
chapter, unsafe buildings. All such unsafe buildings are hereby declared to be
public nuisances and shall be abated by repair, rehabilitation, demolition, or
removal in accordance with the procedure specified in this chapter.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 657A.1 and 364.12[3a])
145.03Â Â Â UNSAFE BUILDING.
â€œUnsafe buildingâ€ means any structure or mobile home meeting any or all of the
following criteria:
1.Â Â Â Various Inadequacies. Whenever the building or structure, or any portion
thereof, because of: (i) dilapidation, deterioration, or decay; (ii) faulty
construction; (iii) the removal, movement, or instability of any portion of the
ground necessary for the purpose of supporting such building; (iv) the
deterioration, decay, or inadequacy of its foundation; or (v) any other cause,
is likely to partially or completely collapse.
2.Â Â Â Manifestly Unsafe. Whenever, for any reason, the building or structure, or
any portion thereof, is manifestly unsafe for the purpose for which it is being
used.
3.Â Â Â Inadequate Maintenance. Whenever a building or structure, used or intended
to be used for dwelling purposes, because of dilapidation, decay, damage,
faulty construction, or otherwise, is determined by any health officer to be
unsanitary, unfit for human habitation or in such condition that it is likely
to cause sickness or disease.
4.Â Â Â Fire Hazard. Whenever any building or structure, because of dilapidated
condition, deterioration, damage, or other cause, is determined by the Fire
Marshal or Fire Chief to be a fire hazard.
5.Â Â Â Abandoned. Whenever any portion of a building or structure remains on a
site after the demolition or destruction of the building or structure or
whenever any building or structure is abandoned for a period in excess of six
months so as to constitute such building or portion thereof an attractive
nuisance or hazard to the public.
145.04Â Â Â NOTICE TO OWNER.
The enforcement officer shall examine or cause to be examined every building or
structure or portion thereof reported as dangerous or damaged and, if such is
found to be an unsafe building as defined in this chapter, the enforcement
officer shall give to the owner of such building or structure written notice
stating the defects thereof. This notice may require the owner or person in
charge of the building or premises, within 48 hours or such reasonable time as
the circumstances require, to commence either the required repairs or
improvements or demolition and removal of the building or structure or portions
thereof, and all such work shall be completed within 90 days from date of
notice, unless otherwise stipulated by the enforcement officer. If necessary,
such notice shall also require the building, structure, or portion thereof to
be vacated forthwith and not reoccupied until the required repairs and
improvements are completed, inspected, and approved by the enforcement officer.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[3h])
1.Â Â Â Notice Served. Such notice shall be served by sending by certified mail to
the owner of record, according to Section 364.12[3h] of the Code of Iowa, if
the owner is found within the City limits. If the owner is not found within the
City limits, such service may be made upon the owner by registered mail or
certified mail. The designated period within which said owner or person in
charge is required to comply with the order of the enforcement officer shall
begin as of the date the owner receives such notice.
2.Â Â Â Hearing. Such notice shall also advise the owner that he or she may
request a hearing before the Council on the notice by filing a written request
for hearing within the time provided in the notice.
145.05Â Â Â CONDUCT OF HEARING.
If requested, the Council shall conduct a hearing in accordance with the
following:
1.Â Â Â Notice. The owner shall be served with written notice specifying the date,

  recommend you review the situation with your attorney before initiating
  procedures and follow his or her recommendation carefully.
145.06Â Â Â POSTING OF SIGNS.
The enforcement officer shall cause to be posted at each entrance to such
building a notice to read: â€œDO NOT ENTER. UNSAFE TO OCCUPY. CITY OF SAC CITY,

or repairs are completed. Such notice shall not be removed without written
permission of the enforcement officer and no person shall enter the building
except for the purpose of making the required repairs or of demolishing the
building.
145.07Â Â Â RIGHT TO DEMOLISH; MUNICIPAL INFRACTION.
In case the owner fails, neglects, or refuses to comply with the notice to
repair, rehabilitate, or to demolish and remove the building or structure or
portion thereof, the Council may order the owner of the building prosecuted as
a violator of the provisions of this chapter and may order the enforcement
officer to proceed with the work specified in such notice. A statement of the
cost of such work shall be transmitted to the Council. As an alternative to
this action, the City may utilize the municipal infraction process to abate the
nuisance.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[3h])
145.08Â Â Â COSTS.
Costs incurred under Section
145.07 shall be paid out of the City treasury. Such costs shall be charged to
the owner of the premises involved and levied as a special assessment against
the land on which the building or structure is located, and shall be certified
to the County Treasurer for collection in the manner provided for other taxes.
In addition, the City may take any other action deemed appropriate to recover
costs incurred.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.12[3h])
145.09Â Â Â COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL NONCONFORMANCE MITIGATION.
By petition of the Planning and Zoning Commission, the Council, on agreement to
proceed by four of the five members, may consider alternative public options to
mitigate commercial and industrial property found out of compliance with
Chapter 145 or ordinances as follows:
1.Â Â Â The Council has determined that compliance with the Code of Ordinances
will benefit the general public.
2.Â Â Â The property owner pledge and promise to commit $5.56 per square foot of
building towards the cost of demolition or remediation.

property owner.
5.Â Â Â A commitment by the property owner to be responsible for and in compliance
with federal, State, and local standards, rules, and regulations pertaining to
the proposed demolition or remediation of the non-conforming real estate, as
well as a commitment for and compliance with all necessary permits and on-call
requirements.
6.Â Â Â The property owner must formally acknowledge the real estate is in
violation of Section
145.03.
7.Â Â Â The property owner accepts all liability pertaining to resolution of the
non- conformity.
8.Â Â Â An acknowledgement by the property owner that until resolution on the non-
conformance by remediation or demolition, the ownership of said real estate
shall remain with the owner submitting the plan to the City.
9.Â Â Â In exchange for said commitments, pledges, promises, and agreements upon
the resolution by demolition or remediation, the City will accept transfer of
said real estate to the City, who shall then become the owner thereof.

1Â Â Â Deep and shallow wells, as defined in IAC 567-40.2(455B): A deep well is a
well located and constructed in such a manner that there is a continuous layer
of low permeability soil or rock at least five feet thick located at least 25
feet below the normal ground surface and above the aquifer from which water is
to be drawn. A shallow well is a well located and constructed in such a manner
that there is not a continuous layer of low permeability soil or rock (or
equivalent retarding mechanism acceptable to the department) at least five feet
thick, the top of which is located at least 25 feet below the normal ground
surface and above the aquifer from which water is to be drawn.
2Â Â Â The separation distances are dependent upon two factors: the type of piping
that is in the existing sewer or drain, as noted in the table, and that the
piping was properly installed in accordance with the standards.
3Â Â Â Solid wastes are those derived from the treatment of water or wastewater.
Certain types of solid wastes from water treatment processes may be land-
applied within the separation distance on an individual, case-by-case basis.
4Â Â Â Solid waste means garbage, refuse, rubbish, and other similar discarded
solid or semisolid materials, including but not limited to such materials
resulting from industrial, commercial, agricultural, and domestic activities.

other improvement, was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start
means either the first placement or permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of pile, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a factory-built home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of the building, whether or not that alteration affects
the external dimensions of the building.
32.Â Â Â â€œStructureâ€ means anything constructed or erected on the ground or
attached to the ground, including (but not limited to) buildings, factories,
sheds, cabins, factory-built homes, storage tanks, grain storage facilities,
and/or other similar uses.
33.Â Â Â â€œSubstantial damageâ€ means damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred. Volunteer labor and donated materials shall be included in
the estimated cost of repair.
34.Â Â Â â€œSubstantial improvementâ€ means any improvement to a structure which
satisfies either of the following criteria:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either:
(i) before the start of construction of the improvement; or (ii) if the
structure has been substantially damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred.
The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure
to correct existing violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety
code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
The term also does not include any alteration of a historic structure, provided
the alteration will not preclude the structureâ€™s designation as a historic
structure.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Any addition which increases the original floor area of a building by
25 percent or more. All additions constructed after the effective date of the
first floodplain management regulations adopted by the community shall be added
to any proposed addition in determining whether the total increase in original
floor space would exceed 25 percent.
35.Â Â Â â€œVarianceâ€ means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of the
floodplain management regulations.
36.Â Â Â â€œViolationâ€ means the failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with the communityâ€™s floodplain management regulations.
160.02Â Â Â STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSE.
1.Â Â Â The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 414, Code of Iowa, as
amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure
safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare.
2.Â Â Â Findings of Fact.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation
which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by:
(i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages
which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or
otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of
Natural Resources.
3.Â Â Â Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and
preserve the rights, privileges, and property of the City and its residents and
to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and
convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in
Subsection 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows so
that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights
or velocities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction or substantial improvement.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
160.03Â Â Â GENERAL PROVISIONS.

Fringe, General Floodplain, and Shallow Flooding (Overlay) Districts, as
established in Section
160.05 of this chapter..
2.Â Â Â Establishment of Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The Flood Insurance Rate
Maps (FIRM) for Sac County and Incorporated Areas, City of Sac City, Panels
19161C0217C and 19161C0236C, dated June 1, 2022, which were prepared as part of
the Flood Insurance Study for Sac County are hereby adopted by reference and
declared to be the Official Floodplain Zoning Map. The Sac County Flood
Insurance Study is hereby adopted by reference and is made a part of this
chapter for the purpose of administering floodplain management regulations. The
flood profiles and all explanatory material contained with the Flood Insurance
Study are also declared to be a part of this chapter.
3.Â Â Â Rules for Interpretation of District Boundaries. The boundaries of the
zoning district areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the Official
Floodplain Zoning Map. When an interpretation is needed as to the exact
location of a boundary, the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it
is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
4.Â Â Â Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used, and no structure
shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered, without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
5.Â Â Â Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provision of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with
this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
6.Â Â Â Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
7.Â Â Â Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this
chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does
not imply that areas outside the designated Floodplain (Overlay) District areas

160.05Â Â Â ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING (OVERLAY) DISTRICTS.
The floodplain areas within the jurisdiction of this chapter are hereby divided
into the following districts:
1.Â Â Â Floodway (Overlay) District (FW) â€“ those areas identified as Floodway on
the Official Floodplain Zoning Map.
2.Â Â Â Floodway Fringe (Overlay) District (FF) â€“ those areas identified as Zone
AE on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map but excluding those areas identified
as Floodway.
3.Â Â Â General Floodplain (Overlay) District (GF) â€“ those areas identified as
Zone A on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map.
The boundaries shall be as shown on the Official Floodplain Zoning Map. Within
these districts, all uses not allowed as permitted uses are prohibited unless a
variance to the terms of this chapter is granted after due consideration by the
Board of Adjustment.
160.06Â Â Â FLOODWAY (OVERLAY) DISTRICT (FW).
1.Â Â Â Permitted Uses. All development within the Floodway District shall be
permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance (or
underlying zoning district) and provided they meet applicable performance
standards of the Floodway District.
2.Â Â Â Performance Standards. All Floodway District uses allowed as a permitted
use shall meet the following standards.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No development shall be permitted in the Floodway District that would
result in any increase in the base flood elevation. Consideration of the
effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption
that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly situated
lands.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All development within the Floodway District shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â No development shall affect the capacity or conveyance of the channel
or floodway of any tributary to the main stream, drainage ditch, or any other
drainage facility or system.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Structures, buildings, recreational vehicles, and sanitary and utility
systems, if permitted, shall meet the applicable performance standards of the
Floodway Fringe District, and shall be constructed or aligned to present the
minimum possible resistance to flood flows.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Structures, if permitted, shall have a low flood damage potential and
shall not be for human habitation.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Storage of materials or equipment that are buoyant, flammable,
explosive or injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited. Storage of
other material may be allowed if readily removable from the Floodway District
within the time available after flood warning.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Watercourse alterations or relocations (channel changes and
modifications) must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within
the altered or relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations
must be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Any fill allowed in the floodway must be shown to have some beneficial
purpose and shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Pipeline river or stream crossings shall be buried in the streambed and
banks or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due to channel
degradation and meandering or due to the action of flood flows.
160.07Â Â Â FLOODWAY FRINGE (OVERLAY) DISTRICT FF.
1.Â Â Â Permitted Uses. All development within the Floodway Fringe District shall
be permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance
(or underlying zoning district) and provided they meet applicable performance
standards of the Floodway Fringe District.
2.Â Â Â Performance Standards. All development must be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance standards.
Where base flood elevation data has not been provided on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to
compute such data. Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no development
may increase the base flood elevation more than one foot. The applicant will be
responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient
technical information to make such determination.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All development shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Be designed and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant
to flood damage.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum
of one foot above the base flood elevation. Construction shall be upon
compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the
base flood elevation and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the
limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such
as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed where existing topography,
street grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the
methods used must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the
various forces and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential
structures located in areas that would become isolated due to flooding of
surrounding ground shall be provided with a means of access that will be
passable by wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this criterion
shall not apply where the Floodplain Administrator determines there is
sufficient flood warning time for the protection of life and property. When
estimating flood warning time, consideration shall be given to the criteria
listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa Administrative Code.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with
attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level. When
floodproofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State of
Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are adequate to
withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and
other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the
base flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any
structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Floodplain
Administrator.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including
basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, and
low damage potential storage
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.

flood elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â New and substantially improved structures shall be constructed with
plumbing, gas lines, water meters, gas meters, and other similar service
utilities either elevated (or in the case of non- residential structures,
optionally floodproofed to) a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation or designed to be watertight and withstand inundation to such a
level.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Factory-Built Homes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â All factory-built homes, including those placed in existing
factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be elevated on a permanent
foundation such that the lowest floor of the structure is a minimum of one foot
above the base flood elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All factory-built homes, including those placed in existing
factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be anchored to resist
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but
are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
Anchorage systems may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or
frame ties to ground anchors as required by the State Building Code.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Utility and Sanitary Systems.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located or
designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system
during flooding.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system as well
as the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment facilities
(other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood protection
equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water
supply treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with
a level of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the base flood
elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk
associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Storage of Equipment and Materials. Storage of equipment and materials
that are flammable, explosive, or injurious to human, animal, or plant life is
prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood
elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or:
(i) not subject to major flood damage and anchored to prevent movement due to
flood waters; or (ii) readily removable from the area within the time available
after flood warning.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as
levees, flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the base
flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for
adequate interior drainage. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources
shall approve structural flood control works.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must be
designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion. In addition, the Department of Natural Resources must
approve such alterations or relocations.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Subdivision. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and
subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation
of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this
chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all
lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during
the base flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50 lots
(whichever is less) shall include base flood elevation data for those areas
located within the Floodplain (Overlay) District.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Accessory Structures to Residential Uses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Detached garages, sheds, and similar structures that are incidental
to a residential use are exempt from the base flood elevation requirements
where the following criteria are satisfied:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential. Its size shall not exceed 600 square feet in size. Those portions of
the structure located less than one foot above the base flood elevation must be
constructed of flood-resistant materials.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage potential
purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure shall not
be used for human habitation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building
site so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The structure shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The structureâ€™s service facilities such as electrical and heating

registered in the State of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods
used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact
and uplift forces and other factors associated with the 0.2 percent annual
chance flood; and that the structure, below the 0.2 percent chance flood
elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water. A record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in
relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the Floodplain Administrator. Where a 0.2
percent chance flood elevation data has not been provided in the Flood
Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to
compute such data. The applicant will be responsible for providing the
Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make
such determinations.
160.08Â Â Â GENERAL FLOODPLAIN (OVERLAY) DISTRICT FP.
1.Â Â Â Permitted Uses.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All development within the General Floodplain District shall be
permitted to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance (or
underlying zoning district) and provided they meet the applicable performance
standards of the General Floodplain District.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Any development which involves placement of structures, factory-built
homes, fill or other obstructions, storage of materials or equipment,
excavation or alteration of a watercourse shall be reviewed by the Department
of Natural Resources to determine: (i) whether the land involved is either
wholly or partly within the floodway or floodway fringe; and (ii) the base
flood elevation. The applicant shall be responsible for providing the
Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make
the determination.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Review by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources is not required for
the proposed construction of new or replacement bridges or culverts where:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The bridge or culvert is located on a stream that drains less than
two square miles, and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The bridge or culvert is not associated with a channel modification
that constitutes a channel change as specified in 567- 71.2(2b) Iowa
Administrative Code.
2.Â Â Â Performance Standards.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â All development, or portions thereof, to be located in the floodway as
determined by the Department of Natural Resources shall meet the applicable
provisions and standards of the Floodway (Overlay) District (Section
160.06).
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All development, or portions thereof, to be located in the floodway
fringe as determined by the Department of Natural Resources shall meet the
applicable provisions and standards of the Floodway Fringe (Overlay) District
(Section
160.07).
160.09Â Â Â APPOINTMENT AND DUTIES OF BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
The Board of Adjustment, hereinafter referred to as the Board, shall hear and
decide: (i) appeals; and (ii) requests for variances to the provisions of this
chapter, and shall take any other action which is required of the Board.
1.Â Â Â Appeals. Where it is alleged that there is any error in any order,
requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in
the enforcement of this chapter, the aggrieved party may appeal such action.
The notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board and with the official from
whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason for the
appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to the Board
all the documents constituting the record upon which the action appealed from
was taken.
2.Â Â Â Variance. The Board may authorize upon request in specific cases such
variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances
granted must meet the following applicable standards.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood would result. Consideration of
the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly
situated lands.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection
for structures than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the applicant
shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Floodplain Administrator
that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance
coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the
Department of Natural Resources.
3.Â Â Â Hearings and Decisions of the Board.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Hearings. Upon the filing with the Board of an appeal or a request for
a variance, the Board shall hold a public hearing. The Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the hearing and give public notice thereof, as well as due
notice to parties in interest. At the hearing, any party may appear in person
or by agent or attorney and present written or oral evidence. The Board may
require the appellant or applicant to provide such information as is reasonably
deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or evaluation of
a professional engineer or other expert person or agency, including the
Department of Natural Resources.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal or
variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an appeal, the Board may, so
long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter,
reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in
writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision.
In granting a variance, the Board shall consider such factors as contained in
this section and all other relevant sections of this chapter and may prescribe
such conditions as contained in Subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board Shall Be Based. In
passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all relevant
factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability
of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the City.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â h.Â Â Â The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development
and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â i.Â Â Â The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for the area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â j.Â Â Â The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â k.Â Â Â The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â l.Â Â Â The cost of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer,
gas, electrical, and water systems), facilities, streets, and bridges.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â m.Â Â Â Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors
listed above, the Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances
as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such conditions
may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â n.Â Â Â Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â o.Â Â Â Limitation of periods of use and operation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â p.Â Â Â Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed
restrictions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â q.Â Â Â Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes,
levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the
Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative
to achieving the purpose of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â r.Â Â Â Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the
flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration,
rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated
with the regulatory flood. The Board shall require that the applicant submit a
plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the
floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection
elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
4.Â Â Â Appeals to the Court. Any person or persons, jointly or severally,
aggrieved by any decision of the Board may present to a court of record a
petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole
or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be
presented to the court within 30 days after the filing of the decision in the
office of the Board.
160.10Â Â Â NONCONFORMING USES.
1.Â Â Â A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before
the passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but which
is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be continued

flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50 percent of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless it is
reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
State or local health, sanitary, building, or safety codes or regulations, or
the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
designation.
3.Â Â Â Except as provided in Subsection 1(B) of this section, any use which has
been permitted as a variance shall be considered a conforming use.
160.11Â Â Â PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with grants of variances) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any
person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its
requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $500.00 or
imprisoned for not more than 30 days. Each day such violation continues shall
be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained prevent the City

Â 
167.01Â Â Â DEFINITIONS.
As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:
1.Â Â Â â€œAirportâ€ means the Sac City Municipal Airport.
2.Â Â Â â€œAirport elevationâ€ means the highest point of an airportâ€™s usable landing
area measured in feet above mean sea level, which elevation is established to
be 1,250 feet.
3.Â Â Â â€œAirport hazardâ€ means any structure or tree or use of land that would
exceed the federal obstruction standards as contained in 14 CFR 77.21, 77.23,
and 77.25, and that obstructs the airspace required for the flight of aircraft
and landing or takeoff at an airport or is otherwise hazardous to such landing
or taking off of aircraft.
4.Â Â Â â€œAirport primary surfaceâ€ means a surface longitudinally centered on a
runway. When the runway has a specially prepared hard surface, the primary
surface extends 200 feet beyond each end of that runway. The width of the
primary surface of a runway will be that width prescribed in Part 77 of the
Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) for the most precise approach existing or
planned for either end of that runway. The elevation of any point on the
primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway
centerline.
5.Â Â Â â€œAirspace heightâ€ means for the purpose of determining the height limits
in all zones set forth in this chapter and shown on the Zoning Map, the datum
shall be mean sea level elevation unless otherwise specified.
6.Â Â Â â€œControl zoneâ€ means airspace extending upward from the surface of the
earth, which zone may include one or more airports and is normally a circular
area of five statute miles in radius, with extensions where necessary to
include instrument approach and departure paths.
7.Â Â Â â€œInstrument runwayâ€ means a runway having an existing instrument approach
procedure utilizing air navigation facilities or area type navigation
equipment, for which an instrument approach procedure has been approved or
planned.
8.Â Â Â â€œMinimum descent altitudeâ€ means the lowest altitude expressed in feet
above mean sea level, to which descent is authorized on final approach or
during circle-to-land maneuvering in execution of a standard instrument
approach procedure, where no electronic glide slope is provided.
9.Â Â Â â€œMinimum en route altitudeâ€ means the altitude in effect between radio

167.02Â Â Â AIRPORT ZONES AND AIRSPACE HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.
In order to carry out the provisions of this section, there are hereby created
and established certain zones that are depicted on the Municipal Airport Height
Zoning Map. A structure located in more than one zone of the following zones is
considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitations.
The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
1.Â Â Â Horizontal Zone. The land lying under a horizontal plane 150 feet above
the established elevations, the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging
by:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Visual Runway and Non-Precision Instrument Utility Runways. Swinging
arcs of 5,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of
runways 14 and 32 and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those
arcs.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Instrument Runway/Non-Precision, Larger than Utility. Swinging arcs of
10,000 feet radii form the center of each end of primary surface of runways 18
and 36 and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs.
(Note: The radius of the arc specified for each end of a runway will have the
same arithmetical value. The value will be the highest determined for either
end of the runway. When a 5,000-foot arc is encompassed by tangents connecting
two adjacent 10,000-foot arcs, the 5,000-foot arc shall be disregarded on the
construction of the perimeter of the horizontal surface.)
No structure shall exceed 150 feet above the established airport elevation in
the horizontal zone, as depicted on the Municipal Airport Height Zoning Map.
2.Â Â Â Conical Zone. The land lying under a surface extending outward and upward
from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20 feet to one for a
horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. No structure shall penetrate the conical
surface in the conical zone, as depicted on the Municipal Airport Height Zoning
Map.
3.Â Â Â Approach Zone. The land lying under the surface longitudinally centered on
the extended runway centerline and extending outward and upward from each end
of the primary surface.
(Note: An approach surface is applied to each end of each runway based upon the
type of approach available or planned for that runway end.)
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Visual Other Than Utility Runway and Non-Precision Instrument Runway.
The inner edge of the approach surface is:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â 500 feet wide for runways 18 and 36, runways 14 and 32.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Visual Other Than Utility Runways. The outer edge of the approach zone
is:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â 1,500 feet for runways 14 and 18.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â 2,000 feet for runway 31.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â 3,500 feet for runway 36.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The approach zone extends for a horizontal distance of
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â 5,000 feet at a slope of 20 to one for runways 14 and 32.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â 10,000 feet at a slope of 34 to one for runway 36.
No structure shall exceed the approach surface to any runway, as depicted on
the Municipal Airport Height Zoning Map.
4.Â Â Â Transitional Zone. The land lying under those surfaces extending outward
and upward at right angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline
extended at a slope of seven to one from the sides of the primary surface and
from the sides of the approach surfaces. No structures shall exceed the
transitional surface, as depicted on the Municipal Airport Height Zoning Map.
5.Â Â Â Increase in Elevation of Structures. No structure shall be erected in the
County that raises the published minimum descent altitude for an instrument
approach to any runway, nor shall any structure be erected that causes the
minimum obstruction clearance altitude or minimum en route altitude to be
increased on any federal airway in the County.
For the purpose of determining the height limits in all zones set forth in this
chapter and shown on the zoning map, the datum shall be mean sea level
elevation unless otherwise specified.
167.03Â Â Â USE RESTRICTIONS.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of 167.02, no use may be made of land or
water within the City or County in such a manner as to interfere with the
operation of any airborne aircraft. The following special requirements shall
apply to each permitted use:

at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain thereto such markers or
lights as may be necessary to indicate to pilots the presence of an airspace
hazard.
167.05Â Â Â VARIANCES.

for such improvements by the City, and as shown on the approved preliminary
plat.
170.10Â Â Â INSPECTION.
All improvements shall be inspected to insure compliance with the requirements
of this chapter. The cost of such inspection shall be borne by the subdivider
and shall be the actual cost of the inspection to the City.
170.11Â Â Â MINIMUM IMPROVEMENTS.
The improvements set forth below shall be considered the minimum improvements
necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 364.1)
1.Â Â Â Streets and Alleys. All streets and alleys within the platted area which
are dedicated for public use shall be brought to the grade approved by the
Council after receiving the report and recommendations of the City Engineer.
2.Â Â Â Roadways. All roadways shall be surfaced with Portland cement concrete or
with asphaltic concrete over a crushed stone base as the Council may require.
3.Â Â Â Curb and Gutter. Curb and gutter shall be required on all streets. All
curb and gutter shall be constructed to the grade approved by the Council after
receiving the report and recommendations of the City Engineer. Newly
constructed curbs and gutters shall comply with the Americans with Disabilities
Guidelines (ADAAG).
4.Â Â Â Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be required by the Council as they are
considered necessary for the general welfare and safety of the community.
Sidewalks shall be constructed to the grade approved by the Council after
receiving the report and recommendations of the City Engineer.
5.Â Â Â Water lines. Where a public water main is reasonably accessible, the
subdivider shall connect with such water main and provide a water connection
for each lot with service pipe installed to the property line in accordance
with the Water Department standards, procedures, and supervision.
6.Â Â Â Sewers.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where a public sanitary sewer is reasonably accessible, the subdivider
shall connect or provide for the connection with such sanitary sewer and shall
provide within the subdivision the sanitary sewer system as required to make
the sewer accessible to each lot in the subdivision. Sanitary sewer shall be
stubbed into each lot. Sewer systems shall be approved by the Council and the
State Department of Natural Resources and the construction subject to the
supervision of the Superintendent of public utilities.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where sanitary sewers are not available, other facilities, as approved
by the Council, the State Department of Health, and the State Department of
Natural Resources must be provided for the adequate disposal of sanitary
wastes.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â An adequate system shall be installed by the subdivider for the
disposal of stormwaters, including any necessary storm sewer lines, intakes,
holding ponds, etc. The system and all parts of it shall be constructed subject
to the approval of the Council and to the supervision of the Superintendent of
public utilities.
170.12Â Â Â EASEMENTS.
1.Â Â Â Public Utilities. Where alleys are not provided, or where otherwise
required by the present or future placement of public utilities, easements of
not less than 10 feet in width shall be granted by the owner along rear, and
where necessary, alongside lot lines for public utility requirements. Except
where prohibited by topography, such easements shall be centered on lot lines.
Easements of greater width may be required along lot lines, or across lots when
necessary for the placement and maintenance of utilities. No buildings or
structures, except as necessary for utilities, shall be permitted on such
easements.
2.Â Â Â Easements Along Streams and Watercourses. Wherever any stream or surface
watercourse is located in an area that is being subdivided, the subdivider
shall, at said subdividerâ€™s expense, make adequate provisions for the proper
drainage of surface water and shall provide and dedicate to the City an
easement along said stream or watercourse as necessary for the proper
maintenance of the watercourse, and as approved by the City.
170.13Â Â Â COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Before the Council shall approve the final plat, all of the foregoing
improvements shall be constructed and accepted by formal resolution of the
Council. Before passage of the resolution of acceptance, the Superintendent of
Public Works shall report that the improvements meet all City specifications
and ordinances or other City requirements, and the agreements between
subdivider and the City.
170.14Â Â Â PERFORMANCE BOND.
The completion requirement may be waived in whole or in part if the subdivider
will post a performance bond with the Council guaranteeing that improvements
not completed will be constructed within a period of one year from final
acceptance of the plat, but final acceptance of the plat will not constitute
final acceptance by the City of any improvements to be constructed.
Improvements will be accepted only after their construction has been completed,
and no public funds will be expended in the subdivision until such improvements
have been completed and accepted by the City.
170.15Â Â Â MINIMUM STANDARDS.
The following standards shall be considered the minimum standards necessary to
protect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the City.
1.Â Â Â Land Suitability. Land shall not be subdivided if it is found to be
unsuitable for the intended development due to flooding, poor drainage
conditions, adverse soils or geological conditions, unsuitable topography or
any other condition that could be deemed harmful to the public health or
general welfare of the residents of the City unless such unsuitable conditions
are corrected to the satisfaction of the City. If land is found to be
unsuitable to subdivide for these or any other reasons, the Council shall
provide the intended subdivider with said reasons and provide them the
opportunity to provide additional information on the situation. Following the
submission of any answer to the question of unsuitability or any additional
information, the Council may then either reaffirm or rescind its decision on
the unsuitability of said land.
2.Â Â Â Relation to Existing Streets.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all
streets shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets,
to topographic conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their
appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such
streets.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either provide for
the continuation of appropriate projection of existing principal streets in
surrounding areas or conform to a plat for the neighborhood approved by the
Council to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions
made continuance or conformance to existing streets impracticable.
3.Â Â Â Acreage Subdivisions.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where the submitted plat covers only a part of the subdividerâ€™s plat, a
sketch of the prospective future system of the unsubmitted part shall be
furnished and the street system of the part submitted shall be considered in
the light of adjustments in connection with the street system of the part not
submitted.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where the parcel is subdivided into larger tracts than for building
lots such parcels shall be divided so as to allow for the opening of major
streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent minor streets.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Subdivisions showing unplatted strips or private streets controlling
access to public ways will not receive approval.
4.Â Â Â Local Streets.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Local streets shall be so planned as to discourage through traffic.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Cul-de-sac streets are permitted where topography and other conditions
justify their use. Such streets shall not be longer than 500 feet and shall
terminate with a turn-around, having an outside roadway diameter of at least 80
feet and a street property line diameter of at least 100 feet. The right-of-way
width of the straight portion of such streets shall be a minimum of 60 feet.
The property line at the intersection of the turn-around and the straight
portion of the street shall be rounded at a radius of not less than 20 feet.
5.Â Â Â Frontage Streets.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial
street, the Council may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage with
screen planting contained in a non-access reservation along the rear property
line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other treatment as may be
necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford
separation of through and local traffic.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or
limited access highway right-of-way, the Council may require a street
approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance
suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes
in residential districts. Such distances shall also be determined with due
regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations.
6.Â Â Â Half-streets. Half-streets shall be prohibited except where essential to
the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of these regulations, and where the Council finds it will be
practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining
property is subdivided. Wherever a half-street is adjacent to a tract to be
subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract.
7.Â Â Â Street Geometrics and Design.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Street design shall be according to the following minimum standards:
Â 
                                                         Minimum Radius of
Type of Street               Right of Way Pavement Width Horizontal/
                                                         Vertical Curves
Arterial                     80â€™        49â€™          500â€™/200â€™
Arterial, with turning lane  90â€™        56â€™          500â€™/200â€™
Collector                    60â€™        36â€™          400â€™/150â€™
Collector, with turning lane 70â€™        41â€™          400â€™/150â€™
Minor Street (parking        50â€™        27â€™          100â€™/100â€™
limitations)                 50â€™        31â€™          100â€™/100â€™
Â 
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be
avoided.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse
curves on arterial and collector streets.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point
by more than 10 degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius
adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than 200 feet for minor and
collector streets, and of such greater radii as the Council shall determine for
special cases.
8.Â Â Â Intersections.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Insofar as is practical, acute angles between streets at their
intersection are to be avoided.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at less than 60
degrees.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a radius
of 10 feet, or of a greater radius where the Council may deem it necessary. The
Council may permit comparable cutoffs or chords in place of rounded corners.
9.Â Â Â Street Names. Streets that are in alignment with others already existing
and named shall bear the name of the existing streets. The proposed names of
new streets shall not duplicate or sound similar to existing street names.
Street names shall be subject to the approval of the Council.
10.Â Â Â Street Grades.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Street grades, wherever feasible, shall not exceed five percent, with
due allowance for reasonable vertical curves.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â No street grade shall be less than one-half of one percent.
11.Â Â Â Alleys.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts, except
that the Council may waive this requirement where other definite and assured
provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading,
and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The width of an alley shall be 20 feet.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided,
but where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit safe
vehicular movements.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable,
shall be provided with adequate turn-around facilities at the dead-end, as
determined by the Council.
12.Â Â Â Blocks.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No block may be more than 1,320 feet or less than 500 feet in length
between the center lines of intersecting streets, except where, in the opinion
of the Council, extraordinary conditions unquestionably justify a departure
from these limits.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In blocks over 700 feet in length, the Council may require at or near
the middle of the block a public way or easement of not less than 10 feet in
width for use by pedestrians and/or as an easement for public utilities.
13.Â Â Â Lots.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The lot size, width, depth, shape, and orientation shall be appropriate
for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use
contemplated.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Minimum lot dimensions and sizes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Residential lots, where not served by public sewer, shall not be
less than 80 feet wide nor less than 10,000 square feet in area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for commercial
and industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service
and parking facilities required by the type of use and development
contemplated.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Corner lots for residential use shall have an extra 10 feet of
width to permit appropriate building setback from and orientation to both
streets.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The subdividing of the land shall be such as to provide, by means of
public street, each lot with satisfactory access to an existing public street.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except where
essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic
arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. A
planting screen easement of at least 10 feet across, which there shall be no
right of access, shall be provided along the line of lots abutting such a
traffic artery or other disadvantageous use.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles to straight
street lines or radial to curved street lines.
14.Â Â Â Building Lines. Building lines shall be shown on all lots within the
platted area. The Council may require building lines in accordance with the
needs of each subdivision.
15.Â Â Â Easements.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Easement across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be
provided for utilities where necessary and shall be at least 10 feet wide.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way,
channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage
right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of such watercourse, and
further width for construction, or both, as will be adequate for the purpose.
16.Â Â Â Plat Markers. Markers shall be placed at all block corners, angle points,
points of curves in streets, and all such intermediate points as shall be
required by the Council. The markers shall be of such material, size and length
as may be approved by the Council.
170.16Â Â Â PROCEDURES AND SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR PLATS.
In obtaining final approval of a proposed subdivision by the Council, the owner
and subdivider shall submit a plat in accordance with the requirements
hereafter set forth and install improvements or provide a performance bond.
170.17Â Â Â PREAPPLICATION CONFERENCE.
Whenever a subdivision located within the platting jurisdiction of the City is
proposed, the owner and subdivider shall schedule a preapplication conference
with the City Administrator. The conference should be attended by the City
Administrator, City Engineer, and such other City or utility representatives as
is deemed desirable, and by the owner and ownerâ€™s engineer and/or planner, as
deemed desirable. The purpose of such conference shall be to acquaint the City

170.32Â Â Â VARIANCES.
Where in the case of a particular proposed subdivision, it can be shown that
strict compliance with the requirement of this chapter would result in
extraordinary hardship to the subdivider, because of unusual topography or
other conditions, the Council may vary, modify, or waive the requirements so
that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secure. Provided,
however, that such variance, modification, or waiver will not have the effect
of nullifying the intent and purpose of this chapter. Such variances and
waivers may be granted only by the affirmative vote of three-fourths of the
members of the Council.
170.33Â Â Â CHAIN SUBDIVIDING.
No more than two building permits for each separate tract existing at the

limit the number of building permits that may be issued for accessory buildings
as defined by the Zoning Ordinance or additions or improvements to a main or
accessory building already legally located upon said tract.
