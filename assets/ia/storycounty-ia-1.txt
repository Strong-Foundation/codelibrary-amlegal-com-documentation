and perform any function it deems appropriate to protect and preserve the
rights, privileges and property of the County and of its residents, and
preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort and

the performance of the foregoing functions.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 331.301)

   Legislation may be effectively introduced, filed, discussed, amended,
changed, read, adopted or otherwise considered at any session of the Board of
Supervisors subject to the limitations of Section 331.302 of the Code of Iowa.
Publication and notice requirements must be in compliance with Sections
331.302, 331.305 and Chapter 21 of the Code of Iowa. Legislation may be
considered for a reasonable length of time after filing provided there is
reasonable continuity in the consideration. Irregular acts of the Board may be
corrected at subsequent meetings prior to final passage. Actions may be
reconsidered until the final vote on that action. Actions may be rescinded
before the legislation becomes effective or at any time unless vested personal
or property rights will be affected. Actions may be repealed or amended in
accordance with Section 331.302 of the Code of Iowa. Legislative acts are
prospective.

certified, recorded and filed as required by Section 331.302 of the Code of
Iowa. A preamble, prefatory statement or explanation of a resolution, if
employed, shall not be a substantive part of a resolution, and may be omitted

Supervisors proceedings. Copies of adopted resolutions will be delivered to
agencies, officers and other persons as required by law or as directed by the
Board.
   3.   Ordinances and Amendments of Ordinances. Action of the Board in the

1.09   INDEMNITY.
   The applicant for any permit or license under this Code of Ordinances, by
making such application, assumes and agrees to pay for all injury to or death
of any person or persons whomsoever, and all loss of or damage to property
whatsoever, including all costs and expenses incident thereto, however arising
from or related to, directly, indirectly or remotely, the issuance of the
permit or license, or the doing of anything thereunder, or the failure of such
applicant, or the agents, employees or servants of such applicant, to abide by
or comply with any of the provisions of this Code of Ordinances or the terms
and conditions of such permit or license, and such applicant, by making such
application, forever agrees to indemnify the County and its officers, agents
and employees, and agrees to save them harmless from any and all claims,
demands, lawsuits or liability whatsoever for any loss, damage, injury or
death, including all costs and expenses incident thereto, by reason of the
foregoing. The provisions of this section shall be deemed to be a part of any
permit or license issued under this Code of Ordinances or any other ordinance
of the County whether expressly recited therein or not.
1.10   PERSONAL INJURIES.
   When action is brought against the County for personal injuries alleged to
have been caused by its negligence, the County may notify in writing any person
by whose negligence it claims the injury was caused. The notice shall state the
pendency of the action, the name of the plaintiff, the name and location of the
court where the action is pending, a brief statement of the alleged facts from
which the cause arose, that the County believes that the person notified is
liable to it for any judgment rendered against the County, and asking the
person to appear and defend. A judgment obtained in the suit is conclusive in
any action by the County against any person so notified, as to the existence of
the defect or other cause of the injury or damage, as to the liability of the
County to the plaintiff in the first named action, and as to the amount of the
damage or injury. The County may maintain an action against the person notified
to recover the amount of the judgment together with all the expenses incurred
by the County in the suit.

7.04 Limitations                 7.08 Exemption Repealed
 
7.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for a partial exemption from
property taxation of the actual value added to qualifying real estate by the
new construction of industrial real estate, research service facilities,
warehouses, owner-operated cattle facilities, and distribution centers.
7.02   DEFINITIONS.
   For use in this chapter the following terms are defined:
   1.   “Actual value added” means the actual value added as of the first year
for which the exemption is received.
   2.   “Distribution center” means a building or structure used primarily for
the storage of goods which are intended for subsequent shipment to retail

storage of petroleum products, or used for the retail sale of goods.
   3.   “New construction” means new buildings and structures and includes new
buildings and structures that are constructed as additions to existing
buildings and structures. The term does not include reconstruction of an
existing building or structure which does not constitute complete replacement
of an existing building or structure or refitting of an existing building or
structure unless the reconstruction of an existing building or structure is
required due to economic obsolescence and the reconstruction is necessary to
implement recognized industry standards for the manufacturing and processing of
specific products and the reconstruction is required for the owner of the
building or structure to continue to competitively manufacture or process those
products, which determination shall receive prior approval from the Board of
Supervisors.
   4.   “Owner-operated cattle facilities” means a building or structure used
primarily in the raising of cattle and which is operated by the person owning
the facility.
   5.   “Qualified industrial real estate” means that which is zoned,

   7.   “Warehouse” means a building or structure used as a public warehouse
for the storage of goods pursuant to Chapter 554, Article 7, of the Code of
Iowa, except that it does not mean a building or structure used primarily to
store raw agricultural products or from which goods are sold at retail.
7.03   PERIOD OF PARTIAL EXEMPTION.
   The actual value added to industrial real estate, as specified in this
chapter, is eligible to receive a partial exemption from taxation for a period
of five years. The exemption shall also apply to the acquisition of or
improvement to machinery and equipment assessed as real estate pursuant to
Section 427A.1[1e] of the Code of Iowa, unless the machinery or equipment is
part of the normal replacement or operating process to maintain or expand the
existing operational status. However, if the property ceases to be classified
as industrial real estate, the partial exemption shall not be allowed for
subsequent assessment years. The amount of actual value added which is eligible
to be exempt from taxation shall be as follows:
   1.   For the first year, 75 percent
   2.   For the second year, 60 percent
   3.   For the third year, 45 percent

   5.   For the fifth year, 15 percent
   6.   For the sixth year, zero percent
7.04   LIMITATIONS.
   The granting of the exemption under this chapter for new construction
constituting complete replacement of an existing building or structure shall
not result in the assessed value of the industrial real estate being reduced
below the assessed value of the industrial real estate before the start of the
new construction added.
7.05   APPLICATIONS.
   An application shall be filed for each project resulting in actual value
added for which an exemption is claimed.
   1.   The application for exemption shall be filed by the owner of the
property with the Assessor by February 1 of the assessment year in which the
value added is first assessed for taxation.
   2.   Applications for exemption shall be made on forms prescribed by the
Director of Revenue, State of Iowa, and shall contain information pertaining to
the nature of the improvement, its cost, and other information deemed necessary
by the Director of Revenue.
7.06   APPROVAL.
   A person may submit a proposal to the Board of Supervisors to receive prior
approval for eligibility for a tax exemption on new construction. The Board of
Supervisors, by ordinance, may give its prior approval of a tax exemption for
new construction if the new construction is in conformance with the Story
County Land Development Regulations Ordinance. Such prior approval shall also
be subject to the public hearing requirements of this Code of Ordinances. Prior
approval does not entitle the owner to exemption from taxation until the new
construction has been completed and found to be qualified real estate. However,
if the tax exemption for new construction is not approved, the person may
submit an amended proposal to the Board of Supervisors to approve or reject.
7.07   DUAL EXEMPTIONS PROHIBITED.
   A property tax exemption under this chapter shall not be granted if the
property for which the exemption is claimed has received any other property tax
exemption authorized by law.
7.08   EXEMPTION REPEALED.
   When in the opinion of the Board of Supervisors, continuation of the
exemption granted by this chapter ceases to be of benefit to the County, the
Board of Supervisors may repeal the ordinance codified in this chapter, but all
existing exemptions shall continue until their expiration.

8.03   PROVISIONS FOR DIVISION OF TAXES LEVIED ON TAXABLE PROPERTY IN THE URBAN
RENEWAL AREA.
   After the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the
taxes levied on the taxable property in the Urban Renewal Area each year by and
for the benefit of the State of Iowa, the County and any school district or
other taxing district in which the Urban Renewal Area is located, shall be
divided as follows:
   1.   That portion of the taxes which would be produced by the rate at which
the tax is levied each year by or for each of the taxing districts upon the
total sum of the assessed value of the taxable property in the Urban Renewal
Area, as shown on the assessment roll as of January 1 of the calendar year
preceding the first calendar year in which there is certified to the County
Auditor an amount of loans, advances, indebtedness, or bonds payable from the
special fund referred to in subsection 2 below, shall be allocated to and when
collected be paid into the fund for the respective taxing district as taxes by
or for said taxing district into which all other property taxes are paid. For
the purpose of allocating taxes levied by or for any taxing district which did
not include the territory in the Urban Renewal Area on the effective date of
the ordinance codified in this chapter, but to which the territory has been
annexed or otherwise included after said effective date, the assessment roll
applicable to property in the annexed territory as of January 1 of the calendar
year preceding the effective date of the ordinance which amends the plan for
the Urban Renewal Area to include the annexed area, shall be used in
determining the assessed valuation of the taxable property in the annexed area.
   2.   That portion of the taxes each year in excess of such amounts shall be
allocated to and when collected be paid into a special fund of the County to
pay the principal of and interest on loans, moneys advanced to or indebtedness,
whether funded, refunded, assumed or otherwise, including bonds issued under
the authority of Section 403.9(1), of the Code of Iowa, incurred by the County
to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, projects in the Urban Renewal
Area, and to provide assistance for low- and moderate-income family housing as
provided in Section 403.22, except that taxes for the regular and voter-
approved physical plant and equipment levy of a school district imposed
pursuant to Section 298.2 of the Code of Iowa, and taxes for the payment of
bonds and interest of each taxing district shall be collected against all
taxable property within the taxing district without limitation by the
provisions of this chapter. Unless and until the total assessed valuation of
the taxable property in the Urban Renewal Area exceeds the total assessed value
of the taxable property in such area as shown by the assessment roll referred
to in subsection 1 of this section, all of the taxes levied and collected upon
the taxable property in the Urban Renewal Area shall be paid into the funds for
the respective taxing districts as taxes by or for said taxing districts in the
same manner as all other property taxes. When such loans, advances,
indebtedness, and bonds, if any, and interest thereon, have been paid, all
money thereafter received from taxes upon the taxable property in the Urban
Renewal Area shall be paid into the funds for the respective taxing districts
in the same manner as taxes on all other property.
   3.   The portion of taxes mentioned in subsection 2 of this section and the
special fund into which that portion shall be paid may be irrevocably pledged
by the County for the payment of the principal and interest on loans, advances,
bonds issued under the authority of Section 403.9(1) of the Code of Iowa, or
indebtedness incurred by the County to finance or refinance in whole or in part
projects in the Urban Renewal Area.
   4.   As used in this section, the word “taxes” includes, but is not limited
to, all levies on an ad valorem basis upon land or real property.

CHAPTER 30
SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL AND MAINTENANCE OF SECONDARY ROADS
 
30.01 Purpose             30.04 Limitation of Service
30.02 Level of Service    30.05 Emergency Conditions
30.03 Sequence of Service
 
30.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish Story County’s policy and level
of service in respect to clearance of snow or ice and maintenance of its
secondary road system during the winter months, as provided in HF 2487, Section
10(2), Acts of the 63rd G.A. Second Session, and pursuant to the provisions of
Section 309.67, Code of Iowa. This policy and level of service are to be
implemented within the amount of money budgeted for this service, as contained
in Story County’s secondary road budget, as adopted by the Board of
Supervisors, and submitted to and approved by the Iowa Department of
Transportation. The normal logistics of maintenance will be modified by varying
severity of storms, winds, temperature, other weather conditions, equipment
limitations, trained personnel available, and budget constraints. Persons using
public rights-of-way are hereby warned that travel conditions are hazardous and
severe weather conditions may overwhelm the time, equipment, and personnel
services assigned to road maintenance. Some storms may be so severe that, in
the professional judgment of the County Engineer, the road services must be
suspended.
30.02   LEVEL OF SERVICE.
   Clearance of snow or ice and maintenance of the secondary road system during
the winter months are primarily for the benefit of the local residents of Story
County. Each storm has individual characteristics and must be dealt with
accordingly. The County’s existing operable snow removal equipment will be
utilized for this purpose. All clearance of snow and ice, sanding, salting, and
other maintenance respecting winter conditions shall be accomplished within the
amount of money budgeted for this service. The rental of equipment is not
anticipated. The portion of the roadway improved for travel may have upon it
snow and ice in a compacted condition. These conditions may be continuous, or
they may be more concentrated on hills, in valleys, curves, and/or
intersections. The entire width of that portion of the road improved for travel
may not be cleared of snow, ice, compacted snow and ice, or frost. Snow cleared
from that part of the roadway improved for travel shall be placed on or in the
adjacent shoulder, ditch, or right-of-way. The County shall not be responsible
for snow pushed or otherwise placed on the roadway or shoulder by others. Snow
can be expected to accumulate adjacent to the traveled portion to the extent
that a motorist’s sight distance to both the left and the right may be greatly
reduced or impaired. The snow removed from intersections will be piled in its
corners in piles of unequal height. The line of sight, sight distance, or
visibility of motorists approaching these intersections may be greatly reduced
or impaired. It is the motorists’ responsibility to drive their vehicles during
these conditions with additional caution and watchfulness, especially in
respect to the surface of the roadway, and reduced or impaired visibility, and
motorists are advised to reduce their speed at least 25 miles per hour below
that legally permitted or advised under normal conditions. In respect to
roadways that have only one lane open, further extreme watchfulness and caution
should be exercised by motorists, and their speed should not exceed 10 miles
per hour. During these conditions no additional warning or regulatory signs
will be placed that warn of impaired sight distances, visibility at
intersections, road blockages, one-lane conditions, or that the road surface is
slick or slippery, or what the advised speed should be.
30.03   SEQUENCE OF SERVICE.
   In the implementation of snow and ice removal and other maintenance of the
County’s secondary road system during the winter months, the County Engineer
shall select the actual sequence of roads to be cleared, as provided for in
this section, and shall determine when weather conditions require snow removal
equipment be removed from the roadway, or that additional clearance of paved
routes be accomplished prior to the clearance of gravel roads. The County
Engineer’s professional judgment shall prevail.
   1.   Paved Routes – First Sequence.
      A.   The initial effort will be to get all routes open to one-lane
traffic as soon as possible.
      B.   After one-lane travel is possible, subsequent snow removal will be
carried on as determined necessary based on existing and forecasted conditions.
      C.   The truck-mounted snow plows and spreaders will not normally be in
operation between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. The trucks may be called
off the road if weather conditions reduce visibility to hazardous working
conditions, in the professional judgment of the Engineer or his delegated
representative.
      D.   It is not the policy of the County to provide a “dry” pavement
condition.
      E.   After roads have been plowed as provided in this section,
intersections, hills, and curves may have salt, sand, or other abrasive
material placed on them. These intersections, hills, and curves will not be re-
sanded, re-salted, or have other abrasives replaced on them between storms.
This sequence of service shall be performed only between the hours of 5:00 a.m.
and 7:00 p.m. each day, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays
observed by County employees.
   2.   Unpaved Roads – Second Sequence.
      A.   The initial effort on granular surfaced roads will be to get one
lane open for traffic from one direction to each occupied dwelling as soon as
possible after a storm has passed.
      B.   After one-lane travel is possible, subsequent snow removal will be
carried on as determined necessary based on existing and forecasted conditions.
      C.   Motor graders and/or truck plows will not normally be in operation
between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. Gravel roads may not be plowed if
the wind is causing continual drifting.
      D.   Snow may not be removed from dirt roads and gravel roads, or
portions thereof, not serving occupied dwellings.
   3.   Private Drives. The County will not clear snow from private drives.
Normal snow removal operations may result in snow being deposited in private
drives. Snow from private drives shall not be placed on the roadway or
shoulders. New mailboxes, plain galvanized normal small size, will be issued to
owners only if destroyed mailbox has been hit by snow removal equipment.
Mailboxes thus provided must be mounted on 4 x 4-inch wood posts. Claims for
replacement mailboxes must be made by the end of the third day after the box is
damaged. Replacement boxes will not be provided for those damaged by flying
snow.
There is no time limit after a snowstorm in which any of the above sequence of
clearance, on paved or unpaved roads, shall take place.
30.04   LIMITATION OF SERVICE.
   The policy and level of service provided for in this chapter does not
include the performance of the following services:
   1.   Sanding, salting, or placing of other abrasives upon a roadway that is
slick, slippery, and dangerous due to the formation of frost.
   2.   Sanding, salting, or placing other abrasives upon paved roadways due to
freezing precipitation that occurs outside the County’s usual working hours.
   3.   Placing of additional warning or regulatory signs warning of impaired
sight distances, visibility at intersections, road blockages, one-lane
conditions, or that the road surface is slick or slippery, or what the advised
speed should be.
   4.   Sanding, salting, or placing abrasives upon any road, except for paved
roads.
30.05   EMERGENCY CONDITIONS .
   1.   The sequence of service may be suspended during emergency conditions.
An “emergency condition” is when one or all of the following situations occur:
where a serious injury has occurred, where a loss of life is probable, or where
disastrous or cataclysmic loss of property is imminent. The above conditions
should be verified by a physician or sheriff or said person’s appropriate
representative. The County will respond to all emergency conditions, either
during or after a hazardous storm.
   2.   The provisions of this chapter shall be further suspended in the event
the Governor, by proclamation, implements the State Disaster Plan, or the
Chairperson of the Board of Supervisors, by proclamation, implements the County
Disaster Plan. If such occurs, the County personnel and equipment shall be
immediately subject to the direction of the Governor or the Chairperson of the
Board of Supervisors.

32.02 Administration                32.07 Displaying Address Markers and Other
                                    Required Numbers
32.03 Road Identification Standards 32.08 Annexations
32.04 Official Road Name Signs      32.09 Enforcement
32.05 Address Numbering
 
32.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for a uniform County-wide system
with respect to identification of roads and assigning address numbers within
the unincorporated portions of Story County. Such a system will assist
emergency services agencies, law enforcement agencies, the U.S. Postal Service,
and the general public in the timely and efficient provisions of services to
Story County.
32.02   ADMINISTRATION.
   1.   The Story County Planning and Development Director (the ''Director") or
designated agent is hereby assigned as the agent of the Board of Supervisors to
be responsible for the administration, implementation, and enforcement of this
chapter.
   2.   The Story County Engineer (the "Engineer'') or designated agent is
hereby assigned as the agent of the Board of Supervisors to be responsible for
the installation and maintenance of street signs and address markers.
   3.   The official 911 Address Map for Story County, Iowa, or amendments
thereto, is hereby incorporated by reference and made a part of this chapter.
32.03   ROAD IDENTIFICATION STANDARDS.
   Road names will be assigned in accordance with the guidelines established
herein as follows:
   1.   Road Naming System - East/West Roads. The majority of roads in
unincorporated Story County generally run along section lines. Roads running in
an east and west direction are to be given a numeric designation beginning with
100th Street on the northernmost section line and road across the County. The
southernmost road in Story County will be given a designation of 340th Street.
East/west roads that do not run on the section line will be assigned to a
numeric designation that falls between the designation assigned to adjoining
northern and southern section line roads. An example of the name of an east/
west road, which is located 1.5 miles south of the Hamilton and Hardin County
line, is 115th Street.
   2.   Road Naming System - North/South Roads. Roads running in a north and
south direction are to be given a numeric designation beginning with 500th
Avenue on the western section line road in the County. The easternmost road in
the County is to have a designation of 740th Avenue. North/south roads that do
not run on a section line are to be assigned a numeric designation that falls
between the designation assigned to the adjoining western and eastern section
line roads. An example of the name of a north/south road, which is located 1.5
miles east of the Boone County line, is 515th Avenue.
   3.   Road Naming System Exceptions - Straight Line Roads. Exceptions may be
made for State and Federal Highways and other roads of historical significance
that travel in a generally straight line. When an exception to the rule is
made, the numeric designation that would normally be assigned to the road would
not be used, and the normal progression continued.
      A.   Straight line east/west road exceptions include, but are not limited
to:
            State Highway 210
            Lincoln Highway
            U.S. Highway 30
      B.   Straight line north/south road exceptions include, but are not
limited to:
            George W. Carver Avenue
            Interstate Highway 35
            U.S. Highway 65
            U.S. Highway 69
   4.   Road Naming System Exceptions - Diagonal or Irregular. The vast
majority of the road network in Story County runs along or adjacent to a
section line; however, there are a few roads that run diagonally or in an
irregular manner, or run in a straight line for a short distance, but do not
run on a section line. In the case of diagonal, irregular roads, or straight
line roads not on a section line, existing recorded names will be used. If none
exists, common place road names, or names accepted by petition signed by 75
percent of the owners of the land along the roadway will be used. If no
recorded name exists, or no petition is presented, a determination will be made
as to whether the road is generally an east/west or north/south road. Once this
determination is made, the road will be designated as if it were a straight
line road.
32.04   OFFICIAL ROAD NAME SIGNS.
   A street sign of standard design, as approved by the Engineer, shall be
erected at each intersection of county roads, and at each intersection of a
county and subdivision/private road as defined below, and at each intersection
of subdivision/private roads within the unincorporated area of the County. At
least one road name sign displaying the name of each road shall be erected and
maintained. Road name signs shall be located in the most suitable corner as
determined by the Engineer.
   1.   County Roads. County roads shall include those accepted into and shown
on the Iowa Department of Transportation's Official Highway and Transportation
Map for Story County. Signs for county roads will be installed and maintained
under the following guidelines:
      A.   The County shall acquire, fabricate, erect, and thereafter maintain
road name signs at the intersection of new county roads.
      B.   In the event that a road sign requires maintenance or replacement,
written notification will be given to the Engineer's Office.
      C.   As adopted by Ordinance 94, the County does not require that
missing/damaged U.S. Highway 69 street intersection signs be replaced by Story
County.
   2.   Subdivision/Private Roads. A subdivision/private road includes any
street, drive, road, lane, or access easement serving three or more occupied
structures, and which is not defined as a county road. Signs for subdivision/
private roads will be installed and maintained under the following guidelines:
      A.   At the request of the owner or majority of the owners of a
subdivision/private road and upon receipt of a fee sufficient to cover the cost
of materials and labor as determined by the Engineer, the County may acquire,
fabricate, and erect a road name sign where county and subdivision/private
roads intersect.
      B.   For subdivision/private roads in platted subdivisions for which the
preliminary plat has been submitted to the County after the effective date of
the ordinance codified in this chapter, the fee shall be paid at the time the
final plat is submitted. The applicant may specify that street name signs are
to be erected immediately upon notification or at the time the road is
completed and final construction is approved by the County. Should the
applicant request that road name signs be erected prior to the new streets
being approved by the County, the applicant shall be responsible for their
maintenance until such time as the streets are approved by the County. Prior to
the County's approval of a new road, the Engineer or designated agent shall
make an inspection to determine that all road name signs are in a state of good
maintenance. Should any subdivision/private road name sign be missing or in
need of repair, the applicant shall pay the full cost for replacement and/or
repair thereof prior to the approval of the new street by the County.
      C.   In the event that a subdivision/private road sign requires
maintenance or replacement, written notification will be given to the Planning
and Development Department, which will forward it to the Engineer's Office.
Upon receipt of a fee sufficient to cover the cost of materials and labor as
determined by the Engineer, the County may acquire, fabricate. and erect the
road name sign. The lettering for subdivision/private road signs shall be a mix
of upper and lower-case letters. The first letter of each name or abbreviation
shall be upper-case and the rest of the lettering in the name or abbreviation
shall be lower-case. The lettering height should be at least six inches. For
local roads with speed limits of 30 mph or less. the lettering height may be
reduced to four inches. Subdivision/private road name signs shall have a green
background with white lettering.

32.07   DISPLAYING ADDRESS MARKERS AND OTHER REQUIRED NUMBERS.
   Story County address markers and other required identifying numbers will be
displayed under the following guidelines:
   1.   County Responsibility. Along all county roads as defined herein, the
County will place property address markers at the main driveway entrance of a
property. When an address is required along a subdivision/private road, the
County will erect the address marker so that it is displayed as required
herein. (A second and third set of property numbers may be placed on both sides
of the mailbox. This shall be the responsibility of the owner.) If the
contractor or homeowner along a subdivision/private road wishes to install the
address marker in a location other than at the main driveway entrance. they
shall notify the Engineer's Office, which shall forward it to the Story County
911 Service Board for approval. Address markers shall not be moved without
prior approval from the Story County 911 Service Board.
   2.   Main Address. Apartments and townhouses where only one number is
assigned shall display such number at the main entranceway. Numbers for
individual units or establishments within the complex shall be the
responsibility of the owner and shall be displayed on, above, or to the side of
the main doorway of each unit.
   3.   Additional Numbers. In addition to posted address markers as required
by this chapter, all units in multiple business establishments shall be
numbered as Suites 100, 200, 300, and so on until the final suite has been
numbered. Address numbers shall also be placed on the buildings for which the
suites are located. The suites shall be numbered from left to right or right to
left depending upon the order of the businesses being leased out. The numbers
will be placed on the door of the suite and on the box for which mail is
received. Such signage shall include at least two-inch letters and numbers
colored black on a white reflective background. If a single entrance is located
on a building with two or more suites located within, then a sign is to be
placed at this entrance indicating the suite numbers located within the
building. Such signage shall include at least two-inch letters and numbers
colored black on a white reflective background. For example, the sign should
read "Suites 100-450".
   4.   Manufactured Home Communities and Recreational Vehicle Park Signs.
Numbers will be displayed in the following manner:
      A.   Manufactured Home Communities. Each manufactured home community
owner is responsible for ensuring that each unit within the park is clearly
labeled with the number assigned to the unit. The numbers for all units shall
be three inches high, consisting of black block or italic lettering on a white
or reflective background. The background height should be the same for all
numbers in each lot, with consistent font type throughout each manufactured
home community. The numbers will be placed on the unit at least five feet about
ground level so they may be viewed from approaching vehicles. The location of
these numbers on the unit should be in a highly visible area on the front
portion of the unit and they should be located uniformly on all sides. Any
obstructions that may obscure the view of the numbers shall be cleared away to
eliminate the obstruction. New units that are placed within the park shall be
clearly addressed with a number placed upon it prior to occupancy by the
owners.
      B.   Recreational Vehicle Parks. Recreational vehicle park owners are
responsible for ensuring that each recreational vehicle site is labeled with
the number assigned to the site. The numbers for all recreational vehicle sites
shall be two inches high, consisting of black block or italic lettering on a
white reflective background. Consistent background height and font type should
be located throughout the recreational vehicle park. These numbers will be
placed on a permanent post a minimum of three feet from the ground or on an
electrical box that clearly marks the intended site. Emergency officials must
be able to locate the site easily from the road in order to assist park
occupants during an emergency.
      C.   Site Location Signs. Site location signs will be placed on permanent
structures or permanent posts at a minimum height of five feet within the
manufactured home community or recreational vehicle park. These signs will
consist of at least two-inch black block or italic lettering on a white or
reflective background. The letters will be placed upon a proportional sign
backing to ensure longevity of the sign. Site location signs will give accurate
information as to the directions of indicated units or sites. Generally, a
number through a subsequent number with an arrow to indicate direction will
suffice to aid emergency vehicles. These site location signs shall be placed in
highly viewable areas prior to each turn to give emergency vehicle operators
time to respond.
      D.   Compliance. Property owners of areas with signage in accordance with
the requirements of this chapter are required to erect and maintain signage as
needed. Property owners of areas subject to these guidelines which have signage
in place not in accordance with the requirements of this chapter are required
to install new signs. Hand-printed signs will not be allowed unless they meet
the requirements of these guidelines.
   5.   Shared Drives. If two or more uses requiring an address marker as
defined in Section
32.06 share a drive, the following applies:
      A.   An address marker indicating each address shall be placed at the
driveway accessing the property from the public right-of-way.
      B.   A second address marker shall be installed at the site of the
structure.
      C.   It will be the responsibility of the property owner to pay the
applicable fees for the installation and maintenance as required for both
signs.
   6.   Prohibitions. Disturbing or removing a property address marker (at the
main driveway entrance) without the prior written approval of the Director or
designated agent is a violation of this chapter. Penalties will be enforced in
accordance with Section
32.09, Enforcement.

CHAPTER 33
USE OF SECONDARY ROAD RIGHT-OF-WAY
 
33.01 Board Findings         33.04 Authorization Process
33.02 Definitions            33.05 Abatement Cost
33.03 Offenses and Penalties 33.06 Enforcement
 
33.01   BOARD FINDINGS.
   The Story County Board of Supervisors finds as follows:
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 331.301[1])
   1.   The unauthorized use of secondary road right-of-way is a problem in the
County.
   2.   This problem includes, but is not limited to, the cultivation and
growing of crops on the County right-of-way; the improper placing of fences or
ditches on the County right-of-way; the alteration of ditches, water breaks and
drainage tiles on the County right-of-way; the placement of trash, junk, rocks,
corncobs, brush, abandoned vehicles or machinery and other items on the County
right-of-way; and the placement of billboards, signs, hazardous mailbox
supports, and advertising devices on the County right-of-way.
   3.   The unauthorized use of secondary road right-of-way can, among other
things, undermine attempts to control drainage and floodwater, diminish snow
storage capacity and hinder snow removal, damage or shorten the life expectancy
of the roadway, or create hazardous obstructions in the roadway.
   4.   The unauthorized use of secondary road right-of-way therefore endangers
the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Story County.
The Board further finds that it is necessary to prevent the unauthorized use of
County secondary roadway right-of-way.
33.02   DEFINITIONS.
   For use in this chapter, the following terms are defined:
   1.   “Any person responsible” includes any person who personally does any
act that constitutes the unauthorized use of the County secondary roadway
right-of-way. “Any person responsible” includes any person who authorizes or
contracts with another to do any act that leads to the unauthorized use of the
County secondary roadway right-of-way. It is not a defense to this chapter that
a person contracted with another person or entity and that the contractor did
the act that constituted the unauthorized use of the County secondary roadway
right-of-way. A person contracting with another shall have an ongoing duty not
to permit the contractor to do work that involves the unauthorized use of the
County secondary roadway right-of-way and to oversee the work done in order to
ensure that it does not involve the unauthorized use of the County secondary
roadway right-of-way. Evidence that work done on or to benefit a piece of
property involved the unauthorized use of the County secondary roadway right-
of-way shall be prima facie evidence that the owner and/or lessee of that
property did authorize or permit the unauthorized use of the County secondary
roadway right-of-way. A landlord and tenant shall both be in violation of this
chapter if the unauthorized use of the County secondary roadway right-of-way
was done with the knowledge, consent, approval or encouragement of the
landlord. It shall be an “affirmative defense” to action under this chapter if
the unauthorized use of the County secondary roadway right-of-way was done
solely by the authority of the tenant without any knowledge, approval, consent
or encouragement by the landlord. A tenant has an independent duty not to
violate this chapter. It is not a defense under this chapter for the tenant
that the unauthorized use of the County secondary roadway right-of-way was done
with the knowledge, approval, consent or encouragement of the landlord unless
the tenant played no part, directly or indirectly, in the action constituting
the unauthorized use of the County secondary roadway right-of-way.
   2.   “County secondary roadway right-of-way” means the entire width,
distance and portion of any property that the County has the right to use,
whether by easement or fee, for roadway purposes. “County secondary roadway
right-of-way” includes the traveled portion of the roadway, the shoulders and
the ditches and embankments, including both fore slopes and back slopes,
attached to any County secondary roads that are used for roadway purposes.
Width of these properties varies and they have been removed from taxation due
to their public usage.
   3.   “Unauthorized use of the County secondary roadway right-of-way” means
any use of the County secondary roadway right-of-way that is not pre-authorized
in writing by the Story County Engineer and that occurs after the effective
date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. It includes, but is not limited
to excavating, filling or making any physical changes to any part of the County
secondary roadway right-of-way; the cultivation and growing of crops on the
County right-of-way; the destruction of plants placed in the County right-of-
way; the placing of fences or ditches on the County right-of-way; the
alteration of ditches, water breaks and drainage tiles on the County right-of-
way; the placement of trash, junk, rocks, corncobs, brush, vehicles, machinery
or other items on or in the County right-of-way; and the placement of
billboards, signs, hazardous mailbox supports, and advertising devices on the
County right-of-way. “Unauthorized use of the County secondary roadway right-
of-way” does not include the mowing or harvesting of grasses in the County
right-of-way so long as the mowing or harvesting of grasses does not destroy or
adversely affect the grasses or other plants in the County right-of-way or is
not in violation of an integrated roadside vegetation management plan
promulgated pursuant to Section 314.22(2) of the Code of Iowa. “Unauthorized
use of the County secondary roadway right-of-way” does not include driving on
the traveled portion of the roadway or parking a vehicle on the shoulder of the
roadway for less than two hours or parking a disabled vehicle on the shoulder
of the roadway for less than 24 hours. “Unauthorized use of the County
secondary roadway right-of-way” does not include the actions of the Story
County Engineer or any agency of Story County or the State of Iowa.
33.03   OFFENSES AND PENALTIES.
   1.   The unauthorized use of the County secondary roadway right-of-way in
Story County is hereby declared a public nuisance and is prohibited.

   Any person responsible for the unauthorized use of the County secondary
roadway right-of-way shall be strictly liable and responsible for the abatement
and the costs of the abatement of the unauthorized use of the County secondary
roadway right-of-way and for any damages caused by the unauthorized use of the
County secondary roadway right-of-way. The County’s costs for abatement or

   1.   If the Animal Control Officer (ACO) or peace officer believes an animal
has been involved in a disturbance or bite incident, or poses a risk or threat
of harm to any person or domestic animal, said officer may then impound the
animal. If the enforcement officer determines that the animal cannot be safely
captured, the animal may be chemically restrained. Story County will not be
held responsible for the death or injury of a believed-dangerous animal due to
chemical restraint. As an alternative to impoundment, the ACO may elect to
allow the owner to keep the animal at the owner’s home if the owner agrees, in
writing, that the animal will be secured at all times and the owner agrees to
accept any and all responsibility if the animal is involved in another
disturbance or bite incident. Failure to keep the animal secured as set out in
the written agreement shall be a simple misdemeanor.

shall investigate to determine whether the animal should be declared a
dangerous animal. This determination shall be made within seven working days.

written notice. This notice shall include the reasons for the determination and
the necessary provisions that must be met for continued ownership.

signed by the owner agreeing to the provisions. There shall be copies on file
of this agreement with the Animal Control Department and the owner.
   6.   It is unlawful to fail to follow the provisions imposed for release or
continued ownership of a dangerous animal. This violation may be charged as a
civil infraction or as a criminal offense. In addition, the court may order the
animal be surrendered and humanely destroyed.
The owner of an animal declared a dangerous animal, and upheld by a hearing,
may appeal that declaration or the provisions imposed by filing a notice, in
writing, with the Clerk of Court within five working days of receiving the
provisions. The District Associate Court shall hear and determine the matter.

elements of temperature and weather extremes.
   4.   If the animal is livestock, there must be access to a natural or
constructed barrier sufficient to offer reasonable protection against
temperature extremes, wind, rain, or snow. These would include natural
windbreaks such as bush or tree lines, large hay bales, pole building, shed, or
barn.
   5.   If the animal is restricted in a confinement area for an extended
period, the areas shall be kept clean and free from contaminates, including

65.01   PURPOSE.
The purpose of this chapter is to safeguard public health and protect water
quality by minimizing the impact of private sewage disposal systems (septic
systems) by promoting the maintenance of existing systems and employing best
technology for new system installation.
65.02   APPLICABILITY.
The provisions contained herein apply to any system that provides for the
treatment or disposal of domestic sewage from four or fewer dwelling units or
the equivalent of less than 16 individuals on a continuing basis, including
domestic waste, whether residential or nonresidential, but not including any
industrial waste of any flow rate except for on-farm food processing provisions
described in Environmental Protection (567) IAC Chapter 68 Commercial Septic
Tank Cleaners.
65.03   ADOPTION OF STATE CODE.
Pursuant to the authority granted in Section 137.104 of the Code of Iowa, the
Board of Health adopts, in its entirety, by reference, the following Iowa
Administrative Code chapter: 567 IAC 69 – Private Sewage Disposal Systems.
65.04   DESIGNATED AGENCY.
Pursuant to Chapter 137 of the Code of Iowa, the Story County Environmental
Health Department (EH) is the designated agency to interpret, monitor and
enforce the rules contained in Environmental Protection (567) IAC Chapter 69
Private Sewage Disposal Systems and Story County Ordinance
Chapter 65 Private Sewage Disposal Systems.
65.05   ADDITIONAL RULES.
Pursuant to Section 137.104 of the Code of Iowa, the Board of Health adopts the
additional rules contained in this and supports the Story County Board of
Supervisors adopting this chapter to the Story Code of Ordinances.
65.06   DEFINITIONS.
   1.   Bedroom means a private room where people usually sleep for the night.
Story County does not have a building code, so there are no specific items,
such as an egress, a closet, minimum room size, minimum height, etcetera, that
make a room a bedroom. Residential septic system sizing is based on the number
of bedrooms and soil type. A bedroom, for septic sizing, accommodates two
people. Owners, in the process of selling a house, shall disclose the total
number of bedrooms used for sizing the septic system, as stated on the permit,
in an effort to inform buyers of the wastewater generation capacity.
   2.   Certified Installer means a person who qualifies as a Certified
Installer of On-site Wastewater Treatment Systems (CIOWTS). Certification,
recertification, and continuing education for CIOWTS is accredited by the Iowa
On-site Waste Water Association (IOWWA). Continuing education credits for
CIOWTS certification obtained prior to January 1, 2018 may continue to be
tracked with the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) or IOWWA. If
the IOWWA board members have good reason to believe the certified installer is
not meeting the standards of a CIOWTS contractor, the IOWWA board has the
authority to revoke a certification, with an appeal process available for the
contractor. Refer to the IOWWA Certified Installer On-site Wastewater Treatment
Systems Credentialing Handbook.
   3.   Maintenance contract means a binding document between the property
owner and a septic system maintenance contractor. A maintenance contractor has
been trained by the system's manufacturer to service, monitor, make minor
repairs, and report on said manufactured system. For systems no longer being
manufactured, a person may service a septic device via permission granted by a
variance issued by the EH. Maintenance contractors are not required to be a
Certified Installer.
   4.   Professional Septic System Evaluator and Designer (Professional
Evaluator)
      A.   Includes a person who is able to successfully:
         (1)   Demonstrate knowledge and skill in soil morphology, observing
attributes such as color, mottling, reduction-oxidation, texture, structure,
and compaction.
         (2)   Identify seasonal groundwater levels and other limiting layers.
         (3)   Identify soil loading rates.
         (4)   Identify topography and landforms and complex slopes as they
relate to wastewater treatment.
         (5)   Identify the optimum type and placement and depth of disposal
systems.
         (6)   Design systems as per the requirements of IAC Chapter 69
"Private Sewage Disposal Systems" and this ordinance.
         (7)   Identify the proper use of pumps, tanks, distribution boxes,
drop boxes, valves, plumbing, piping, grease traps, holding tanks, and
aggregate.
         (8)   Demonstrate knowledge of wastewater strengths.
      B.   Professional Evaluators include (but not limited to):
         (1)   Licensed engineers in the State of Iowa. A minimum of three
years of experience in onsite wastewater treatment system design and soil
evaluations are required.
         (2)   Individuals with a bachelor's or associate's degree from an
accredited postsecondary education institution in Soil Science, Environmental
Science, Agronomy, or related field. A minimum of three years of experience in
onsite wastewater treatment system design and soil evaluations are required.
         (3)   The Story County Sanitarian
      C.   A person wanting to work in Story County as a Professional Evaluator
shall submit an application and supporting documentation to EH. Application
forms shall be provided by EH. An interview may be requested by EH to aid in
determining if a person is qualified to be a Professional Evaluator in Story
County. An appeal for denials may be requested in writing to the BOH within
thirty days of EH's decision.
   5.   Stream means any watercourse listed as a "designated use segment" in
rule IAC Chapter 61 567-61.3 (455B) which includes any watercourse that
maintains flow throughout the year or contains sufficient pooled areas during
intermittent flow periods to maintain a viable aquatic community. Designated
use segments include:
      A.   Class 'Al' water, as per the State of Iowa water classifications,
also referred to as a primary contact recreational use water, means waters in
which recreational or other uses may result in prolonged and direct contact
with the water, involving considerable risk of ingesting water in quantities
sufficient to pose a health hazard. Such activities would include, but not be
limited to, swimming, diving, water skiing, and water contact recreational
canoeing.
      B.   Class 'A2' water, as per the State of Iowa water classifications,
also referred to as a secondary contact recreational use water, means waters in
which recreational or other uses may result in contact with the water that is
either incidental or accidental. Such uses include fishing, commercial and
recreational boating, any limited contact incidental to shoreline activities
and activities in which users do not swim or float in the water body while on a
boating activity.
      C.   Class 'A3' water, as per the State of Iowa water classifications,
also referred to as a children's recreational use water, means waters in which
recreational uses by children are common. Such waters are water bodies having
definite banks and bed with visible evidence of the flow or occurrence of
water. This type of use would primarily occur in urban or residential areas.

construction traffic. This is the responsibility of the property owner and or
the builder.
65.20   HOLDING TANKS.
The use of holding tanks shall be limited as much as possible. If EH issues a
permit for a holding tank, a maintenance contract for proper monitoring and
servicing shall be established between the owner and a Commercial Septic Tank
Cleaner. A maintenance contract is required for the life of the installed
holding tank. The homeowner is responsible for ensuring that the contract
guarantees the removal of the tank contents before overflow or any discharge.
65.21   SUBDIVISION PLANNING FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT.
   1.   Soil-based treatment is the preferred method of treatment and septic
system placement shall be a key part of the planning phase for subdivisions.
Establishing lot sizes, lot lines, green spaces, easements, and road placement
for a subdivision shall consider the soils, slope, waterways and sensitive
environmental areas, providing for soil-based wastewater treatment as much as
possible. Cluster systems (multiple houses using a shared system) are
recommended for subdivisions in close proximity to a municipal sanitary sewer

65.35   DISCHARGING SYSTEMS.
   1.   Septic systems that are designed to discharge effluent as per
specifications of this ordinance shall meet effluent parameters identified
below. Septic systems with laterals as tertiary treatment are not considered
discharging systems, and do not need to be sampled. There are two
classifications of discharging systems, based on where they discharge:
      A.   If the system discharges to a designated surface water of the state
or a subsurface drainage tile, the owner of the septic system shall submit a
Notice of Intent to the IDNR, and obtain a National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit #4. These septic systems shall meet
the effluent parameters identified in the permit issued by IDNR.
      B.   Those septic systems that DO NOT discharge to a designated surface
water of the state or a subsurface drainage tile shall meet the effluent
parameters identified in Table 2, below. Sampling is required upon request by
the Sanitarian to verify that a discharging system is properly treating the
effluent, or for a time-of-transfer inspection. Annual sampling is not
required.
Table 2
 
Effluents Discharging To E. coli cfu/100 mL CBOD5 mg/L TSS mg/L
Class "Al","A3" waters   235                25         25

Ground surface           2880               25         25
2.   Sampling location and procedure.
      A.   Effluent samples must be collected from an approved sampling port
(accessed from ground surface) or from the end of the discharge pipe (if
accessible) following the final treatment component of the system. Sample
results shall be sent to EH.
      B.   If the system is not discharging at the time of sampling, but
appears to have been discharging, water must be added to the system through the
building plumbing to create a discharge.
   3.   Only a "qualified sampler" shall conduct effluent sampling for
compliance monitoring. "Qualified samplers" include the following:
      A.   EH personnel - fees for sampling conducted by EH shall be set by the
Board of Health.
      B.   An Iowa-certified wastewater treatment operator.
      C.   An individual who has received training approved by IDNR.
      D.   IDNR certified Time of Transfer inspectors.
   4.   Effluent samples must be analyzed by an Iowa certified lab. A list of
certified laboratories is available from the State Hygienic Lab. Sample
containers provided by the laboratory must be used for the sample. The sample
must be collected from a free-falling effluent pipe or sampling port where the
effluent is flowing. Samples shall not be taken from a pooled location. Sample
submission shall follow the lab's instruction.
   5.   If a sample does not meet the effluent limits stated in Table 2 above,
the owner must work with EH to investigate the potential causes of the problem,
and a repeat sample must be taken within 30 days for the specific parameter
that was out of compliance. If the second sample is noncompliant, the owner
must take corrective actions to bring the system into compliance.
65.36   VARIANCES. 
Variances to this ordinance may be granted by EH provided sufficient
information is submitted to substantiate the need for and propriety of such
action. Requests for variances and justification shall be in writing, filed
with EH. Appeals shall be decided by the BOH. Septic permits will list any
approved variances.

   7.   The employee issuing the citation shall appear in court when the
hearing is held.
72.07   COURT PROCEEDINGS; STATE LAW PROVISIONS.
   Pursuant to Section 331.307, Code of Iowa, the proceedings before the court
are as follows:
   1.   In proceedings before the court for a County infraction:
      A.   The County has the burden of proof that the County infraction
occurred and that the violator committed the infraction. The proof shall be by
clear, satisfactory, and convincing evidence.
      B.   The court shall ensure that the violator has received a copy of the
charges and that the violator understands the charges. The violator may
question all witnesses who appear for the County and produce evidence or
witnesses on the violator’s behalf.
      C.   The violator may be represented by counsel of the violator’s own
selection and at the violator’s own expense.

section and fails without good cause to appear in response to the civil
citation, judgment shall be entered against the person cited.
   3.   A person found guilty of a County infraction is liable for the court
costs and fees. If a person is found not guilty of a County infraction or the
action is dismissed, the County is liable for the court costs and court fees.
Where the action is disposed of without payment, or provision for assessment,
of court costs, the clerk shall at once enter judgment for costs against the
County.
   4.   Seeking a civil penalty, as authorized in this section, does not
preclude a County from seeking alternative relief from the court in the same
action.
   5.   When a violator has been found guilty of a County infraction, the court
may impose a civil penalty or may grant appropriate relief to abate or halt the
violation, or both, and the court may direct that payment of the civil penalty
be suspended or deferred under conditions established by the court. If a
violator willfully fails to pay the civil penalty or violates the terms of any
other order imposed by the court, the failure is contempt.
   6.   A violator who has been found guilty of a County infraction may file a
motion for a new trial or a motion for a reversal of a judgment as provided by
law or rule of civil procedure.
   7.   This section does not preclude a peace officer of a County from issuing
a criminal citation for a violation of a County code or regulation if criminal
penalties are also provided for the violation. Each day that a violation occurs
or is permitted by the violator to exist, constitutes a separate offense.
   8.   The issuance of a civil citation for a County infraction or the ensuing
court proceedings do not provide an action for false arrest, false
imprisonment, or prosecution.

80.16 Floodplain Development Permit
Required
 
80.01   STATUTORY AUTHORITY, PURPOSE, AND FINDINGS OF FACT.
   1.   Statutory Authority. This chapter is established under authority of
Chapter 331 of the Code of Iowa, as amended. This chapter establishes a
development permit system that requires a permit for all development within
areas of significant flood hazard as identified by the Flood Insurance Study
for Story County, Iowa, and Incorporated Communities dated January 15, 2021,
within the Unincorporated Areas of Story County. The original Flood Insurance
Study for Story County, Iowa was adopted and implemented by the Story County
Board of Supervisors on June 1, 1983.
   2.   Purpose. This chapter establishes a Floodplain Management Program for
the Unincorporated areas of Story County, Iowa, intended and designed to manage
the development of land in those areas that would be inundated during a one
percent annual chance or greater flood to minimize damage to property and
threats to personal safety by protecting floodways from developmental
encroachment, which would increase flood levels or impede the free flow of
flood waters, and by requiring special site planning and construction standards
in the floodway fringe. The chapter is required to meet the minimum
requirements for acceptance in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) for
counties that have a detailed Flood Insurance Study (FIS) issued by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). It is the purpose of this chapter to
protect and preserve the rights, privileges, and property of Story County and
its residents, and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare,
and comfort and convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses
described in this chapter, with provisions designed to:
      A.   Reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows
so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.
      B.   Restrict or prohibit development that is dangerous to health,
safety, or property in times of flood or which causes excessive increases in
flood heights or velocities.
      C.   Require that development vulnerable to floods, including public
facilities that serve such development, be protected against flood damage at
the time of initial construction or substantial improvement.
      D.   Protect individuals from buying lands that may not be suited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
      E.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program.
   3.   Findings of Fact.
      A.   The flood hazard areas of Story County are subject to periodic
inundation, which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community.
      B.   These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused
by the: (i) occupancy of flood hazard areas by development vulnerable to flood
damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately
elevated or otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) cumulative effect of
obstructions on the floodplain, causing increases in flood heights and
velocities.
      C.   This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood
hazards consistent with the standards established by the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources (IDNR) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

constructed of flood-resistant materials.
            d.   The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building
site so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
            e.   The structure shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation,
collapse and lateral movement.
            f.   The structure’s service facilities such as electrical and
heating equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least three (3) feet
above the one percent annual chance or greater flood elevation.
            g.   The structure’s walls shall include openings that satisfy the
provisions of Section 80.13(3)(B).
         (2)   Exemption from the one percent annual chance or greater flood
elevation requirements for such a structure may result in increased premium
rates for flood insurance coverage of the structure and its contents.
      M.   Recreational Vehicles.
         (1)   Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of
paragraph E of this subsection regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-
built homes when the following criteria are satisfied.
            a.   The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less
than 180 consecutive days; and
            b.   The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for
highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
         (2)   Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than
180 consecutive days and are not ready for highway use must satisfy
requirements of paragraph E of this subsection regarding anchoring and
elevation of factory-built homes.
      N.   Pipeline Crossings. Pipeline river or stream crossings shall be
buried in the streambed and banks or otherwise sufficiently protected to
prevent rupture due to channel degradation, meandering, and the action of flood
flows. Only trenchless construction methods shall be permitted for pipeline
installations. An undisturbed stream buffer shall be maintained where
trenchless methods are also required. The buffer shall be 50 feet or the
channel width, measured as the average width between the top of the opposing
banks, whichever is greater. The buffer shall be the required width on either
side of the stream, measured from the stream edge The buffer may be reduced to
the width of the Special Flood Hazard Area in the case that the required buffer
is larger than the Special Flood Hazard Area.
(Ord. 302 - Sep. 22 Supp.)
      O.   Maximum Damage Potential Development. All new or substantially
improved maximum damage potential development shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated a minimum of three (3) feet above the elevation
of the 500-year flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems,
be floodproofed to such a level. When floodproofing is utilized, a professional
engineer registered in the State of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing
methods used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities,
impact and uplift forces and other factors associated with the 0.2% annual
chance flood; and that the structure below the 0.2% annual chance flood
elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water. A record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in
relation to NAVD 1988 ) to which any structures are floodproofed shall be
maintained by the Floodplain Manager. Where 0.2% chance flood elevation data
has not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The applicant will
be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with
sufficient technical information to make such determinations.
80.14   GF – GENERAL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT.
   1.   Statement of Intent. The GF General Floodplain District reflects those
areas that would be inundated during a one percent annual chance or greater
flood, but for which specific flood elevations and Floodway and Floodway Fringe
limits have not been established. It is the intent of the GF General Floodplain
District to impose the development standards of the Floodway and Floodway
Fringe after a determination is made to identify the Floodway and Floodway
Fringe areas on an individual project basis.
   2.   Applicant’s Burden to Define Floodway and Floodway Fringe Boundary.
Where one percent annual chance or greater flood data has not been provided in
the Flood Insurance Study, the burden to demonstrate the boundary of the
Floodway and Floodway Fringe rests on the applicant.
   3.   Permitted Development. The following development shall be permitted
within the GF General Floodplain District to the extent they are not prohibited
by any other ordinance or underlying zoning district as defined in the Story
County Land Development Regulations and provided they do not include placement
of structures, factory-built homes, fill or other obstructions, the storage of
materials or equipment, excavation or alteration of a watercourse.
      A.   Agricultural uses such as general farming, pasture, grazing, outdoor
plant nurseries, horticulture, viticulture, truck farming, forestry, sod
farming and wild crop harvesting.
      B.   Industrial-commercial uses such as loading areas, parking areas,
airport landing strips.
      C.   Private and public recreational uses such as golf courses, tennis
courts, driving ranges, archery ranges, picnic grounds, boat launching ramps,
swimming areas, parks, wildlife and nature preserves, game farms, fish
hatcheries, shooting preserves, target ranges, trap and skeet ranges, hunting
and fishing areas, hiking and horseback riding trails.
      D.   Residential uses such as lawns, gardens, parking areas and play
areas.
      E.   Replacement or Newly Constructed Bridges and/or Culverts. The
requirement to define the floodway and floodway fringe boundary does not apply
to proposed replacement or newly constructed bridges and/or culverts wherein
the bridge and/or culvert is:
         (1)   Located in a rural (unincorporated) area where the stream drains
less than 100 square miles or in an urban (incorporated) area where the stream
drains less than two square miles; and
         (2)   Not associated with a channel modification that constitutes a
channel change as specified in 567-71.2(1)b, Iowa Administrative Code.
      In cases of bridges and/or culverts not in compliance with the
aforementioned criteria, as well as projects not associated with bridges and/or
culverts located within the GF General Floodplain, the following development
standards shall apply and review by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources is
required.
      F.   Streambank Stabilizations and Drainage Ditch Maintenance. The
requirement to define the floodway and floodway fringe boundary does not apply
to proposed drainage ditch maintenance completed by the drainage district in
accordance with Chapter 468 of the Code of Iowa and stream bank stabilizations
wherein:
         (1)   Spoils are disposed of outside of the Special Flood Hazard Area
or spread less than six inches thick in an even layer away from the top of the
bank; and
         (2)   No fill is proposed; and
         (3)   Revetment material, if proposed, is placed so that it does not
extend past the existing bank or, in the case of severe erosion so that the
resulting channel cross-section is not more restrictive than the adjacent
natural upstream and downstream channel cross-sections and the revetment
material does not extend above the adjacent top of the bank. Revetment material
shall also comply with the following best practices, as illustrated in Figure
1:
            a.   The stream bank is prepared by sloping or terracing prior to
the placement of gravel bedding and/or fabric under the revetment material.
            b.   The revetment material consists of a mixture of sizes so as to
form a dense, interlocking blanket.
            c.   The revetment material is placed on the existing or prepared
stream bank with a finished slope of no steeper than two (2) feet horizontal to
one (1) foot vertical rise.
            d.   Revetment material is restricted to field stone, quarry rock
and broken concrete. All exposed reinforcing steel shall be removed or cut
flush with the surface of the concrete prior to placement. Any concrete slabs
larger than three feet across shall be broken into smaller pieces prior to
placement. The use of asphalt or other solid waste is prohibited.
            e.   The thickness of a revetment blanket shall not exceed three
(3) feet.
            f.   A toe of revetment material to protect against scour and
erosion is also proposed.
         (4)   For mowed banks, a finished slope of no steeper than three (3)
feet horizontal to one (1) foot vertical rise is recommended.
         (5)   Other professionally accepted best practices for stream bank
stabilization may be utilized at the discretion of the Floodplain Manager or
their designee, such as those included in Iowa’s River Restoration Toolbox, as
amended by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.
      G.   The Floodplain Manager may require the floodway and floodway fringe
boundary to be defined in the case development proposed under 80.14(3)(E) or
80.14(3)(F) may increase flood levels, impede flood flows, or otherwise creates
a risk for downstream life or property.

appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason for the appeal. The
official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to the Board of
Adjustment all the documents constituting the record upon which the action
appealed from was taken.
80.23   VARIANCES.
The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in specific cases such
variances from the terms of this chapter which will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. All
variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the Iowa Department
of Natural Resources. Variances granted must meet the following applicable
standards.
   1.   Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that
the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local codes or ordinances.
   2.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the one percent annual chance or greater flood
would result. Consideration of the effects of any development on flood levels
shall be based upon the assumption that an equal degree of development would be
allowed for similarly situated lands.
   3.   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   4.   In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection
for structures than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the applicant
shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Floodplain Manager that:
(i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage;
and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
80.24   HEARINGS AND DECISIONS OF THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
   1.   Hearings. Upon the filing with the Board of Adjustment of an appeal, an
application for a conditional use or a request for a variance, the Board shall
hold a public hearing. The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing
and give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to parties in interest.
At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney and
present written or oral evidence. The Board may require the appellant or
applicant to provide such information as is reasonably deemed necessary and may
request the technical assistance and/or evaluation of a professional engineer
or other expert person or agency, including the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources.
   2.   Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal,
conditional use or variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an
appeal, the Board may, so long as such action is in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the
order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make
its decision, in writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons
for its decision. In granting a conditional use or variance, the Board shall
consider such factors as contained in this section and all other relevant
sections of this chapter and may prescribe such conditions as contained herein.
80.25   FACTORS UPON WHICH THE DECISION TO GRANT VARIANCES SHALL BE BASED.
In passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
   1.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments.
   2.   The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or downstream
to the injury of others.
   3.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.
   4.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
   5.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the

to achieving the purpose of this chapter.
   5.   Flood proofing measures. Flood proofing measures shall be designed
consistent with the flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood
velocities, durations, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and
other factors associated with the regulatory flood. The Board of Adjustment
shall require that the applicant submit a plan or document certified by a
registered professional engineer that the flood proofing measures are
consistent with the regulatory flood protection elevation and associated flood
factors for the particular area.
80.27   APPEALS TO THE COURT.
Any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision of the
Board of Adjustment may present to a court of record a petition, duly verified,
setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying
the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court
within 30 days after the filing of the decision in the office of the Board.
80.28   NONCONFORMING USES.
A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before the
passage or amendment of this chapter, but which is not in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter, may be continued subject to the following
conditions:
   1.   If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any future use
of the structure or land shall conform to this chapter.
   2.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be

accommodate land uses compatible with agriculture and to protect agricultural
land from encroachment of urban land uses. The Cornerstone to Capstone (C2C)
Comprehensive Plan designates priority agricultural land as Agricultural
Conservation Areas. These areas are intended to preserve rural character by
limiting the development of most new non-farm dwellings to large lots. In some
instances, the A-1 District permits non-farm residential development on smaller
lots in furtherance of the Cornerstone to Capstone (C2C) Comprehensive Plan
goals and objectives.
   2.   Principal Permitted Uses. Only the use of structures and/or land listed

   11.   Waivers. Whenever the tract proposed to be developed is of such
unusual size, character, or shape or is surrounded by such development or
unusual conditions that the strict application of the requirements contained in
the Ordinance would result in substantial hardships or injustices, the Board of
Supervisors upon recommendation of the Commission may waive requirements to the
end that the developer is allowed to develop the property in a reasonable
manner; provided, however, all such waivers granted hereunder shall be in
harmony with the intended spirit of the Ordinance and granted with the view
toward protecting the public interest and welfare. Application for such waiver
to the requirements of the Ordinance shall be made in writing by the developer
at the time of filing of the site development plan, and shall specifically
state the requirements and the sections of the Ordinance to be considered. In
deciding whether to grant a waiver, the Board of Supervisors shall consider all
legal principles outlined in Section 92.03(4) of this Code of Ordinances.
      A.   In no case shall any waiver be more than a minimum easing of the
requirements. In no case shall it have the effect of reducing the traffic
capacity of any street or be in conflict with any ordinance.
      B.   Recommendation by the Commission for approval of such waiver must be
the affirmative vote of the majority of the Commission membership.
      C.   In recommending waivers, the Commission may require such conditions
as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the
requirements so waived.
   12.   Modifications. Minor modifications to the approved site development
plan are permissible upon authorization by the Director.
      A.   A modification is minor if it has no substantial impact on
neighboring properties, the general public, or those intended to use or occupy
the proposed development.
      B.   All other requests for modifications to the approved site
development plan will be processed as new applications. New conditions may be
imposed by the Board of Supervisors, but the applicant retains the right to
reject such new conditions by withdrawing the request for modifications and
proceeding under the terms and conditions of the original permit.
      C.   The permit holder requesting approval of modifications shall submit
a written request (including plans as necessary) to the Director, and the
request shall specifically identify the modifications. The Director shall
determine whether the proposed modification is minor.
      D.   Approval of all modifications must be given in writing.
   13.   Permit Requirements. Permit requirements shall be in accordance with
Section 92.11, Required Permits.
   14.   Required Conditions. No use shall be permitted to be established or
maintained which by reason of its nature or manner of operation is or may
become hazardous, obnoxious, or offensive owing to the emission of odor, dust,
smoke, cinders, gas, fumes, noise, and vibrations, refuse matter or water-
carried waste. All facilities required for the discharge, collection and
treatment of liquid, solid or gaseous wastes shall be designed, constructed,
and operated in accordance with all statutes and regulations of the State of
Iowa and Story County. Conditions addressing such impacts shall be determined

system extend beyond the required setbacks for accessory uses listed in Table
86-8.
         (3)   Solar Panels. Solar panels shall be placed such that
concentrated solar radiation or glare is not directed onto nearby properties or
roadways.
         (4)   Compliance with FAA Regulations. Non-commercial SES must comply
with applicable FAA regulations.
(Ord. 317 – Apr. 24 Supp.)
         (5)   Compliance with National Electric Code. Applications for non-
commercial SES shall be accompanied by a line drawing of the electrical
components in sufficient detail to allow for a determination that the manner of
installation conforms to the National Electrical Code. This information is
frequently supplied by the manufacturer.
         (6)   Utility Notification. A non-commercial SES shall not be
installed until evidence has been given that the utility company has been
informed of the customer's intent to install an interconnected customer-owned
generator. Off-grid systems shall be exempt from this requirement.
      E.   Non-commercial towers, subject to the following standards:
         (1)   Tower Height. For property sizes under one acre the tower height
shall be limited to 80 feet. For property sizes of one acre or more, there is
no limitation on tower height, except as imposed by FAA regulations.
         (2)   Setback. The base of the tower shall be set back from all
property lines, public rights-of-way, and above ground public utility lines at
a distance no less than 115 percent of the total height of the tower.
            a.   Towers shall be allowed closer to a property line if the
applicant and abutting property owners grant permission, via recorded easement
when required setbacks cross property lines, which restrict new development
within the easements. At no time shall a tower be placed closer to a property
line if existing structures on affected properties are within 100 percent of
the total height of the tower.
         (3)   Engineer Certification. A tower shall not be erected unless the
plans and specifications for the system have received the stamped approval of
an Iowa registered engineer. However, a manufacturer may submit its standard
plans and specifications, including its soils study and foundation plans for
such a tower, for a one-time review and stamped approval by an Iowa registered
engineer as suitable for construction in any soil condition that exists in the
State of Iowa. If such one-time stamped approval is obtained, that manufacturer
may thereafter construct such tower utilizing the approved soils study and
foundation plans, without obtaining and presenting the stamped approval of an
Iowa registered engineer for each such installation.
         (4)   Compliance with FAA Regulations. Non-commercial towers must
comply with applicable FAA regulations.
(Ord. 317 – Apr. 24 Supp.)
         (5)   Insurance. A certificate of insurance shall be provided, showing
general liability insurance coverage for the installation and operation of the

87.01   SUBDIVISION PLAT REQUIRED.
   1.   A subdivision plat shall be made when land is subdivided by repeated
divisions or simultaneous divisions into three or more parcels. Repeated
divisions mean those that are done at intervals of time on or after July 1,
1990. Simultaneous divisions mean those which are done at any one time on or
after July 1, 1990. A subdivision plat shall contain all of the divisions in
the tracts being divided.
   2.   The following exceptions to this section are hereby established.
      A.   A subdivision plat shall not be required when land is divided by
conveyance to a governmental agency for public improvements.
      B.   Aliquot Parts and Government Lots. Divisions along established
aliquot part lines shall be permitted without requiring a subdivision plat.
Divisions along established government lots lines shall be permitted without
requiring a subdivision plat.
      C.   Any acquisition plat of land divided for right-of-way purposes.
      D.   Any conveyance of an easement.
      E.   Parcel Line Adjustment. A change in an existing boundary line
between two parcels of land wherein the new parcel is not meant for independent
development and is only meant to enhance the size and/or shape of the
neighboring parcel shall not require a subdivision plat. The following are
procedural steps for a parcel line adjustment:
         (1)   The enlarged parcel must be surveyed, and the new survey assigns
a new parcel letter designation to the new parcel, rather than calling it by
the same letter designation as amended. The Auditor’s Office shall be
responsible for assigning parcel letter designations.
         (2)   The following note shall be placed on the face of the survey:
This plat of survey incorporates and is amended for the Plat of Survey recorded
in the office of the Story County Recorder on __________________ and recorded
in Book/Slide_______, Page _______. New deed for new parcel must be recorded
with survey.
         (3)   A new deed for the new, entire parcel shall be recorded along
with the survey. There cannot be two separate ownership instruments on record
for the enlarged parcel.
(Ordinance No. 160)
   3.   For lots platted as part of a subdivision as established after December
31, 2006, any further division shall require a subdivision as defined in
Section
87.06,
87.07,
87.08, or
87.09 of this chapter.
(Ordinance No. 160)
   4.   For lots platted as a part of a subdivision as established prior to
December 31, 2006, each lot may be further divided one time through the Plat of
Survey process, provided, however, that the original approval of the
subdivision by the Board of Supervisors permitted further division of land. If
such permission was not granted, the only means to further divide these lots is
through the subdivision process as defined in Section
87.06,
87.07,
87.08, or
87.09 of this chapter. All lot divisions must be in conformance with the
minimum lot requirements of the applicable zoning districts and all setbacks
must be achieved.
(Ordinance No. 160)
87.02   PLAT OF SURVEY REQUIRED.
   1.   Where a lot, parcel, or tract has not been divided on or after July 1,
1990, the grantor of land that has been divided using a metes and bounds
description or a specific quantity description shall have a plat of survey made

88.05(3) shall be required and the development shall be subject to inspections
for conformance to erosion and sedimentation prevention best practices.
            b   A geotechnical analysis is encouraged to be completed and the
analysis reviewed by an Iowa licensed engineer for special design
considerations and recommendations, including for foundation design,
construction sequencing, retaining walls, slope stability, excavation, and
shoring for existing structures on the subject property and any neighboring
properties.
            c   Limits of disturbance shall be denoted on site plans, and on-
site.

Figure 1 Significant Slope Diagram
         (3)   For subdivision plats with three or more development lots,
conditional use permits, or commercial site plans submitted after the adoption
of this ordinance, the following standards shall apply:
            a.   A development envelope will be shown on the site plan or the
preliminary and/or final plat for each lot that contains significant, natural
slopes to show the area where a dwelling or other proposed development may be
sited. The development envelope shall meet the required setbacks for the
applicable zoning district and shall be large enough to accommodate a 1,200-
square-foot dwelling with a two-car garage or other proposed use.
            b.   When the development envelope includes slopes greater than or
equal to 15%, or includes an area within a buffer of two (2) feet for every one
(1) foot of vertical rise measured from the toe or summit of a significant
slope, a geotechnical analysis shall be required, and shall be submitted with
the site plan or preliminary plat. The analysis shall be completed/reviewed by
an Iowa-licensed engineer to ensure the suitability of a site for development
and any special design considerations and recommendations, including for
foundation design, construction sequencing, retaining walls, slope stability,
excavation, and shoring for existing structures on the subject property and any
neighboring properties. These recommendations may be included as conditions of
approval. Lots and/or development envelopes determined to be unsuitable for
development shall be reconfigured to provide a suitable building site that
accommodates the required development envelope.
            c.   Slopes with a grade greater than 35%, shall be considered
protected. The area within a buffer measured two (2) feet for every one (1)
foot of vertical rise, not to exceed fifty (50) feet, from the summit and toe
of a slope with a grade greater than 35%, shall also be considered protected.
These areas shall not be impacted for any reason, including by any impervious
surface such as gravel or concrete driveways, with the exception of installing
required erosion control practices, or the installation of essential utilities.
            d.   Major disturbance to the natural terrain to create a site
suitable for development is discouraged. Major disturbance includes removal of
the natural slope or terracing to create a building pad.
            e.   An erosion control plan and a plan to re-vegetate the site
shall be required, completed by a qualified professional such as an Iowa-
licensed engineer, landscape architect, or other professional certified in
erosion and sediment control plan development.
            f.   Limits of disturbance shall be denoted on site plans, and on-
site when development is proposed.
      B.   Reduction in Minimum Lot Sizes. A reduction in minimum lot size may
be allowed when 50% or more of agricultural lands are preserved as an outlot,
in an easement, or through a deed or other permanent restriction to provide
buffering to other adjacent agricultural lands or when critical natural
resources are preserved in accordance with
88.05.
         (1)   The reduction shall be allowed so that the development yield is
equivalent to a net density of one unit per acre prior to the preservation of
agricultural lands and critical natural resources.
         (2)   Lot sizes may be reduced to a minimum of 10,000 square feet. All
bulk standards for the applicable or requested zoning district shall be met.
         (3)   For the reduction to apply, the development shall meet Iowa
Department of Natural Resources requirements for minimum separation distances
for dwellings and wells from open feedlots and confined animal feeding
operations. These distances shall be maintained from existing operations.
Buffers of no less than 250 feet shall also be maintained from other
agricultural uses.
         (4)   The reduction shall be allowed only when a site evaluation is
conducted by a certified engineer or soils professional for septic systems. In
the case of a subdivision plat, the evaluation shall accompany the plat. In the
case of a major subdivision, the evaluation shall accompany the preliminary
plat.
            a.   All lots shall comply with Story County Environmental Health
or Iowa Department of Natural Resources requirements for common or private
sewage disposal systems. For lots under a half-acre, a common wastewater
treatment system may be necessary and is encouraged.
            b.   A subdrain system may be required to divert discharged
effluent away from critical natural resource areas.
(Ord. 310 – Oct. 23 Supp.)
   3.   Side Lot Lines. All side lot lines shall be substantially at right
angles or radial to street centerlines.
   4.   Double Frontage Lots. Double frontage lots shall be avoided except
where essential from major traffic arteries or to overcome specific
disadvantages of topography. Any double frontage lot extending from road to
road shall provide the required front setbacks on both roads.
   5.   Flag Lots. Flag lots shall be avoided wherever possible.
   6.   Bulk Regulations. The minimum dimensions for lots shall be in
accordance with the bulk regulations of the district within which the
subdivision is located; provided, however, the minimum depth for a development
lot shall be 100 feet and that the depth shall not be in excess of three times
the width.
   7.   Comer Lots. Comer lots shall be of such width as to permit the
maintenance of all yard requirements as required by the Ordinance.
   8.   Lots at Street Intersections. All lots at street intersections shall
have a radius of not less than 25 feet at the street comer. A greater radius
shall be required for intersections involving one or more major streets. A cut-
off or chord may be substituted for the circular arc.
   9.   Setback Lines. Setback lines shall be shown on all lots intended for
residential, commercial or industrial use. Such setback lines shall not be less
than the minimum yard requirements of the district within which the property is
located.
   10.   Required Dimensions and Setbacks. The setback of the building for
front, rear, and side yards shall in all cases be measured at a right angle
from the lot line exclusive of public right-of-way or easement to the nearest
point of the adjacent building wall of the building.
   11.   One Principal Building to a Residential Lot. There shall be no more
than one principal building on a residential lot, parcel, or tract, unless
otherwise specified in the Ordinance.
(Ord. 317 – Apr. 24 Supp.)
88.04   ACCESS REQUIREMENTS.
   1.   Driveways off Existing County Roads. All new driveways for proposed
lots, parcels or tracts that take access off an existing County road shall
maintain a 300-foot access separation distance from other driveways and 500
feet of sight distance in each direction.
      A.   Upon approval of the County Engineer, the separation distance may be
reduced in cases where special conditions require less separation distance.
   2.   Existing lots, parcels, and/or tracts.
      A.   Any lot, parcel, or tract intended for development purposes that
exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the Ordinance that
does not abut on a county or subdivision/private road shall have an exclusive,
unobstructed private easement as recorded in the Office of the Story County
Recorder.
      B.   Shared access easements shall be required in the cases where any
lot, parcel, or tract that exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of the Ordinance has frontage along an existing or proposed
subdivision/private road or county road, but does not meet the separation or
sight distance requirements for driveways set forth in Section 88.04(1).
      C.   In no case shall an easement provide access to more than four
single-family dwellings, more than two two-family dwellings, or more than two
multiple dwellings.
   3.   New lots, parcels, and/or tracts.
      A.   No new lot, parcel, or tract intended for development purposes and
created through a platting process shall be approved by the Board of
Supervisors that proposes to take access through an easement. All new lots
intended for development purposes shall abut a current or proposed county or
subdivision/private road. Lots created through the Residential Parcel
Subdivision process are exempt from these requirements.
      B.   Shared access easements shall be required in the case where any new
lot, parcel, or tract has frontage along an existing or proposed subdivision/
private road or county road, but does not meet separation or sight distance
requirements set forth in Section 88.04(1).
   4.   Access Easement Width Requirements.
      A.   In cases where access is to be provided by easement to one single-
family dwelling, an exclusive, unobstructed private easement 20 feet in width
shall be provided and recorded in the Office of the Story County Recorder. See
Figure 1.
      B.   In cases where access is to be provided by easement to two or more
single-family dwellings or for other development purposes via a single drive,
an exclusive or common easement 50 feet in width shall be provided over the
shared portion of the drive and recorded in the Office of the Story County
Recorder. See
Figure 1.

Figure 1 - Access Easement Configurations
88.05   ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURAL RESOURCE STANDARDS.
   1.   Protections for Critical Natural Resource Areas. When property is
developed, it shall be done so that the development is designed and arranged to
protect critical natural resource areas. The purpose of these standards is to
further the goals of the Cornerstone to Capstone (C2C) Plan and the Countywide
Watershed Assessment by providing protections for areas that are
environmentally or culturally significant. It is also to achieve the purpose of
the Story County Land Development regulations to balance land use rights of
individual landowners and the economic, social, and environmental concerns of
the public. Critical natural resource areas include wetlands, watercourses and
waterbodies, steep slopes, significant trees, archaeological resources, and
remnant prairies and savannas. These areas are mapped as Natural Resource Areas
on the C2C Plan Future Land Use Map. However, not all critical natural resource
areas are mapped and individual developments will need to consider site
specific characteristics. Disturbance shall be minimized and/or mitigated where
avoidance is not possible.
(Ord. 317 – Apr. 24 Supp.)
      A.   General Requirements. The following standards apply to all critical
natural resource areas that are not otherwise exempt.
         (1)   Impact. Impact to critical areas is permitted only in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter. Protected areas shall be denoted on the
site plan or subdivision plat, if applicable, and shall be marked on the site
prior to any construction activities, including any ground disturbance or
vegetation removal. Markings shall consist of lath or another marking at
maximum intervals of every 50 feet along the edge of the critical natural
resource area. A greater interval may be required as necessary to provide
visibility between the markings. Fencing or a buffer from the edge of a
resource may be required for extremely critical resources. During the
construction stage of development, the applicant shall not clean equipment or
material or store or dispose of waste such as paints, oils, solvents, asphalt,
concrete, motor oil, or other harmful material in the critical natural resource
area.
         (2)   Mitigation Plan. In all cases where mitigation is permitted and
required due to exceeding allowed thresholds for disturbance, a mitigation plan
shall be developed and implemented in accordance to the following standards.
These requirements shall not supplant regulatory mitigation required through
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or other regulatory agency or governmental
body. If the provisions under this chapter of the Story County Land Development
Regulations are in excess of another governmental entity or body’s standards,
then the County provisions shall still apply.
            a.   Qualified Professional. All mitigation plans shall be
developed and implemented by a qualified professional as defined in Chapter
85.08.
            b.   Responsible Party. The party responsible for maintenance and
their contact information, if different from the property owner or permit
applicant, shall be included.
            c.   Methods of Mitigation. Required mitigation may be accomplished
through preservation and enhancement of off-site critical natural resource
areas, reconstruction of critical natural resource areas, or a combination
thereof.
            d.   Location. All mitigation shall occur within Story County
unless the applicant can demonstrate that mitigation in accordance to this
section is not feasible within the County or otherwise permitted by a specific
resource subsection.
            e.   Standards for Permanent Protection. Areas preserved,
reconstructed, or created to meet mitigation requirements shall be permanently
protected from development through a conservation easement, deed restriction,
or donated to a public agency for protection. They shall also be placed in an
outlot in the case a subdivision plat is proposed.
               i.   Conservation easements shall be held by an accepted third
party land conservation organization (e.g. Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation,
The Nature Conservancy) or Story County Conservation.
               ii.   Land donations to public agencies would include entities
such as the Story County Conservation Board, Iowa Department of Natural
Resources, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, etc.
If donation to a public agency is infeasible, land donations to conservation
non-profits may be permissible.
               iii.   A long-term management plan, with provisions for
monitoring and reporting to the County, and a process for addressing necessary
changes due to failure of plans shall also be provided within the mitigation
plan.
               iv.   Suitable remedial action by the responsible party will be
required if all or part of a reconstructed critical area fails to become
established in the timeframe indicated in the plan.
            f.   Approval. Mitigation plans shall be approved by the Board of
Supervisors after a recommendation from the Story County Conservation Board.
               i.   If the Board of Supervisors does not approve the mitigation
plan, then no permit or other approval may be granted for a development
project.
         (3)   Conservation Easements. To provide balance between development
and protecting critical natural resource areas, conservation easements or other
permanent protections may be required over critical natural resource areas and
their applicable buffers as a condition on rezonings, subdivisions of two or
more development lots, conditional use permits, and commercial site plans.
Requiring a conservation easement as a condition will be determined by the
Board of Supervisors after the Story County Conservation Board makes a
recommendation on whether they support the easement.
         (4)   Stream Easements. Easements shall be required for watercourses
and waterbodies included in subdivisions of two or more development lots and
the easement shall include provisions for maintenance and upkeep due to
potential erosion issues.
         (5)   Violation. If a responsible party fails or refuses to meet the
requirements of the approved mitigation plan or any provision of this
ordinance, the County shall notify the party responsible for implementation and
maintenance of the mitigation plan in writing following the procedure for
Notice of Violations in Chapter 93 of the Story County Land Development
Regulations. Depending on the severity of the violation, the permitted
timeframe to submit a compliance schedule may be reduced. If the violator does
not correct/abate the violation or provide an acceptable schedule to correct/
abate the violation, or does not comply with the schedule, a citation for a
County infraction may be issued in accordance with
Chapter 93 of the Story County Land Development Regulations.
      B.   Requirements for Significant Trees and Native Woodland Shrubs.
Native trees and shrubs provide wildlife corridors and habitat for Story
County’s wildlife species. They also provide water quality benefits, supply
oxygen, and store atmospheric carbon.
         (1)   Applicability. The provisions within this section apply to all
zoning and grading permits, conditional use permits, commercial site plans, and
subdivisions of more than two (2) development lots. These shall be hereinafter
referred to as “development.” The provisions do not apply to general tree/shrub
management, i.e. thinning of trees or removal of invasive or dead/dying trees
not associated with or intended to facilitate development.
         (2)   Identification. Significant trees are native, deciduous trees
with a caliper greater than four (4) inches, measured four (4) feet off the
ground, or a native coniferous tree taller than fifteen (15) feet. Significant
native shrubs have a basal diameter of three (3) inches. Significant trees and
native shrubs that meet one or more of the following removal criteria shall be
exempt from the requirements of this subsection:
            a.   Tree stands that are low quality replantings. These shall be
identified through historic aerial imagery taken between the 1930s and 1980 to
determine cropping history and locations of old-growth stands. Stands planted
post-1980 may be considered low quality plantings.
            b.   Dead, dying or naturally fallen trees, or trees found to be a
threat to public health, safety or welfare;
            c.   Trees that are determined to substantially obstruct clear
visibility at driveways and intersections; or
            d.   Tree or shrub species identified as invasive species by the
Iowa Department of Natural Resources.
         (3)   Impact. Impact to significant trees and/or shrubs shall be
avoided where possible, and the burden of persuasion as to why impact is
unavoidable will at all times be on the applicant. Mitigation for impact to
significant trees or shrubs shall be required in Natural Resource Areas, as
mapped on the C2C Plan Future Land Use Map. Cut or fill over a four-inch depth
or compaction within the drip line of any significant tree shall be considered
impact. The following mitigation standards shall be required in addition to
those general standards in Chapter 88.05(1)(A).
(Ord. 317 – Apr. 24 Supp.)
            a.   Zoning and grading permits for parcels intended for
residential development, or for subdivision lots created before the adoption of
this ordinance, may impact up to one (1) acre of significant trees and/or
shrubs without mitigation. Impacts over one (1) acre shall require mitigation.
            b.   Commercial site plans, conditional use permits, or subdivision
plats of more than two (2) development lots may impact up to 15% or five (5)
acres, whichever is less, of the wooded acres on a development site (including
across multiple parcels or phases of development). Impacts over 15% or five (5)
acres, whichever is less, shall require mitigation.
            c.   Prior to impact, a replacement plan or mitigation plan shall
be submitted as part of a development application.
               i.   For zoning and grading permits, a replacement plan may be
approved by the Planning and Development Director in lieu of a mitigation plan
approved by the Board of Supervisors. The replacement plan shall outline why
the impact is unavoidable and include a site plan showing where trees are being
replanted and the number and species.
               ii.   For subdivisions creating more than two development lots,
conditional use permits, and commercial site plans, a mitigation plan shall be
completed by a qualified professional and shall include additional information
regarding the long-term management of the wooded area(s), including outlining
when it may be necessary to remove native trees or shrubs due to overgrowth and
for the overall health of the wooded area(s). When the removal of native,
significant trees and/or shrubs is deemed appropriate by a qualified
professional for the overall health of the wooded area(s), such removal shall
not count towards replacement ratios. A qualified professional may be a
professional in natural resource science or management, or forestry.
            d.   The replacement or mitigation plan shall also meet and or/
address the following standards:
               i.   Replacement trees shall be planted either on the
development site or in an alternative planting site within Story County when
infeasible. Allowable alternative planting sites are the following: County-
owned parks or preserves; eligible areas undergoing riparian buffer
improvements; privately owned land under a conservation easement or in a land
trust, with permission of the property owner. Planting areas shall be
appropriate locations for native trees based on where old growth forests
currently, or historically, are located, and shall not cause detriment to other
critical natural resource areas and shall be appropriate for the tree or shrub
species involved.
               ii.   For zoning and grading permits requiring mitigation, a
significant tree or shrub that is impacted shall be replaced at a ratio of 1:1,
and a 20% mortality buffer shall be added to the total number of replacement
trees or shrubs (e.g. if thirty (30) trees are the minimum needed for the
replacement ratio, then at least thirty-six (36) shall be planted). Replacement
costs shall be at the applicant’s expense.
               iii.   For commercial site plans, conditional use permits, or
subdivisions of more than two development lots, significant trees or shrubs
shall be replaced at a minimum ratio of 1:1. A greater ratio, up to 6:1, may be
required if recommended by a qualified professional based on species and size.
A 20% mortality buffer shall be added to the total number of replacement trees
or shrubs (e.g. if thirty (30) trees are the minimum needed for the replacement
ratio, then at least thirty-six (36) shall be planted). Replacement costs shall
be at the applicant’s expense.
               iv.   Replacement trees and/or shrubs shall meet the following
minimum size requirements and shall be primarily native species in order to
restore and enhance the site as nearly as practicable to its pre-settlement
character. Coniferous trees shall not be permitted as replacement trees.
               Deciduous Trees—one and one-half inch (1.5 inch) caliper
               Native Shrubs—five gallon pot size
      C.   Requirements for Wetlands. Wetlands provide wildlife habitat,
downstream water quality protection, and natural flood/stormwater attenuation.
         (1)   Applicability. The provisions within this section shall be
applicable to all proposed rezonings, conditional use permits, commercial site
plans, and subdivisions of more than two (2) development lots. These shall be
hereinafter referred to as “development.” Zoning permits and grading permits on
subdivision lots established before the adoption of this ordinance, or on
unplatted parcels or tracts, are exempt. The provisions do not apply to general
management, i.e. mowing of vegetation.
         (2)   Identification. When an application for development is
submitted, the following identifying features and sources shall be referenced
to identify wetlands. Applicants are encouraged to consult these sources prior
to making a submittal.
            a.   Wetlands identified on the Story County Countywide Watershed
Assessment maps and/or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetland
Inventory.
            b.   Hydric soils identified on the Story County Soil Survey maps.
            c.   Depressions and evidence of ponding on U.S. Geological Survey
Topographic Maps and aerial imagery.
            d.   Soil borings provided by a registered soil engineer and/or a
survey of plant material completed by a botanist, landscape architect,
engineer, or other qualified professional.
         (3)   Wetland Delineation Required. When development is proposed
within one hundred and fifty (150) feet of an identified wetland, a qualified
wetland specialist shall be hired to provide wetland delineation. The
delineation shall use the methods in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Wetland
Delineation Manual and Regional Supplement. If the delineation occurs outside
of the normal growing season, the applicant may be required to amend the
delineation with information on plant species during the growing season, if
vegetation may impact the wetland classification. The delineation shall be
completed at the applicant’s expense.
            a.   Wetland Classification. The delineation shall classify the
wetland based on the following types. When the areas of any wetland are
hydrologically connected and/or have contiguous buffers, the connected areas
shall be added together to determine the wetland's size for wetland
classification purposes. Vegetation classes identified during the delineation
shall adhere to those adopted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the
National Wetland Plant List Indicator Rating Definitions and current National
Wetland Plant List.
               Class 1 Wetlands.
               i.   Wetlands that are used by species listed by the federal or
state government as endangered or threatened, or which have an outstanding
natural habitat for those species; or
               ii.   Wetlands which have forty to sixty percent open waters in
dispersed patches with two or more wetland vegetation classes; or
               iii.   Wetlands which are equal to or greater than ten (10)
acres in size and have three or more wetland vegetation classes, one of which
is an aquatic bed wetland; or
               iv.   Wetlands with plant associations of infrequent occurrence
according to the Iowa Coefficient of Conservatism (a Coefficient score greater
than or equal to seven).
               Class 2 Wetlands.
               i.   Wetlands which are greater than one acre in size; or
               ii.   Wetlands which are equal to or less than one acre in size,
and have three or more wetland vegetation classes; or
               iii.   Wetlands which are equal to or less than one acre in size
and with a forested wetland vegetation class.
               Class 3 Wetlands.
               i.   Wetlands which are equal to or less than one acre in size
and have two or fewer wetland vegetation classes.
            b.   Restoration Recommendations. The delineation shall also
include recommendations to improve the wetland’s function, including removal of
invasive species and drain tiles, reseeding and planting, ongoing maintenance
recommendations, and restoring the vegetative buffer around the wetland area.
         (4)   Implementation. After a delineation is completed and the wetland
(s) is classified in accordance with the wetland classification section, the
proposed development shall comply with the following:
            a.   Buffering. The following buffers are required around the
delineated area:
               i.   Class 1 Wetlands: One hundred (100) feet.
               ii.   Class 2 Wetlands: Seventy-five (75) feet.
               iii.   Class 3 Wetlands: Fifty (50) feet.
            b.   Activities Allowed. Only the following activities are allowed
in buffer areas:
               i.   Minor land-disturbing activities for erosion control or
revegetation.
               ii.   Fencing.
               iii.   Utilities.
               iv.   Unpaved trails and paths.
            c.   Buffer Averaging. Buffers may be averaged so that the total
area of the buffer is not reduced, and the width of the buffer at any one point
is not decreased by more than fifty (50) percent of the required buffer width,
if the following is demonstrated by the wetland delineation:
               i.   The wetland is less than one (1) acre in area; and
               ii.   Does not contain species listed by the federal or state
government as endangered or threatened, or critical or outstanding natural
habitat for those species; and
               iii.   Does not contain diverse plant associations of infrequent
occurrence or of regional significance; and
               iv.   Buffer averaging will improve the buffer function, wetland
protection, and/or enhance the vegetative cover; and
               v.   The area being removed from the buffer does not contain
other critical natural resource areas or act as a buffer for those areas, such
as native trees or prairie remnants.
            d.   Buffer Reduction. The Story County Conservation Board may make
recommendations to the Board of Supervisors regarding reductions in required
buffer sizes. The Board of Supervisors may approve plans where the required
buffer is reduced in size by no more than (50) percent of the required buffer
width when sufficient protective measures are in place to identify and protect
a wetland(s) from impacts, such as fencing installed by a developer. This shall
not apply in conjunction with buffer averaging. The reduction in buffer size
may not result in any impacts, as determined by a qualified wetland specialist,
to:
               i.   Species listed by the federal or state government as
endangered or threatened, or critical or outstanding natural habitat for those
species; or
               ii.   Diverse plant associations of infrequent occurrence or of
regional significance; or
               iii.   The function or health of the wetland, including ensuring
a sufficient vegetated area around the wetland is maintained to filter
pollutants or slow surface runoff; and
               iv.   The area being removed shall not contain other critical
natural resource areas or act as a buffer for those areas, such as native trees
or prairie remnants.
         (5)   Impact. To meet the goal of no net-loss of wetlands in Story
County, impact to delineated wetlands, including, but not limited to, grading
and earth disturbance, construction, vegetation removal, and vehicle or heavy
machinery movement, shall be limited to the following when permitted based on
the wetland class: management activities necessary for restoration and
maintenance of the wetland; infrastructure necessary for access to a property,
such as drive entrances and access roads; and rural water lines, gas lines, or
other public utilities. These impacts shall be the minimum necessary to
accomplish the needs of the infrastructure project or utility installation.
Wetlands shall not be used for stormwater retention or detention basins. If
impacts are permitted, the applicant shall provide a written statement from the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers stating that development fully complies with all
applicable federal wetland regulation as established in the Clean Water Act.
            a.   Class 1 Wetlands. Shall not be impacted for any purpose other
than public infrastructure projects.
            b.   Class 2 and Class 3 Wetlands. Impact shall only be allowed
when the impacts are strictly for the infrastructure and utility installation
listed in
88.05(1)(C)(5). The applicant shall demonstrate that avoiding and minimizing
the impact to a wetland is unreasonable and that siting said infrastructure in
other locations is infeasible.
         (6)   Compensatory Mitigation. Compensatory mitigation is required for
any delineated wetland impact that equals or exceeds one tenth (0.10) of an
acre. The following mitigation standards shall be required in addition to those
general standards in Chapter
88.05(1)(A):
            a.   Mitigation areas for wetlands shall be located in the same
HUC-12 subwatershed as the original wetland. If that is shown to be infeasible,
then the same HUC-10 could be used upon extenuating circumstances and with
approval as part of the mitigation plan.
            b.   For mitigation areas preserving existing wetlands off-site,
wetlands shall be preserved at a ratio of 1:1. For mitigation areas
reconstructing or creating wetlands, wetlands shall be replaced at a ratio of
2:1. For mitigation areas restoring previously drained or impacted wetlands,
wetlands shall be restored at a ratio of 2:1.
            c.   Story County Conservation shall approve of all seeds used in
the mitigation area prior to planting. No invasive or foreign species shall be
planted in the mitigation area.
         (7)   Restoration. Restoration to improve the wetland’s function,
including removal of invasive species and drain tiles, reseeding and planting,
restoring the vegetative buffer around the wetland area, and placing the area
in a conservation easement that includes provisions for ongoing maintenance,
may be required as a condition of the applicable permit for the development.
When the wetland in question is a farmed wetland and commercial or residential
development is proposed, restoration of the farmed wetland shall be required.
      D.   Requirements for Watercourses and Waterbodies. Watercourses and
waterbodies are areas that store and/or convey surface water, including but not
limited to rivers, streams, creeks, drainageways, ponds, and lakes. These areas
provide floodwater conveyance and storage, and their riparian areas improve
water quality. Additionally, they provide habitat and recreational
opportunities. The requirements of this section shall be in addition to the
applicant’s obligation to satisfy all other applicable local, state, or federal
regulations and permits.
         (1)   Applicability. The provisions within this section apply to all
zoning and grading permits, conditional use permits, commercial site plans, and
subdivisions with two (2) or more development lots. These shall be hereinafter
referred to as “development.”
         (2)   Identification. The existence of watercourses and waterbodies
shall be identified or ruled out in accordance with the following procedures:
            a.   Use of Story County Countywide Watershed Assessment maps,
critical resource area maps, or FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) may be
used to identify or rule out the existence of watercourses and waterbodies.
         (3)   Implementation. If watercourses or waterbodies are located on
the site, the proposed use and development shall comply with the following:
            a.   Buffering. An undisturbed buffer shall be provided in
accordance to the following requirements:
               i.   Rivers and streams within the Special Flood Hazard Area
(SFHA) for which no floodway is identified on the effective Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) shall require a minimum 50-foot undisturbed buffer on each side
of the stream’s belt width, which is the stream flows measured between the
outsides of opposing meander bends. (See Figure 2)
               ii.   Rivers and streams within the SFHA for which floodway is
identified on effective FIRM maps shall require a minimum 75-foot undisturbed
buffer on each side of the floodway boundary, measured from the edge of the
floodway boundary, or the belt width as described for streams with no floodway,
whichever creates the largest stream buffer.
               iii.   Other mapped watercourses and surface waterbodies not
within the SFHA shall have an undisturbed buffer 50 feet in width, measured
from the edge of the watercourse or surface waterbody.
               iv.   The buffer size shall be required to be increased to cover

               vii.   Public water supply intake or public wastewater outfall
structures
               viii.   Public access facilities that must be on the water,
including boat ramps, docks, foot trails leading directly to the stream or
watercourse, fishing platforms, and overlooks
               ix.   Utility lines and easements running parallel with the
stream, except that all easements (permanent and construction) and clearing and
grading shall recognize the sensitivity of the streams and use Best Management
Practices (BMPs) to limit and repair the disturbance within the buffer area.
This includes such impervious cover as necessary for the operation and
maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents, and
valve structures.
         (4)   Impact. Development shall be designed to avoid and minimize
impact to all streams and watercourses. Development in the floodplain is
discouraged. Watercourse alterations or relocations (channel changes and
modifications) or any proposed development in the floodplain shall be in
accordance with Chapter 80 Floodplain Management Program of the Story County
Code of Ordinances or other State or Federal requirements. Only the following
types of development shall be permitted to encroach on a required buffer:
management activities necessary for restoration and maintenance of the stream
or watercourse; infrastructure necessary for access to a property, such as
drive entrances and access roads; and rural water lines, gas lines, or other
public utilities. These impacts shall be the minimum necessary to accomplish
the needs of the infrastructure project or utility installation.
         (5)   Restoration. Restoration to improve riparian buffer areas along
watercourses and waterbodies, including removal of invasive species and drain
tiles, reseeding and planting, restoring the riparian buffer, and placing the
area in a conservation easement that includes provisions for ongoing
maintenance, may be required as a condition of a rezoning, conditional use
permit, commercial site plan, and/or subdivision with more than two development
lots.
      E.   Requirements for Prairie Remnants and Savanna Remnants. Prairie
remnants are characterized by areas containing an association of native
grasses, sedges, and forbs. Savanna remnants are characterized by a mixed
association of native trees and shrubs in grassland and forbs. The native trees
are open grown and are frequently oaks and hickories. Prairie remnants and
savanna remnants provide habitat to Story County’s wildlife species and
pollinators, reduce soil erosion, and improve water quality through
infiltration. Determination of prairie remnants and savanna remnants shall be
made by a qualified professional.
         (1)   Applicability. The provisions within this section shall be
applicable to all proposed rezonings, conditional use permits, commercial site
plans, and subdivisions with more than two (2) development lots. These shall be
hereinafter referred to as “development.” Zoning permits and grading permits on
subdivision lots established before the adoption of this ordinance, or on
unplatted parcels or tracts, are exempt. The provisions do not apply to general
tree/shrub management, i.e. thinning of trees or removal of invasive or dead/
dying trees not associated with or intended to facilitate development.
         (2)   Identification. When an application for development is received,
identification of prairie remnants and/or savanna remnants shall be made in
accordance with the following procedures:
            a.   Review of critical natural areas mapping.
            b.   Use of historic aerial photographs to determine cropping
history of the property. Unplowed or uncropped prairies and savannas shall be
considered remnants.
            c.   If the above procedures do not definitively rule out a prairie
remnant or savanna remnant, a qualified professional shall complete an on-site
assessment during the prairie growing season, between June 15th and August
15th. A prairie remnant and savanna remnant may only be identified by the flora
present, not soil type. For savanna remnants, large (greater than eighteen (18)
inches diameter breast height), open grown, native trees, such as Oak or
Hickory, must be present.
         (3)   Prairie Remnant and/or Savanna Remnant Delineation Required. If
development is proposed within one hundred fifty (150) feet of a prairie
remnant and/or savanna remnant, the full extent of the remnant shall be
delineated by a qualified professional such as a biologist or ecologist. The
delineation shall be completed at the applicant’s expense.
            a.   Restoration Recommendations. The delineation shall also
include recommendations to improve the prairie remnant and/or savanna remnant,
including removal of invasive species, reseeding and planting, ongoing
maintenance recommendations, and restoring and/or creating a vegetative buffer
around the remnant.
         (4)   Implementation. After delineation of a prairie remnant and/or
savanna remnant, the proposed use or development shall comply with the
following standards:
            a.   Buffering. A one-hundred (100) foot vegetated buffer is
required around all delineated prairie remnant and savanna remnant, following
the delineation’s restoration recommendations.
            b.   Buffer Reduction. The Story County Conservation Board may make
recommendations to the Board of Supervisors regarding reductions in required
buffer sizes. The Board of Supervisors may approve plans where the required
buffer is reduced in size by no more than (50) percent of the required buffer
width when sufficient protective measures are in place to identify and protect
a prairie remnant and/or savanna remnant from impacts, such as fencing or
subdrains installed by a developer. The reduction in buffer size may not result
in any impacts to:
               i.   Species listed by the federal or state government as
endangered or threatened, or critical or outstanding natural habitat for those
species; or
               ii.   Diverse plant associations of infrequent occurrence or of
regional significance; or
               iii.   The function or health of the prairie remnant and/or
savanna remnant, including ensuring a sufficient vegetated area around the
prairie remnant and/or savanna remnant to filter pollutants or slow surface
runoff; and
               iv.   The area being removed shall not contain other critical
natural resource areas or act as a buffer for those areas, such as native trees
or wetlands.
         (5)   Impact. Impact to delineated prairie remnant and savanna
remnant, including, but not limited to, grading and earth disturbance,
construction, vegetation removal, and vehicle or heavy machinery movement,
shall be limited to the following: management activities necessary for
restoration and maintenance of the remnant; and rural water lines, gas lines,
or other public utilities. These impacts shall be the minimum disturbance
necessary to accomplish the needs of the infrastructure project or utility
installation. Trenchless construction methods may be required.
         (6)   Mitigation. The following mitigation standards shall be required
in addition to those general standards in Chapter
88.05(1)(A).
            a.   In cases where delineated prairie remnant and/or savanna
remnant exists on the site and impact to the prairie remnant and/or savanna
remnant is allowed as outlined in
88.05(1)(E)(5), the following mitigation procedures shall be required. In all
instances, impacted prairie shall be mitigated with prairie, and impacted
savanna shall be mitigated with savanna:
               i.   For mitigation areas preserving existing prairie and/or
savanna off-site, prairies and/or savannas shall be preserved at a ratio of 1:
1. For mitigation areas reconstructing or creating prairie and/or savanna,
prairie and/or savanna shall be replaced at a ratio of 2:1.
               ii.   Story County Conservation shall approve of all seeds,
plugs, and species used in the mitigation area prior to planting. The seed mix
shall be equivalent to the Natural Resources Conservation Service CP42
pollinator mix or another Story County Conservation approved planting plan,
with local ecotype seed only, and a ratio of 10 grass seeds to 30 forb seeds
per square foot.
         (7)   Restoration. Restoration to improve the prairie remnant and/or
savanna remnant, including removal of invasive species, reseeding and planting,
restoring the vegetative buffer around the remnant, and placing the area in a
conservation easement that includes provisions for ongoing maintenance, may be
required as a condition of the applicable permit or rezoning for the
development.
      F.   Requirements for Archaeological Resources. Those areas containing
significant sites of archaeological resources, such as Native American mounds
and burial sites, which contain material remains of past human life or of
archaeological interest. The requirements of this section shall be in addition
to the applicant’s obligation to satisfy all other applicable local, state, or
federal regulations and permits.
         (1)   Applicability. The provisions within this section shall be
applicable to all proposed commercial and industrial development and site
plans, subdivisions with more than two (2) development lots, rezonings, and
conditional use permits within six-hundred fifty (650) feet of a stream.
         (2)   Identification. An archaeological assessment shall be conducted
for the entire property to determine whether burial sites and Native American
mounds exist on site, in accordance to the following procedures:
            a.   The applicant shall conduct a search of the Iowa Site File for
archaeological sites recorded within a one-mile radius of the proposed
development through the University of Iowa Office of the State Archaeologist
(OSA). The applicant shall indicate in their request to the OSA that the search
is required to comply with the Story County Land Development Regulations
Chapter
88.05 Environmental and Natural Resource Standards. The OSA report will
identify and evaluate known surveys and archaeological resources and include
recommendations for further archaeological investigations.
            b.   If OSA does not recommend an archaeological survey, written
notice as such from the OSA will suffice for completing this requirement.
            c.   If OSA recommends an archaeological survey, the applicant
shall engage a qualified consultant from the Association of Iowa Archaeologists
(AIA) Consultants List to complete the survey.
            d.   The consultant shall provide an electronic report of the
survey to the Planning and Development Director and OSA. OSA may review the
report to determine its adequacy using standard AIA guidelines. The report
shall include recommendations regarding further archaeological investigations
and appropriate research questions to assist in the event of mitigation.
         (3)   Implementation. If burial sites and/or Native American mounds
are found on site, the applicant shall proceed in accordance with the
following:
            a.   Buffering. A buffer zone shall be established that measures
one hundred (100) feet, or as requested by Native American Nations (or other
appropriate descendent communities) around the burial site and/or Native
American mounds.
         (4)   Impact. The critical area and its buffer area shall be left
undisturbed except for non-invasive/non-ground-disturbing management practices.
         (5)   Mitigation. The following mitigation standards shall be required
in addition to those general standards in Chapter
88.05(1)(A).
            a.   Disturbance to the buffer area and/or reduction in buffer size
shall only be permitted after recommendation from OSA, which may include
consultation between Native American Nations (or other appropriate descendent
communities), OSA, the State Historic Preservation Office, the Planning and
Development Director, and funding agencies involved to determine mitigation
measures.
            b.   A programmatic agreement or memorandum of understanding or
agreement (MOA) or other appropriate protection measures may be developed as
part of the recommendation.
   2.   Common Open Space Requirement. In all major subdivisions of 10
development lots or more there shall be a minimum of 15 percent of the
subdivision dedicated or reserved as common open space, as defined in Section
85.08, Definitions.

the violator does not correct/abate the violation or provide an acceptable
schedule to correct/abate the violation or does not comply with the schedule, a
citation for a County infraction may be issued in accordance with Chapter 93 of
the Story County Land Development Regulations.
      E.   Exemptions. The following exemptions to the Stormwater Management
Plan requirement may apply; however, such uses shall not be exempt from adopted
Floodplain Management Ordinance (codified in Chapter 80 of this Code of
Ordinances) or other State or Federal requirements.
         (1)   Agricultural. Except to the extent required to implement Section
335.2, Code of Iowa, as amended, the Stormwater Management Plan requirement
shall not apply to development that is primarily adapted, by reason of nature
or area, for use for agricultural purposes, while so used.
         (2)   County, State, or Federal Government. County, state, or federal
governments shall not be required to submit a Stormwater Management Plan for
the maintenance and/or construction of county roads and public road right-of-
way.
         (3)   Maintenance of Legally Established Development. The maintenance
of development that has legally occurred prior to the adoption of this
Ordinance (Ord. 285), shall not be counted towards the threshold for submitting
a Stormwater Management Plan of one-acre disturbed or one-acre disturbed as
part of a common development plan if the footprint of the maintenance work is
within or the same area as that previously disturbed.
         (4)   When infiltration is infeasible due to the natural or existing
physical characteristics of a site including, but not limited to, if the
surface and underlying soils are NRCS Group D or have minimum infiltration rate
less than .52 inch/hour, the measured groundwater elevation is less than four
feet below the basin invert or infiltration surface, bedrock or impervious
soils are less than four feet below the infiltration surface, recommended
setbacks from site features (property lines, structures, septic systems, and
wells) in the Iowa Stormwater Management Manual cannot be met, or where
hotspots or contaminated soil make infiltration-oriented BMPs hazardous, the
site shall be designed to provide water quality treatment for the runoff
resulting from a rainfall depth of 1.25 inches and alternative practices such
as a treatment train, constructed wetlands/wetland forebays, retention ponds/
extended detention ponds, filters (sand-peat, underground sand, perimeter sand
filter, organic sand, pocket sand filter, gravel, others), grassed/vegetated
swales and channels, and vegetated filter strips shall be implemented to the
maximum extent practical with the goal of an 80% reduction in of the annual
average post-development total suspended soilds (TSS) load. The site
limitations shall be identified in the Stormwater Management Plan.
88.06   VISION CLEARANCE.
In all districts, no fence, hedge, wall, sign, trees, or other obstruction
shall be permitted which obstructs the view of approaching vehicles three and
one-half feet above the traveled portion of a roadway within the area of a
triangle formed by the center of the intersection and points 150 feet from the
center of the intersection when measured along the centerlines of the
intersecting roads.
88.07   FENCES AND WALLS.
   1.   In any A-1, A-2, A-R, R-1, R-2, and RMH District, on any lot used for
residential purposes, fences, and walls not exceeding eight feet in height are
permitted within the limits of the side and rear yards. A fence or wall not
exceeding four and one-half feet in height is permitted within the limits of
the required front yard setback (front setback area). In the case of retaining
walls or supporting embankments, the above requirements shall apply to the
ground surface of the retained embankment. The maximum height of the fence or
wall within the limits of the front yard may be raised to six feet if
constructed to be non-view-obscuring (not in excess of 50 percent opacity) when
it exceeds four and one-half feet.
   2.   In all other districts, fences and walls are permitted not exceeding
eight feet in height within the limits of the yard.
   3.   In all cases, fences shall be constructed with the best side facing the
neighboring land user. All structural components shall be located on the inside
of the fence.
   4.   In no case shall razor wire, barbed wire, or concertina wire be used
for fencing materials in any A-R, R-1, R-2, and RMH District. Fences shall be
located within the boundaries of the property and shall be able to be
maintained from the same property upon which it is located.
   5.   A fence or wall of at least four feet in height and designed to prevent
unintentional access by a child shall enclose all outdoor in-ground swimming
pools. Prior to construction, an Application for a Zoning Permit, as defined in
Section 92.11, Required Permits, shall be submitted for review and action.
Above-ground pools less than four feet in height or with stairways, ladders, or
other accesses shall be appropriately secured to prevent unintentional access
by a child. A zoning permit is not required for above-ground pools.
   6.   No regulation contained in this section shall apply for fences as
governed by Chapter 359A of the Code of Iowa, as amended.
88.08   PARKING AND CIRCULATION STANDARDS.
This section is intended to provide standards to ensure well-designed and
efficient parking layout and circulation. Parking lots shall conform to the
following minimum standards:
   1.   Compliance with Code of Federal Regulations. Accessible parking spaces
shall be consistent with the requirements of Chapter I of Title 28 of the Code
of Federal Regulations, Part 36, Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability
by Public Accommodations and in Commercial Facilities, as amended.
   2.   Locating Near Entrances. All accessible spaces shall be located as
close as possible to the nearest accessible building entrance.
   3.   Minimum Number of Accessible Parking Spaces. Each parking lot shall
contain at least the minimum specified number of accessible parking spaces as
defined in the 2010 American Disability Act (ADA) Standards for Accessible
Design, as amended.
   4.   Circulation and Pavement Markings. Parking lots shall provide well-
defined circulation routes for vehicles and pedestrians. All parking spaces
shall be clearly marked. Appropriately placed pavement markings shall be
employed where necessary to guide internal circulation and traffic ingress and
egress. Parking lots and parking spaces may be defined with railroad ties,
raised concrete strips, reflective raised pavement markers, standard "car
bumpers", and/or landscaping.
   5.   Perpendicular Parking Bays. Parking bays shall be perpendicular to the
land uses they serve to the maximum extent feasible.
   6.   Pedestrian Walkways. Commercial parking lots shall include walkways
that are located in places that are logical and convenient for pedestrians.
   7.   Mitigating Impacts from Deliveries and/or Truck Traffic. All
developments that anticipate deliveries and/or truck traffic that may adversely
affect adjacent property owners by creating noise, dust or odor problems shall
avoid or mitigate those impacts either through physical design or operational
procedures.
   8.   Loading Zones and Service Areas. Where applicable, loading zones and
service areas shall be adequately sized to accommodate the types of vehicles
that use them.
   9.   Off-Street Loading Areas. In any district in connection with every
building or part thereof hereafter erected having a gross floor area of 6,000
square feet or more, which is to be occupied by manufacturing, storage,

through the lowest direct light emitting part of the luminaire.
      B.   Lighting of construction projects and outdoor recreational
facilities (public or private), including, but not limited to, football fields,
soccer fields, baseball fields, softball fields, tennis courts, swimming pools,
special event or show areas, shall meet the following conditions:
         (1)   All fixtures used for such lighting shall be fully shielded or
be designed or provided with sharp cut-off capability, so as to minimize up-
light, spill-light, and glare.
         (2)   Illumination of the playing field, court, track, pool, or event
site, after midnight is prohibited except to conclude a scheduled event that
was scheduled to be completed before 11:00 p.m. that circumstances prevented
concluding before 11:00 p.m.
         (3)   Temporary outdoor light fixtures for uses incidental to
construction work shall only be illuminated when construction work is occurring
and removed upon completion or abandonment of the construction work.
      C.   The use of laser source light or any similar high intensity light
for outdoor advertising or entertainment when projected above the horizontal
plane is prohibited.
      D.   The operation of searchlights for advertising purposes is
prohibited.
      E.   Legally established nonconforming luminaries may be replaced with a
like kind of luminaire unless more than 50 percent of the like kind of
luminaires on the same premises are being replaced.
      F.   All nonexempt outdoor light fixtures shall be designed, installed,
and maintained to prevent light trespass and/or mitigate light pollution.
Outdoor light fixtures shall be installed and thereafter maintained so as not
to cause direct light from the luminaire to be directed toward residential
buildings on adjacent or nearby properties and/or land, or rights-of-way. If
such condition should occur, the luminaire shall be redirected or its light
output shall be controlled as necessary to eliminate such condition.
   3.   Exempted Light Sources. The following are exempted from this section:
      A.   Any light source producing 1,800 lumens or less;
      B.   All temporary emergency lighting needed by emergency services, as
well as all vehicular luminaries;
      C.   All hazard warning luminaires required by Federal regulatory
agencies;
      D.   A building or structure that has been designated for historic
preservation by the State of Iowa, or the National Park Service, shall be
exempt from the "fully shielded" requirements, if a historic restoration cannot
be achieved by other means.
88.10   SCREENING OF MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT AND REFUSE COLLECTION AREAS.
   1.   Loading docks, truck parking, outside storage, shipping containers,
trash collection, utility meters, HVAC equipment, mechanical equipment,
material and equipment storage yards and other service functions located in the
C-LI Commercial/Light Industrial or HI Heavy Industrial Districts or permitted
by a home business or conditional use permit shall be incorporated into the
overall design and landscaping or be screened from view by a screening fence at
least 75 percent opaque or compact hedge of sufficient height and density to
screen the view at maturity or within three years, whichever is first, so that
the visual and acoustical impacts of these functions are fully contained and
out of view from adjacent properties and public streets.
   2.   Rooftop mechanical units, flues, and vents shall be organized and
screened so as to not be visible from adjacent properties and public streets.
88.11   MINIMUM LANDSCAPING STANDARDS.
   1.   Minimum Landscaping. An area equivalent to at least 20 percent
impervious surface of a property to be developed (excluding single-family and
two-family dwellings) shall be planted as landscaped areas. The landscaped
areas shall be designed and placed so as to achieve the maximum capture and
filtration of storm water originating from the property.
   2.   Parking Lot Landscaping. Parking lots of more than five spaces shall
plant live trees within and on the perimeter of the parking lots at the minimum
ratio of one tree for every five parking spaces or fraction thereof. Canopy
tree cover established on site shall be designed and planted in a manner that
generally achieves a minimum of 50 percent coverage of paved surface at
maturity.
88.12   FRONTAGE ROAD REQUIREMENT.
Frontage road easements of 50 feet plus a buffer strip of 10 feet and a
frontage road with shared entrances shall be provided whenever two or more
permitted uses exist on abutting lots or within 1,320 feet of each other when
property is zoned A-2, Agribusiness, C-LI, Commercial/Light Industrial, or HI,
Heavy Industrial. Frontage road access points shall occur at intervals of not
less than 1,320 feet or four per mile. These requirements may be waived at the
discretion of the Story County Engineer if predicted traffic volumes associated
with existing and proposed land uses do not indicate declines in existing level
of service standards.
88.13   TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS AND STUDY.
   1.   Purpose.
      A.   To allow Story County to determine the safety and congestion
impacts, and related consequences, of proposed major traffic generating uses;
      B.   To require that applicants respond with reasonable proposals to
resolve potential negative traffic impacts that their proposed uses will have
on the county and other nearby streets;
      C.   To recognize that sufficient federal, state and county funds are not
always available to resolve traffic issues caused by private development;
      D.   To assist in carrying out Chapter 5, Land Use, and Chapter 7,
Transportation, of the Story County Cornerstone to Capstone (C2C) Comprehensive
Plan and the Story County Land Development Regulations;
(Ord. 317 – Apr. 24 Supp.)
      E.   To ensure that county roads bordering a subdivision or land
development are coordinated and of such widths, grades, and surface types and
in such locations as deemed necessary to accommodate proposed traffic and to
facilitate adequate safety protection;
      F.   To assist the Story County Engineer in evaluating existing county
roads in the vicinity of proposed subdivisions and other land development for
traffic levels, future capacity, road conditions, and needed transportation
improvements;
      G.   To ensure that the access into and out of subdivisions and other
land developments is reasonably safe; and
      H.   To assist in assuring all new transportation systems will be
compatible with the existing county transportation network to promote
efficiency and safety.
   2.   Administration.
      A.   A Traffic Impact Analysis is required for all proposed commercial or
industrial development (as defined in Chapter 88.01 General Regulations)
including those requiring a conditional use permit and for major residential
subdivisions (as defined in Chapter 87.09 Major Subdivision Plats) when a
proposed development will generate equal to or greater than 100 new vehicle
trips per day. The Traffic Impact Analysis shall be submitted with the
application. The Story County Engineer may require a Traffic Impact Analysis
when less than 100 new vehicle trips per day will be generated if there are
safety or roadway/intersection capacity deficiencies or when two or more
proposed developments will generate equal to or greater than 100 new vehicle
trips per day.
      B.   A Traffic Impact Study may be required by the Story County Engineer,
Board of Supervisors, or Board of Adjustment, based on the results of the
traffic impact analysis, including impacts of the development on roadway and
intersection operating conditions, levels of service, or due to a high
incidence of accidents. If required, the traffic impact study shall be
submitted prior to consideration by the Board of Supervisors or Board of
Adjustment.
      C.   The Traffic Impact Analysis and/or Traffic Impact Study shall be
prepared by an Iowa licensed professional engineer with expertise in the
preparation of traffic impact studies.
      D.   The full cost of the Traffic Impact Analysis and/or Traffic Impact
Study shall be the applicant's expense.
      E.   Proposed improvements identified in the Traffic Impact Analysis and/
or Traffic Impact Study shall be reviewed and evaluated by the Story County
Engineer and Board of Supervisors and may be included as a county project with
the annual adoption of the Story County Capital Improvements Plan and budget at
the discretion of the Board of Supervisors.

90.01   STATEMENT OF INTENT.
   Many land use activities, while not inherently inconsistent with other
permitted uses in a particular district, may have significant impacts on the
surrounding area. Conditional use permits for such uses allow special
conditions to be “attached” to the development to address those impacts. The
conditional use permit process provides for flexibility in identifying the
special conditions without making the Ordinance unreasonably complicated. The
objective of the conditional use permit process is to encourage compatibility
of the proposed development with the environment, and with existing and future
land uses in the area.
90.02   ISSUANCE OF CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
   1.   A conditional use permit may be issued only after review and approval
of the submitted application, including any plans, by the Board of Adjustment.
An application and plan shall only be approved upon a determination that the
development, if completed as proposed, will comply with the provisions of this
chapter.
   2.   A conditional use permit shall be issued in the name of the applicant
(except that applications submitted by an agent shall be issued in the name of
the principal), shall identify the property involved and the proposed use, and
shall incorporate by reference the approved application and plan. The permit
shall contain any special conditions or requirements lawfully imposed by the
Board of Adjustment. The Director shall record the permit with the County
Recorder and shall provide the applicant with a copy of the recorded permit.
   3.   All development shall occur strictly in accordance with such approved
application and plan.
90.03   APPLICATION FOR CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
   1.   The applicant for a conditional use permit must be a person with the
legal authority to take action in accordance with the permit.
   2.   The application must be submitted in accordance with the requirements
set forth in Section
92.10, Required Permits.
(Ordinance No. 192)
   3.   Review Process and Submittal Requirements.
      A.   Conceptual Review Meeting. Before an applicant may submit a
conditional use permit application, the applicant must attend conceptual review
meeting with County departments and other applicable entities as appropriate.
The applicant shall submit a conceptual review application prior to the
meeting, including a proposed site development plan and a narrative of the
proposed development. A conceptual review meeting may be waived, upon written
request to the Director or his/her designee, by all members of the Interagency
Review Team.
(Ordinance No. 152) (Ordinance No. 192)
      B.   Formal Application Submitted. An application for a conditional use
permit shall be submitted to the Planning and Development Department and shall

staff shall send a notice via mail to all surrounding property owners within
one-fourth mile of the property included in a conditional use request outlining
the location, time and date of the public hearing before the Planning and
Zoning Commission.
         (3)   The failure to notify as provided in this section shall not
invalidate any recommendation made under the terms of the Ordinance, provided
such failure was not intentional, and the omission of the name of any owner of
property who may, in the opinion of the Board of Adjustment, be affected by
such amendment or change shall not invalidate any recommendation adopted
hereunder, it being the intention of this subsection to provide, to the fullest
extent possible, due notice that an application is pending before the Planning
and Zoning Commission.
      E.   Public Hearing before the Planning and Zoning Commission. A staff
report setting forth findings concerning the application’s conformance to this

invalidate any recommendation made under the terms of the Ordinance, provided
such failure was not intentional, and the omission of the name of any owner of
property who may, in the opinion of the Board of Adjustment, be affected by
such amendment or change shall not invalidate any recommendation adopted
hereunder, it being the intention of this subsection to provide, to the fullest
extent possible, due notice that an application is pending before the Board of
Adjustment.
      G.   Public Hearing before the Board of Adjustment. Following a
recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission, the conditional use
permit request shall be placed on the Board of Adjustment agenda. A staff
report setting forth the Planning and Zoning Commission’s findings of fact

recommendations by the Planning and Zoning Commission for requirements or
conditions to be imposed is prepared by Planning and Development staff and
placed on the Board of Adjustment agenda. The staff report shall be presented
by the Planning and Development staff at the Board of Adjustment meeting. Any
person may submit comments or request to speak on the items prior to the start
of the meeting. The public hearing shall be scheduled according to standard
agenda procedures. After reviewing the application at a public hearing, the
Board of Adjustment shall determine whether it concurs in whole or in part with
the Planning and Zoning Commission’s proposed findings and recommendations. To

            b.   The Board of Adjustment shall consider such reasonable
requirements or conditions to the permit as will ensure the development will
satisfy the requirements of this chapter. A vote may be taken on such
conditions before consideration of whether the permit should be approved or
denied for any of the reasons set forth in paragraphs C and D below.
(Ordinance No. 184)
            c.   The Board of Adjustment shall consider whether the application
complies with all of the Standards for Approval set forth in Section

Board of Adjustment concludes that the application fails to meet one or more of
the criteria, the application shall be denied.
(Ordinance No. 184)
            d.   If the Board of Adjustment concludes that all such criteria in
Section
90.04(1) have been met, the application and plans shall be approved unless it

satisfaction of the Director and meet all applicable County, State, and federal
requirements at such time the salvage yard is abandoned, or moved in whole or
in part. A salvage yard that remains idle or unused for a continuous period of
one year, whether or not fixtures or equipment are removed, shall constitute
abandonment. The casual, intermittent, temporary, or illegal operation of a
salvage yard shall not be sufficient evidence to establish continuous use.
      B.   Residential Envelope. A residential envelope shall be provided which
shall extend 50 feet from the side and rear lines of the principal residential
building and which shall extend from the front line of the principal
residential building to the required front yard line. Accessory buildings that
are attached or connected to a principal residential building shall be
considered a part of such principal building. The required yard may serve as
the required envelope, and in such cases regulations concerning required yards
shall govern.
      C.   Screening Requirements. The owner shall submit a screening plan,
which shall integrate that screen with the natural surroundings and assure
reasonable access to the screen for maintenance purposes. The screening plan
shall include the following:
         (1)   Screening shall be designed to eliminate the visual impact of
the salvage yard contents by obscuring it from view from adjacent roadways and,
as appropriate, adjacent property.
         (2)   Screening materials shall generally consist of natural objects,
plantings, fences or other appropriate means such as storage sheds, buildings
and other similar elements.
            a.   Natural objects shall be earthen berms, natural topography,
wooded areas or other similar elements.
            b.   Plantings shall be shrubs and trees of such types as to
provide year-round obscurement commensurate with local site conditions. All
plant material used for screening shall be of a size and quantity to provide
obscurement.
            c.   Screens shall be made of wood, metal, or other materials
commonly used in the building trade and shall be of such height and type, in
accordance with permissible district regulations, as necessary to provide
obscurement. Screens shall be designed to withstand a minimum wind load of 20
pounds per square foot and shall be of a permanent nature. All materials used
for finishing screens shall be a non-reflective material which will blend with
the natural surroundings. Screening shall not be placed in any manner so that
either the screen or the maintenance of the screen will create or contribute to
the creation of a safety hazard or endanger public safety or interfere with
road maintenance.
         (3)   The owner shall maintain the screening in a condition equal to
the original installation of the screening. Maintenance shall include, but not
be limited to, the following items:
            a.   Replacement of plant material that is dead or has been damaged
so that it no longer serves the intended purpose of screening the junkyard.
            b.   Screen maintenance shall include the renewal of the surface
treatment with stains, paints, or other appropriate material when needed and
the replacement of panels, sections, members or support structures of the
screening when needed.
      D.   Confinement of Salvage Yard. A junk or salvage yard shall not be
permitted within any required yard or envelope. No portion of the front yard or
front envelope shall be used for the conduct of business in any manner
whatsoever except for parking of customer or employee vehicles.
      E.   Area. Lot area requirements shall be in accordance with all
applicable district regulations for single-family dwellings. The area to be
confined for the salvage yard shall not exceed five acres.
      F.   Distance Standards. A Conditional Use Permit for a rural salvage
yard may not be issued for a proposed location within a five-mile radius of any
other lawfully existing rural salvage yard in Story County. Also, such a permit
may not be issued for a proposed location within 1,000 feet of the Greenbelt-
Conservation District.
   4.   Communication Towers and Facilities. Communication towers/facilities
existing and/or approved prior to the date of adoption of these standards may
continue to be used; however, proposed modifications must be reviewed by the
Director and, depending on the nature of the proposed modifications, may be
subject to review and approval by the Board of Adjustment. In addition, any
proposed modifications to approved and/or existing towers/facilities on towers
constructed prior to April 20, 2001, for co-location must submit an application
for zoning permit consistent with the requirements of Section
92.10, Required Permits.

60 dBA for any period of time, when measured at any dwelling, school, hospital,
church, or public library existing on the date of approval of any conditional
use permit from the property line.
         (1)   In the event audible noise due to C-WECS operations contains a
steady pure tone, such as a whine, screech, or hum, the standards for audible
noise set forth in this subsection shall be reduced by five dBA.
         (2)   In the event the ambient noise level (exclusive of the
development in question) exceeds the applicable standard given above, the
applicable standard shall be adjusted so as to equal the ambient noise level.
The ambient noise level shall be expressed in terms of the highest whole number
sound pressure level in dBA, which is succeeded for more than five minutes per
hour. Ambient noise levels shall be measured at the exterior of potentially
affected existing residences, schools, hospitals, churches and public
libraries. Ambient noise level measurement techniques shall employ all
practical means of reducing the effect of wind generated noise at the
microphone. Ambient noise level measurements may be performed when wind
velocities at the proposed project site are sufficient to allow wind turbine
operation, provided that the wind velocity does not exceed 30 mph at the
ambient noise measurement location.
         (3)   In the event the noise levels resulting from the C-WECS exceed
the criteria listed above, a waiver to said levels may be granted by the Board
of Adjustment upon recommendation by the Commission provided that the following
has been accomplished:
            a.   Written consent from the affected property owners has been
obtained stating that they are aware of the C-WECS and the noise limitations
imposed by the Ordinance, and that consent is granted to allow noise levels to
exceed the maximum limits otherwise allowed; and

points and along the outer and innermost guy wires up to a height of eight feet
above the ground. Visible fencing shall be installed around anchor points of
guy wires. The property owner must sign a notarized acknowledgement and consent
form allowing construction of the turbine and guyed wires without fencing as
required in the Ordinance to be presented to the Commission and Board of
Adjustment.
      N.   Discontinuation and Decommissioning. A C-WECS shall be considered a
discontinued use after one year without energy production, unless a plan is
developed and submitted to the Director outlining the steps and schedule for
returning the C-WECS to service. All C-WECS and accessory facilities shall be
removed to four feet below ground level within 180 days of the discontinuation
of use. Each C-WECS shall have a decommissioning plan outlining the anticipated
means and cost of removing C-WECS at the end of their serviceable life or upon
becoming a discontinued use. The cost estimates shall be made by a professional
engineer licensed in the State of Iowa. The plan shall also identify the
financial resources that will be available to pay for the decommissioning and
removal of the C-WECS and accessory facilities. The County reserves the right
to verify that adequate decommissioning terms are contained in the landowner
easement.
         (1)   The applicant shall submit a copy of the commissioning plan to
all property owners within the Conditional Use Permit area. The property owners
shall provide the County a signed affidavit stating their awareness and
responsibility of decommissioning costs.

sufficient to restore the roads and bridges to preconstruction conditions.
Financial assurance mechanisms in the form of a performance bond and/or other
security approved by the Story County Attorney’s Office shall be submitted
covering 130 percent the costs of all required improvements. This requirement
may be waived by the Board of Adjustment by recommendation from the Story
County Engineer.
      P.   Shadow Flicker. Shadow flicker shall be limited to a maximum
exposure of 30 hours per year and actual exposure of 10 hour per year when
measured at any dwelling, school, hospital, church or public library existing
on the date of approval of any conditional use permit from any turbine. In the
event that a turbine is proposed to be sited within 10 times the rotor diameter
of a turbine from any of these structures, a shadow flicker analysis shall be
required demonstrating conformance to this requirement. In the event shadow
flicker exposure time resulting from a C-WECS exceeds the criteria listed
herein, a waiver to said levels may be granted by the Board of Adjustment upon
recommendation by the Commission, provided that the following has been
accomplished:
         (1)   Written consent from the affected property owners has been
obtained stating they are aware of the C-WECS and the shadow flicker
limitations imposed by the Ordinance, its adverse health effects, and that
consent is granted to allow shadow levels to exceed the maximum limits
otherwise allowed.

CHAPTER 91
LAND DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS: EXCEPTIONS, MODIFICATIONS AND NONCONFORMING USES
 
91.01 Exceptions and Modifications 91.02 Nonconforming Uses
 
91.01   EXCEPTIONS AND MODIFICATIONS.
The regulations specified in the Ordinance are subject to the following
exceptions, modifications, and interpretations:
   1.   Interpretation. Whenever the regulations of the Ordinance require a
greater width or size of yards, courts, or other open spaces, or require a
greater percentage of the lot to be left unoccupied or impose other higher
standards than are required in any other statutes or local ordinance or
regulation, the provisions of the Ordinance shall govern. Whenever the
provisions of any other statute or local ordinance or regulation require a
greater width or size of yards, courts, or other open spaces, or require a
greater percentage of the lot to be left unoccupied, or impose other higher
standards than are required by the Ordinance, the provisions of such statute or
local ordinance or regulation shall govern.
   2.   A legally established lot of official record which becomes
nonconforming as a result of amendments to the Ordinance may be developed with
structures or uses permitted within the district in which the lot is located
subject to the following:
      A.   If a legally established lot of record is joined with another
legally established lot of record or another parcel or portion thereof with
which it was not historically transferred, or a legally established lot of
record or portion thereof is divided from another legally established lot of
record or another parcel with which it was historically transferred, it shall
lose its status as a legally established lot of record unless the newly created
parcel became nonconforming as a result of an amendment to the regulations in
effect at the time the lot, parcel, or tract was created.
      B.   When a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the
regulations applicable to the intended use, except that the lot is smaller than
that required for the intended use, then the lot may be used as proposed just
as if it were conforming.
      C.   In any district where dwellings are permitted, a single-family
dwelling may be located on any legally established nonconforming lot
irrespective of the lot area or width, provided however:
         (1)   The sum of the side yard widths of any such lot shall not be
less than 30 percent of the width of the lot, but in no case less than 10
percent of the width of the lot for any one side yard.
         (2)   The depth of the rear yard of any such lot need not exceed 20
percent of the depth of the lot, but in no case shall be less than 20 feet.
   3.   Chimneys, cooling towers, elevator bulk-heads, fire towers, monuments,
water towers, houses of worship, ornamental towers and spires, telephone, radio
or television towers, or necessary mechanical appurtenances may be erected to a
height in excess of existing district regulations of Story County; provided,
however, no such structure shall be permitted to extend into the approach
zones, clear zones, or other restricted air space required for the protection
of any public airport.
   4.   No accessory building shall be erected in any required yard other than
a rear yard, as provided hereinafter.
      A.   On a corner lot they shall conform to the setback regulations on the
side road. Accessory structures may be erected as a part of the principal
building, or may be connected thereto by a breeze-way or similar structure,
provided all yard requirements for a principal building are complied with.
      B.   An accessory structure that is not a part of the main building shall
not occupy more than 30 percent of the rear yard. No accessory structure shall
be constructed upon a lot until the construction of the main building has
actually commenced, and no accessory structure shall be used unless the main
building on the lot is also being used.
      C.   In cases where the property is zoned A-1, Agricultural, an accessory
structure may be constructed in advance of a dwelling, provided that
construction of the dwelling begins within two years. A signed agreement
between the Director and property owner is required by the applicant prior to
construction.
   5.   Except as herein provided, every part of a required yard shall be open
to the sky, unobstructed by a structure, except for the projection of sills,
belt course, cornices, and ornamental features which are not to exceed 12
inches.
   6.   Open-lattice enclosed fire escapes, fireproof outside stairways, and
balconies opening upon fire towers, and the ordinary projections of chimneys
and flues into the rear yard may be permitted for a distance of not more than
three and one-half feet and where the same are so placed as not to obstruct
light and ventilation.
   7.   Covered stoops, uncovered stoops, unenclosed terraces, uncovered
porches, platforms, and ornamental features which do not extend more than three
feet above the floor level of the ground story may project into a required
yard, and shall submit an application for zoning permit as required in Section
92.11, Required Permits. Projections shall maintain a distance of at least two
feet from any abutting side lot line. Projections may extend not more than
eight (8) feet into the required front setback and may extend up to fifty (50)
percent of the required rear setback.
   8.   Temporary structures and uses that are used only in conjunction with
construction work may be permitted in any district during the period of
construction, but such temporary structures shall be removed upon completion of
the construction work and shall submit an application for zoning permit as
required in Section 92.11, Required Permits.
   9.   More than one industrial, commercial, multiple dwelling or
institutional building or use may be established upon a single lot or tract in
a district permitting these uses, provided that the yards and open spaces
required around the boundaries of the lot or tract shall not be encroached upon
by any such buildings, and provided further that there shall be no change in
the intensity of use.
   10.   Where more than 40 percent of the frontage in a block has been built
up with buildings having a front yard, then the building line of the building
to be erected shall conform to the natural building lines of the block as
determined by the existing buildings.
   11.   In instances where buildings are erected containing two or more uses
housed vertically, the required side yards for the first floor use shall
control.
   12.   Encroachment of ramps, elevators, mechanical access devices, and other
structures intended to provide a reasonable accommodation that may be
necessary, because of a disability, in compliance with the 2010 American
Disability Act (ADA) Standards tor Accessible Design, are exempt from all bulk
requirements of the applicable zoning district.
   13.   An accessory building may be built on an adjoining lot to the
principle use, parcel, or tract if the adjoining lots, parcels or tracts are
owned by the same property owner, and said property owner signs a Restrictive
Covenant agreeing not to sever the adjoining lots, parcels, or tracts without
the mutual consent of the Director and property owner.
   14.   Accessory structures which are less than 100 square feet and have no
permanent attachment to the underlying ground shall not require a Zoning
Permit; however, all bulk requirements of the applicable zoning district shall
be satisfied with the exception of rear and side setbacks.
   15.   Where one parcel of property is divided into two or more portions by
reason of different zoning district classifications, each of these portions
shall be used independently of the others in its respective zoning
classification for the determination of permitted uses and application of bulk
standards.
   16.   Any pump, underground fuel storage tanks, and islands, including any
canopies, shall be set back at least 20 feet from any street or lot line.
91.02   NONCONFORMING USES.
   1.   Statement of Intent. Within the various districts established by the
Ordinance or by amendments that may later be adopted, there exist structures,
use of land, use of structures, or use of land and structures in combination,
which were lawful prior to the adoption of the Ordinance but which would be
prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the provisions of the Ordinance. It
is the intent of the Ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue
until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the
intent of the Ordinance that such nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon,
expanded or extended.
   2.   Nonconforming Structures. Where a structure exists at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of the Ordinance which could not be built under
the terms of the Ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage,
height, yards, or other characteristic of the structure or its location on the
lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the following provisions:
      A.   Where an existing structure or structures or part or parts thereof
are not in conformity with the Ordinance, no enlargement, alteration, or
reconstruction shall be permitted which encroaches further into a required
setback.
      B.   Should such structures be destroyed by any means to an extent of 60
percent or more of its fair market value at the time of destruction, exclusive
of the foundation, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the
provisions of the Ordinance. If the structure is less than 60 percent destroyed
above the foundation, it may be reconstructed provided that a zoning permit has
been applied for within six months of such happening and reconstruction has
been completed within the time frame specified in 92.11, Required Permits.
   3.   Nonconforming Use of Land. Where a use of land upon which no building
or structure is erected or constructed exists at the effective date of adoption
or amendment of the Ordinance that would not be allowed in the zoning district
under the terms of the Ordinance, the use may be continued so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
      A.   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased or extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of the Ordinance.
      B.   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot or parcel which was not occupied by such use at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of the Ordinance.
      C.   If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than six months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform
to the district regulations of the zoning district in which such land is
located.
      D.   The casual, intermittent, temporary, or illegal use of land shall
not be sufficient to establish the existence of a nonconforming use and the
existence of a nonconforming use on the part of a lot or tract shall not be
construed to establish a nonconforming use on the entire lot or tract.
      E.   If no expansions occur, a nonconforming use of land may be changed
to another nonconforming use of a similar nature within the same or a more
restrictive zoning classification. Whenever a nonconforming use has been
changed to a more restrictive zoning use or to a conforming use, such use shall
not thereafter be changed to a less restrictive use.
   4.   Nonconforming Use of Structures. Where a use of a structure exists at
the effective date of adoption or amendment of the Ordinance that would not be
allowed in the zoning district under the terms of the Ordinance, the use may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
      A.   No existing structure devoted entirely or in part to a use not
permitted by the Ordinance in the zoning district in which it is located shall
be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except
which required by law, unless the use is changed to a use permitted in the
zoning district which such structure is located.
      B.   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
structure which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time
of adoption or amendment of the Ordinance. No such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building.
      C.   If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a
structure may be changed to another nonconforming use of a similar nature
within the same or a more restrictive zoning classification. Whenever a
nonconforming use has been changed to a more restrictive zoning use or to a
conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less restrictive
use.
      D.   Any nonconforming use of a structure which remains idle or unused
for a continuous period of six months, whether or not the equipment or fixtures
are removed, shall not again be used except in conformity with the regulations
of the zoning district in which such structure is located.
      E.   The casual, intermittent, temporary, or illegal use of a structure
shall not be sufficient to establish the existence of a nonconforming use and
the existence of a nonconforming use on the part of a lot or tract shall not be
construed to establish a nonconforming use on the entire lot or tract.
      F.   Any structure devoted to a use made nonconforming by the Ordinance
that is destroyed by any means to an extent of sixty (60) percent or more of
its fair market value at the time of destruction, exclusive of the foundation,
then the right to maintain the nonconforming use shall expire and the structure
shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the regulations of the
zoning district in which such structure is located. If the structure is less
than sixty (60) percent destroyed above the foundation, it may be reconstructed
and used as before provided that a zoning permit has applied for within six
months of such happening and reconstruction has been completed within the time
frame specified in 92.11, Required Permits.
   5.   Required Repairs. Nothing in the Ordinance shall be deemed to prevent
the restoration to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to
be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order
of such official.

92.01   DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
   1.   A Board of Adjustment shall consist of five members, a majority of whom
shall reside within the County but outside the corporate limits of any city,
appointed by the Board of Supervisors. Terms shall be five years and vacancies
shall be filled by the Board of Supervisors for the unexpired term of any
member whose term becomes vacant. The Board of Supervisors shall have the power
to remove any member of the Board of Adjustment for cause, upon written charges
and after public hearing.
   2.   The Board of Adjustment shall elect a Chairperson and Vice Chairperson.
All meetings of the Board of Adjustment shall be held at the call of the
Chairperson and at such time and place within the County as the Board of
Adjustment may determine. Such Chairperson, or in his/her absence the acting
Chairperson, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All
meetings of the Board of Adjustment shall be open to the public.
(Ordinance No. 184)
   3.   The Board of Adjustment shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing
the vote of each member on every question, or if absent or failing to vote
indicating such fact, and shall keep complete records of its examinations and
other official actions. Every rule, regulation, every amendment or appeal
thereof, and every order, requirement, decision or determination of the Board
of Adjustment shall be immediately filed in the office of the Director and
shall be public record. The Board of Adjustment shall adopt its own rules of
procedure not to conflict with the Ordinance or with the Iowa Statutes. The
Board of Adjustment shall not be compensated, except for necessary expenses.
92.02   APPEALS OF THE DIRECTOR’S DECISION.
   1.   The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged that there is error of law in any order, requirement, decision or
determination made by the Planning and Development Director or his/her designee
in the enforcement of the Ordinance.
   2.   Procedure. Such appeal shall be submitted within a period of not more
than 30 days from the date of the Director’s decision, and in the manner
prescribed by the Board of Adjustment. Such appeal shall be filed with the
Director with notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof, filing fee and
additional submittal requirements. When notice of the appeal is filed, the
Director shall transmit all of the records regarding the appeal to the Board of
Adjustment and place the appeal on the next scheduled meeting of the Board of
Adjustment.   (Ordinance No. 184)
   3.   Stay of Proceedings. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of
the action appealed from, unless the Director certifies to the Board of
Adjustment, after notice of appeal shall have been filed, that by reason of the
facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in the Director’s opinion, cause
imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be
stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board
of Adjustment or by a court of record on application, on notice to the Director
and on due cause shown.
(Ordinance No. 184)
92.03   VARIANCES.
   1.   The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide upon applications to vary
the strict application of the height, area, setback, parking or density
requirements to the extent necessary to permit the applicant a reasonable use
of the property in those specified instances where there are peculiar,
exceptional and unusual circumstances in connection with a specific parcel of
land, which circumstances do not generally exist within the locality or
neighborhood concerned and where the strict application of the ordinance would
result in an unnecessary hardship. However, such variance shall not have the
effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of the Ordinance. No variance shall
be granted that encroaches the vision clearance standards established in
Section 88.06.
   2.   Special conditions shall include but not be limited to a property owner
who can show that their property was acquired in good faith and where by reason
of exceptional topographical conditions or other extraordinary or exceptional
situations the strict application of the terms of the Ordinance actually
prohibits the use of the property in a manner reasonably similar to that of
other property in the district.
   3.   The special conditions and circumstances shall not result from the
actions of the applicant. Under no circumstances shall the Board of Adjustment
grant a variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of the
Ordinance in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication
prohibited by the terms of the Ordinance in said district.
   4.   Review Process and Submittal Requirements.
      A.   Formal Application Submitted. An application for a variance
submitted to the Planning and Development Department shall include:
         (1)   Application form, signed by the property owner, and filing fee.
         (2)   Written narrative explaining justification for proposed variance
and conformance to the legal principles in Section 92.03(4)(D)(1).
         (3)   Site development plan sketch.
         (4)   Other information deemed necessary by the Planning and
Development Director.
      B.   Interagency and Staff Review of Application. Following submittal,
including applicable filing fee, of a completed application for a variance,
Planning and Development shall review application materials for compliance with
the legal principles in Section 92.03(4)(D)(1). The application shall also
undergo review by members of the Interagency Review Team.
      C.   Meeting Notice for Board of Adjustment.
         (1)   Notice to Cities within Two Miles. Planning and Development
staff shall send notice to any city located within two miles of the requested
variance outlining the location, time, and date of the public hearing before
the Board of Adjustment.
         (2)   Notice to Surrounding Property Owners. Planning and Development
staff shall send a notice via mail to all surrounding property owners within
one-fourth mile of the property included in the variance request outlining the
location, time, and date of the public hearing before the Board of Adjustment.
         (3)   The failure to notify as provided in this section shall not
invalidate any recommendation made under the terms of the Ordinance, provided
such failure was not intentional, and the omission of the name of any owner of
property who may, in the opinion of the Board of Adjustment, be affected by
such amendment or change shall not invalidate any recommendation adopted
hereunder, it being the intention of this subsection to provide, to the fullest
extent possible, due notice that an application is pending before the Board of
Adjustment.
      D.   Public Hearing before the Board of Adjustment and Board of
Adjustment Action. Following completion of interagency and staff review of the
application for a variance, a staff report setting forth findings of fact
concerning the application's conformance to the legal principles in Section
92.03(4)(D)(1) of this chapter and any recommendations for requirements or
conditions to be imposed shall be prepared by Planning and Development staff
and placed on the Board of Adjustment agenda. The staff report shall be
presented by the Planning and Development staff at the Board of Adjustment
meeting. Any person may submit comments or request to speak on the items prior
to the start of the meeting. The public hearing shall be scheduled according to
standard agenda procedures. After reviewing the application at a public
hearing, the Board of Adjustment shall determine whether it concurs in whole or
in part with the staffs proposed findings and recommendations. To the extent
the Board does not concur, the Board shall propose its own findings of fact
concerning the application's conformance to the legal principles in Section
92.03(4)(D)(1) of this chapter or recommendations and provide supporting
reasons. The Board of Adjustment shall make a motion regarding compliance or
noncompliance of the application to the legal principles, and such motion
becomes the official decision of the Board of Adjustment.
         (1)   In deciding whether to grant a variance request, the Board of
Adjustment shall consider all the following legal principles. All legal
principles shall be satisfied in order for the Board of Adjustment to grant a
variance.
            a.   Finding of unnecessary hardship: (i) the land in question
cannot yield a reasonable return if used only for a purpose allowed in that
zone; (ii) the plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances and not to
general conditions in the neighborhood which may reflect the unreasonableness
of the Ordinance itself; (iii) the use to be authorized by the variance will
not alter the essential character of the locality.
            b.   Granting the variance will not be contrary to the public
interest.
            c.   The spirit and intent of the Story County Cornerstone to
Capstone (C2C) Comprehensive Plan and Story County Land Development Regulations
are protected.
      E.   Any such motion regarding compliance or noncompliance of the
application to the legal principles shall specify the supporting reasons for
the motion. To the extent the Board does not concur with staff's findings and
recommendations, the Board shall propose its own findings of fact concerning
the application's conformance to the legal principles in Section 92.03(4)(D)(1)
of this chapter or recommendations and provide supporting reasons, including,
but not limited to new facts or evidence presented at the public hearing. It
shall be presumed that the Board adopts staff's findings and recommendations if
the Board does not specifically make a motion regarding the compliance or
noncompliance of the application of the legal principles.
      F.   The Board of Adjustment may attach a condition to a variance that
limits the duration of said variance or other condition related to the legal
principles in Section 92.03(4)(D)(1).
   5.   Appeals of Actions of the Board of Adjustment. Any interested party may
appeal a variance decision of the Board of Adjustment within 30 days of
recording in the following ways:
      A.   Board of Supervisors. The Board of Supervisors may provide for its
review of variances granted by the Board of Adjustment before their effective
date. The Board of Supervisors may remand a decision to grant a variance to the
Board of Adjustment for further study. If remanded, the effective date of the
variance is delayed for 30 days from the date of the remand.
      B.   Petition to Court. Any person or persons, jointly or severally,
aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Adjustment under the provisions of
Chapter 331 of the Code of Iowa, or any taxpayer, or any officer, department,
board or bureau of the County may present to a court of record a petition, duly
verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part,
specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be presented to
the court within 30 days after the filing of the decision in the office of the
board.
   6.   Stay of Proceedings. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of
the action appealed from, unless the Planning and Development Director
certifies to the Board of Adjustment, after notice of appeal shall have been
filed, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in
the Planning and Development Director's opinion, cause imminent peril to life
or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a
restraining order which may be granted by the Board of Adjustment or by a court
of record on application, on notice to the Director and on due cause shown.
   7.   Expiration. Variances which have been granted in accordance with the
provisions of the Ordinance shall be null and void at the end of six months
from the date of granting if substantial action as defined in Section 85.08,
Definitions, has not been taken to accomplish the purpose for which the
variance was granted. A six-month extension may be granted by the Director or
their designee upon written request to the Planning and Development Department.
(Ord. 304 - Sep. 22 Supp.)
92.04   WAIVERS BY THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.
   1.   Where, in the case of a particular proposed development, it can be
shown that strict compliance with the requirements of the Ordinance results in
extraordinary hardship to the applicant, because of unusual topography or other
conditions, the Board of Supervisors, upon recommendation by the Commission,
may waive the requirements so that substantial justice may be done and the
public interest secured, provided, however, that such waiver will not have the
effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of the Ordinance.
(Ordinance No. 208)
   2.   In determining whether a hardship exists, the Commission and Board of

                                     Citation
93.02 Notice of Violation; Procedure 93.04 Court Proceedings; State Law
                                     Provisions
 
93.01   INTENT.
   It is the intent of this chapter to establish written procedures to be
followed in the enforcement of County planning and development regulations, and
to provide information to the public about enforcement procedures. In an effort
to gain compliance with County regulations, all persons responsible for
enforcing the County Land Development Regulations (Chapter 85, 86, 87, 88, 89,
90, 91, and 92) shall first attempt compliance through inspection,
notification, and request for voluntary compliance. When all reasonable efforts
have failed and administrative remedies have been exhausted, any County
employee authorized to enforce the regulations may issue a citation to any
person, firm, or corporation determined to be committing a County infraction.
93.02   NOTICE OF VIOLATION; PROCEDURE.
   1.   A zoning violation is brought to the attention of the Story County
Planning and Development Office.
   2.   An investigation is conducted to determine whether or not a violation
exists.
   3.   If a violation exists, a Notice of Violation is provided to the
violator and a copy to the complainant, if appropriate. In the case of a
violation by a tenant, the property owner or agent should receive a copy of the
notice. Such notice shall request voluntary compliance with the regulations and
shall:
      A.   Be in writing;
      B.   Include a description of the nature of the violation, including the
sections of this Code of Ordinances violated;
      C.   Include the location and time of the violation;
      D.   Allow 30 days from the date of receipt or posting of the notice to
correct/abate the violation, or to submit a compliance schedule to be approved
by the Planning and Development Director;
      E.   Explain that failure to correct/abate the violation within the
specified time will result in further action by the County, including
prosecution as a simple misdemeanor punishable by a fine or imprisonment, or
the issuance of a citation and the assessment of a fine;
      F.   Explain that each day each violation continues after the compliance
date may be deemed a separate offense;
      G.   Explain that the Notice of Violation may be appealed to the Board of
Adjustment within 30 days from the date of receipt or posting of the notice,
that an appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
from, that the Board of Adjustment must act within 30 days from receipt of an
appeal, and that the compliance date would be 30 days from the date of the
Board of Adjustment determination; and
      H.   Be served by personal service or by certified mail return receipt
requested, or in the event neither can be accomplished, by posting the notice
in a conspicuous place on the premises.
93.03   COUNTY INFRACTION; ISSUANCE OF CITATION.
   If the violator does not correct/abate the violation or provide an
acceptable schedule to correct/abate the violation or does not comply with the
schedule, a citation for a County infraction may be issued. Any County employee
authorized to enforce the regulations to which this chapter applies may issue a
citation. A citation shall be issued according to the following procedure:
   1.   A County infraction is punishable by the following civil penalties:
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 331.307[1])
      A.   First Offense - Not to exceed $750.00
      B.   Each Repeat Offense - Not to exceed $1,000.00
   2.   A citation may be issued only by an authorized employee who has
witnessed the violation.
   3.   A citation may be issued only after the following criteria have been
met:
      A.   The issuance of the citation is authorized by the Planning and
Development Director;
      B.   The citation is signed by the authorized employee issuing the
citation prior to issuance/service to the violator;
      C.   The citation contains all information as required by State law,
including:
         (1)   The name and address of the violator;
         (2)   The name or description of the infraction attested to by the
authorized employee issuing the citation;
         (3)   The location and time of the infraction;
         (4)   The amount of the civil penalty (fine) to be assessed or the
alternate relief sought, or both;
         (5)   The manner, location and time in which the penalty may be paid;
         (6)   The time and place of court appearance; and
         (7)   The penalty for failure to appear in court.
   4.   The citation may be served by personal service or by certified mail
return receipt requested.
   5.   If the violation has not been corrected/abated by the compliance date
established on the citation, a citation may be issued immediately for a repeat
offense, i.e., a recurring violation of the same section of this Code of
Ordinances. Each day each violation continues after the compliance date
established on the citation may be deemed a separate County infraction.
   6.   Upon issuance of a citation, the employee shall give one copy to the
violator. One copy shall be retained by the Planning and Development Office and
one copy sent to the Clerk of Court's Office.
   7.   All citations shall be numbered, and the Planning and Development
Office shall keep a record of all citations issued or voided and shall be
responsible for delivering a copy of the citation to the court.
   8.   The employee issuing the citation shall appear in court when the
hearing is held.
(Ord. 304 - Sep. 22 Supp.)
93.04   COURT PROCEEDINGS; STATE LAW PROVISIONS.
   Pursuant to Section 331.307, Code of Iowa, the proceedings before the court
are as follows:
   1.   In proceedings before the court for a County infraction:
      A.   The County has the burden of proof that the County infraction
occurred and that the violator committed the infraction. The proof shall be by
clear, satisfactory, and convincing evidence.
      B.   The court shall ensure that the violator has received a copy of the
charges and that the violator understands the charges. The violator may
question all witnesses who appear for the County and produce evidence or
witnesses on the violator’s behalf.
      C.   The violator may be represented by counsel of the violator’s own
selection and at the violator’s own expense.
      D.   The violator may enter a plea admitting or denying the infraction.
      E.   The verdict of the court for a County infraction shall be “guilty”
of the County infraction or “not guilty” of the County infraction.
   2.   If the person named in the citation is served as provided in this
section and fails without good cause to appear in response to the civil
citation, judgment shall be entered against the person cited.
   3.   A person found guilty of a County infraction is liable for the court
costs and fees. If a person is found not guilty of a County infraction or the
action is dismissed, the County is liable for the court costs and court fees.
Where the action is disposed of without payment, or provision for assessment,
of court costs, the clerk shall at once enter judgment for costs against the
County.
   4.   Seeking a civil penalty, as authorized in this section, does not
preclude a County from seeking alternative relief from the court in the same
action.
   5.   When a violator has been found guilty of a County infraction, the court
may impose a civil penalty or may grant appropriate relief to abate or halt the
violation, or both, and the court may direct that payment of the civil penalty
be suspended or deferred under conditions established by the court. If a
violator willfully fails to pay the civil penalty or violates the terms of any
other order imposed by the court, the failure is contempt.
   6.   A violator who has been found guilty of a County infraction may file a
motion for a new trial or a motion for a reversal of a judgment as provided by
law or rule of civil procedure.
   7.   This section does not preclude a peace officer of a County from issuing
a criminal citation for a violation of a County code or regulation if criminal
penalties are also provided for the violation. Each day that a violation occurs
or is permitted by the violator to exist, constitutes a separate offense.
   8.   The issuance of a civil citation for a County infraction or the ensuing
court proceedings do not provide an action for false arrest, false
imprisonment, or prosecution.
