contrary.
§ 10.20 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any licensed peace officer of the city's Police Department, or the
County Sheriff, or any Deputy Sheriff shall have the authority to enforce any
provision of this code.
   (B)   As permitted by M.S. § 626.862, as it may be amended from time to
time, the City Clerk/Treasurer shall have the authority to administer and
enforce this code. In addition, under that statutory authority, certain
individuals designated within the code or by the Clerk/Treasurer or City
Council shall have the authority to administer and enforce the provisions
specified. All and any person or persons designated may issue a citation in
lieu of arrest or continued detention to enforce any provision of the code.
   (C)   The City Clerk/Treasurer and any city official or employee designated
by this code who has the responsibility to perform a duty under this code may
with the permission of a licensee of a business or owner of any property or
resident of a dwelling, or other person in control of any premises, inspect or
otherwise enter any property to enforce compliance with this code.
   (D)   If the licensee, owner, resident, or other person in control of a
premises objects to the inspection of or entrance to the property, the City
Clerk/Treasurer, peace officer, or any employee or official charged with the
duty of enforcing the provisions of this code may, upon a showing that probable
cause exists for the issuance of a valid search warrant from a court of
competent jurisdiction, petition and obtain a search warrant before conducting
the inspection or otherwise entering the property. This warrant shall be only
to determine whether the provisions of this code enacted to protect the health,
safety and welfare of the people are being complied with and to enforce these
provisions only, and no criminal charges shall be made as a result of the
warrant. No warrant shall be issued unless there be probable cause to issue the
warrant. Probable cause occurs if the search is reasonable. Probable cause does
not depend on specific knowledge of the condition of a particular property.
   (E)   Every licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of property
within the city shall permit at reasonable times inspections of or entrance to
the property by the City Clerk/Treasurer or any other authorized city officer
or employee only to determine whether the provisions of this code enacted to
protect the health, safety and welfare of the people are being complied with
and to enforce these provisions. Unreasonable refusal to permit the inspection
of or entrance to the property shall be grounds for termination of any and all
permits, licenses or city service to the property. Mailed notice shall be given
to the licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of the property,
stating the grounds for the termination, and the licensee, owner, resident or
other person in control of the property shall be given an opportunity to appear
before the City Clerk/Treasurer to object to the termination before it occurs,
subject to appeal of the Clerk/Treasurer's decision to the City Council at a
regularly scheduled or special meeting.
   (F)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of
the city to enter private property in urgent emergency situations where there
is an imminent danger in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare.
§ 10.98 SUPPLEMENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to those administrative penalties established in this code
and the enforcement powers granted in §
10.20, the City Council is authorized to create by resolution, adopted by a
majority of the members of the Council, supplemental administrative penalties.
   (B)   These administrative penalty procedures in this section are intended
to provide the public and the city with an informal, cost effective and
expeditious alternative to traditional criminal charges for violations of
certain provisions of this code. The procedures are intended to be voluntary on
the part of those who have been charged with those offenses.
   (C)   Administrative penalties for violations of various provisions of the
code, other than those penalties established in the code or in statutes that
are adopted by reference, may be established from time to time by resolution of
a majority of the members of the City Council. In order to be effective, an
administrative penalty for a particular violation must be established before
the violation occurred.
   (D)   In the discretion of the peace officer, City Clerk/Treasurer, or other
person giving notice of an alleged violation of a provision of this code, in a
written notice of an alleged violation, sent by first class mail to the person
who is alleged to have violated the code, the person giving notice may request
the payment of a voluntary administrative penalty for the violation directly to
the City Treasurer within 14 days of the notice of the violation. In the sole
discretion of the person giving the notice of the alleged violation, the time
for payment may be extended an additional 14 days, whether or not requested by
the person to whom the notice has been given. In addition to the administrative
penalty, the person giving notice may request in the notice to the alleged
violator to adopt a compliance plan to correct the situation resulting in the
alleged violation and may provide that if the alleged violator corrects the
situation resulting in the alleged violation within the time specified in the
notice, that the payment of the administrative penalty will be waived.
   (E)   At any time before the payment of the administrative penalty is due,
the person who has been given notice of an alleged violation may request to
appear before the City Council to contest the request for payment of the
penalty. After a hearing before the Council, the Council may determine to
withdraw the request for payment or to renew the request for payment. Because
the payment of the administrative penalty is voluntary, there shall be no
appeal from the decision of the Council.
   (F)   At any time after the date the payment of the administrative penalty
is due, if the administrative penalty remains unpaid or the situation creating
the alleged violation remains uncorrected, the city, through its Attorney, may
bring criminal charges in accordance with state law and this code. Likewise,
the city, in its discretion, may bring criminal charges in the first instance,
rather than requesting the payment of an administrative penalty, even if a
penalty for the particular violation has been established by Council
resolution. If the administrative penalty is paid, or if any requested
correction of the situation resulting in the violation is completed, no
criminal charges shall be initiated by the City for the alleged violation.
§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   (A)   Whenever in this code or in any ordinance of the city any act is
prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful, an offense or a misdemeanor,
or whenever in such code or ordinance the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
provided therefor, the violation of any such provision of this code or city
ordinance shall be punished as a misdemeanor. The term MISDEMEANOR shall be as
defined in M.S. § 609.02, Subd. 3.
   (B)   Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this
code, including Minnesota Statutes specifically adopted by reference, which is
designated to be a petty misdemeanor shall, upon conviction be guilty of a
petty misdemeanor. The term PETTY MISDEMEANOR shall be as defined in M.S. §
609.02, Subd. 4a.
   (C)   In either the case of a misdemeanor or a petty misdemeanor, the costs
of prosecution may be added. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon
each day during which a violation occurs or continues.
   (D)   The failure of any officer or employee of the city to perform any
official duty imposed by this code shall not subject the officer or employee to
the penalty imposed for a violation.
   (E)   In addition to any penalties provided for in this section or in §
10.98, if any person, firm or corporation fails to comply with any provision of
this code, the Council or any city official designated by it, may institute
appropriate proceedings at law or at equity to restrain, correct or abate the
violation.
   (F)   In case of the amendment by the City Council of any section of this
code for which a penalty is not provided, the general penalty as provided in
division (A) of this section shall apply to the section, as amended; or in case
such amendment contains provisions for which a specified penalty other than the
general penalty in division (A) of this section is provided in another section
in the same chapter, the penalty so specified shall be held to relate to the
amended section, unless such penalty is specifically repealed therein.

shall, taken together, constitute the plan.
      (2)   Land use ordinances.
         (a)   The Planning Commission shall review all proposed amendments to
existing land use ordinances and may propose and recommend other land use
ordinances. The Planning Commission shall hold all public hearings required by
law for any new ordinance, amendments to existing ordinances, rezoning,
conditional use permits, and interim uses. Following any such hearing, the

proceedings.
         (d)   If the Council otherwise disagrees with the recommendations of
the Planning Commission in a manner which significantly affects the decision to

representatives, to review the matter prior to a decision by the Council.
      (3)   Subdivisions and platting. The Planning Commission shall hold all
public hearings required for the approval of a subdivision or plat under the
city subdivision regulations and comply with the following procedure:
         (a)   Upon receipt of a complete application for a subdivision (all
relevant information has been submitted and the subdivision regulations
complied with), the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the
proposal as required by law. Following the public hearing, the Planning
Commission shall timely provide the Council with a copy of the proposed
subdivision and all findings and recommendations of the Planning Commission.
         (b)   If the Planning Commission recommends that the proposal be
approved, or approved with conditions, the Planning Commission shall proceed
with the proposal, taking into consideration any concerns related in writing by
the Council.
         (c)   The proposed subdivision shall be preliminarily approved or
disapproved within 120 days following delivery of the completed application
unless an extension of the review period has been agreed to by the applicant.
If the proposal is not preliminarily approved or disapproved within the stated
period, the application shall be deemed preliminarily approved and upon demand,
the city shall execute a certificate to that effect.
         (d)   Following the preliminary approval, the applicant shall submit
to the Planning Commission a final plat as required under the subdivision
regulations. The Planning Commission shall review the final plat to insure that
it is consistent with and meets all conditions contained in the preliminary
approval. If in compliance, the Planning Commission shall recommend to the
Council approval of the final plat. The Council shall approve the final plat
within 60 days of its submission to the Planning Commission.
         (e)   Conditions of approval shall be deemed to include all rights,
duties, and obligations which the city may impose under the law.
   (E)   Board of Adjustment. There is hereby created for the city a Board of
Adjustment.
      (1)   The City Council shall serve as the Board of Adjustment.
      (2)   The Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers:
         (a)   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is an
error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the Zoning
Administrator in the enforcement of the zoning ordinance; and
         (b)   To hear requests for and to grant variances from the literal
provisions of the zoning ordinance in instances where their strict enforcement
would cause undue hardship because of circumstances unique to the individual
property under consideration when it is demonstrated that the actions will be
in keeping with the spirit and intent of the ordinance. UNDUE HARDSHIP means
the property in question cannot be put to a reasonable use if used under
conditions allowed by the official controls; the plight of the landowner is due
to circumstances unique to the property and not created by the landowner; and
the variance if granted will not alter the essential character of the locality.
Economic considerations alone shall not constitute an undue hardship if
reasonable use of the property otherwise exists under the terms of the
ordinance. UNDUE HARDSHIP also includes, but is not limited to, inadequate
access to direct sunlight for solar energy systems. A variance may not be
granted for a “use” that is not permitted in the land use district where the
affected property is located.

§ 31.06 FIRE CALL FEES.
   (A)   Purposes and intent. This section is adopted for the purpose of
authorizing the city to charge for fire service as authorized by M.S. §§
366.011, 366.012, and 415.01.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      (1)   FALSE ALARM. Any fire service call for which fire service was not
required, including false reports in violation of state law.
      (2)   FIRE PROTECTION CONTRACT. A contract between the city and a town,
or other city, for the city to provide fire service.
      (3)   FIRE SERVICE. Any deployment of fire fighting personnel and/or
equipment to extinguish a fire or perform any preventative measure in an effort
to protect equipment, life, or property in an area threatened by fire. It also
includes the deployment of fire fighting personnel and/or equipment to provide
fire suppression, rescue, extrication, and any other services related to fire
and first responders rescue as may occasionally occur.
      (4)   FIRE SERVICE CHARGE. The charge imposed by the city for receiving
fire service.
      (5)   MOTOR VEHICLE. Any self-propelled vehicle designed and originally
manufactured to operate primarily upon public roads and highways, and not
operated exclusively upon railroad tracks. It includes semi trailers. It does
not include snowmobiles, manufactured homes, all terrain vehicles, or park

   (E)   Billing and collection.
      (1)   Parties requesting and receiving fire services may be billed
directly by the city. Additionally, if the party receiving fire services did
not request services, but a fire or another situation exists requiring, at the
discretion of the Fire Department personnel in charge, fire service, the party
will be charged and billed for such service. All parties will be billed whether
or not the fire service is covered by insurance. Any billable amount of the
fire charge not covered by a party’s insurance remains a debt of the party
receiving the fire service.
      (2)   Parties billed for fire service will have 30 days to pay. If the
fire service charge is not paid by that time, it will be considered delinquent
and the city will send a notice of delinquency.
      (3)   If the fire service charge remains unpaid for 30 days after this

legal means to collect the fire service charge. The party receiving fire
service shall be liable for all collection costs incurred by the city
including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney fees and court costs.
      (4)   If the fire service charge remains unpaid for 30 days after the
notice of delinquency is sent, the City Council may also, on or before October
15 of each year, certify the unpaid fire service charge to the County Auditor
in which the recipient of the services owns real property for collection with
property taxes. The County Auditor is responsible for remitting to the city all
charges collected on behalf of the city. The city must give the property owner
notice of its intent to certify the unpaid fire service charge by September 15.
      (5)   A false alarm will be billed as a fire call only after 1 prior
false alarm within a 12-month period by the same property owner.

to equipment of the Center City Fire Department, or supplies or materials used
during service provided under this agreement, the cost of repair or replacement
of the damaged equipment and the cost of the supplies and materials used may be
billed separately, at the request and discretion of the Fire Chief.
   (G)   Mutual aid agreement.  Any charges for mutual aid service shall be
determined by the current mutual aid agreement, and such amounts shall be
considered fees authorized by this chapter.
   (H)   Application of collections to budget. All collected fire charges will
be city funds and used to offset the expenses of the city Fire Department in
providing fire services.

disposal system which violates any statute, rule, regulation, or ordinance of
any regulatory agency, or state or federal regulatory body.
      (12)   Any waters or wastes containing BOD5 or suspended solids of such
character and quantity that unusual attention or expense is required to handle
such materials at the wastewater treatment works, except as may be permitted by
specific written agreement subject to the provisions of division (P).
   (E)   (1)   If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which contain substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in division (D), and/or which in the judgement of
the Commission may have a deleterious effect upon the wastewater treatment
facility processes, equipment, or receiving water and/or soil, vegetation and
ground water, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public
nuisance, the city may:
         (a)   Reject the wastes;

provided and installed by the owner when, in the opinion of the IGU they are
necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing floatable grease
in excessive amounts as specified in division (D)(2), any flammable wastes, as
specified in division (C)(1), sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that
such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling
units. All interceptors shall be to the type to be readily and easily
accessible for cleaning and inspection. In the maintaining of these
interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible for the proper removal and
disposal of the captured materials by appropriate means, and shall maintain a
record of dates and means of disposal which are subject to review by the IGU.
Any removal and hauling of the collecting materials not performed by the
owner’s personnel, must be performed by a currently licensed waste disposal
firm.
   (I)   Where required by the IGU, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable structure,
or control manhole with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of wastes.
The structure shall be accessibly and safely located, and shalt be constructed
in accordance with the plans approved by the IGU. The structure shall be
installed by the owner at his/her expense and shall be maintained by the owner
so as to be safe and accessible at all times.

industrial wastes at the discretion of the city shall be required to provide
laboratory measurements, tests, and analysis of waters and wastes to illustrate
compliance with this subchapter and any special conditions for discharge
established by the city or regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the
discharge. The number, type and frequency of sampling and laboratory analysis
to be performed by the owner shall be as stipulated by the city. The industry
must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the wastewater discharge
to assure that compliance with the federal, state, and local standards are
being met. The owner shall report the results of measurements and laboratory
analysis to the city at such times, and in such manner as prescribed by the
city. The owner shall bear the expense of all measurements, analysis and
reporting required by the city. At such times deemed necessary, the city
reserves the right to take measurements and samples for analysis by an
independent laboratory.
   (K)   All measurements, tests, and analysis of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this subchapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association.
Sampling methods, location, times, duration and frequencies are to be
determined on an individual basis subject to approval by the IGU.
   (L)   Where required by the city, the owner of any property serviced by a
sanitary sewer shall provide protection from an accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this subchapter. Where
necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharges of prohibited materials
shall be provided and maintained at the owner’s expense. Detailed plans showing
facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be
submitted to the IGU for review and approval prior to construction of the
facility. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not
relieve any user from the responsibility to modify the user’s facility as
necessary to meet the requirements of this subchapter. Users shall notify the
IGU and the Commission immediately upon having a slug or accidental discharge
of substances of wastewater in violation of this subchapter to enable
countermeasures to be taken by the IGU and the Commission to minimize damage to
the wastewater treatment works. The notification will not relieve any user of
any liability for any expense, loss or damage to the wastewater treatment
system or treatment process, or for any fines imposed on the city on account
thereof under any state and federal law. Employers shall insure that all
employees who may cause or discover a discharge are advised of the emergency
notification procedure.
   (M)   No person, having charge of any building or other premises which
drains into the public sewer, shall permit any substance or matter which may
form a deposit or obstruction to flow or pass into the public sewer. Within 15
days after receipt of written notice from the city, the owner shall install a
suitable and sufficient catch basin or waste trap, or if one already exists,
shall clean out, repair or alter the same, and perform such other work as the
IGU may deem necessary. Upon the owner’s refusal or neglect to install a catch
basin or waste trap or to clean out, repair or alter the same after the period
of 15 days, the IGU may cause such work to be completed at the expense of the
owner or representative thereof.
   (N)   Whenever any service connection becomes clogged, obstructed, broken or
out of order, or detrimental to the use of the public sewer, or unfit for the
purpose of drainage, the owner shall repair or cause such work to be done as
the city may direct. Each day after 15 days that a person neglects or fails to
so act shall constitute a separate violation of this section, and the IGU may
then cause the work to be done, and recover from such owner or agent the
expense thereof by an action in the name of the city.
   (O)   The owner or operator of any motor vehicle washing or servicing
facility shall provide and maintain in serviceable condition at all times, a
catch basin or waste trap in the building drain system to prevent grease, oil,
dirt or mineral deposit from entering the public sewer system.
   (P)   In addition to any penalties that may be imposed for violation of any
provision of this chapter, the city may assess against any person the cost of
repairing or restoring sewers or associated facilities damaged as a result of
the discharge of prohibited wastes by such person, any may collect such
assessment as an additional charge for the use of the public sewer system or in
any other manner deemed appropriate by the city.
   (Q)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefore, by the
industrial concern, providing that National Categorical Pretreatment Standards
and/or state disposal system permit limitations are not violated.

ON-SITE SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEMS
§ 53.45 INDIVIDUAL SEWAGE TREATMENT SYSTEMS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The purpose of the sewage and wastewater treatment
ordinance shall be to provide minimum standards for and regulation of
individual sewage treatment systems (ISTS) and septage disposal including the
proper location, design, construction, operation, maintenance, and repair to
protect surface water and ground water from contamination by human sewage and
waterborne household and commercial waste; to protect the public’s health and
safety, and eliminate or prevent the development of public nuisances pursuant
to the authority granted under M.S. Chapter 115 and Minnesota Rules Chapter
7080 as amended that may pertain to sewage and wastewater treatment.
   (B)   General provisions.
      (1)   Public sewer not available. Where a public sewer is not available
under the provisions of §
53.20 of the City Code, the building sewer shall be connected to a private
wastewater disposal system complying with the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   Standards adopted by reference. The city hereby adopts, by this
reference, Minnesota Rules Chapter 7080 as now constituted and from time to
time amended.
      (3)   Permits. No person shall install, alter, repair, or extend any
individual sewage treatment system in the city without first applying for and
obtaining a permit from the City Clerk at the same time, paying a fee as set
forth in the city fee schedule. Such permit shall be valid for a period of 12
months from the date of issuance.
      (4)   License requirements. No person shall engage in the evaluation,
inspection, design, installation, construction, alteration, extension, repair,
maintenance, or pumping of on-site individual sewage treatment systems without
first obtaining a license to perform such tasks from the Minnesota Pollution
Control Agency.
      (5)   Failing septic systems. A notice of noncompliance shall be issued
and copies provided to the property owner within 30 days under the following
conditions:
         (a)   An ISTS posing an imminent threat to public health or safety
shall be upgraded, replaced, or repaired, or its use discontinued, within an
appropriate time no greater than 60 days.
         (b)   A failing ISTS which is not an imminent threat to public health
that receives a notice of noncompliance shall be upgraded or its use
discontinued within 10 months after receiving such notice from the Building
Inspection Department.
         (c)   In the event a property owner fails to upgrade, replace, or
repair such failed system or discontinue its use within the time limits stated
above, the city shall contract for the property owner’s septic system to be
upgraded, replaced, or repaired and all costs associated thereto shall be
assessed to the property as outlined in division (I) of this section.
      (6)   Additional soil treatment area requirements. On all lots created
after November 2, 1987, there shall be 10,000 square feet of area tested and
suitable for a standard septic system to provide for a primary as well as a
secondary system to be installed.
      (7)   Point of sale requirements: existing septic systems. No owner of a
building located in the city which is not served by public sewer, shall sell
such building by conveyance or contract for conveyance without providing for an
inspection of the septic system by the Zoning Administrator or his or her
agent, or other appropriate agency, prior to the time of sale.
         (a)   TIME OF SALE shall mean when a written purchase agreement is
executed by the buyer or in the absence of a purchase agreement, the time of
the execution of any document providing for the conveyance by deed or contract.
         (b)   At the time of inspection, the Zoning Administrator or his or
her agent will determine if a system is compliant, failing or an imminent
health threat. Upgrade shall be required as follows:
            1.   Imminent public health threats shall be upgraded, replaced,
repaired, or use discontinued, within 60 days.
            2.   An existing system, built prior to April 1, 1996, and not in a
shoreland or wellhead protection area or serving food, beverage, or lodging
establishment, with less than 24 inches of vertical separation between the
bottom of the soil treatment system and saturated soil, shall be upgraded prior
to the sale of the property. If weather conditions prohibit repair of the
septic system prior to the time of sale, sufficient funds or a performance bond
shall be placed in escrow to repair the system at a date when weather
conditions permit.
            3.   An existing system, built on or after April 1, 1996, or in a
shoreland or wellhead protection area or serving a food, beverage, or lodging
establishment; with less than 36 inches of vertical separation between the
bottom of the soil treatment system and saturated soil, shall be upgraded prior
to the sale of the property. If weather conditions prohibit repair of the
septic system prior to the time of sale, sufficient funds or a performance bond
shall be placed in escrow to repair the system at a date when weather
conditions permit.
      (8)   Point of sale requirements: existing private wells.  No owner of a
building located in the city, which is served by a private well, shall sell
such building by conveyance or contract for conveyance without providing to the
city the results of a current test of the property’s well water for fecal
coliform and nitrates. The purpose of the water test is to develop a database
of the condition of the city’s well water resources.
      (9)   Collector systems. On previously developed sites where site and
soil conditions do not provide suitable conditions for final treatment and
disposal on an individual lot, a soil treatment system located on another lot
or lots may be employed under terms of a conditional use permit, where approved
by the City Council.
   (C)   Inspection requirements for new or replacement installations.
      (1)   Trench systems.
         (a)   Observation pit. Prior to the installation of a trench type
system, an observation pit must be dug for purposes of viewing the soil
profile. The observation pit may be the tank pit. This will help in preventing
trench systems being placed in saturated or anaerobic soil conditions.
         (b)   Tank Inspection. The tops of all tanks must be exposed for
viewing tank levelness, tank depth, and pipe connections. Manhole risers and
inspection pipes must be in place. The tank size stamp must be visible.
         (c)   Final inspection. The next inspection will be for the rockbed
placement. Laterals and drop boxes must be exposed for purposes of viewing
connections, lateral sizes, and lateral lengths. Inspection pipes must be in
place. All distribution pipes must be left uncovered for inspection unless the
distribution pipe is before an existing tank. Final approval will not be issued
until the pump and alarm (if required) are wired and the system is fully
operational. Geotextile fabric may be placed on the system after rockbed
approval.
         (d)   As-built drawings. The installer, upon completion of
installation, shall file with the Zoning Administrator as-built drawings
indicating the location of system components, dimensioned from a permanent
reference point.
      (2)   At grade and mound systems.
         (a)   Scarification. The soil must be prepared in the following
manner: all vegetation longer than 2 inches is to be cut and removed from the
site; the soil surface is to be roughened to a depth of 8 inches and not moved
more than 1 foot from its original location; and the plastic limit of the soil
must not be exceeded. If the soil can be rolled into a wire 1/8" or less, the
moisture content of the soil is too high for installation of a sewage treatment
system. If weather is threatening, Building Inspection Department must be
called for approval to cover the scratch without an inspection.
         (b)   Rockbed inspections. The rockbed must be level. Laterals and the
manifold must be exposed for viewing connections, and inspection pipes must be
in place. All distribution pipes must be left uncovered for inspection, unless
the distribution pipe is before an existing tank. Geotextile fabric may be
placed on the system, after rockbed approval.
         (c)   Tank inspection. The tops of all tanks must be exposed for
viewing tank levelness, tank depth, and pipe connections. Manhole risers and
inspection pipes must be in place. The tank size stamp must be visible.
         (d)   Final inspection. The fill cover depth on the system must be as
follows: a 12-inch loamy sand cap at the center of the rockbed, 6 inches at
rockbed edges. Six inches of topsoil (not peat) must be placed over the entire
system. Therefore, the total depth of soil at the center of the rockbed will be
18 inches and 12 inches at the rockbed edges. A vegetation cover must be
established. Hay or some other form of protective covering must be placed on
the system to protect seed. Final approval will not be issued until the pump
and alarm are wired and the system is fully operational.
         (e)   As-built drawings to be filed. The installer, upon completion of
installation, shall file with the Zoning Administrator as-built drawings
indicating the location of system components, dimensioned from a permanent
reference point.
      (3)   New tanks.
         (a)   The tops of all tanks must be exposed for viewing tank
levelness, tank depth, and pipe connections. Manhole risers and inspection
pipes must be in place. The tank size stamp must be visible. Final approval
will not be issued until the alarm (if required) is wired and the system is
fully operational.
         (b)   The installer, upon completion of installation, shall file with
the Zoning Administrator as-built drawings indicating the location of system
components, dimensioned from a permanent reference point.
      (4)   Reused tanks.
         (a)   Tanks being reused must meet all criteria stated in Minnesota
Rules Chapter 7080 and the City of Center City ISTS Ordinance.
         (b)   Tanks that meet the minimum size requirements of Minnesota Rules
Chapter 7080 may be reused.
         (c)   Tanks must be exposed for viewing.
      (5)   Inspection for point of sale.
         (a)   The area must be free of snow.
         (b)   The tank will be opened and pumped and the distribution box
open.
         (c)   The ground will be unfrozen or thawed to allow soil borings when
necessary.
         (d)   Access to the house may be necessary to check for alarm, etc.
   (D)   Mandatory maintenance required. The city hereby establishes a plan for
review of each on-site sewage systems within the city over a period of three
years beginning in 2011.
      (1)   The plan. Pursuant to the established plan, the city shall mail a
maintenance report form by April 1 of each year to properties containing on-
site sewage disposal systems due to have maintenance checks. All systems shall
have maintenance checks triennially. Those on-site sewage disposal systems
found to have permitted, through misuse or abuse, sludge and/or scum to exit
past the last septic tanks outlet baffle shall have biennial maintenance checks
until such time that it has been demonstrated that such misuse or abuse has
been abated.
         (a)   Each property owner receiving a maintenance report form shall at
their sole expense, provide for the pumping and maintenance of the system. The
completed maintenance report form and an administrative fee as set forth in the
city fee schedule shall be returned to the city by October 1 of the same year.
         (b)   The above-described system maintenance shall include, but not be
limited to, pumping and cleaning of the septic tank, evaluation of the
condition of the tank, baffles, and system, and an examination of the drain
field for evidence of system failure.
         (c)   Evaluation of the on-site septic tank and system shall be made
by a registered inspector or master pumper licensed by the State of Minnesota.
A listing of registered inspectors and pumpers are available from the MPCA and
shall also be available from the city.
         (d)   In the event a property owner fails to complete the maintenance
report form and return it to the city as required herein; the city shall
contract for the property owner's septic system to be pumped, cleaned, and
evaluated and all costs associated thereto shall be assessed against each
property as outlined in M.S. §§ 429.101, et seq.
         (e)   Upon evaluation, if the system is found to be an imminent threat
to public health, the owner of the property shall have the system pumped and
repaired or replaced pursuant to the requirements of this section.
         (f)   Any on-site inspection conducted by the city shall be invoiced
to the property owner in an amount established by ordinance.
         (g)   Pursuant to M.S. § 429.101, the City Council hereby authorizes
the city staff to certify any unpaid costs or charges imposed pursuant to this
section, to the County Auditor for collection as other taxes.
   (E)   Contaminated wells.
      (1)   Septic system inspection required. If a known well has exceeded the
standards set by the Minnesota State Department of Health for fecal coliform or
nitrates, all septic systems within a radius of 1500 feet shall, within 60 days
of receiving notice from the city, be required to submit to the city a current
certificate of compliance for their septic system.
      (2)   Temporary waiver. The city may temporarily waive the certificate of
compliance requirement when a well has been found to be contaminated during the
period from November 1 to April 30, provided that an inspection of the system
is performed by the following June 1 and the property owner submits a
certificate of compliance by the following September 30.
      (3)   Failure to provide certificate of compliance. In the event a
property owner fails to provide a certificate of compliance within the 60 days
the city will hire an inspector to conduct a compliance inspection and all
costs associated thereto shall be assessed to the property as outlined in
division (I) of this section.
      (4)   Failure to abate. In the event a property owner fails to upgrade,
replace, or repair such failed system or discontinue its use within the time
limits stated above, the city shall contract for the property owner's septic
system to be upgraded, replaced, or repaired and all costs associated thereto
shall be assessed to the property as outlined in division (I) of this section.
      (5)   Well water test required. All property owners that are required to
provide a certificate of compliance shall also provide to the city the results
of a current test of the property’s well water for fecal coliform and nitrates.
The purpose of the water test is to develop a database of the condition of the
city’s well water resources.
   (F)   Mandatory connection to city sewer. In the event that either an ISTS
or a private well fails to pass inspection, then the property owner shall be
required to connect to city sewer and city water pursuant to §

(Ord. 203, passed 9-1-1987; Am. Ord. 2011-06-07D, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 53.73 METERED BILLABLE FLOW RATE DETERMINATION.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   Each user shall pay operation, maintenance and replacement costs in
proportion to the user’s proportionate contribution of wastewater flows and
loadings to the treatment plant, with the minimum rate for loadings of BOD and
TSS being the rate established for concentrations of 200 mg/1 and BOD and 250
mg/l TSS (such as, normal domestic strength wastewater).
      (2)   Those "industrial users" discharging segregated "normal domestic
strength wastewater" only, can classified as "commercial users" for the purpose
of rate determination.
   (B)   User charges for normal domestic strength users.
      (1)   Calculating billable flows and loadings. The charges assessed
residential users and those of other classes connected to the city’s water
utility and discharging "normal domestic strength wastewater" shall be
established proportionately according to billable wastewater volume. Billable
wastewater volume shall be calculated as follows:
         (a)   Measurement of wastewater volume for residential users.
            1.   Measurement of wastewater volume for residential users
connected to the city’s water utility. Except as provided for herein, billable
wastewater volume for residential users shall be calculated on the basis of
metered water usage.
            2.   Measurement of wastewater volume for residential users not
connected to the city’s water utility.  
               a.   The charges assessed residential user and those users of
other classes discharging "normal domestic strength wastewater" who are not
connected to the city’s water utility shall be estimated.
               b.   Residential users may appeal the number of ERU’s assigned
to a particular connection by installing and maintaining, at their own expense,
water meters of a type approved by the city. The meters shall be equipped with
remote registering recorders located at an accessible site on the owner’s
property.
The city reserves the right to require residential users to install water
meters for the purpose of determining billable wastewater volume.
         (b)   Measurement of wastewater volume for nonresidential users.
            1.   The charges assessed nonresidential users discharging "normal
domestic strength wastewater" shall be established proportionately according to
billable wastewater volume. Billable wastewater volume shall be calculated as
follows: the billable wastewater volume of nonresidential users may be
determined in the same manner as for residential users connected to the city’s
water utility. Except that if the city determines that there are significant
seasonal variations in the metered water usage of nonresidential users
resulting in a proportionate increase (or decrease) in wastewater volume, then
billable wastewater volume shall be calculated on the basis of quarterly
metered water usage recorded throughout the year, calculated on the basis of
wastewater flow meters.
            2.   The city may, at its discretion, require nonresidential users
to install a water meter, or such additional water meters or wastewater flow
meters as may be necessary to determine billable wastewater volume.
         (c)   Determination of loadings for normal domestic strength users.
The billable amounts of BOD and TSS will be calculated from the volume of
metered water usage, as determined above, where the billable quantities will be
those attributable to wastewater at a concentration of 200 mg/l BOD and 250 mg/
1 TSS (such as, "Normal Domestic Strength Wastewater").
      (2)   Determination of user charges for normal domestic strength users. 
         (a)   User charges for normal domestic strength users.
 
Un = Comr
    Tbwv
 
            Where:   Un =   Unit cost for operation, maintenance and
replacement to treat normal domestic strength, in $/Kgal.
                  Comr =   (Total annual OM&R costs) - (charges collected to
treat concentrations greater than normal domestic strength; in accordance with
§ 52.74(E).
                  Tbwv =   Total annual billable wastewater volume in Kgal.
         (b)   Calculation of user charge for normal domestic strength
wastewater.
               Un = Un X bwv
            Where:   Uc =   User charge
                  Un =   Unit cost for operation, maintenance and replacement
to treat normal domestic strength in $/Kgal.
                  bwv =   Billable wastewater volume of a particular user in
Kgal.
         (c)   Calculation of administrative charge for normal domestic
strength wastewater.
               Ad = Cad ÷ #eu
            Where:   Ad =   Administrative Charge per user.
                  Cad =   Total budget for administrating and treating I/I.
                  #eu =   Number of equivalent users.
   (C)   The sewer service charges established in this subchapter shall not
prevent the assessment of additional charges to users who discharge wastes with
concentrations greater than normal domestic strength or wastes of unusual
character or contractual agreements with such users, as long as the following
conditions are met:
      (1)   The user pays operation, maintenance and replacement costs
proportion to the user’s proportionate contribution of wastewater flows and
loadings to the treatment plant, and no user is charged at a rate less than
that of “normal domestic strength wastewater.”
      (2)   (a)   The measurements of such wastes are conducted according to
the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and
Wastewater, in a manner acceptable to the city as provided for in this
subchapter.
         (b)   A study of unit costs of collection and treatment processes
attributable to flow, BOD, TSS and other significant loading shall be developed
for determining the proportionate allocation of costs to flows and loadings for
user discharging wastes of greater than normal domestic strength or wastes of
unusual character.

§ 53.74 ANNUAL REVIEW OF USER CHARGE SYSTEM.
   (A)   Annual review.
      (1)   The user charges to be assessed sewer utility users, the total
costs for operation, maintenance and replacement, and the wastewater flow and
waste contribution by users and user classes shall be reviewed annually by the
city. The City Clerk/Treasurer shall submit annually to the Council a report
which shall include at least the following:
         (a)   Total costs for operation, maintenance and replacement for the
previous year and estimated for the next year, divided into the aforesaid
categories and further distributed among the functions for these categories:
treatment, conveyance, collection and administration.
         (b)   Total revenue collected by user class for the proceeding year.
         (c)   Estimated or measured flow discharged by each user class for the
preceding and succeeding years, including infiltration and inflow.
         (d)   Estimated or measured waste discharged by each user class for
the preceding and succeeding years.
         (e)   Method for proportionately distributing the succeeding year’s
estimated operation, maintenance and replacement costs to each user class which
shall comprise the proposed user charge system.
      (2)   The proposed user charge system shall be submitted to the Council
for review and approval. Upon acceptance of the sewer utility budget by the
Council, the user charge rates shall be established by Council resolution. The
user charge rates shall be established to meet these general requirements:
         (a)   Maintain the proportionate distribution of operation and
maintenance and replacement costs among users and user classes.
         (b)   Generate sufficient revenue to pay the total operation,
maintenance and replacement costs necessary for proper operation, maintenance
and replacement of the sewer utility.
         (c)   Apply excess revenues collected from a class of users to the
costs of operation, maintenance and replacement attributable to that class for
the next year and adjust the user charges accordingly.
         (d)   Calculate the user charge based upon the flow and waste load
estimated to be discharged to the sewer utility in the succeeding year,
including infiltration and inflow.
   (B)   Notification to users. At least annually, following the approval of
the user charges by the Council, each user shall be notified of the rate and
that portion of the user charge which is attributable to operation, maintenance
and replacement costs of sewer utility services. The notification shall be made
in conjunction with a regular bill.

   (A)   Rates. The wastewater service charges for the use of and for service
supplied by the wastewater facilities of the city shall be established by
ordinance and audited annually.
   (B)   Bills.
      (1)   The rates or charges for service shall be payable quarterly. The
owner of the premises, the occupant thereof and the user of the service shall
be jointly liable to pay for the service to such premises and the service is
furnished to the premises by the city only upon the condition that the owner of
the premises, occupant, and user of the services are jointly liable therefore
to the city.
      (2)   Bills for sewer service shall be sent out by the city within 15
days of end of each quarter for which the service is billed.
      (3)   All sewer bills are due and payable 30 days after being sent out. A
penalty of 10% shall be added to all bills not paid by the 30th day after they
have been rendered.
   (C)   Delinquent bills. If the charges for services are not paid within 90
days after the rendition of the bill for such services, the services may be
discontinued without further notice and shall not be reinstated until all
claims are settled.
   (D)   Lien-notice of delinquency.
      (1)   Whenever a bill for sewer service remains unpaid for 90 days after
it has been rendered, the city may file with the County Recorder a statement of
lien claim. This statement shall contain the legal description of the premises
served, the amount of the unpaid bill, and a notice that the city claims a lien
for this amount as well as for all charges subsequent to the period covered by
the bill.
      (2)   If the user whose bill is unpaid is not the owner of the premises
and the city has notice of this, notice shall be mailed to the owner of the
premises if his or her address be known to the city, whenever such bill remains
unpaid for the period of 90 days after it has been rendered. The failure of the
city to record such lien or to mail such notice or the failure of the owner to
receive such notice shall not affect the right to foreclose the lien for unpaid
bills as mentioned in the foregoing section.
   (E)   Foreclosure of lien. Property subject to a lien for unpaid charges may
be sold for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds of the sale shall be
applied to pay the charges, after deducting costs, as is the case in the
foreclosure of statutory liens. The foreclosures shall be by bill in equity in
the name of the city. The city’s attorney is hereby authorized and directed to
institute such proceedings in the name of the city in any court having
jurisdiction over such matters against any property for which the bill has
remained unpaid 90 days after it has been rendered.
   (F)   Revenues.

respect in the manner provided by statute.
   (G)   Accounts. The city shall establish a proper system of accounts and
shall keep proper books, records, and accounts in which complete and correct
entries shall be made of all transactions relative to the sewerage system, and
at regular annual intervals shall cause to be made an audit by an independent
auditing concern of the books to show the receipts and disbursements of the
sewerage system. In addition to the customary operating statements, an annual
audit report shall also reflect the revenues and operating expenses of the
wastewater facilities, including a replacement cost, to indicate that sewer
service charges under the wastewater cost recovery system and capital amounts
required to be recovered do in fact meet these regulations. In this regard, the
financial information to be shown in the audit report shall include the
following:
      (1)   Flow data showing total gallons sent to the wastewater plant for

§ 54.01 STORMWATER DRAINAGE UTILITY ESTABLISHED.
   The municipal storm sewer system shall be operated as a public utility
pursuant to M.S. § 444.075, as amended from time to time, from which revenues
will be derived subject to the provisions of this chapter and Minnesota
Statutes.
(Ord. 2011-06-07E, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 54.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of all funds derived is to pay for all or part of the
construction, reconstruction, repair, enlargement, improvement, or other
obtainment and the maintenance, operation, and use of the storm sewer utility
as established by the city. All revenues derived from the fee shall be credited
to the appropriate storm sewer fund.
(Ord. 2011-06-07E, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 54.03 DEFINITION.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definition shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   RESIDENTIAL EQUIVALENT FACTOR (REF).  One REF is defined as the ratio of the
average volume of runoff generated by a given land use to the average volume of
runoff generated by a typical single-family residential land during a standard
1-year rainfall event.
(Ord. 2011-06-07E, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 54.04 STORMWATER DRAINAGE FEES.
   Stormwater drainage fees for parcels of land shall be determined by
multiplying the REF for a parcel’s land use by the parcel’s acreage and
multiplying by 1.5. The resulting number shall be rounded up to the nearest
whole number, which product shall then be multiplied by the stormwater drainage
rate. The REF values for various land uses are as follows:
 
Classification Land Uses                                     REF
1              Parks with parking facilities                 .88
2              Single-family and duplex residential          1.00
3              Public and private schools, community center, 1.13
               churches, and governmental buildings
4              Multiple-family residential                   1.75
5              Commercial, industrial, warehouse             3.00
6              Improved vacant                               As assigned
 
   Land uses which do not fall within the categories of this section, including
“Improved vacant” uses, shall be calculated on a case-by-case basis using 3700
square feet of impervious surface area as 1 REF.
(Ord. 2011-06-07E, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 54.05 STORMWATER DRAINAGE RATE.
   The stormwater drainage rate shall be set forth in the city fee schedule at
a per-month, per- REF-acre rate, billed quarterly.
(Ord. 2011-06-07E, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 54.06 ONE-FAMILY AND DUPLEX PARCELS.
   For the purpose of calculating stormwater drainage fees, all developed one-
family and duplex parcels shall be considered to have an acreage of 1/3 acre.
(Ord. 2011-06-07E, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 54.07 CREDITS.
   The Council may adopt policies recommended by the City Engineer, by
resolution, for adjustment of the stormwater drainage fee for parcels based
upon hydrologic data to be supplied by property owners, which data demonstrates
a hydrologic response substantially different from the standards. Such
adjustments of stormwater drainage fees shall not be made retroactively. A
credit reduction of one-half of the stormwater utility fee amount shall be
given to owners of commercial lots who construct and maintain city-approved
retention and storm treatment facilities.
(Ord. 2011-06-07E, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 54.08 EXEMPTIONS.
   The following land uses are exempt from stormwater drainage fees:
   (A)   Public rights-of-way.
   (B)   Vacant and unimproved land with ground cover, such as agricultural and
conservation zoned land that does not have a residential or commercial building
on the parcel. Platted and subdivided land is not included as exempt.
   (C)   Lakes.
   (D)   Wetlands recognized by local authorities.
   (E)   City owned property, city parks, and city libraries.
   (F)   Cemeteries.
   (G)   Church parks and church ballfields.
(Ord. 2011-06-07E, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 54.09 PAYMENT OF FEE.
   (A)   A statement for charges shall be rendered quarterly in January, April,
July and October of each year. The statements will be mailed out no later than
the 15th of the month the meters are read and shall be due no later than the
15th of the following month (if the 15th lands on Saturday or Sunday or a
holiday that the city offices are closed, the bill will be due the following
business day). If the bill is not paid by the due date, there will be a late
charge as set forth in the fee schedule assessed to the bill.
   (B)   Delinquent accounts shall be handled as set forth in §
51.05 of the Center City code.
(Ord. 2011-06-07E, passed 6-7-2011; Am. Res. 2022-04-05E, passed 4-5-2022)
§ 54.10 RECALCULATION OF FEE.
   If a property owner or person responsible for paying the stormwater drainage
fee questions the correctness of an invoice for such charge, such person may
have the determination of the charge recomputed by written request to the city
made within 12 months of mailing of the invoice in question by the city.
(Ord. 2011-06-07E, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 54.11 LATE PAYMENT CHARGE.
   Each quarterly billing for stormwater drainage fees not paid when due shall
incur a quarterly carrying charge as set forth in the city fee schedule
pursuant to §
51.05.
(Ord. 2011-06-07E, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 54.12 CERTIFICATION OF PAST DUE FEES ON TAXES.
   Any past due stormwater drainage fees in excess of 30 days past due on
October 1 of any year may be certified to the County Auditor for collection
with real estate taxes in the following year pursuant to M.S. § 444.075, Subd.
3, as amended from time to time. In addition, the city shall also have the
right to bring a civil action or to take other legal remedies to collect unpaid
fees.

in the manner and to the condition required by the city, or fails to
satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the city, the
city at its option may do such work. In that event the permittee shall pay to
the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If

breach.

to prevent the commission and maintenance of public nuisances. Except in
emergency situations of imminent danger to human life and safety, no police
officer or designated person shall enter private property for the purpose of
inspecting or preventing public nuisances without the permission of the owner,
resident or other person in control of the property, unless the officer or
person designated has obtained a warrant or order from a court of competent
jurisdiction authorizing the entry, as provided in §
10.20.
§ 92.23 ABATEMENT.
   (A)   Notice. Written notice of violation; notice of the time, date, place
and subject of any hearing before the City Council; notice of City Council
order; and notice of motion for summary enforcement hearing shall be given as
set forth in this section.
      (1)   Notice of violation. Written notice of violation shall be served by
a peace officer or designated person on the owner of record or occupant of the
premises either in person or by certified or registered mail. If the premises
is not occupied, the owner of record is unknown, or the owner of record or
occupant refuses to accept notice of violation, notice of violation shall be
served by posting it on the premises.
      (2)   Notice of City Council hearing. Written notice of any City Council
hearing to determine or abate a nuisance shall be served on the owner of record
and occupant of the premises either in person or by certified or registered
mail. If the premises is not occupied, the owner of record is unknown, or the
owner of record or occupant refuses to accept notice of the City Council
hearing, notice of City Council hearing shall be served by posting it on the
premises.
      (3)   Notice of City Council order. Except for those cases determined by
the city to require summary enforcement, written notice of any City Council
order shall be made as provided in M.S. § 463.17 (Hazardous and Substandard
Building Act), as it may be amended from time to time.
      (4)   Notice of motion for summary enforcement. Written notice of any
motion for summary enforcement shall be made as provided for in M.S. § 463.17
(Hazardous and Substandard Building Act), as it may be amended from time to

that a public nuisance is being maintained or exists on the premises in the
city, the officer or person designated shall notify in writing the owner of
record or occupant of the premises of the fact and order that the nuisance be
terminated or abated. The notice of violation shall specify the steps to be
taken to abate the nuisance and the time within which the nuisance is to be
abated. If the notice of violation is not complied with within the time
specified, the officer or designated person shall report that fact forthwith to
the City Council. Thereafter, the City Council may, after notice to the owner
or occupant and an opportunity to be heard, determine that the condition
identified in the notice of violation is a nuisance and further order that if
the nuisance is not abated within the time prescribed by the City Council, the
city may seek injunctive relief by serving a copy of the City Council order and
notice of motion for summary enforcement or obtain an administrative search and
seizure warrant and abate the nuisance.
   (C)   Emergency procedure; summary enforcement. In cases of emergency, where
delay in abatement required to complete the notice and procedure requirements
set forth in divisions (A) and (B) of this section will permit a continuing
nuisance to unreasonably endanger public health safety or welfare, the City
Council may order summary enforcement and abate the nuisance. To proceed with
summary enforcement, the officer or designated person shall determine that a
public nuisance exists or is being maintained on premises in the city and that
delay in abatement of the nuisance will unreasonably endanger public health,
safety or welfare. The officer or designated person shall notify in writing the
occupant or owner of the premises of the nature of the nuisance and of the
city's intention to seek summary enforcement and the time and place of the City
Council meeting to consider the question of summary enforcement. The City
Council shall determine whether or not the condition identified in the notice
to the owner or occupant is a nuisance, whether public health, safety or
welfare will be unreasonably endangered by delay in abatement required to
complete the procedure set forth in division (A) of this section, and may order
that the nuisance be immediately terminated or abated. If the nuisance is not
immediately terminated or abated, the City Council may order summary
enforcement and abate the nuisance.
   (D)   Immediate abatement. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city,
without notice or other process, from immediately abating any condition which
poses an imminent and serious hazard to human life or safety.

shall prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the owner. Thereupon the
amount shall be immediately due and payable at the office of the City Clerk/
Treasurer.
   (B)   Assessment. After notice and hearing as provided in M.S. § 429.061, as
it may be amended from time to time, if the nuisance is a public health or
safety hazard on private property, the accumulation of snow and ice on public
sidewalks, the growth of weeds on private property or outside the traveled
portion of streets, or unsound or insect-infected trees, the City Clerk/
Treasurer shall, on or before September 1 next following abatement of the
nuisance, list the total unpaid charges along with all other charges as well as
other charges for current services to be assessed under M.S. § 429.101 against
each separate lot or parcel to which the charges are attributable. The City
Council may then spread the charges against the property under that statute and
other pertinent statutes for certification to the County Auditor and collection
along with current taxes the following year or in annual installments, not
exceeding 10, as the City Council may determine in each case.

95.01   Findings and intent
   
95.02   Definitions
   
95.03   Sexual offender and sexual predator residence prohibition; penalties;
exceptions
   
95.04   Property owners prohibited from renting real property to certain sexual
offenders and sexual predators; penalties
   
95.05   Severability
§ 95.01 FINDINGS AND INTENT.
   (A)   Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence,
and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an
extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to
use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders
commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are
prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual
offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly
exorbitant.
   (B)   It is the intent of this chapter to serve the city’s compelling
interest to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety, and welfare of
the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children
regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders
and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent
residence.
(Ord. 2012-09-08A, passed 9-8-2012)
§ 95.02 DEFINITIONS.
   The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall
have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context
clearly indicates a different meaning:

sexual offense, regardless of whether adjudication has been withheld, in which
the victim of the offense was less than 16 years of age, or has been
categorized as a Level III sex offender under M.S. § 244.052 or successor
statute.
   DESIGNATED SEXUAL OFFENSE.  A conviction, adjudication of delinquency,
commitment under M.S. Chapter 253B, or admission of guilt under oath without
adjudication involving any of the following offenses: M.S. §§ 609.342, 609.343,
609.344, 609.345, 609.352, 609.365, 617.23, 617.246, 617.247, 617.293,
successor statutes, or a similar offense from another state.
   PERMANENT RESIDENCE. A place where the person abides, lodges, or resides for
14 or more consecutive days.
   TEMPORARY RESIDENCE. A place where the person abides, lodges, or resides for
a period of 14 or more days in the aggregate during any calendar year and which

nonconsecutive days in any month and which is not the person’s permanent

   (C)   Measurement of distance.
      (1)   For purposes of determining the minimum distance separation, the
requirement shall be measured by following a straight line from the outer

      (5)   The residence is also the primary residence of the person’s
parents, grandparents, siblings, spouse, or children.
      (6)   The residence is a property owned or leased by the Minnesota
Department of Corrections.
(Ord. 2012-09-08A, passed 9-8-2012)
§ 95.04 PROPERTY OWNERS PROHIBITED FROM RENTING REAL PROPERTY TO CERTAIN SEXUAL

§ 96.01 PURPOSE.
   It is hereby declared to be the policy of the City of Center City to
encourage citizen participation in the planting and maintenance of trees in
public rights-of-way; to regulate the transplanting or removal of such trees
and shrubs in order to eliminate and guard against dangerous conditions which
may result in injury to persons using the streets, sidewalks, or property of
the city; to promote and enhance the beauty and general welfare of the city by
promoting planting and specifically by preserving, if at all possible, existing
trees and shrubs; to prevent damage to any public sewer or water main, street,
sidewalk, or other public property; to protect trees and shrubs located in
public areas from undesirable and unsafe planting, removal, treatment, and
maintenance practices; and to guard all trees and shrubs within the city
against the spread of disease or pests. It is the intent of the City Council
that the provisions of this chapter shall apply to all trees, shrubs, or plants
growing or hereafter planted in or upon any public right-of-way or other
premises owned or controlled by the city, and also to all trees or shrubs
growing or to be planted in or upon any private premises which shall threaten
the lives, health, safety, or welfare of the public or of the property owned or

§ 114.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   Studies conducted by the Minnesota Attorney General and the Texas City
Attorneys’ Association, as well as the cities of St. Paul, Alexandria, and
Rochester, Minnesota; Indianapolis, Indiana; Phoenix, Arizona; Los Angeles,
California; Seattle, Washington; St. Croix County, Wisconsin; Adams County and
the City of Denver, Colorado, have examined the impact that adult
establishments have on their respective communities. These studies concluded
that adult establishments have an adverse impact on surrounding neighborhoods.
Those impacts include increased crime rates, lower property values, increased
transiency, neighborhood blight and potential health risks. The City Council of
the City of Center City is relying on the studies, many of which were conducted
in larger cities, recognizing that the same or similar adverse impacts could
occur in a small city such as the City of Center City. Based on these studies,
the City Council makes the following findings regarding the need to regulate
adult establishments:
   (A)   The public health, safety, morals, and general welfare will be
promoted by the city adopting regulations governing adult establishments.
   (B)   Adult establishments have adverse secondary impacts of the types set
forth above.
   (C)   The adverse impacts caused by adult establishments tend to diminish if
adult establishments are governed by location requirements, licensing
requirements, and health requirements.
   (D)   It is not the intent to prohibit adult establishments from having a
reasonable opportunity to locate in the city.
   (E)   Many members of the public perceive areas within which adult
establishments are located as less safe than other areas that do not have such
uses.
   (F)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place
the burden of reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the
adult establishment. A licensing procedure will place an incentive on the
operators to see that the adult establishment is run in a manner consistent
with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as
the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances
that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually-oriented business,
fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring
therein.
   (G)   The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted
of a sexually-related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant
may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.
   (H)   The barring of individuals with sexually-related criminal convictions
from the management of adult establishments for a period of years serves as a
deterrent to and prevents conduct which may lead to the transmission of
sexually-transmitted diseases.
   (I)   The general health, safety, and welfare of the community is promoted
by prohibiting nudity in adult establishments. This prohibition is based on
concerns of potential adverse effects such as prostitution, the transmission of
sexually-transmitted diseases, exposure to minors, obscenity and unsanitary
conditions in public places.
   (J)   Small cities experience many of the same adverse impacts of adult
establishments present in larger communities.

structure, district or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural
features should be avoided when possible.

destroy significant historical, architectural, or cultural material, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of
the property, neighborhood, or environment.
      (10)      Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures
shall be done in such a manner, that if such additions or alterations were to
be removed in the future, the essential-form and integrity of the structure
would be unimpaired.
   (D)   Findings. Before approving any building activity, the Commission shall
make findings based on the program for rehabilitation and preservation of the
heritage preservation site or district in regard to the following.

proposed structures designated to replace the present building or buildings.
      (3)   In the case of a proposed new building, the Commission shall make
written findings on how the building will in itself, or by reason of its
location on the property, materially affect the architectural or historic value
of buildings on adjacent sites or in the immediate vicinity of the heritage
preservation site.

§ 170.08 MINIMUM DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Application. The following land subdivision principles, standards and
requirements will be applied by the Commission in evacuating plans for proposed
subdivisions:
      (1)    Where literal compliance with the standards herein specified is
clearly impractical, upon recommendation of the Planning Commission, or, in the
absence of such recommendation, at its own discretion, the Council may modify
or adjust the standards to permit reasonable utilization of property while
securing substantial conformance with the objectives of these regulations,
including the issuance of a variance, if appropriate, as provided herein.
      (2)   The proposed subdivision shall conform to the Comprehensive
Development Plan of the city.
   (B)   Land requirements.
      (1)   Land shall be suited to the purpose for which it is to be
subdivided. No preliminary plan shall be approved if the site is not suitable
for purposes of the kind proposed by reason of potential flooding, topography,
or adverse earth or rock formation.
      (2)   Land subject to hazards to life, health, or property shall not be
subdivided for residential purposes until all such hazards have been eliminated
or unless adequate safeguards against such hazards are provided by the
subdivision plan.
      (3)   Proposed subdivisions shall be coordinated with existing nearby
municipalities or neighborhoods so that the community as a whole may develop
harmoniously.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)

   (A)   Proposed roads shall conform to the state, county, and/or city plans
as have been prepared, adopted, and/or filed as prescribed by law.
   (B)   Roads shall be logically related to the topography so as to produce
usable lots and reasonable grades.
   (C)   Access shall be given to all lots and portions of the tract in the
subdivision, and to adjacent unsubdivided territory unless the topography
clearly indicates that such connection is not feasible. Reserved strips, and
land-locked areas shall not be created.
   (D)   Minor roads shall be laid out to discourage their use by through
traffic, and where possible, thoroughfares shall be protected for use by
service roads or marginal access roads.
   (E)   Half or partial roads will not be permitted, except where essential to
reasonable subdivision of a tract in conformance with the other requirements
and standards of these regulations and where, in addition, satisfactory
assurance for dedication of the remaining part of the road can be secured.
   (F)   Wherever a tract to be subdivided borders an existing half, or partial
road, the other part of the road shall be platted within such tract.
   (G)   Dead-end roads shall be prohibited, except as stubs to permit future
road extension into adjoining tracts, or when designed as cul-de-sac roads.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 170.10 CUL-DE-SAC ROADS.
   (A)   Cul-de-sac roads, permanently designed as such, shall not exceed 300
feet in length, except by variance. Such a variance may be granted if it can be
clearly shown that by reason of unfavorable land form, or the irregular shape
of the land from which the subdivision is being made, a normal street pattern
cannot be established, or that land would be wasted by not granting such a
variance.
   (B)   Unless future extension is clearly impractical or undesirable, the
turnaround right-of-way shall be placed adjacent to a property line and a
right-of-way of the same width as the street shall be carried to the property
line in such a way as to permit future extension of the street into the
adjoining tract. At such time as such a street is extended, the overage created
by the turnaround outside the boundaries of the extended street shall revert in
ownership to the property owner fronting on the temporary turnaround.

§ 170.22 SUBDIVISIONS WITHOUT MUNICIPAL WATER AND SEWER.
   In subdivisions where municipal water and sewer services are not presently
available, the Planning Commission may recommend and require that the lots in
the subdivision be consistent with the requirements for lots with public sewer
and water as set forth above, and that the developer convey 2 or more lots for
the purpose of transfer of ownership or building development, and further that
any such building development be confined to 1 of the multiple lots conveyed.
At such time as municipal sewer service becomes immediately available, and upon
connection of the existing building development to same, the undeveloped lots
may be conveyed to other persons or entities and building development may be
permitted on same.

§ 170.23 IMPROVEMENTS.
   Before the Council shall approve a final plat of a subdivision, the
subdivider shall provide the required improvements at his or her own expense,
shall give bond in an amount equal to the engineer’s estimate or make other
financial arrangements acceptable to the Council to cover the cost of the
following:
   (A)   Survey monuments. All subdivision boundary corners, block and lot
corners, road intersection corners and points of tangency and curvature shall
be marked with survey monuments meeting the minimum requirements of state law.
All United States, state, county, and other official bench marks, monuments, or
triangular stations in or adjacent to the property shall be preserved in
precise position unless a relocation is approved by the controlling agency.
   (B)   Grading. Roads and lots shall be graded to secure proper drainage.
   (C)   Surface water drainage. Surface water drainage shall be provided by
storm sewers or drainage courses adequate to drain surface water from the
subdivision and protect roadway pavements.
   (D)   Minimum pavement width and roadway surfacing.  Roads shall meet the
standards set forth herein and shall be approved after inspection by the
engineer.
   (E)   Sanitation.  
      (1)   Where lots cannot be connected with a public sewerage system,
provisions must be made for sanitary sewerage facilities, consisting of a
central treatment plant or approved individual disposal systems for each lot.
This does not mean that the installation of individual disposal systems shall
be at the expense of the subdivider.
      (2)   All approved sewage disposal systems shall comply with the
regulations and recommended standards of the city and the Minnesota Department
of Health and the Pollution Control Agency.
   (F)   Water supply.  
      (1)   Water supply for tall areas shall be designed to meet regulations
and recommended standards of the city and the Minnesota Department of Health.
Where connection with a public water system is feasible, the public water
facilities shall be utilized.
      (2)   When the subdivision is located within the service area of the
public water supply system, water mains not less than 6 inches in diameter
shall be constructed throughout the entire subdivision in such a manner as to
serve adequately all lots and tracts with connection to such public system
together with shut-off valves and fire hydrants at intervals of not less than
600 feet.
   (G)   Miscellaneous facilities.  Tree planting street name signs, traffic
control signs, over-sized utility trunk lines, pedestrian ways, and other
improvements may be required.
   (H)   Payment for installation of improvements. The required improvements to
be furnished and installed by the subdivider, which are listed and described,
are to be furnished and installed at the sole expense of the subdivider;
provided however, that in the case of an improvement, the cost of which would
by general policy be assessed only in part to the improved property and the
remaining cost paid out of general tax levy, provision may be made for payment
of a portion of the cost by the city and provided further, that if any
improvement installed within the subdivision will be of substantial benefit to
lands beyond the boundaries of the subdivision, provision may, be made for
causing a portion of the cost of the improvement, representing the benefit to
such lands, to be assessed against the same and in such ease the subdivider
will be required only to pay for such portion of the whole cost of the
improvement as will represent the benefit to the property within the
subdivision.
   (I)   Required agreement providing for proper installation of improvements.
Prior to installation of any required improvements and prior to approval of the
final plat, the subdivider shall enter into a contract in writing with the city
requiring the subdivider to furnish and construct the improvements at his or
her sole cost and, in accordance with plans and specifications and usual
contract conditions, which may include provision for supervision of details of
construction by the Engineer and grant to the Engineer authority to correlate
the work to be done under the contract by any subcontractors authorized to
proceed there under and with any other work being done or contracted by the
city in the vicinity.
   (J)   Construction plans.  Construction plans for the required improvements
conforming in all respects with the standards of the Engineer and the
ordinances of the city, shall be prepared at the subdivider’s expense by a
professional engineer or land surveyor who is registered in the State of
Minnesota, and the plans shall contain his or her seal. The plans, together
with the quantities of construction items, shall be submitted to the City
Engineer for his or her approval and for his or her estimate of the total cost
of the required improvements; upon approval they shall become a part of the
contract required. The tracings of the plans approved by the City Engineer plus
2 prints shall be furnished to the city to be filed by the City Engineer as a
record.
   (K)   Inspection. All required improvements on the site that are to be
installed under the provisions of this chapter may be inspected during the
course of construction by the City Engineer or Building Official.
   (L)   Improvements completed prior to approval of final plat.  Improvements
within a subdivision which have been completed prior to application for
approval of the final plat shall be accepted as equivalent improvements in
compliance with the requirements only if the engineer shall certify that he or
she is satisfied that the existing improvements conform to applicable
standards.
   (M)   Incomplete improvements.  In the event of small subdivisions or in
subdivisions in which development may proceed slowly, or in other events in
which the provision of surfaced streets, utility lines, or other improvements
is clearly not feasible immediately following approval of the final plat, the
city may elect to commence assessment proceedings, utilize funds of a cash
escrow agreement, or otherwise move to finance and install improvements when
the subdivision is developed to the point of warranting the improvements. The
improvements are required in order to provide greater assurance of public
health, assure reliability of water supply, provide for economy of
installation, provide more effective fire fighting through hydrants, and
otherwise protect the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare.

§ 170.24 VARIANCES.
   (A)   The Planning Commission may recommend a variance to the City Council
from the requirements of subdivision planning procedure or public improvements
when a group housing or cluster development is proposed or in specific cases
when the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size, shape, or character,
or is surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict
compliance with the requirements of this section would result in substantial
hardship or injustice.
   (B)   The standards and requirements of these regulations may be modified by
the Council in the case of plans which, in the judgment of the Council, achieve
substantially the objectives of these regulations and which are further
protected by such covenants or other legal provisions as will assure conformity
to and achievement of this plan.
   (C)   In recommending any variance, the Commission shall take into account
the following:
      (1)   The features of the natural terrain and considerations of
preservation of scenic beauty and conservation practices.
      (2)   The location of the proposed subdivision, proposed land use, and
existing use of land in the vicinity.
      (3)   The number of persons to reside or work in the proposed subdivision
and the probable effect of the proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in
the vicinity.
      (4)   Those variances that will allow the subdivider to develop his
property in a reasonable manner and at the same time preserve the general
intent and spirit of this chapter and protect the public welfare and interests
of the city.
   (D)   Variances from the strict application of this chapter may also be
granted in the case of planned developments provided the Council, upon review
and recommendations from the Planning Commission, shall find that the proposed
development is fully consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter; a
PLANNED DEVELOPMENT shall be considered any development of more than 3 acres
which consists of 2 or more principal structures or uses on a single lot or
parcel of land for which a complete, detailed plan has been submitted showing
all proposed structures, uses, traffic-ways, sidewalks, landscaping, off-street
parking and other features and facilities. This provision of the chapter is
intended to provide flexibility needed for new land planning and land
development trends and techniques.
   (E)   (1)   Variances. The Council may grant a variance upon receiving a
report from the Planning Commission in any particular case where the subdivider
has shown that by reason of exceptional topography or other physical conditions
the strict compliance with these regulations could cause an exceptional and
undue hardship on the enjoyment of a substantial property right provided such
relief may be granted without detriment to the public welfare and without
substantially impairing the intent and purpose of these regulations.
      (2)   Application required. Application for any such variance shall be
made in writing by the subdivider at the time when the preliminary plat is
filed for consideration, stating fully all facts relied upon by the petitioner,
and shall be supplemented with maps, plans, or other additional data which may
aid the Planning Commission in the analysis of the proposed project. The plans
for such development shall include such covenants, restrictions, or other legal
provisions necessary to guarantee the full achievement of the plan.
      (3)   The Planning Commission shall consider such application, give its
written recommendations thereon, with the reasons therefore, at the time of its
approval or disapproval of the plan. If the Planning Commission refuses to
recommend a variance within 70 days, the subdivider may at once petition the
Council for a review of the decision of application for variance.

Chapter 54
§ 171.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. This chapter is adopted pursuant to M.S. §§
462.351 to 462.364, as it may be amended from time to time.
   (B)   Findings. The city hereby finds that uncontrolled and inadequate
planned use of wetlands, woodlands, natural habitat areas, areas subject to
soil erosion and areas containing restrictive soils adversely affects the
public health, safety, and general welfare by impacting water quality and
contributing to other environmental problems, creating nuisances, impairing
other beneficial uses of environmental resources and hindering the ability of
the city to provide adequate water, sewage, flood control, and other community
services. In addition, extraordinary public expenditures may be required for
the protection of persons and property in areas which may be affected by
unplanned land use.
   (C)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to promote, preserve, and
enhance the natural resources within the city and protect them from adverse
effects caused by poorly sited development or incompatible activities by
regulating land disturbing or development activities that would have an adverse
and potentially irreversible impact on water quality and unique and fragile
environmentally sensitive land; by minimizing conflicts and encouraging
compatibility between land disturbing and development activities and water
quality and environmentally sensitive lands; and by requiring detailed review
standards and procedures for land disturbing or development activities proposed
for the areas, thereby achieving a balance between urban growth and
development.
   (D)   Applicability. Every applicant applying for a permit to allow land
disturbing activities of one acre or greater must submit a stormwater
management plan to the City Engineer. No building permit, subdivision approval,
or development permit to allow land disturbing activities may be issued for
that site until approval of the stormwater management plan or a waiver of the
approval requirement has been obtained in strict conformance with the
provisions of this chapter.
   (E)   Exemptions. The provisions of this chapter do not apply to:
      (1)   Any part of a subdivision if a plat for the subdivision has been
approved by the city on or before the effective date of this chapter;
      (2)   A lot for which a building permit has been approved;
      (3)   Installation of fence, sign, telephone, cable television, fiber
optic cable, electric poles, and other kinds of posts or poles, utility lines,
or service connections to these utilities which result in creating under 5,000
square feet of exposed soil; and
      (4)   Emergency work to protect life, limb, or property and emergency
repairs, unless the land disturbing activity would have otherwise required an
approved erosion and sediment control plan, except for the emergency. If a plan
would have been required, then the disturbed land area shall be shaped and
stabilized in accordance with the city’s requirements as soon as possible.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)

   (F)   Conditions. A stormwater management plan may be approved subject to
compliance with conditions reasonable and necessary to insure that the
requirements of this chapter are met. Conditions may limit the size, kind, or
character of the proposed development, require the construction of structures,
drainage facilities, storage basins and other facilities, require replacement
of vegetation, establish required monitoring procedures, stage the work over
time, require alteration of the site design to insure buffering and require the
conveyance to the city or other public entity of necessary lands or easements.
   (G)   Performance bond.
      (1)   An irrevocable letter of credit or other form of security shall be
requested to cover the amount of the established cost of complying with the
conditions in an amount of no less than $3,000 per gross acre or $1,500 for
each single or twin family home or equivalent, whichever is greater and as
calculated by the City Engineer. The bond must guarantee completion and
compliance with conditions within a specific time and may be extended in
accordance with this section. This security must be available prior to
commencing the project.
      (2)   The city may request a greater financial security, if the city
considers that the development site is especially prone to erosion or the
resource to be protected especially valuable.
      (3)   If, at anytime during the course of the work, this amount falls
below 50% of the required deposit, the developer shall make another deposit in
the amount necessary to restore the deposit to the required amount.
      (4)   If the developer does not bring the financial security back up to
the required amount within 7 days after notification by the city that the
amount has fallen below 50% of the required amount, the city may:
         (a)   Withhold the scheduling of inspections and/or the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy; and/or
         (b)   Revoke any permit issued by the city to the applicant for the
site in question and any other of the applicant’s sites within the city’s
jurisdiction.
      (5)   When more than half of the development’s exposed soil area achieves
final stabilization, the city can reduce the total required amount of the
financial security by half, if recommended by the City Engineer.
      (6)   The city may act against the financial security if any of the
conditions listed below exist. The city shall use funds from this security to

         (b)   The developer fails to conform to the grading plan and/or the
stormwater pollution control plan as approved by the city;
         (c)   The techniques utilized under the stormwater pollution control
plan fail within 1 year of installation; or
         (d)   The developer fails to reimburse the city for corrective action
taken hereunder.
      (7)   Any unspent amount of the financial security deposited with the
city for faithful performance of the stormwater pollution control plan and any
stormwater and pollution control plan related remedial work must be released 1
full year after the completion of the installation of all stormwater pollution
control measures as shown on the grading and/or the stormwater pollution
control plan and establishment of final stabilization.
   (H)   Fees. All applications for a stormwater management plan approval must
be accompanied by a processing and approval fee as determined by ordinance of

(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 171.03 APPROVAL STANDARDS.
   (A)   Compliance. No stormwater management plan that fails to meet the
standards in this section shall be approved. At a minimum these pollution
abatement control practices must conform to those in the current version of the
State Pollution Control Agency’s publication, Protecting Water Quality in Urban
Areas.
   (B)   Site dewatering. Water pumped from the site including temporary
sedimentation basins, grit chambers, sand filters, up-flow chambers, hydro
cyclones, swirl concentrators or other appropriate controls as appropriate.
Water may not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion or flooding of the
site or receiving channels of a wetland.
   (C)   Waste and material disposal. All waste and unused building materials,
including garbage, debris, cleaning wastes, wastewater, toxic materials or
hazardous materials, shall be properly disposed of off-site and not allowed to
be carried by runoff into a receiving channel or storm sewer system.
   (D)   Tracking. Graveled roads, access drives, and parking areas must be of
sufficient width and length to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public
or private roadways. Any sediment reaching a public or private road shall be
removed by street cleaning, not flushing, before the end of each workday.
   (E)   Drain inlet protection. All storm drain inlets must be protected
during construction until control measures are in place with a straw bale, silt
fence, or equivalent barrier meeting accepted design criteria, standards and
specifications contained in the MPCA publication, Protecting Water Quality in
Urban Areas.
   (F)   Soil erosion control. The following criteria apply only to
construction activities that result in runoff leaving the site.
      (1)   Channelized runoff from adjacent areas passing through the site
must be diverted around disturbed areas, if practical. Otherwise, the channel
must be protected as follows: sheet-flow runoff from adjacent areas greater
than 10,000 square feet in area shall be diverted around disturbed areas unless
shown to have resultant runoff of less than 1/2-foot per 3 seconds across the
disturbed area for a 1-year storm event. Diverted runoff must be conveyed in a
manner that will not erode the conveyance and receiving channels.
      (2)   All activities on the site must be conducted in a logical sequence
to minimize the area of bare soil at any one time.
      (3)   Runoff from the entire disturbed area on the site must be
controlled by meeting either divisions 1 and 2 or divisions 1 and 3.
         (a)   All disturbed ground left inactive for 14 or more days must be
stabilized by seeding or sodding or by mulching or covering or other equivalent
control measures.
         (b)   For sites with more than ten acres disturbed at one time, or if
a channel originates in the disturbed area, 1 or more temporary or permanent
sedimentation basins must be constructed. Each sedimentation basin must have a
surface area of at least 1% of the area draining to the basin and at least 3
feet of depth and constructed in accordance with accepted design
specifications. Sediment must be removed to maintain a depth of three feet. The
basin discharge rate must also be sufficiently low as to not cause erosion
along the discharge channel or the receiving water.
         (c)   For sites with less than 10 acres disturbed at one time, silt
fences, straw bales or equivalent control measures must be placed along all
side-slope and down-slope sides of the site. If a channel or area of
concentrated runoff passes through the site, silt fences must be placed along
the channel edges to reduce sediment reaching the channel. The use of silt
fences, straw bales or equivalent control measures must include a maintenance
and inspection schedule.
         (d)   Any soil or dirt storage piles containing more than 10 cubic
yards of material should not be located with a down-slope drainage length of
less than 25 feet from the toe of the storage pile to a roadway or drainage
channel. If remaining for more than 7 days, it must be stabilized by mulching,
vegetative cover, tarps or other means. Soil deposit piles that will be in
existence for less than 7 days must be controlled by placing straw bales or
silt barriers around the storage pile. In-street utility repair or construction
soil or dirt storage piles located closer than 25 feet of a roadway or drainage
channel must be covered with tarps or suitable alternative control, if exposed
for more than 7 days the storm drain inlets must be protected with straw bales
or other appropriate filtering barriers.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 171.04 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Stormwater management criteria.
      (1)   An applicant must install or construct, on or for the proposed land
disturbing or development activity, all stormwater management facilities
necessary to manage increased runoff so that the 2-year, 10-year and 100-year
storm peak discharge rates existing before the proposed development are not
increased and accelerated channel erosion will not occur as a result of the
proposed land disturbing or development activity. An applicant may also make an
in-kind or monetary contribution to the development and maintenance of the
community stormwater management facilities designed to serve multiple land
disturbing and development activities undertaken by 1 or more persons,
including the applicant.
      (2)   Escrow account established. Prior to beginning any site work
related to the approval of a subdivision, building permit, or excavation
permit, the applicant shall provide the city with an erosion control deposit
commensurate with the type of activity anticipated. The City Building Official
shall set the fee as set forth in the city fee schedule. The deposit shall be
held by the city in an escrow account established for that particular project.
Thereafter, the applicant shall, on a continuous basis, keep the project site
in compliance with each and every provision of this section. Failure to do so
may result in the city mobilizing whatever efforts it deems necessary to bring
the project into compliance with the city’s erosion control provisions. In such
an event, the city shall calculate the actual cost of the intervention
including labor, the cost of equipment or materials used and a 10%
administrative fee (but not less than $50) and deduct that amount from
aforementioned escrow account. Upon completion of the project and the
establishment of sufficient turf to make erosion control measures unnecessary,
the City Building Official shall notify the City Treasurer who shall return the
balance of the escrow account to the applicant. In the event that the escrow
balance drops below 50% of the escrowed amount, the applicant shall immediately
provide the necessary funds to bring the account back to its original amount.
Failure to do so shall result in the issuance of a stop work order by the city.
      (3)   The applicant must give consideration to reducing the need for
stormwater management facilities by incorporating the use of natural topography
and land cover such as wetlands, ponds, natural swamps, and depressions, as
they exist before development, to the degree that they can accommodate the
additional flow of water without compromising the integrity or quality of the
wetland or pond.
      (4)   The following stormwater management practices must be investigated
in developing a stormwater management plan in the following descending order of
preference:
         (a)   Infiltrations of runoff on-site, if suitable soil conditions are
available for use;
         (b)   Flow attenuation by use of open vegetated swamps and natural
depressions; and
         (c)   Stormwater retention facilities.
      (5)   A combination of successive practices may be used to achieve the
applicable minimum control requirements specified in division (A) above.
Justification shall be provided by the applicant for the method selected.
   (B)   Detention facilities.
      (1)   Stormwater detention facilities constructed in the city must be
designed according to the National Urban Runoff Program (NURP) wet basin design
criteria and the urban best management practices as reflected in the WC
publication, Protecting Water Quality in Urban Areas.
      (2)   The facilities must contain, at a minimum, the following design
factors.
         (a)   A permanent pond surface area equal to 2% of the impervious area
draining to the pond or 1% of the entire area draining to the pond, whichever
amount is greater;
         (b)   An average permanent pool depth of 4 to 10 feet;
(An alternative to divisions (B)(1) and (2) shall be that the volume of
permanent pool be equal to or greater than the runoff from a 2-inch rainfall
for the fully developed site.)
         (c)   A permanent pool length-to-width ratio of 3 to 1 or greater;
         (d)   A minimum protective shelf extending 10 feet into the permanent
pool with a slope of 10 to 1 beyond which slopes should not exceed 3 to 1;
         (e)   At the minimum of a 30-foot wide protective buffer strip of, if
possible, predevelopment vegetation surrounding the permanent pool (all
wetlands). The buffer strip’s width shall be increased at least 4 feet for
every 1% of slope of the surrounding land. The city may choose to extend the
size of the buffer strip to protect sensitive wetlands from degradation.
Editor’s note:
   Where new buffer vegetation is planted “native” vegetation is preferred,
since some non-native plant species cannot compete with native species and
create a mono-culture of decreased environmental value. Useful references are
the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency’s publications Buffer Zone and Soil
Bioengineering.
         (f)   A device to keep oil, grease and other floatable material from
moving downstream as a result of normal operations;
         (g)   Stormwater detention facilities for the new development must be
sufficient to limit peak flows in each sub-watershed to those that existed
before the development for the 10-year storm event; and (Also, calculations and
hydrologic models used in determining peak flows must be submitted along with
the stormwater management plan.)
         (h)   All stormwater detention facilities must have a fore bay to
remove coarse-grained particles prior to discharge into a watercourse or
storage basin.
   (C)   Wetlands.
      (1)   Runoff must not be discharged directly into wetlands without pre-
settlement of the runoff.
      (2)   A protective buffer strip of natural vegetation at least 1 rod
(16.5 feet) in width must surround all wetlands.
      (3)   Wetlands must not be drained or filled, wholly or partially, unless
replaced by wetland areas of at least equal public value. Replacement must be
guided by the following principles in descending order of priority:
         (a)   Avoiding the direct or indirect impact of the activity that may
destroy or diminish the wetland;
         (b)   Minimizing the impact by limiting the degree or magnitude of the
wetland activity and its implementation;
         (c)   Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring
the affected wetland environment;
         (d)   Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and
maintenance operations during the life of the activity; and
         (e)   Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute
wetland resources or environments. Compensation including the replacement ratio
and quality or replacement must be consistent with the requirements outlined in
the rules adopted by the Board of Water and Soil Resources described in the
Wetland Conservation Act of 1991.
   (D)   Steep slopes. No land disturbing or development activities are allowed
on slopes of 18% or more.
   (E)   Catch basins. All newly installed and rehabilitated catch basins must
be provided with a sump area for the collection of coarse-grained material. The
basins must be cleaned when they are half filled with material.
   (F)   Drain leaders.
      (1)   All newly constructed and reconstructed buildings must route drain
leaders to storm sewer facilities or pervious areas wherein the runoff can be
allowed to infiltrate.
      (2)   The flow rate of water from the leaders must be controlled so no
erosion occurs in the pervious areas.
   (G)   Inspections and maintenance. All stormwater management facilities must
be designed to minimize the need of maintenance, to provide access for
maintenance purposes and to be structurally sound. All stormwater management
facilities must have a plan of operation and maintenance that assures continued
effective removal of pollutants carried in stormwater runoff. The City
Engineer, or designated representative, must inspect all stormwater management
facilities during construction, during the first year of operation and at least
once every 5 years thereafter. The inspection records will be kept on file at
the office of the City Engineer for a period of 6 years. It is the
responsibility of the applicant to obtain any easements or property interests
to allow needed access to the stormwater management facilities for inspection
and maintenance purposes.
   (H)   Models; methodologies and computations. Hydrologic models and design
methodologies used for the determination of runoff and analysis of stormwater
management structures must be approved by the City Engineer. Plans,
specifications, and computations for stormwater management facilities submitted
for review must be sealed and signed by a registered professional engineer. All
computations must appear on the plans submitted for review unless otherwise
approved the City Engineer.
   (I)   Watershed management plans; groundwater management plans. Stormwater
management plans must be consistent with adopted watershed management plans and
groundwater management plans prepared in accordance with M.S. §§ 103B.231 and
103B.255, as they may be amended from time to time, respectively and as
approved by the State Board of Water and Soil Resources.
   (J)   Easements. It is the responsibility of the applicant to obtain from
adjacent property owners any necessary easements or other property interests
concerning flowage of water.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 171.05 NOTIFICATIONS; REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   Notification by city. The initial contact will be to a party or
parties listed on the application and/or the stormwater pollution control plan.
Forty-eight hours after notification by the city or 72 hours after the failure
of erosion control measures, whichever is less the city, at its discretion, may
begin corrective work.
   (B)   Erosion off-site. If erosion breaches the perimeter of the site, the
applicant shall immediately develop a cleanup and restoration plan, obtain the
right-of-entry from the adjoining property owner and implement the cleanup and
restoration plan within 48 hours of obtaining the adjoining property owner’s
permission. In no case, unless written approval is received from the city,
shall more than 7 calendar days go by without corrective action being taken. If
in the discretion of the city, the applicant does not repair the damage caused
by the erosion, the city may do the remedial work required and charge the cost
to the applicant.
   (C)   Erosion into streets, wetlands or water bodies. If eroded soils,
including tracked soils from construction activities, enter or appear likely to
enter streets, storm sewers, wetlands or other water bodies, prevention
strategies, cleanup, and repair must be immediate. The applicant shall provide
all traffic control and flagging required to protect the traveling public
during the cleanup operations.
   (D)   Failure to complete corrective work. When an applicant fails to
conform to any provision of this policy within the time stipulated, the city
may take the following actions:
      (1)   Withhold the scheduling of inspections and/or the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy;
      (2)   Revoke any permit issued by the city to the applicant for the site
in question or any other of the applicant’s sites within the city’s
jurisdiction;
      (3)   Direct the correction of the deficiency by city forces or by a
separate contract; (The issuance of a permit constitutes a right-of-entry for
the city or its contractor to enter upon the construction site for the purpose
of correcting deficiencies in erosion control.)
      (4)   All costs incurred by the city in correcting stormwater pollution
control deficiencies must be reimbursed by the applicant; and if payment is not
made within 30 days after costs are incurred by the city, payment will be made
from the applicant’s financial securities, as described herein.
      (5)   If there is an insufficient financial amount in the applicant’s
financial securities, as described herein, to cover the costs incurred by the
city, then the city may assess the remaining amount against the property. As a
condition of the permit, the owner shall waive notice of any assessment hearing
to be conducted by the city, concur that the benefit to the property exceeds
the amount of the proposed assessment and waive all rights by virtue of M.S. §
429.081, as it may be amended from time to time, to challenge the amount or
validity of assessment.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 171.06 ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Violations.
      (1)   The city shall be responsible enforcing this chapter.
      (2)   Any person, firm, or corporation failing to comply with or
violating any of these regulations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.
All land use and building permits must be suspended until the developer has
corrected the violation.
      (3)   Each day that a separate violation exists shall constitute a
separate offense.
   (B)   Right of entry and inspection. The applicant shall allow the city and

§ 194.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for deviations from the literal
provisions of this title in instances where their strict enforcement would
cause undue hardship because of circumstances unique to the individual property
under consideration, and to grant such variances only when it is demonstrated
that such actions will be in keeping with the spirit and intent of this title.

(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 194.03 UNDUE HARDSHIP.
   UNDUE HARDSHIP as used in connection with the granting of a variance means
the property in question cannot be put to a reasonable use if used under
conditions allowed by this title, the plight of the landowner is due to
circumstances unique to the property not created by the landowner, and the
variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality.
Economic considerations alone shall not constitute an UNDUE HARDSHIP if
reasonable use for the property otherwise exists under the terms of the title.
UNDUE HARDSHIP also includes, but is not limited to, inadequate access to
direct sunlight for solar energy systems.

§ 194.05 CRITERIA.
   The Board of Adjustment shall not approve any variance request unless they
find failure to grant the variance will result in undue hardship on the
applicant, and, as may be applicable, all of the following criteria have been
met:
   (A)   Physical characteristics. Because of the particular physical
surroundings, shape, or topographical conditions of the specific parcel of land
involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished
from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were to be
carried out.
   (B)   Unique to parcel. The conditions upon which an application for a
variance is based, are unique to the parcel of land for which the variance is
sought and are not applicable, generally, to other property within the same
zoning classification.
   (C)   Purely financial. The purpose of the variance is not based exclusively
upon a financial hardship, or a desire to increase the value or income
potential of the parcel of land.
   (D)   Self-created. The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by this
title and has not been created by any persons having an interest in the parcel
of land and is not a self-created hardship.
   (E)   Public welfare. The granting of the variance will not be detrimental
to the public welfare or injurious to other land or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the parcel of land is located.
   (F)   Nuisance avoided. The proposed variance will not impair an adequate
supply of light and air to adjacent property, substantially increase the
congestion of the public streets, increase the danger of fire, or endanger the
public safety.
   (G)   Minimum action.  The requested variance is the minimum action required
to eliminate the hardship.
   (H)   Use variance. The requested variance does not involve a use that is
not allowed within the respective zoning district.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 194.06 ENFORCEMENT.

Chapter 200 (Enforcement and Penalties) of this title. The city reserves the
right upon issuing any variances to inspect the premises to ensure compliance
with the provisions of this chapter or any conditions additionally imposed.

grounds for review of the variance by the Board of Adjustment.

   Unless the Board of Adjustment specifically approves a different time when
action is officially taken on the request, approvals which have been issued
under the provisions of this chapter shall expire without further action by the
Planning Commission or the Board, within 1 year of the date of approval unless
the applicant has substantially commenced the authorized use or improvement, or
unless within 30 days prior to the expiration of the variance the applicant has
petitioned for a time extension by completing and submitting a request for an
extension, including the renewal fee as set forth in the city fee schedule.
Such extension request shall be submitted in writing and shall state facts
showing a good faith attempt to complete or utilize the approval permitted in
the variance. A request for an extension not exceeding one year shall be
subject to the review and approval of the Board. Should a second extension of
time or any extension of time longer than one year be requested by the
applicant, it shall be presented to the Planning Commission for a
recommendation and to the Board for a decision.

of the adjoining land or buildings, the effect upon traffic into and from the
premises, or on any adjoining roads, and all other or further factors as the
city shall deem a prerequisite of consideration in determining the effect of
the use on the general welfare, public health, and safety.

201.02   Schedule of fees
   
201.03   Base zoning fee
   
201.04   Cost recovery
§ 201.01 PURPOSE.
   The costs to the city for receiving, analyzing, processing, hearing, and
approving zoning application requests for changes, modifications, or special
consideration under this title, such as requests for map and text amendments,
comprehensive plan amendments, conditional use permits, interim use permits,
variances, administrative permits, site plan reviews, and appeals are
considered to be unique to the applicant requesting such consideration, and it
is the intent of this chapter to provide that all costs of the city incurred by
such requests shall be borne by the applicant. The reimbursement to the city,
in addition to the base fee, shall be limited to actual costs of the city.
Actual costs shall include, but not limited to, all administrative,
engineering, legal, planning or other consultant fees or costs paid by the city
for other consultants for expert review of a development application.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)

§ 201.03 BASE ZONING FEE.
   Each applicant shall pay a non-refundable base fee at the time an
application is presented to the city for a zoning request. This fee is intended
to reimburse the city for its reasonable costs for administrative processing of
a development application. If this fee proves to be insufficient to cover such
costs, such additional cost will be charged to the applicant.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 201.04 COST RECOVERY.
   In the event additional review by the city and its consultants is
anticipated and/or needed during zoning application review and the city incurs
professional fees such as administrative, legal, engineering, planning, or any
other cost, including but not limited to postage and publication expenses, the
applicants shall reimburse the city for those fees. The city may require a cash
escrow, irrevocable letter of credit, or other financial instruments which
provides equivalent assurance to the city and which are approved by the Zoning
Administrator according to §
202.01(C) (Purpose and Procedure) of this title for these costs prior to the
final action on the zoning application review. Such cash escrow, irrevocable
letter of credit, or other financial instruments shall be in the form approved
by the city or its representative according to §
202.01(C) (Purpose and Procedure) of this title. If the applicant fails to
reimburse the city for costs associated with the zoning application review, the
city shall have the authority to use the provisions of the M.S. Chapter 429, as
amended, supplemented, or replaced from time to time, to assess those costs
against any property associated with the zoning application request, and any
such assessment shall, at the time at which taxes are certified to the County
Auditor, be certified for collection in the manner that other special
assessments are so certified.

CHAPTER 202: SITE PERFORMANCE AGREEMENT
Section
   
202.01   Purpose and procedure
§ 202.01 PURPOSE AND PROCEDURE.
   Upon approval of conditional use permits, interim use permits, variances,
administrative permits, planned unit developments, and site plan reviews the
city may require the applicant to enter into a site performance agreement prior
to the issuing of building permits or initiation of work on the proposed
improvements or development. Said agreement shall guarantee conformance and
compliance with the conditions of the approval, the codes of the city, and the
provision of this title. The site performance agreement shall include, without
limitation, the following items and conditions.
   (A)   The applicant shall execute the site improvement performance agreement
on forms provided by the city. The agreement shall be approved as to form and
content by the City Attorney and shall define the required work and reflect the
terms of this chapter and the provisions of this title as to the required
guarantee for the performance of the work by the applicant.
   (B)   The required work can include, but is not limited to, private exterior
amenities such as landscaping, private driveways, parking areas, recreational
fields, structures and buildings, drainage systems, water quality ponds,
wetland mitigation, wetland buffers, erosion control, curbing, fences and
screening, and other similar facilities. The required work shall also include
all aspects of a tree preservation plan and reforestation plan, if applicable.
   (C)   Financial security. The applicant may be required to provide financial
security to assure compliance with the agreement and conditions of the
approval. A financial guarantee shall be submitted with the executed site
performance agreement as provided herein:
      (1)   Financial guarantees acceptable to the city include cash escrow, an
irrevocable letter of credit, or other financial instruments which provide
equivalent assurance to the city and which are approved by the Zoning
Administrator.
      (2)   When any instrument submitted as a financial guarantee contains a
provision for an automatic expiration date, after which the instrument may not
be drawn upon, not withstanding the status of the site performance agreement or
of the required work, the expiration date shall be October 31; further, it
shall be the responsibility of the applicant to notify the city in writing, by
certified mail, at least 60 days in advance of the expiration date of the
intention to renew the instrument or to not renew the instrument. If the
instrument is to be renewed, a written notice of extension shall be provided 30
days prior to the expiration date; if the instrument is not to be renewed, and
has not been released by the Zoning Administrator, another acceptable financial
guarantee in the appropriate amount shall be submitted at least 30 days prior
to the expiration. The term of any extension shall be approved by the Zoning
Administrator. Upon receipt of an acceptable substitute financial guarantee,
the Zoning Administrator may release the original guarantee.
      (3)   The amount of the financial guarantee shall be established by the
Zoning Administrator based upon an itemized estimate of the cost of all
required work as provided by the applicant and reviewed by the Zoning
Administrator. A cash escrow or irrevocable letter of credit shall be in the
amount of 125% of the approved estimated cost. The amount of any other approved
financial instrument shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator.
      (4)   At the option of the city, the applicant may submit a separate
financial guarantee for that portion of the required work consisting solely of
landscaping improvements with another financial guarantee for all other
exterior amenities and improvements which comprise the work. All trees shall be
warranted to be alive, of good quality, and disease-free for 12 months from the
time of planting. Any subsequent replacement shall be warranted for 12 months
from the time of planting.
      (5)   The term of the financial guarantee shall be for the life of the
site improvement performance agreement, and it shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to ensure that a submitted financial guarantee shall continue in
full force and effect until the proposed improvements or development are
completed and the Zoning Administrator or Building Official has issued a
certificate of occupancy indicating compliance with the application approval
and Building Code of the city or a certificate of completion has been issued by
the city. Once a certificate of occupancy or certificate of completion has been
issued and all work has been accepted the financial guarantee shall be released
or reduced as provided in this chapter.
   (D)   The time allowed for completion of the required improvements shall be
set out in the site improvement performance agreement. The agreement and the
financial guarantee shall provide for forfeiture to the city to cure a default
or reimburse the city the cost of enforcement measures. As various portions of
such required work are completed by the applicant, are in compliance with city
requirements, and are approved by the city, the Zoning Administrator may
release such portion of the financial guarantee as is attributable to such
completed work. Landscaping improvements shall not be deemed complete until the
city has verified survivability of all required plantings through one “winter
season” which is defined for the purpose of this section as the period October
31 through April 30.
   (E)   The applicant shall notify the Zoning Administrator in writing when
all or a portion of the required improvements have been completed in accordance
with the approved plan and may be inspected. Upon receipt of such notice, the
Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for the inspection of the
improvements to determine that the useful life of all work performed meets the
standards for the particular industry, profession, or material used in the
performance of the work. Any required work failing to meet such standards shall
not be deemed to be complete and the applicant shall be notified in writing as
to required corrections. Upon determination that the work has been completed,
including the winter season survivability of all landscape improvements, a
certificate of occupancy and/or certificate of completer which includes notice
of the date of actual completion shall be given to the applicant and
appropriate action to release or to reduce the amount of the financial
guarantee shall be taken by the Zoning Administrator.
   (F)   The applicant shall agree in writing to pay any and all reasonable
attorney’s fees, consultant fees, and related costs incurred by the city to
enforce the terms and conditions of any application approval or provisions of
any performance agreement relating to said permits. The performance agreement
shall also include additional standard conditions as approved from time to time
by the City Council, as well as specific conditions related to the approval.
This chapter is not a limitation on reasonable conditions to be included in any
specific performance agreement.
   (G)   The applicant shall agree to indemnify and hold harmless the city, its
agents, employees, representatives, and consultants against any and all claims,
demands, losses, damages, and expenses (including attorney’s fees) arising out
of, related to or resulting from the applicant’s negligent or intentional acts,
or any violation of any safety law, regulation, or code in the implementation
of the performance agreement, without regard to any inspection or review made
or not made by the city, its agents, employees, representatives, or consultants
or failure to take any other prudent precaution.

have been signed and prepared within the last 10 years from the date of
submittal, unless the property pins are not found and established, in which
case a new certificate of survey shall be required. Furthermore, after property
pin location is established, the project must be staked out prior to the
issuance of a building permit, unless specifically waived by the city.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 203.03 EXPIRATION AND EXTENSION OF BUILDING PERMIT.
   Expiration of permits shall be in accordance with the Building Code unless

CHAPTER 204: NONCONFORMING LOTS, STRUCTURES, AND USES
Section
   
204.01   Purpose
   
204.02   Nonconforming lots
   
204.03   Nonconforming uses or structures
   
204.04   Structural changes
   
204.05   Maintenance
   
204.06   Restoration and alterations required by law for the benefit of health,
safety, and welfare
§ 204.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to provide for the regulation of
nonconforming lots, structures, and uses and to specify those requirements,
circumstances, and conditions under which nonconforming lots, structures, and
uses will be operated and maintained. This title establishes separate
districts, each of which is an appropriate area for the location of uses which
are permitted in that district. It is necessary and consistent with the
establishment of these districts that nonconforming buildings, structures, and
uses not be permitted to continue without restriction. Furthermore, it is the
intent of this chapter that all nonconforming lots, structures, and uses shall
be eventually brought into conformity.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 204.02 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   (A)   No lot of record shall be reduced in size below the district
requirements of this title.
   (B)   A lot of record shall be deemed buildable even though the lot area
and/or dimensions are less than those required for the district provided the
following conditions are met:
      (1)   Evidence is provided that the lot in question met minimum
requirements for the division of property under ordinance regulations in effect
at the time the property was divided.
      (2)   It has frontage on a public street.
      (3)   The lot is at least 60% of the minimum lot area and lot width
required as specified in the applicable district and other provisions of this
title are complied with.

limitations and such further regulations as the City Council may require for
securing the purposes of this title.
   (A)   A nonconforming use of land or structure shall not be enlarged or
increased in size or land area, nor shall such nonconforming use be moved to
any part of the parcel of land upon which the same was not conducted prior to
the adoption of this title.
   (B)   A nonconforming use shall not be changed unless the changed to a
conforming or more conforming use. Such use shall not thereafter be changed to
a nonconforming use.
   (C)   If any existing nonconforming use of building or land is discontinued
for a period of one year it cannot be resumed.
   (D)   If a structure occupied by a legal nonconforming use or a legal
nonconforming structure is destroyed by fire or other peril to the extent that
repair or replacement costs exceeds 50% of the assessors estimated market value
of the structure and no building permit has been applied for within 180 days of
when the structure is damaged, the structure shall not be replaced or repaired
except in conformity with this title. In the event of a building permit to
replace or repair such a building is applied for within 180 days of when the
structure is damaged, the city may impose reasonable conditions on a building
permit issued thereto to mitigate any newly created impact on adjacent
property.
   (E)   Alterations may be made to a residential building containing
nonconforming residential unit when alterations will improve the livability of
the unit provided the number of dwelling unit in the building is not increased.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 204.04 STRUCTURAL CHANGES.
   No existing structure devoted to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged,
extended, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the
use of the structure to a conforming use.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 204.05 MAINTENANCE.
   Maintenance of a building or other structure containing or used for a
nonconforming use will be permitted when it includes necessary non-structural
repairs and incidental alterations which do not extend or intensify the
nonconforming building or use.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 204.06 RESTORATION AND ALTERATIONS REQUIRED BY LAW FOR THE BENEFIT OF HEALTH,
SAFETY, AND WELFARE.
   (A)   Nothing in this title shall prevent the strengthening, restoration, or
alteration of a structure or building maintained for a nonconforming use when
such action is required by:
      (1)   Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) or it amendments;
      (2)   Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) or it amendments; or
      (3)   Any other state or federal law which requires changes based on
health, safety, or welfare.
   (B)   This title shall not prevent such strengthening, restoration, or
alterations even if the building is enlarged so long as the purpose of the
restoration, strengthening, or alteration is required by ADA, OSHA, or other
state or federal law dealing with health, safety, and welfare. Proof of such
requirement shall be provided by the applicant.

land disturbing activity or create new impervious surface without first
obtaining a permit from the city that incorporates and approves a storm water
pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) for the activity, development or
redevelopment. For sites disturbing less than one acre, an erosion and sediment
control plan may be submitted as part of the building permit application.
   (B)   Development not permitted. No land shall be developed and no use shall
be permitted that will result in water runoff causing flooding, erosion, or
deposit of sediment on adjacent properties. Such runoff shall be properly
channeled into a storm drain, watercourse, ponding area, or other public
facilities subject to the review and approval of the City Engineer.
   (C)   Standards. Erosion and sediment controls shall meet the standards for
the general permit authorization to discharge stormwater associated with
construction activity under the national pollutant discharge elimination
system/state disposal system permit program permit MN R100001 (NPDES general

for individual building permits. Erosion and sediment control measures shall be
consistent with best management practices (BMP’s) for erosion and sedimentation
control as specified in the “Minnesota Stormwater Manual” (MPCA, 2005), as
amended, and shall be sufficient to retain sediment on-site. Erosion control
measures may also be specified by the City Engineer as needed and deemed
appropriate during the construction and post-construction periods separate from
the above.
   (F)   Sediment control practices. All temporary erosion and sediment
controls shall be installed on all down gradient perimeters before commencing
the land disturbing activity, and left in place and maintained as needed until
removed per city approval after the site had been stabilized. Property and
streets adjacent to the site of a land disturbance shall be protected from
sediment deposition. All permanent erosion control measures shall be installed,
maintained, repaired if needed and operational per the design and as required
by the city to assure the continued performance of their intended function.
   (G)   Storm sewer inlets. All storm sewer inlets which are functioning
during construction shall be protected so that sediment laden water does not
enter the conveyance system without first being filtered or otherwise treated
to remove sediment.
   (H)   Stormwater channels. All on-site stormwater conveyance channels shall
be designed and constructed to withstand the expected velocity of flow from a
10-year frequency storm without erosion. Erosion controls must be provided at
the outlets of all storm sewer pipes.

temporary sedimentation basins, grit chambers, sand filters, upflow chambers,
hydrocyclones, swirl concentrators, or other appropriate controls as
appropriate. Water may not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion or
flooding of the site or receiving channels of a wetland. All dewatering shall
be in accordance with all applicable county, state, and federal rules and
regulations. Minnesota Department of Natural Resources regulations regarding
appropriate permits shall also be strictly adhered to.
   (J)   Sites more than 1 acre not graded. If the activity creates more than 1
acre of disturbed area, and the activity is taking place on a site where soils
are currently disturbed (e.g., a tilled agricultural site that is being
developed), areas that will not be graded as part of the development and areas
that will not be stabilized according to the time frames specified in the NPDES
general construction permit part IV.B.S, shall be seeded with a temporary or
permanent cover before commencing the proposed land disturbing activity.
   (K)   Seeding. All disturbed ground left inactive for 7 or more days shall
be stabilized by seeding or sodding or by mulching or covering or other
equivalent control measure.
   (L)   Removal. All temporary erosion and sediment control devices including
silt fence, gravel, hay bales, or other measures shall be removed from the
construction site and properly disposed of or recycled. This removal and
disposal must occur within 30 days of the establishment of permanent vegetative
cover or final site stabilization is achieved on the disturbed area.
   (M)   Waste and material disposal. All waste and unused building materials
(including garbage, debris, cleaning wastes, wastewater, toxic materials, or
hazardous materials) shall be properly disposed of off-site and not allowed to
be carried by runoff into a receiving channel or storm sewer system.
   (N)   Tracking. Each site shall have rock construction entrance, access
drives, and parking areas of sufficient width and length to prevent sediment
from being tracked onto public or private roadways. Any sediment reaching a
public or private road shall be removed by street cleaning (not flushing)
before the end of each workday or more often if necessary to maintain the road
in safe driving condition.
   (O)   Foundation, garage floor. Unless approved by the City Engineer, the
top of the foundation and garage floor of all structures shall be at least 18
inches above the grade of the crown of the street.

neighborhood and that a home occupation remains accessory and subordinate to
the principal residential use of the dwelling. The regulations recognize that
many types of home occupations can be conducted with little or no effect on the
surrounding neighborhood. In addition, this chapter is intended to provide a
mechanism enabling the distinction between Type I home occupations and Type II
home occupations, so that Type I home occupations are allowed with the issuance
of an administrative permit and Type II home occupations are allowed through a
public hearing permitting process.

199.05 (Information Requirement) of this title.
   (B)   Type II home occupation. Any Type II home occupation, as described in
this chapter, shall be required to obtain a home occupation permit from the

§ 207.01 FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND EFFECT.
   (A)   Findings. The city finds:
      (1)   Exterior signs have a substantial impact on the character and
quality of the environment.
      (2)   Signs provide an important medium through which individuals may
convey a variety of messages.
      (3)   Signs can create traffic hazards and aesthetic concerns, thereby
threatening the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (4)   The city’s zoning regulations include the regulation of signs in an
effort to provide adequate means of expression and to promote the economic
viability of the business community, while protecting the city and its citizens
from a proliferation of signs of a type, size, location, and character that
would adversely impact upon the aesthetics of the community and threaten the
health, safety, and welfare of the community. The regulation of the physical
characteristics of signs within the city has had a positive impact on traffic
safety and the appearance of the community.
   (B)   Purpose and intent. It is not the purpose or intent of this chapter to
regulate the message displayed on any sign; nor is it the purpose or intent of
this chapter to regulate any building design or any display not defined as a
sign, or any sign which cannot be viewed from outside a building. The purpose
and intent of this chapter is to:
      (1)   Regulate the number, location, size, type, illumination, and other
physical characteristics of signs within the city in order to promote the
public health, safety, and welfare.
      (2)   Maintain, enhance, and improve the aesthetic environment of the
city by preventing visual clutter that is harmful to the appearance of the
community.
      (3)   Improve the visual appearance of the city while providing for
effective means of communication, consistent with constitutional guarantees and
the city’s goals of public safety and aesthetics.
      (4)   Provide for fair and consistent enforcement of the sign regulations
set forth herein under the zoning authority of the city.
   (C)   Effect. A sign may be erected, mounted, displayed, or maintained in
the city if it is in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. The
effect of this chapter, as more specifically set forth herein, is to:
      (1)   Allow a wide variety of sign types in commercial zones, and a more
limited variety of signs in other zones, subject to the standards set forth in
this sign ordinance.
      (2)   Allow certain small, unobtrusive signs incidental to the principal
use of a site in all zones when in compliance with the requirements of this
sign ordinance.
      (3)   Prohibit signs whose location, size, type, illumination, or other
physical characteristics negatively affect the environment and where the
communication can be accomplished by means having a lesser impact on the
environment and the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (4)   Provide for the administration and enforcement of the provisions of
this chapter.

§ 210.01 PURPOSE.
   The regulation of off-street parking spaces in this title is to alleviate or
prevent congestion of the public right-of-ways and to promote the safety and
general welfare of the public, by establishing minimum requirements for off-

utilization of various parcels of land or structures.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 210.02 APPLICATION OF OFF-STREET PARKING REGULATIONS.
   (A)   The off-street regulations and requirements set forth herein shall
apply to all off-street parking facilities in all of the zoning districts of
the city.
   (B)   Calculating space. When in the process of determining the number of
off-street parking spaces required, there occurs a fraction of a space, such
fraction shall constitute as a requirement for another whole space. The parking
requirements for a use not specified or not precisely identified herein shall
be the same as required for a use of similar nature as determined by the City
Council based upon, but not limited to, characteristics for similar uses and
professional studies.
   (C)   In churches, stadiums, sports arenas, and other places of public
assembly in which patrons or spectators occupy benches, pews, or other similar
seating facilities, each 18 inches of such design capacity seating facilities
shall be counted as one seat for the purpose of determining requirements.
   (D)   Except as provided for under joint parking and for shopping centers,
should a structure contain 2 or more types of use, each use shall be calculated
separately for determining the total off-street parking spaces required.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 210.03 SITE PLAN DRAWING.
   The applicant shall provide off-street parking spaces as required within
this chapter on all applications for building permits in all zoning districts
including single-family and two-family dwellings. The applicant shall include
and submit a parking plan with the site plan drawing in accordance with
Chapter 199 (Site Plan Review) of this title. Such site plan shall be approved
by the city prior to the issuance of any building or zoning permit and before
construction is started. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until all
items regarding parking facilities shown on the site plan have been completed.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 210.04 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Floor area. The term “floor area”, for the purpose of calculating the
number of off-street parking spaces required, shall be determined on the basis
of the exterior floor area dimensions of the buildings, structure or use times
the number of floors, minus 10%, except as may hereinafter be provided or
modified.
   (B)   Added floor area. Whenever a use requiring off-street parking is
increased in floor area, and such use is located in a building existing on or
before the effective date of this title, June 7, 2011, additional parking
spaces for the additional floor area shall be provided and maintained in
amounts hereafter specified for that use.
   (C)   Reduction of existing off-street parking space or lot area. Off-street

exceeds the requirements set forth herein for a similar new use.
   (D)   Loading space and drive aisles. Loading space and drive aisles shall
not be construed as supplying off-street parking space.
   (E)   Change of use or occupancy of land. No change of use or occupancy of
land already dedicated to a parking area, parking spaces, or loading spaces
shall be made, nor shall any sale of land, division, or subdivision of land be
made which reduces area necessary for parking, parking stalls, or parking
requirements below the minimum prescribed by this title.
   (F)   Change of use or occupancy of buildings.
      (1)   Any change of use or occupancy of any building or buildings
including additions thereto requiring more parking area shall not be permitted
until there is furnished such additional parking spaces as required by this
title.
      (2)   If the existing number of parking spaces provided for a shopping
center does not conform to the required number of parking spaces, when a tenant
vacates the shopping center, the parking required by a new
tenant occupying the vacated space may not exceed the parking required of the
tenant being replaced. Required spaces of the existing and new tenant shall be
determined in accordance with this title without reference to the fact that the
use is in a shopping center.
   (G)   Disability accessible parking. Disability accessible parking spaces
shall be provided as applicable pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, as may be
amended.
   (H)   Restrictions on parking.
      (1)   Required accessory off-street parking spaces in any district shall

inoperable vehicles, and/or storage of snow. All site plans required by this
title shall illustrate the size and location of snow storage space on the
property in question.
      (2)   Except as may be otherwise allowed by this title, on and off-street
parking facilities accessory to a residential use shall be utilized solely for

title, may be approved by the Zoning Administrator as an administrative permit
according to

to residential structures be used for the storage of commercial vehicles or
equipment or for the parking of automobiles belonging to the employees, owners,
tenants, or customers of business or manufacturing establishments.
      (4)   Except where specifically allowed, contracting, excavating
equipment, or other commercial vehicles and equipment may not be parked or
stored on any property in the city unless it is being used in conjunction with
a temporary service benefiting the premises.
      (5)   Off-street parking facilities for dwellings shall be provided and
located on the same lot or parcel of land as the building they are intended to
serve.
      (6)   Unless alternative provisions in compliance with this chapter and
title are made, no building permit shall be issued and no person shall alter
said parking structure to be used as a dwelling unit or other activity such as
the storage of goods and materials.
   (I)   Repair work. No motor vehicle repair work of any kind shall be
permitted in conjunction with exposed off-street parking facilities, except for
temporary (not exceeding 8 hours) minor repairs of vehicles owned by the

   (G)   Any use which depends upon off-site parking to meet the requirements
of this title shall maintain ownership and parking utilization of the off-site
location until such time as on-site parking is provided or a site in closer
proximity to the principal use is acquired and developed for parking.
   (H)   Compliance with off-street parking requirements provided through
leased off-street parking may be approved by the City Council, subject to the
following additional conditions:

satisfaction of the number of spaces required pursuant to §
210.08 (Number of Spaces Required) of this title.
   (B)   Development and uses. Within the B-1 Downtown Business District, the
city may approve development and uses which do not comply with the required

which it is agreed that the property in question is financially responsible for
its proportionate share of the city sponsored and provided parking space
construction, maintenance, and parking site acquisition for new on-street and
lot parking. Said responsibility shall be determined on the basis of the
property’s parking space shortage based upon ordinance requirements, in
relationship to the total parking space shortage, as defined by §
210.08 (Number of Spaces Required) of this title for a defined service and
benefit area. The “service and benefit area” shall include all properties which
benefit from the available public parking serving a particular retail and
commercial neighborhood or district.

maximum amount possible, taking into account the use and design objectives of
the B-1 Downtown Business District, as outlined by this title and the
comprehensive plan.
      (3)   The parking shortages created by the development are not premature
or in excess of the supply which can be provided by the city through a public
parking system on a long term basis.
   (C)   Exception. Except as provided for by §
210.11(B) (B-1 Downtown Business District Parking) of this title, no deferment
of required parking may be granted for parcels within the B-1 Downtown Business
District.

§ 213.02 FENCES AND RETAINING WALLS.
   Fences shall be permitted in all yards subject to the following:
   (A)   Permit required. No person, except on a farm and related to
agricultural uses, shall hereafter construct or cause to be constructed or
erected within the city, any fence or retaining wall without first making an
application for and securing a permit with the Zoning Administrator.
   (B)   Locations; boundary line fences.
      (1)   Fences, including footings, shall be located entirely upon the
private property for which the building permit has been issued and no fence
shall be placed on or extend into public rights-of-way or onto public property.
      (2)   Such a fence of any material shall be located no closer than 3 feet
from any side or rear lot line on the property of the person constructing or
causing the construction of the fence.
      (3)   An exception to the above restriction involving an encroachment up
to the side or rear property line shall be allowed by administrative permit
provided that a fence agreement addressing construction, maintenance, and
repair responsibilities, as well as trespass rights, is established between the
adjoining property owners and said agreement is filed with the County Recorder
against the titles of the respective properties.
      (4)   The owner of the property on which a fence exists or is proposed to
be constructed is responsible for verifying their property lines according to §
203.02 (Certificate of Survey Required) of this title.
      (5)   Fences in easements shall not impede the flow of water. If the city
needs to utilize the easement, the fence will be removed and relocated at the
expense of the property owner.
   (C)   Construction and maintenance.
      (1)   Every fence shall be constructed in a substantial, workmanlike
manner and of substantial material reasonably suited for the purpose for which
the fence is proposed to be used. Every fence shall be maintained in a
condition of reasonable repair and shall not be allowed to become and remain in
a condition of disrepair or danger, or constitute a nuisance, public or
private. Any such fence which is, or has become dangerous to the public safety,
health or welfare, is a public nuisance, and the Zoning Administrator shall
commence proper proceedings for the abatement thereof.
      (2)   Except as otherwise permitted, security fences, wherever allowed
shall be constructed in such a manner, that no barbed ends shall be at the top.
      (3)   Electric fences shall only be permitted in the A-1 District when
related to agriculture, and on farms in other districts when related to
agricultural purposes, but not as boundary fences.

Telecommunications Act of 1996 (“the Act”) governs the construction, placement,
and modification of personal wireless service facilities.
   (B)   Consistent with the Act, the general purpose of this chapter is to
manage the placement, construction, and modification of towers, antennas, and
related facilities in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the
public, while not unreasonably interfering with the development of the
competitive wireless telecommunications marketplace in the city.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 214.02 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   In furtherance of the goals of the city and within the framework of
the Act and state law, the city will give due consideration to the City’s
Comprehensive Plan, zoning districts, existing land uses, and environmentally
sensitive areas in approving sites for the location of towers, antennas, and
related facilities. Specifically, the purposes of this section are:
      (1)   To provide for wireless telecommunication services for the
residents and businesses of the city.
      (2)   To minimize adverse visual impacts of towers, antennas, and
facilities through design, siting, landscaping, and innovative camouflaging
techniques.
      (3)   To promote and encourage shared use and collocation of towers and
antenna support structures so as to reduce the number of towers needed to serve
the area.
      (4)   To avoid damage to adjacent properties caused by telecommunication
towers, antennas and facilities by ensuring that those structures are soundly
and carefully designed, constructed, modified, maintained, and promptly removed
when no longer used or when determined to be structurally unsound.

§ 215.03 SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS (SES).
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The city finds that other communities are being
requested to address the use and development of renewable energy systems,
believing them to enhance energy conservation efforts with limited adverse
impact on nearby properties. The city finds that it may be in the public
interest to encourage the use and development of such renewable energy systems;
to support the use of solar energy collection systems and the development of
solar energy farms; and that the development of solar energy farms could be
balanced with the protection of the public health, safety and welfare. While it
wishes time to study the issue, it also wishes to have a process in place to
address the issue while it is being studied. Accordingly, the city resolves
that the following standards shall be temporarily adopted to address
applications for solar energy systems and solar energy farms to be constructed
within the city while the city undertakes to study the issue.
   (B)   Severability. The provisions of this section shall be severable and
the invalidity of any division or subdivision thereof shall not make void any
other division subdivision of this section.
   (C)   Applicability. These regulations shall apply to all solar energy
systems and solar energy farms on properties and structures under the
jurisdiction of city zoning. Those systems shall be defined as solar farms
generating less than 50 megawatts of power. The city shall refer any
application for a large electric power generating plant (LEPGP) to the
Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MN PUC) for approval.
   (D)   Types of SES.

allowed height in any zoning district and shall not extend beyond the perimeter
of the roof line of the building on which it is mounted. For purposes of height
measurement, roof or building mounted SES other than building-integrated
systems shall be considered to be mechanical devices and are restricted
consistent with other building mounted mechanical devices for the zoning
district in which the system is being installed.
         (e)   Roof mounted SES shall be placed on the roof to limit visibility
from the public right-of-way or to blend into the roof design, provided that
minimizing visibility still allows the property owner to reasonably capture
solar energy.

§ 217.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is:
   (A)   To encourage a more creative and efficient development of land and its
improvements through the preservation of natural features and amenities than is
possible under the more restrictive application of zoning requirements. This
section may allow modifications such as non-standard lot sizes, private streets
and driveways, reduced rights-of-way and street widths, housing types, zero lot
lines, and building setbacks. These changes shall meet the standards and
purposes of the Comprehensive Plan while preserving the health, safety, and
welfare of the citizens of the city:
   (B)   To allow for the potential mixture of uses in an integrated and well
planned area;
   (C)   To ensure concentration of open space into more usable areas, and a
preservation of the natural resources of the site;
   (D)   To facilitate the economical provision of streets and public
utilities; and
   (E)   To facilitate mixed use developments, and/or affordable housing,
recreational uses, and institutional uses.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 217.02 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   A planned unit development shall require approval of a conditional use
permit according to
Chapter 196 (Conditional Use Permits) of this title. The planned unit
development conditional use permit shall apply to all specified zoning
districts. The city may approve the planned unit development only if it finds
that the development satisfies all of the following standards:
   (A)   Ownership. An application for a planned unit development, which is
developed as a tract under single or unified ownership or control and which
generally includes 2 or more principal buildings or uses but which may consist
of 1 building containing a combination of principal and supportive uses, must
be filed by the landowner or jointly by all landowners of the property included
in the planned unit development. In the case of unified ownership or control,
the approval of the planned unit development shall be binding on all owners.
The financial commitments incurred through any portion of the planned unit
development shall be the responsibility of all owners.
   (B)   Permitted uses. All permitted, permitted accessory, or conditional
uses contained in the underlying zoning district shall be treated as permitted,
permitted accessory, and conditional uses within planned unit development.
Mixed use planned unit developments are permitted provided they meet the intent
and purpose for which a planned unit development is permitted. Uses not
otherwise allowed in the zoning district are prohibited within a planned
development unless specific provisions are made and listed in the development
plan or modified in the conditions of approval.
   (C)   The planned unit development is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan
of the city.
   (D)   The planned unit development is an effective and unified treatment of
the development possibilities on the project site and the development plan
provides for the preservation or creation of unique amenities such as natural
streams, stream banks, wooded cover, rough terrain, manmade landforms or
landscaping, and similar areas.
   (E)   The planned unit development can be planned and developed to harmonize
with any existing or proposed development in the areas surrounding the project
site.
   (F)   The tract is at least 5 acres in size unless the applicant can show
that a planned unit development of less acreage meets the standards and
purposes of the comprehensive plan and preserves the health, safety, and
welfare of the citizens of the city and that all of the following conditions
exist:
      (1)   The proposal better adapts itself to the physical and aesthetic
setting of the site and with the surrounding land uses than could be developed
using strict standards and land uses allowed within the underlying zoning
district;
      (2)   The proposal would benefit the area surrounding the project to
greater degree than development allowed within the underlying zoning district
(s);
      (3)   The proposal would provide mixed land use and/or site design
flexibilities while enhancing site or building aesthetics to achieve an
overall, workable higher quality of development than would otherwise occur in
the underlying zoning district; and
      (4)   The proposal would ensure the concentration of open space into more
workable or usable areas and would preserve the natural resources of the site
than would otherwise occur in the underlying zoning district.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 217.03 EFFECT ON EXISTING ZONING; INTERPRETATION.
   The granting of a planned unit development permit does not alter in any
manner the existing zoning district classification except that building permits
shall not be issued, which are not in conformity pursuant to an approved
planned unit development permit unless it is amended, cancelled, or modified.
Whenever a question arises concerning the interpretation of this chapter, it
shall be the duty of the Planning Commission to ascertain all facts concerning
the question and forward all data and a recommendation to the City Council for
a determination.

   (C)   Supporting community facilities.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 217.05 DENSITY.
   In any planned unit development the maximum number of dwelling units allowed
shall not exceed those of the land use districts in the comprehensive plan.
   (A)   Density increases consistent with the comprehensive plan may be
allowed if it can be demonstrated to meet objectives of affordable housing or
increased open space identified in the comprehensive plan.
   (B)   Optional waiver of maximum residential density requirements. To assist
in providing low and moderately priced housing or to provide increased land for
open space corridors, park trails, or natural resource preservation, certain
zoning and subdivision ordinance standards may be modified when a planned unit
development is submitted for approval. Land upon which the applicant agrees to
build increased residential densities, consistent with the comprehensive plan
and/or retain as increased open space, consistent with the comprehensive plan
may also be subject to optional zoning provisions.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)

approved preliminary plat. This plan shall include any recommended changes by
the Planning Commission and the City Council to the original general

§ 217.10 ENFORCEMENT OF DEVELOPMENT SCHEDULE.
   The construction and provisions of all of the common open spaces and public
and recreational facilities which are shown on the final development plan must
proceed at the same phase of the construction of dwelling units. From time to
time the Zoning Administrator may review all of the building permits issued for
the planned development and examine the construction which has taken place on
the site. If he or she shall find that the rate of construction of dwelling
units is greater than the rate at which common open spaces and public and
recreational facilities have been constructed and provided, he or she shall
forward this information to the City Council, which may modify or revoke the
planned unit development permit.

§ 217.11 CONVEYANCE AND MAINTENANCE OF COMMON OPEN SPACE.
   (A)   All land shown on the final development plan as common open space must
be conveyed to homeowners association or similar organization provided in an
indenture establishing an association or similar organization for the
maintenance of the planned unit development. The common open space must be
conveyed to the homeowners association or similar organization subject to
covenants to be approved by the City Attorney which restrict the common open
space to the uses specified on the final development plan, and which provide
for the maintenance of the common open space in a manner which assures its
continuing use for its intended purpose.
   (B)   If a homeowners association is created, the applicant shall submit any
required homeowner association documents at the time of the first final plat of
development to the City Attorney and city staff which explain:
      (1)   Ownership and membership requirements.
      (2)   Articles of incorporation and bylaws.
      (3)   Time at which the developer turns the association over to the
homeowners.
      (4)   Approximate monthly or yearly association fees for homeowners.

roads, recreation facilities, parking, common open space grounds, and
utilities.

§ 217.12 STANDARDS FOR COMMON OR OPEN SPACE.
   No open area may be approved as common open space under the provisions of
this chapter unless it meets the following standards:
   (A)   The location, shape, size, and character of the common open space must
be suitable for the planned unit development;
   (B)   Common open space must be used for amenity or recreational purposes.
The uses authorized for the common open space must be appropriate to the scale
and character of the planned unit development, considering its size, density,
expected population, topography, and the number and type of dwellings to be
provided. Whenever possible, common open space shall be linked to the open
space areas or parks of adjoining developments;
   (C)   Common open space must be suitably improved for its intended use but
common space containing natural features worthy of preservation may be left
unimproved. The buildings, structures, and improvements which are permitted in
the common open space must be appropriate to the uses which are authorized for
the common open space and must conserve and enhance the amenities of the common
open space having regard to its topography and unimproved condition; and
   (D)   Outlots to be dedicated to the city for park, ponding, or other
purposes shall be deeded to the city before the final plat is released for
recording.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 217.13 SITE IMPROVEMENT PERFORMANCE AGREEMENT AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEE.
   Prior to City Council consideration of a planned unit development, the
applicant, as may be applicable, shall guarantee to the city the completion of
all improvements as shown on the final development plan. The guarantee shall be
made by means of a site improvement performance agreement and a financial
guarantee as specified in
Chapter 202 (Site Performance Agreement) of this title.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 217.14 REVIEW AND AMENDMENTS.
   (A)   From time to time the Zoning Administrator may review planned unit
developments within the city and may make a report to the City Council on the
status of noncompliance for a particular planned unit development. If the
Zoning Administrator finds that the development has not commenced within 1 year
after the original approval of the conditional use for the planned unit
development, the Zoning Administrator may recommend that the City Council
extend the time or revoke the conditional use permit as set forth in §
196.06 (Revocation) of this title. Prior to cancellation or revocation of this
permit, the City Council shall hold a public hearing at which time all
interested parties will be given an opportunity to be heard.
   (B)   For additional phases of the planned unit development, if within 5
years the project has not progressed, the Zoning Administrator may recommend
that the City Council determine what action will be taken with the remainder of
the project. Prior to determining the outcome of the planned unit development,
the City Council shall hold a public hearing at which time all interested
parties will be given an opportunity to be heard.
   (C)   Minor changes in the location, placement, and heights of the buildings
or structures may be authorized by the Zoning Administrator if required by
engineering or other circumstances not foreseen at the time the final
development plan was approved.
   (D)   Approval of the Planning Commission and City Council shall be required
for other changes such as rearrangement of lots, blocks, and building tracts.
These changes shall be consistent with the purpose and intent of the approved
final development plan.
   (E)   Any amendment to the planned unit development shall require the same
procedures as for the application for a conditional use permit as set forth
Chapter 196 (Conditional Use Permits) of this title.

§ 218.03 ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Zoning district boundary lines established by this title generally follow
lot lines, the centerlines of railroad rights-of-way, street rights-of-way,
watercourses, or the corporate limit lines, all as they exist upon effective
date of this title, June 7, 2011.
   (A)   Appeals concerning the exact location of a zoning district boundary
line shall be heard by the City Council serving as the Board of Adjustment and
Appeals pursuant to
Chapter 195 (Appeals) of this title.
   (B)   Whenever any street, alley, or other public way is vacated by official
action of the city, the zoning district adjoining each side of such street,
alley, or public way shall be automatically extended to the center of such
vacation, and all area included in the vacation shall then and henceforth be
subject to all appropriate regulations of the extended districts.
   (C)   All streets, alleys, public ways, and railroad rights-of-way, if not
otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be in the same zone as
the property in the most restrictive classification immediately abutting upon
such alleys, streets, public ways, or railroad rights-of-way. Where the
centerline of a street, alley, public way, or railroad right-of-way serves as a
district boundary, the zoning of such areas, unless otherwise specifically
designated, shall be deemed to be the same as that of the abutting property up
to such centerline.
   (D)   All areas within the corporate limits of the city which are underwater
and which are not shown as included within any zone shall be subject to all
regulations of the zone which immediately adjoins such water area. If such

construed to be extended into the water area in a straight line until they meet
the other district at the halfway point and/or to the corporate limits.
District boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to
follow such shorelines, and in the event of change in shoreline shall be
construed as moving with the actual shoreline. District boundaries indicated as
approximately following the centerlines of streams, rivers, lakes, or other
bodies of water shall be construed to follow such centerlines.

§ 225.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the B-1 Downtown Business District is to encourage a viable
downtown area which is intended to serve the entire city and be a diversified
commercial center that offers the full range of comparison goods, sales and
services, cultural, civic, and entertainment opportunities, financial and
professional offices, and public uses. Although this district relies on
automobile traffic, the needs of pedestrians and bicyclists are deemed equally
important. Pedestrian and bicycle linkages, landscaping, and appropriate
amenities are important components of this district. The pedestrian orientation
of buildings adjacent to sidewalks encourages parking in the rear yards and
enhances the traditional character exemplified by historical central business
districts. Zoning standards are intended to promote compatibility in form,
function, and style.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)

§ 229.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the SL Shoreland Management Overlay District is to manage the
effect of shoreland and water surface crowding, to prevent pollution of surface
and ground waters of the city, to provide ample space on lots for sewage
treatment systems, to minimize flood damages, to maintain property values, and
to maintain natural characteristics of shorelands and adjacent water areas via
shoreland controls which regulate lot sizes, placement of structures, and
alterations of shoreland areas.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 229.02 AREA GOVERNED.
   (A)   All lands lying within 1,000 feet of a lake and 300 feet of a river or
stream shall be subject to and governed by these regulations. If the
subdivision of any lands, whether by plat or otherwise, create separate
individual lots which extend landward for a distance greater than the described
boundaries of the lakeshore district, the lakeshore regulations shall apply to
all such lots in their entirety.
   (B)   Given the present boundaries of the city, all land within the city is
included in the Lakeshore Management District.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 229.03 EXISTING LAKE CLASSIFICATIONS.
   (A)   The present city limits of the city are bounded by or include parts of
the following lakes, all presently classified as general development lakes:
      (1)   Pioneer Lake.
      (2)   North Center Lake.
      (3)   South Center Lake.
   (B)   The existing city does not contain nor abut any other lakes, rivers,
or streams, nor are there any other such lakes, rivers, or streams within 1
mile of the unincorporated area surrounding the city boundaries. In the event,
whether by annexation or otherwise, the city is enlarged to include any other
lakes, rivers, or streams, this chapter shall then be amended to accommodate
and regulate them in accordance with such guidelines as are then in effect.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 229.04 POLICIES UNDERLYING LAKESHORE REGULATIONS.
   (A)   The management of areas unsuitable for development due to wet soils,
steep slopes, flooding, inadequate drainage, severe erosion potential, presence
of significant historic sites or any other feature likely to be harmful to the
health, safety, or welfare of the residents of the community.
   (B)   The reservation of areas suitable for residential development from
encroachment by commercial and industrial uses.
   (C)   The centralization of service facilities for residential areas and
enhancement of economic growth for those areas suitable for limited commercial
development.
   (D)   The management of areas for commercial or industrial uses which, by
their nature, require location in shoreland areas.
   (E)   The protection of valuable agricultural lands from conversion to other
uses.
   (F)   The preservation and enhancement of the quality of water based
recreational use of public waters including provisions for public accesses.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 229.05 LAKESHORE MANAGEMENT DISTRICTS.
   All lands presently contained within the city, and added by annexation in
the future lying within the shoreland boundaries shall comply with the general
provisions of this section. Such lands are designated on the Lakeshore
Management Map, which is incorporated herein by reference as if appearing in
total, and described as follows:
   (A)   SP Special Protection District. A Special Protection District is
intended to be used for 2 basic purposes. The first purpose is to limit and
properly manage development in areas that are generally unsuitable for
development or uses due to flooding, erosion, limiting soil conditions, steep
slopes, or other major physical constraints. A second purpose is to manage and
preserve areas with special historical, natural, or biological characteristics.
There are 4 SP districts in the city, located as follows:
      (1)   All of Blocks 10, 11, and 12, of the plat of Kavanagh and Schulze’s
First Addition to Center City.
      (2)   Outlot #1 of F. G. Loren’s Addition to Center City.
      (3)   All of Lots A and B of Kavanagh and Schulze’s First Addition to
Center City (including that part of Lot A subsequently platted as Loren’s
Subdivision of Lot A).
      (4)   An historical district, consisting of the following lands:
         (a)   The West Half of Lot 6, and all of Lots 7-14, inclusive, in
Block 1; and all of Blocks 3 and 6; all in Kavanagh and Schulze’s First
Addition to Center City.
         (b)   The Swedish Church property which is bordered by Summit Avenue
on the west, Lindeke Place on the south and east, and Louise Avenue on the
north.
   (B)   RD Residential District. A Residential District is primarily intended
to allow low to medium density seasonal and year round residential uses on
lands suitable for such uses. It is also intended to prevent establishment of
various commercial, industrial, and other uses in these areas that cause
conflicts or problems for residential uses. Some nonresidential uses with
minimal impacts on residential uses are allowed if properly managed under
conditional use procedures. All lands within the existing city are designated
RD unless expressly designated otherwise.
   (C)   HD High Density Residential District. A High Density Residential
District is intended for use on lands with heterogeneous mixes of soils,
vegetation, and topography that are not well suited to residential development
using standard, lot block subdivisions. This approach enables such areas to be
developed, often even with higher than lot block densities, while also avoiding
and preserving unsuitable terrain and soils. Other compatible uses such as
residential planned unit development, surface water oriented commercial,
multiple-unit single-family, parks, historic sites, and semipublic are also
allowed, primarily as conditional uses. The city does not presently contain any
high density residential districts.
   (D)   WOD Water Oriented Commercial District. A Water Oriented Commercial
District is intended to be used only to provide for existing or future
commercial uses adjacent to water resources that are functionally dependent on
such close proximity.
   (E)   G General Use District. A general use district is intended to be used
only for lands already developed or suitable for development with concentrated
urban, particularly commercial, land uses. It should not generally be used on
natural environment lakes or remote river classes. Several other intensive
urban uses such as industrial and commercial planned unit development are
allowed in this district if handled as conditional uses. G districts are all
lands so designated on the lakeshore map.
   (F)   High water elevations. 
      (1)   For Pioneer Lake (Basin #13-34) the lowest floor shall be 3 feet
above either the highest known water level of Pioneer Lake or 3 feet above the
lowest point of the road separating Pioneer and North Center Lake (Basin
#13032) whichever provides the greatest degree of protection.
      (2)   For North Center Lake (13-32) and South Center Lake (Basing #13-
27), the lowest floor shall be placed at or above the elevation 904.0, sea
level datum.
      (3)   Exception. Boathouses shall normally meet the structure elevation
requirements as outlined by 1001.11, 2, (a) and (b). However, the city may
allow construction of a boathouse at a level no lower than the ordinary high
water level of Pioneer, north Center and South Center Lakes if the boathouse is
flood-proofed in accordance with the State Building Code.
      (4)   Lowest floor certification requirement, if a structure has been
constructed or improved a location within a special flood hazard area (A-zone)
as shown on the most current flood insurance map for the city, the permittee
shall provide certification of the as-built elevation of the lowest floor of
said structure. Such certification shall be made on forms provided by the City
Clerk. The Zoning Administrator shall maintain a record of such elevations
pursuant to Code of Federal Regulations.
   (G)   Grading and filling permits. Any grading and filling within the
Shoreland District which involves the movement of more than 10 cubic yards but
less than 100 cubic yards of earthen material shall not be conducted unless the
Zoning Administrator has first issued a permit authorizing such activity. All
grading and filling in excess of 100 cubic yards of earthen material shall not
be conducted unless the City Council has established a conditional use permit
in accordance with the city’s established conditional use permit process. All
grading and filling including work involving less than 10 cubic yards which
does not require a permit, is subject to the following standards and criteria:
      (1)   When reasonable alternatives exist fill must not be placed in any
wetland area because these areas provide for nutrient and sediment entrapment
for storm runoff prior to discharge into public bodies of water.
      (2)   All permits shall require that the permittee seed and mulch or sod
exposed soils within a specified time period in order to prevent erosion from
the site.
      (3)   No permit shall authorize the placement of fill below the ordinary
high water level, of a public water, unless a permit from the Commissioner of
Natural Resources has first been secured.
      (4)   Exceptions. No extra permit shall be required for basement
excavations or similar construction activity which has been authorized by a
valid building permit provided no more than 100 cubic yards of fill material
are hauled to or from the building site and the building permit contains
provisions for the implementation of erosion control measures consistent with
division (2) above.

§ 229.08 RESIDENTIAL LOT PROVISIONS.
   All single, duplex, triplex, and quad residential lots created hereafter
shall meet or exceed the dimensions which follow.
   (A)   (1)   Lots must not be occupied by any more dwelling units than
indicated below. Residential subdivisions with dwelling unit densities
exceeding those in the tables below may only be allowed if designed and
approved as residential planned unit developments. The sewer lot area
dimensions set forth below can only be used if publicly owned sewer system
service is available to the property.
      (2)   Only land above the ordinary high water level of public waters can
be used to meet lot area standards. Lot width standards must be met at both the
ordinary high water level and at the building line.
   (B)   One guest cottage may be allowed on lots meeting or exceeding the
duplex dimensions set forth below provided the following standards are met:
      (1)   For lots exceeding the minimum lot dimensions of duplex lots, the
guest cottage must be located within the smallest duplex sized lot that could
be created including the principal dwelling unit.
      (2)   A guest cottage may not cover more than 700 square feet of land
surface and may not exceed a height of 15 feet.
      (3)   A guest cottage must be located or designed to reduce its
visibility as viewed from the lake and adjacent shorelands by vegetation,
topography, increased setbacks, color, or such other means as is approved by
the city, assuming summer, leaf on conditions.
   (C)   Lots of record. Lots of record that do not meet the minimum area and
width standards contained herein may be allowed as building sites without
variances from the minimum lot size requirements provided:
      (1)   The use is permitted in the designated zoning district.
      (2)   The lot has been in separate ownership from abutting lands
continuously since it was created.
      (3)   The lot was created in compliance with official controls in effect
at the time of its creation.
      (4)   All sewage treatment and setback requirements contained herein are
met.
   (D)   Variances. Any variances from setback requirements must be obtained
before any use is made of, sewer treatment is provided to, or building permits
are issued for the lot. In evaluating such variances, the Board of Adjustment
shall consider sewage treatment and water supply capabilities and any
constraints of the lots. The Board shall deny the variance if adequate
facilities cannot be provided.
   (E)   Requirement. If in a group of 2 or more contiguous lots under common
ownership any individual lot does not meet the minimum size and width
requirements, the lot may not be considered as a separate parcel of land for
the purpose of sale or development. The lot must be combined with 1 or more of
the contiguous lots such that all of the lots meet the minimum size and width
requirements to the greatest possible extent.
   (F)   Lots designated for private lake access. Lots expressly conveyed,
designated, or dedicated as access to public waters for use by owners of non-
lakeshore lots within a plat must meet the following standards:
      (1)   The lot must meet the minimum size and width for residential lots
required herein, but must be of sufficient width to permit a vehicle and
trailer to turn around and utilize such access in an area confined to the lot.
      (2)   The lot may be provided with a dock provided that not more than 6
boats or watercraft shall be permitted to be docked and/or beached at any given
time. Boats or watercraft moored or attached to buoys shall be included in the
maximum number here permitted.
      (3)   By incorporation, or by the formation of a legally created
association, covenants shall be recorded which:
         (a)   Specify the ownership of the lot, make such ownership
inseparable from the ownership of the benefitting lots, and shall provide that
a conveyance of a benefitting lot shall include the attending interest in the
access lot;
         (b)   Provide the means for maintenance of the lot and assessing and
collecting the cost thereof;
         (c)   Provided a means for paying any and all real estate taxes,
assessments, and any other charges levied against the lot and assessing same to
the benefitting lots;
         (d)   Specify and enumerate all uses which may be made of the lot and
those uses which are prohibited.
      (4)   The city may require that appropriate screening be constructed,
installed, or planted and maintained to minimize the impact of the lot and its
use as viewed from the public water.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 229.09 PLACEMENT AND HEIGHT OF STRUCTURES AND FACILITIES ON LOTS.
   (A)   Setback requirement. When more than 1 setback requirement applies to a
site, structures and facilities must be located to meet the most stringent
setback.
   (B)   Exceptions to structure setbacks - lots of record. Where structures
exist on the adjoining lots on both sides of a building site, the structure
setbacks may be decreased without a variance to conform to the adjoining
setbacks; provided the proposed building site is not in a shore impact zone or
bluff impact zone.
   (C)   High water elevations. In addition to the setback requirements set
forth above, all structures must be placed at an elevation consistent with the
city floodplain controls; where no reliable data exists, the elevation of the
lowest floor of a structure, including a basement, is determined as follows:
      (1)   The lowest floor level must be not less than 3 feet above the
highest known water level, or the established ordinary high water mark,
whichever is higher.
      (2)   Water oriented accessory structures may have the lowest floor
located lower than the level cited in the next preceding section if the
structure is constructed of flood resistant materials up to the required
elevation, all electrical and mechanical equipment is placed above that
elevation, and if flooding is anticipated, the structure is constructed to
withstand wave action and damage from ice and floating debris.
   (D)   Bluff impact zones. Structures and accessory facilities, except
stairways, lifts, and landings may not be placed within a bluff impact zone.
   (E)   Steep slopes. No sewage treatment system, road, driveway, structure,
or other permanent improvement shall be permitted on a steep slope except by
conditional use permit. Considerations for such a permit shall include the
prevention of erosion; the preservation of existing vegetation, and the
screening of structures; and the use and parking of vehicles and other
attending facilities as viewed from the surface of the adjacent lake, assuming
summer, leaf on vegetation.
   (F)   Cemeteries and historic sites.
      (1)   No structure may be placed nearer than 50 feet from the boundary of
a cemetery or burial ground protected under M.S. Chapter 307 without first
receiving written approval from the office of the Minnesota State
Archaeologist.
      (2)   No structure may be placed on a significant historic site
designated under M.S. § 138 without first obtaining the written approval of the
local, state, or federal agency or department having jurisdiction over the
site.
   (G)   Roads and highways. No structure may be placed nearer than 50 feet
from the right-of-way line of any federal, state, or county highway, or 20 feet
from the right-of-way line of any town road or public street.
   (H)   Height restrictions. No structure hereafter erected in a residential
district shall exceed 25 feet in height, except churches, public buildings for
which a conditional use permit has been issued, and agricultural structures.
   (I)   Accessory structures and facilities. All accessory structures and
facilities must meet the setback standards set forth herein, except that a
residential lot may have 1 water oriented accessory structure or facility
within a setback, provided:
      (1)   The structure or facility does not exceed 10 feet in height,
excluding safety rails, and does not occupy an area greater than 250 square
feet, except that such a structure or facility used solely for watercraft
storage, including the storage of related boating and water oriented sporting
equipment may occupy an area not exceeding 400 square feet, provided that the
maximum width of the structure is 20 feet as measured parallel to the
configuration of the shoreline;
      (2)   Detached decks may not exceed 8 feet above grade at any point;
      (3)   The structure or facility is setback not less than 10 feet from the
ordinary high water mark;
      (4)   The structure or facility is treated to reduce its visibility as
viewed from the public water and adjacent shorelands by vegetation, topography,
an increased setback, or color, assuming summer, leaf on conditions;
      (5)   The roof of the structure may be used as a deck with safety rails
which may not be enclosed and may not be used for storage; and
      (6)   The structure or facility is not designed for habitation and does
not contain or otherwise have available either water supply or provisions for
the disposition of sewage.
   (J)   Structure setbacks. The setback requirements contained in the
following table shall be the minimum setbacks, except for water oriented
accessory structures and facilities regulated under division (I):
      (1)   Structure setback standards.
 
                    Ordinary high water level setback
Class               (feet)                             Setback from top of

   (K)   Stairways, lifts and landings. Access up and down bluffs and steep
slopes shall be stairways or lifts meeting the following requirements, unless a
variance is granted:
      (1)   Stairways and lifts must not exceed 4 feet in width on residential
lots; wider stairways for which express approval has been obtained in writing
may be used for commercial properties, public open space recreational
properties, and planned unit developments.

      (1)   The area within each tier is divided by the single residential lot
size standard for lakes, the single residential lot width standard times the
tier depth unless the local unit of government has specified an alternative
minimum lot size which shall then be used to yield a base density of dwelling
units or sites for each tier. Proposed locations and numbers of dwelling units
or sites for the residential planned unit development are then compared with
these data and map of the evaluation. Local governments may allow some dwelling
unit or site density increases for residential planned unit developments above
the densities determined in the evaluation if all dimensional standards in §§
150.55 through 150.60 inclusive are met or exceeded. Maximum density increases
may only be allowed if all design criteria in division (D)(3) below are also
met or exceeded. Increases in dwelling unit or site densities must not exceed
the maximums in the following table. Allowable densities may be transferred
from any tier to any other tier further from the shoreland water body or
watercourse, but must not be transferred to any other tier closer.

existence and functioning of the development as a community.
         (a)   Deed restrictions, covenants, permanent easements, public
dedication and acceptance, or other equally effective and permanent means shall
be provided to ensure long-term preservation and maintenance of open space. The
instruments shall include all of the following protections: commercial uses
prohibited; vegetation and topographic alterations other than routine
maintenance prohibited; construction of additional buildings or storage of
vehicles and other materials prohibited; and uncontrolled beaching prohibited.
         (b)   Unless an equally effective, alternative community framework has
been established and approved by the city, all residential planned unit
developments must use an owners association with the following features:
membership must be mandatory for each dwelling unit or site purchaser and any
successive purchasers; each member must pay a pro rata share of the
association’s expenses and unpaid assessments can become liens on units or
sites; assessments must be adjustable to accommodate changing conditions; and
the association must be responsible for insurance, taxes, and maintenance of
all commonly owned property and facilities.
   (E)   Commercial planned unit development density evaluation steps and
design criteria. The following density evaluation steps and design criteria for
commercial planned unit developments must comply with the following:
      (1)   Determine the average inside living area size of dwelling units or
sites within each tier, including both existing and proposed units and sites.
Computation of inside living area sizes need not include decks, patios, stoops,
steps, garages, or porches and basements, unless they are habitable space.
      (2)   (a)   Select the appropriate floor area ratio from the following
table:
Commercial Planned Unit Development
Average Unit Floor Area (sq.ft.) Lakes; Urban, Agricultural, Tributary River
                                 Segments
Commercial Planned Unit Development
Average Unit Floor Area (sq.ft.) Lakes; Urban, Agricultural, Tributary River
                                 Segments
1,000                            .108
1,100                            .116
1,200                            .125
1,300                            .133
1,400                            .142
1,500                            .150
 
         (b)   For average unit floor areas less than shown, use the floor area
ratios listed for 200 square feet. For areas greater than shown, use the ratios
listed for 1,500 square feet. For recreational camping areas, use the ratios
listed at 400 square feet. Manufactured home sites in recreational camping
areas shall use a ratio equal to the size of the manufactured home, or if
known, the ratio listed for 1,000 square feet.
      (3)   Multiply the useable area within each tier by the floor area ratio
to yield total floor area for each tier allowed to be used for dwelling units
or sites.
      (4)   Divide the area computed in division (E)(3) above by the average
determined in division (E)(1). This yields a base number of dwelling units and
sites for each tier.
      (5)   Determine whether the project is eligible for any additional
density increases. To be eligible, projects must meet all of the design
standards and exceed 1 or more of them. The local unit of government may decide
how much, if any, increase in density to allow for each tier, but must not
exceed the maximum allowable density increases listed in the following table:
 
Maximum Allowable Dwelling Unit or Site Density Increases for Commercial
Planned Unit Developments
Tier   Maximum density increase within each tier
First  50
Second 100
Third  200
Fourth 200
Fifth  200
 
      (6)   Allowable densities may be transferred from any tier to any other
tier further from the shoreland lake but must not be transferred to any other
tier closer.
      (7)   Commercial planned unit developments must contain open space
meeting all of the following criteria:
         (a)   At least 50% of the total project area must be preserved as open
space.
         (b)   Dwelling units or sites, road rights-of-way or land covered by
road surfaces or parking areas, except water oriented accessory structures or
facilities are developed areas and should not be included in the computation of
open space.
         (c)   Open space shall include areas with physical characteristics
unsuitable for development in their natural state and areas containing
significant historic sites or unplatted cemeteries.
         (d)   All shore impact zones within commercial planned unit
developments shall be included as open space and at least 50% of these areas
must be preserved in their natural or existing state.
         (e)   Open space shall include outdoor recreation facilities for use
by guests staying in dwelling units or sites or the public.
         (f)   Open space shall include subsurface sewage treatment systems if
use of the space is restricted to avoid adverse impacts on the systems.
      (8)   Design of structures and facilities shall be in accordance with the
following standards:
         (a)   Commercial planned unit developments must be connected to
publicly owned water supply and sewer systems if available. On-site water
supply and sewage treatment systems must be designed and installed to meet or
exceed applicable rules of the Minnesota Department of Health and the Minnesota
Pollution Control Agency. On-site sewage treatment systems must be located on
the most suitable areas of the development and sufficient lawn area free of
limiting factors must be provided for a replacement soil treatment system for
each sewage system.
         (b)   Dwelling units or sites must be located on suitable areas of the
development. They must be designed and located to meet or exceed the following
dimensional standards for the relevant shoreland classification: setback from
the ordinary high water level, elevation above surface water features and
maximum height. Maximum density increases may only be allowed if structure
setbacks from the ordinary high water level are increased to at least 50%
greater than the minimum setback or the impact on the water body is reduced an
equivalent amount through vegetative management, topography, or other means
acceptable to the local unit of government and the setback is at least 25%
greater than the minimum setback.
         (c)   Structures, parking areas, and other facilities must be designed
and located in a manner that minimizes their visibility from surface water
features, assuming summer, leaf on conditions. The structure, dwelling unit,
accessory structure, or parking area must be treated to reduce visibility as
viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation, topography,
increased set backs, color, or other means acceptable to the local unit of
government assuming summer, leaf on conditions. Vegetative and topographic
screening must be preserved, if existing, or may be required to be provided.
         (d)   Water oriented accessory structures and facilities may be
located within shore impact zones if they meet or exceed design standards
contained herein.
         (e)   Shore recreation facilities, including but not limited to
swimming areas, docks, and watercraft mooring areas and launching ramps must be
centralized and located in areas suitable for them. Evaluation of suitability
must include consideration of land slope, water depth, vegetation, soils, depth
to ground water and bedrock, or other relevant factors. The number or
watercraft allowed to be continuously beached, moored, or docked must not
exceed 1 for each allowable dwelling unit or site in the first tier,
notwithstanding existing mooring sites in an existing harbor. Launching ramp
facilities, including a small dock for loading and unloading equipment, may be
provided for use by occupants of dwelling units or sites located in other
tiers.
      (9)   Erosion control and stormwater management for commercial planned
unit developments shall comply with the following requirements:
         (a)   Be designed and their construction managed to minimize the
likelihood of serious erosion occurring either during or after construction.
This must be accomplished by limiting the amount and length of time of bare
ground exposure. Temporary ground covers, sediment entrapment facilities,
vegetated buffer strips, or other appropriate techniques must be used to
minimize erosion impacts on surface water features. Erosion control plans
approved by a soil and water conservation district may be required if project
size and site physical characteristics warrant.
         (b)   Be designed and constructed to effectively manage reasonably
expected quantities and qualities of stormwater runoff. Impervious surface
coverage within any tier must not exceed 25% of the tier area, except 35%
impervious surface coverage may be allowed in the first tier of general
development lakes with an approved stormwater management plan and consistency
with M.S. § 150.59.
(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
§ 229.21 ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Variances. Variances may only be granted in accordance with M.S.
Chapter 462. They may not circumvent the general purposes and intent of the
official controls. No variance may be granted that would allow any use that is
not permitted in the zoning district in which the subject property is located.
Conditions may be imposed in the granting of variances to ensure compliance and
to protect adjacent properties and the public interest. In considering variance
requests, boards of adjustment must also consider whether property owners have
reasonable use of the lands without the variances, whether existing sewage
treatment systems on the properties need upgrading before additional
development is approved, whether the properties are used seasonally or year
round, whether variances are being requested solely on the basis of economic
considerations and the characteristics of development on adjacent properties.
   (B)   Conditional uses. In addition to any existing standards the city may
have for reviewing conditional uses, the following standards must be
incorporated into local controls and used for reviewing conditional uses
located in shoreland areas:
      (1)   A thorough evaluation of the topographic, vegetation, and soil
conditions on the site to ensure:
         (a)   Prevention of soil erosion or other possible pollution of public
waters, both during and after construction.
         (b)   Limiting visibility of structures and other facilities as viewed
from public waters.
         (c)   Adequacy of the site for water supply and on-site sewage
treatment.
      (2)   An assessment of the types, uses, and numbers of watercraft that
the project will generate in relation to the suitability of public waters to
safely accommodate these watercraft.
   (C)   Conditions. Local governments may impose conditions when granting
conditional use permits that specify: increased setbacks from public waters;
vegetation allowed to be removed or required to be established; sewage
treatment system location, design, or use; location, design, and use
requirements for watercraft launching or docking, and for vehicular parking;
structure or other facility design, use, and location; phasing of construction;
and other conditions considered necessary by the local unit of government.
   (D)   Interim uses. Interim uses shall be permitted in compliance with the
law governing same.
   (E)   Notification procedures.
      (1)   Copies of all notices of any public hearings to consider variances,
amendments, or conditional uses under local shoreland management controls must
be sent to the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designated representative and
postmarked at least 10 days before the hearings. Notices of hearings to
consider proposed plats must include copies of the plats.
      (2)   A copy of amendments and plats and final decisions granting
variances or conditional uses under local shoreland management controls must be
sent to the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designated representative and
postmarked within 10 days of final action.
   (F)   Zoning Administrator.
      (1)   The City Council shall appoint a Zoning Administrator, who shall
serve at the pleasure of the Council.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator shall enforce the provisions of this
chapter, and, in addition thereto and in furtherance thereof, shall:
         (a)   Accept applications for, process, and issue permits upon the
fulfillment of all requirements necessary therefore, and shall make and
maintain records thereof.
         (b)   Supervise the inspection of buildings and uses of land to
determine compliance with the terms and requirements of this chapter.
         (c)   Maintain current and permanent records of the adoption,
implementation, and enforcement of this chapter, including, but not limited to,
all maps, amendments, conditional uses, variances, interim uses, and appeals
relating to this chapter.
         (d)   Institute in the name of the city, after receiving approval of
the City Council for court proceedings, any appropriate action or proceedings
against any person violating the requirements of this chapter, otherwise
necessary to enforce same.
   (G)   Variances.
      (1)   Purpose. Where it is found that extraordinary and unnecessary
hardships may result from strict compliance with this chapter, variances may be
granted, provided that such variances will not have the effect of nullifying
the intent and purpose of this chapter, the City Comprehensive Plan, the
official map, or other development regulations.
      (2)   Application for variance. An application for a variance shall be
filed with the Zoning Administrator, stating and showing the exceptional
conditions and/or unusual difficulties claimed, including the legal description
of the parcel involved, and any surveys, maps, photographs, or other documents
clearly showing the nature and extent of the variance requested, and all
reasons or justifications therefore.
      (3)   Referral to Board of Adjustment. The application shall be referred
to the Board of Adjustment and shall be set on for a hearing before that Board.
At the hearing, the Board may request additional information deemed essential
to make a decision on the requested variance. Within 35 days following the date
of the hearing, or following the date of a continued hearing to consider
additional information, the Board of Adjustment may deny, approve, or approve
with conditions the variance requested.
      (4)   Public hearing held. Within 40 days of receipt of the application
for a variance, the Board of Adjustment shall hold a public hearing upon the
request, giving the applicant written notice of the time and date of the
hearing, and publishing such notice not less than 10 days prior to the hearing.
      (5)   Factors to be considered.
         (a)   A variance shall be granted from the literal provisions of this
chapter only in instances where their strict enforcement would cause undue
hardship because of circumstances unique to the parcel under consideration,
which circumstances shall not have been caused by the owner or applicant, and
where such variance will be in keeping with the spirit and intent of this
chapter. UNDUE HARDSHIP means the property in question cannot be put to a
reasonable use if used under conditions allowed by this chapter, the variance
will not alter the essential character of the locality, and the variance is not
based solely on economic considerations.
         (b)   A variance may not be granted for a use which is not permitted
in the district in which the parcel in question is located.
      (6)   Denial of application. The denial of an application for a variance
shall constitute a finding and determination that the conditions required for
approval do not exist. No application for a variance which has been denied
wholly or in part shall be resubmitted for a period of 1 year from the date of
the order of denial, except on grounds of new evidence or proof of change of
conditions found to be valid by the Board of Adjustment.
      (7)   Violation of stated condition. A violation of any stated condition
attached to a variance shall be a violation of this code, and in addition,
shall constitute grounds for the termination of the variance.
      (8)   Time within which to exercise a variance. A variance shall become
null and void 1 year after the date upon which it was granted unless the
variance is fully implemented and the conditions met. The Board of Adjustment
may expressly extend the time within which the use may be implemented and the
conditions met at the time of the granting of the original variance if so
requested and the reasons are justified.
   (H)   Conditional use permit.
      (1)   Application. Whenever this chapter requires a conditional use
permit, an application therefore in writing shall be filed with the Zoning
Administrator.
      (2)   Contents of application. The application shall be accompanied by a
site plan of the proposed use showing such information as may be necessary or
desirable, including but not limited to the following:
         (a)   Site plan drawn to scale showing parcel and building dimensions.
         (b)   Location of all existing and proposed buildings and their square
footages, and the distance of such buildings from the boundaries of the parcel
involved.
         (c)   The uses existing on the parcel, and on all adjoining
properties.
         (d)   Curb cuts, driveways, access roads, parking spaces, and off-
street loading areas.
         (e)   Existing topography.
         (f)   Finished grading and drainage plan.
         (g)   The type of business or activity and the proposed number of
employees.
         (h)   Proposed floor plan of any building with use or uses indicated.
         (i)   Existing and proposed sanitary sewer, storm sewer, and water
plan with estimated use per day.
         (j)   Soil type and soil limitations for the intended use. If severe
soil limitations for the intended use are noted, a plan or statement indicating
the soil conservation practice or practices to be used to overcome the
limitation shall be made a part of the permit application.
         (k)   A location map showing the general location of the proposed use
within the city.
         (l)   The conditions giving rise to the need for a special use permit,
together with the reasons supporting the issuance thereof.
         (m)   The names and addresses of property owners within 300 feet of
the boundary of the subject property.
      (3)   Referral to Commission. The application and required information
shall be referred to the Planning Commission for study concerning the effect of
the proposed use on the Comprehensive Plan and on the character and development
of the neighborhood.
      (4)   Public hearing. Within 40 days after filing an application, a date
shall be set for a hearing thereon by the Planning Commission. Notice of such
hearing shall be mailed not less than 10 days before the date thereof to the
applicant and to each property owner situated wholly or in part within 300 feet
of the boundary of the property to which the special use permit relates,
insofar as the names and addresses can be determined from the City Clerk/
Treasurer or the County Auditor from records available to the public.
      (5)   Recommendation of Planning Commission. The Planning Commission
shall forward its findings and recommendations to the City Council within 35
days from the date of the hearing.
      (6)   City Council action. The City Council shall consider the advice and
recommendation of the Planning Commission and the effects of the proposed use
upon the health, safety, and welfare of the city and of the occupants of the
immediate neighborhood. Should the City Council find that the proposed use when
conducted under the specified conditions will not be detrimental to the health,
safety, or general welfare of the community, it may grant a special use permit,
specifying the location and the use requested, together with such conditions
attached thereto as are deemed appropriate.
      (7)   Periodic review. The City Council may require a periodic review of
the permit and the conditions attached thereto to be made by the Zoning
Administrator.
      (8)   Revocation. A violation of any condition set forth in a special use
permit shall constitute a violation of this chapter, and constitute grounds for
the immediate termination of the permit.
      (9)   Purpose for which issued. A special use permit shall be issued for
a particular use of a structure and/or parcel, and shall not be deemed issued
to a particular person or firm.
      (10)   Special use permit voided. A special use permit issued hereunder
shall become void 1 year after the date upon which it was granted, unless the
permit is fully implemented and the conditions attached thereto fully met;
provided, that the Council may expressly extend the period of time within which
a special use permit may be implemented and the conditions met at the time of
issuance of the original special use permit, if requested to do so and the
grounds for the request justify such an extension.
      (11)   Appeals. Any person adversely affected by a decision to grant or
deny a special use permit may appeal the decision to the District Court within
30 days following the date of the decision; provided, that the applicant, and
any interested person desiring a copy of the decision who leaves their name and
address with the Zoning Administrator, for that purpose, may appeal the
decision within 35 days following the date of mailing of the decision.
   (I)   Interim uses.
      (1)   The City Council may issue an interim use, under and pursuant to
M.S. § 462.3597.
      (2)   The procedure for issuing an interim use permit shall be the same
as that for issuing a conditional use permit, under division (C) above.
      (3)   An interim use permit may be granted only if:
         (a)   The use is a permitted use or a conditional use in the district
in which the property is located; provided, that a proposed use may be granted
such a permit where the use is not incompatible with the permitted and
conditioned uses allowed in the district, as determined by the Council, and the
use otherwise complies with the requirements of this chapter;
         (b)   The use will terminate on a date certain, or the use will
terminate on the occurrence of an event which can be identified with certainty;
         (c)    Permitting the use will not impose additional costs on the
public if it is necessary for the public to take the property upon which the
use is conducted in the future;
         (d)    The use does not run with the land, and may not be transferred,
assigned nor conveyed, unless expressly permitted in the interim use permit;
         (e)   The applicant and/or owner of the parcel agrees to all terms and
conditions set forth in the interim use, verifying that consent by signing the
interim use permit;
         (f)   The interim use permit is recordable in the office of the County
Recorder of the county; and
         (g)   The City Council may require such security as is deemed
appropriate to assure the termination of the interim use on the date, or upon
the occurrence of the event which terminates the use.
      (4)   An interim use may be terminated:
         (a)   In the event of a violation of any of the conditions stated in
the permit; or
         (b)   By an amendment of the zoning regulations, which renders the
interim use incompatible with the provisions of the amendment.
   (J)   Amendment of chapter.
      (1)   Authority. The provisions of this chapter may be amended by the
City Council.
      (2)   Initiation for amendment. The City Council or the Planning
Commission may, upon their own motion, initiate an amendment to the text of
this chapter or the official map of the city; or any person owning real estate
may petition the Council to amend the text of this chapter or amend the
official map of the city in such a manner as to affect his or her real estate
or a larger parcel which includes his or her real estate.
      (3)   Application for amendment. All petitions or requests for amendments
shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator. When the application involves the
changing of zoning districts and boundaries thereof, it shall be accompanied by
a map or plat showing the lands proposed to be changed, type of soil, and all
lands and uses made thereof within 400 feet of the boundaries of the property
proposed to be rezoned, together with a certified list of the names and
addresses of the owners of the land in the entire area mentioned.
      (4)   Referral to the Planning Commission. All petitions or requests for
amendments shall be referred to the Planning Commission which shall hold an
official public hearing within 60 days of the date of filing such petition.
      (5)   Notice. The Zoning Administrator shall cause to be published a
notice of public hearing in the official newspaper of the city at least 10 days
but not more than 30 days prior to the date of the hearing.
      (6)   Action by the Planning Commission.
         (a)   If the request is for a district change of a single parcel,
notices of the time, place, date, and purpose of the hearing shall be mailed to
all owners of property within 300 feet of the affected parcel not less than 10
days nor more than 30 days prior to the date of the hearing. Failure of a
property owner to receive notice shall not invalidate any such proceeding on
the application.
         (b)   If, at the hearing, the Planning Commission determines that
additional information or documentation is required, the applicant shall be so
notified to obtain such information or documentation; the hearing shall be
continued to a date certain to permit the applicant to comply.
         (c)   Upon receipt of all required information, and completion of the
hearing process, the Planning Commission shall make its recommendation to the
City Council within 35 days thereafter, unless the applicant consents to an
extension of this period of time.
      (7)   Action by the City Council.
         (a)   If the City Council determines that it has insufficient
information to act on the application, the Council may remand the matter to the
Planning Commission, for further hearing.
         (b)   If the City Council determines that all relevant information has
been obtained by the Planning Commission, the City Council shall act upon the
recommendation of the Planning Commission, either approving or denying the
application, within 35 days of the receipt of the recommendations of the
Planning Commission.
         (c)   If the Planning Commission approves the application, the
findings and order of the Council shall be submitted to the Zoning
Administrator and same shall be incorporated into the official copy of the
ordinances of the city and duly published and recorded, and thereafter
implemented by the Zoning Administrator.
      (8)   Amendments do not modify the boundaries of a district.
         (a)   Amendments to the text of this chapter may be initiated by the
City Council, the Planning Commission, or an interested property owner, by
submitting an application, in writing, to the Zoning Administrator setting
forth the proposed amendment. The proposed amendment shall be submitted to and
set on for a hearing before the Planning Commission. Notice of the proposed

(Ord. 2011-06-07A, passed 6-7-2011)
CHAPTER 230: GENERAL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT; FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
Section
   
230.01   General Floodplain District; Floodplain Management Ordinance
§ 230.01 GENERAL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT; FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE.
   (A)   Statutory authorization, findings of fact, and purpose.
      (1) Statutory authorization. The legislature of the State of Minnesota
has, in M.S. Chapter 103F and Chapter 462, delegated the responsibility to
local government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
Therefore, the City Council does ordain as follows.
      (2)  Findings of fact.
         (a)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation which results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures or flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
         (b) Methods used to analyze flood hazards. This chapter is based upon
a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the
standards established by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
              (c) National Flood Insurance Program compliance. This chapter is
adopted to comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood
Insurance Program codified as 44 C.F.R. § 44, Pt. 59 -78, as amended, so as to
maintain the community’s eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
      (3)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote
the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize those losses
described in division (A)(2)(a) above by provisions contained herein.
   (B)   General provisions
      (1)   Lands to which chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all
lands within the jurisdiction of the city shown on the Official Zoning Map and/
or the attachments thereto as being located within the boundaries of the
Floodway or Flood Fringe Districts.
      (2)   Establishment of Official Zoning Map. The Official Zoning Map
together with all materials attached thereto is hereby adopted by reference and
declared to be a part of this chapter. The material attached to the Official
Zoning Map shall include the Flood Insurance Study, Chisago County, Minnesota
and Incorporated Areas, Flood Insurance Rate Map panels therein numbered
27025C0289D, 27025C0290D, and 27025C0295D, all dated April 17, 2012, and
prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Official Zoning Map
shall be on file in the Office of the City Clerk.
      (3)   Regulatory flood protection elevation. The regulatory flood
protection elevation shall be an elevation no lower than one foot above the
elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by
encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway.
      (4)   Interpretation.
         (a)   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
         (b)   The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by
scaling distances on the Official Zoning Map. Where interpretation is needed as
to the exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the
Official Zoning Map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict
between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions and there is a formal
appeal of the decision of the Zoning Administrator, the City Council shall make
the necessary interpretation. All decisions will be based on elevations on the
regional (100-year) flood profile, the ground elevations that existed on the
site at the time the city adopted its initial floodplain ordinance or on the
date of the first National Flood Insurance Program map showing the area within
the 100-year floodplain if earlier, and other available technical data. Persons
contesting the location of the district boundaries shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to present their case to the City Council and to submit technical
evidence.
      (5)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. It is not intended by this
chapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions,
the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent
with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
      (6)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. This chapter does not imply
that areas outside the floodplain districts or land uses permitted within such
districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not
create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for
any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
      (7)   Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this
chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.
      (8)   Definitions. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases
used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the same meaning
as they have in common usage and so as to give this chapter its most reasonable
application.
         (a)   ACCESSORY USE OR STRUCTURE. A use or structure on the same lot
with, and of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal
use or structure.
         (b)   BASEMENT. Any area of a structure, including crawl spaces,

in the official control that may be allowed but only after an in-depth review
procedure and with appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in the
official zoning controls or building codes and upon a finding that:
            1.   Certain conditions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist.
            2.   The structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive
land use plan if one exists and are compatible with the existing neighborhood.
         (d)   EQUAL DEGREE OF ENCROACHMENT. A method of determining the

in the stage of a wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally
dry areas.
         (f)   FLOOD FREQUENCY. The frequency for which it is expected that a
specific flood stage or discharge may be equaled or exceeded.
         (g)   FLOOD FRINGE. That portion of the floodplain outside of the
floodway. FLOOD FRINGE is synonymous with the term “floodway fringe” used in
the Flood Insurance Study for Chisago County, Minnesota and Incorporated Areas.

watercourse and those portions of the adjoining floodplain which are reasonably
required to carry or store the regional flood discharge.
         (k)   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely
for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a
basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor.
         (l)   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The
term MANUFACTURED HOME does not include the term “recreational vehicle.”

which may impede, retard, or change the direction of the flow of water, either
in itself or by catching or collecting debris carried by such water.
         (n)   PRINCIPAL USE OR STRUCTURE. All uses or structures that are not
accessory uses or structures.
         (o)   REACH. A hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal
segment of a stream or river influenced by a natural or man-made obstruction.

bridge crossings would most typically constitute a REACH.
         (p)   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle that is built on a single
chassis, is 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, is designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use. For the purposes of this chapter, the term RECREATIONAL VEHICLE shall be
synonymous with the term “travel trailer/travel vehicle.”
         (q)   REGIONAL FLOOD. A flood which is representative of large floods
known to have occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of
what can be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the
100-year recurrence interval. REGIONAL FLOOD is synonymous with the term "base
flood," 1% annual chance or 100-year flood elevation.
         (r)   REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION. The regulatory flood
protection elevation shall be an elevation no lower than 1 foot above the
elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by
encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway.
         (s)   STRUCTURE. Anything constructed or erected on the ground or
attached to the ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to,

recreational vehicles not meeting the exemption criteria specified in division
(I)(3)(a) of this chapter and other similar items.
         (t)   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a
structure where the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
         (u)   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Within any consecutive 365-day period,
any reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair),
repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the
“start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures that
have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include either:
            1.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
            2.   Any alteration of an “historic structure,” provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an
“historic structure.” For the purpose of this chapter, “historic structure”
shall be as defined in C.F.R. § 44, Part 59.1.
          (v)   VARIANCE. A modification of a specific permitted development
standard required in an official control including this chapter to allow an
alternative development standard not stated as acceptable in the official
control, but only as applied to a particular property for the purpose of
alleviating a hardship, practical difficulty, or unique circumstance as defined
and elaborated upon in a community's respective planning and zoning enabling
legislation.
      (9)   Annexations. The Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted by
reference into division (B)(2) above may include floodplain areas that lie
outside of the corporate boundaries of the City of Center City at the time of
adoption of this chapter. If any of these floodplain land areas are annexed
into the city after the date of adoption of this chapter, the newly annexed
floodplain lands shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter immediately
upon the date of annexation into the city.
   (C)   Establishment of zoning districts.
      (1)   Districts.
         (a)   Floodway District. The Floodway District for lakes, wetlands,
and other basins shall include those areas designated as Zone AE on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map panels adopted in division (B)(2) that are below the
ordinary high water level as defined in M.S. § 103G.005, subd. 14.
         (b)   Flood Fringe District. The Flood Fringe District for lakes,
wetlands, and other basins shall include those areas designated as Zone AE on
the Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted in division (B)(2) that are below
the 1% annual chance flood elevation (100-year flood elevation) but above the
ordinary high water level as defined in M.S. § 103G.005, subd. 14.
      (2)   Compliance. No new structure or land shall hereafter be used and no
structure shall be constructed, located, extended, converted, or structurally
altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other
applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this
chapter. Within the Floodway and Flood Fringe Districts, all uses not listed as
permitted uses or conditional uses in divisions (D) and (E) that follow,
respectively, shall be prohibited. In addition, a caution is provided here
that:
         (a)   New manufactured homes, replacement manufactured homes, and
certain travel trailers and travel vehicles are subject to the general
provisions of this chapter and specifically division (I).
         (b)   Modifications, additions, structural alterations, normal
maintenance and repair, or repair after damage to existing nonconforming
structures and nonconforming uses of structures or land are regulated by the
general provisions of this chapter and specifically division (K).
         (c)   As-built elevations for elevated or flood proofed structures
must be certified by ground surveys and flood proofing techniques must be
designed and certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as
specified in the general provisions of this chapter and specifically as stated
in division (J) of this chapter.
   (D)   Floodway District (FW). The permitted and conditional uses listed
below are only allowable in the floodway if not prohibited by any other
underlying zoning district classifications of the City of Center City and if
not prohibited by any applicable state or federal law.
      (1)   Permitted uses.
         (a)   General farming, pasture, grazing, outdoor plant nurseries,
horticulture, and wild crop harvesting.
         (b)   Boat launching ramps, swimming areas, parks, wildlife and nature
preserves, and fishing areas.
         (c)   Residential lawns, gardens, and play areas.
      (2)   Standards for floodway permitted uses.
         (a)   The use shall have a low flood damage potential.
         (b)   The use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district
if one exists.
         (c)   The use shall not obstruct flood flows or increase flood
elevations and shall not involve structures, fill, obstructions, excavations,
or storage of materials or equipment.
      (3)   Conditional uses.
         (a)   Extraction and storage of sand, gravel, and other materials.
         (b)   Marinas, boat rentals, permanent commercial docks, piers,
wharves, and water control structures.
         (c)   Railroads, streets, bridges, utility transmission lines, and
pipelines.
         (d)   Placement of fill.
      (4)   Standards for floodway conditional uses.
         (a)   All uses. No fill (including fill for roads and levees),
deposit, obstruction, or other use may be allowed as a conditional use that
will cause any increase in the stage of the 100-year or regional flood or cause
an increase in flood damages in the reach or reaches affected.
         (b)   All floodway conditional uses shall be subject to the procedures
and standards contained in division (J)(4) of this chapter.
         (c)   The conditional use shall be permissible in the underlying
zoning district if one exists.
         (d)   Fill.
            1.   Fill, dredge spoil, and all other similar materials deposited
or stored in the floodplain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative
cover, mulching, riprap, or other acceptable method.
            2.   Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not be
allowed in the floodway unless a long-term site development plan is submitted
which includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the plan.
            3.   As an alternative, and consistent with division 2. immediately
above, dredge spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may allow
temporary, on-site storage of fill or other materials which would have caused
an increase to the stage of the 100-year or regional flood but only after the
governing body has received an appropriate plan which assures the removal of
the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time available.
The conditional use permit must be title registered with the property in the
Office of the County Recorder.
         (e)   Storage of materials and equipment. Storage of other materials
or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time
available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the
governing body. The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited.
         (f)   Community-wide structural works for flood control intended to
remove areas from the regulatory floodplain shall not be allowed in the
floodway.
   (E)   Flood Fringe District (FF).
      (1)   Permitted uses. Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or
structures listed as permitted uses in the underlying zoning use district(s).
If no pre-existing, underlying zoning use districts exist, then any residential
or nonresidential structure or use of a structure or land shall be a permitted
use in the Flood Fringe District provided such use does not constitute a public
nuisance. All permitted uses shall comply with the standards for Flood Fringe
District “Permitted Uses” listed in division (E)(2) and the “Standards for all
Flood Fringe Uses” listed in division (E)(5).
      (2)   Standards for Flood Fringe permitted uses.
         (a)   All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated
on fill so that the lowest floor including basement floor is at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for
structures shall be no lower than 1 foot below the regulatory flood protection
elevation and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least 15 feet beyond
the outside limits of the structure erected thereon.
         (b)   As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures
that constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed 500 square feet at
its largest projection may be flood proofed in accordance with the following
standards:
            1.   Accessory structures shall not be designed for human
habitation.
            2.   Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally
dry flood proofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing
classifications in the State Building Code. As an alternative, an accessory
structure may be flood proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 flood proofing
classification in the State Building Code and, for a detached garage, the
detached garage must be used solely for parking of vehicles and limited
storage. Flood proofed accessory structures must meet the following additional
standards:
               a.   The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed
to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls;
               b.   Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be
elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly
flood proofed; and
               c.   To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure,
there must be a minimum of two “automatic” openings in the outside walls of the
structure having a total net area of not less than 1 square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be openings on at
least 2 sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no higher
than 1 foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human
intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this
requirement for automatic openings.
         (c)   The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess
of 1,000 cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel shall be allowable only
as a conditional use, unless said fill is specifically intended to elevate a
structure in accordance with division (E)(2)(a) of this chapter.
         (d)   The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on
fill to the regulatory flood protection elevation.
         (e)   The provisions of division (E)(5) of this chapter shall apply.
      (3)   Conditional uses. Any structure that is not elevated on fill or
flood proofed in accordance with division (E)(2)(a) through (E)(2)(b) and or
any use of land that does not comply with the standards in division (E)(2)(c)
through (E)(2)(d) shall only be allowable as a conditional use. An application
for a conditional use shall be subject to the standards and criteria and
evaluation procedures specified in divisions (E)(4) through (E)(5) and (J)(4)
of this chapter.
      (4)   Standards for flood fringe conditional uses.
         (a)   Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be
utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood
protection elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts,
pilings, parallel walls, etc., or above-grade, enclosed areas such as crawl
spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be
considered above-grade and not a structure's basement or lowest floor if: 1)
the enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the structure; 2) it
is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant
materials; and 3) it is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access,
or storage. The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the
following additional standards:
            1.   Design and certification. The structure's design and as-built
condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
as being in compliance with the general design standards of the State Building
Code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing,
and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above
the regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood water
from entering or accumulating within these components during times of
flooding. 
            2.   Specific standards for above-grade, enclosed areas. Above-
grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be
designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate:
               a.   A minimum area of openings in the walls where internal
flooding is to be used as a flood proofing technique. There shall be a minimum
of 2 openings on at least 2 sides of the structure and the bottom of all
openings shall be no higher than 1-foot above grade. The automatic openings
shall have a minimum net area of not less than 1 square inch for every square
foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered professional
engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area would suffice. The
automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
flood waters without any form of human intervention; and
               b.   That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant
materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the State
Building Code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of
vehicles, or storage.
         (b)   Basements, as defined by division (B)(8)(b) of this chapter,
shall be subject to the following:
            1.   Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below
the regulatory flood protection elevation.
            2.   Nonresidential basements may be allowed below the regulatory
flood protection elevation provided the basement is structurally dry flood
proofed in accordance with division (E)(4)(c) of this chapter.
         (c)   All areas of nonresidential structures including basements to be
placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be flood proofed
in accordance with the structurally dry flood proofing classifications in the
State Building Code. Structurally dry flood proofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-
2 flood proofing classification in the State Building Code and this shall
require making the structure watertight with the walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of
buoyancy. Structures flood proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not
be permitted.
         (d)   When at any one time more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or
other similar material is located on a parcel for such activities as on-site
storage, landscaping, sand and gravel operations, landfills, roads, dredge
spoil disposal or construction of flood control works, an erosion/sedimentation
control plan must be submitted unless the community is enforcing a state
approved shoreland management ordinance. In the absence of a state approved
shoreland ordinance, the plan must clearly specify methods to be used to
stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the 100-year or
regional flood event. The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered
professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the governing
body. The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the
material from the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists.
         (e)   Storage of materials and equipment.
            1.   The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or
plant life is prohibited.
            2.   Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if
readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning
and in accordance with a plan approved by the governing body.
         (f)   The provisions of division (E)(5) of this chapter shall also
apply.
      (5)   Standards for all Flood Fringe uses.
         (a)   All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or
above an elevation not more than 2 feet below the regulatory flood protection
elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the City Council must
specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the structure for
times of flooding and only after determining that adequate flood warning time
and local flood emergency response procedures exist.
         (b)   Commercial uses - accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad
tracks, and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the
employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood
warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be
inundated to a depth and velocity such that when multiplying the depth (in
feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the product number exceeds 4 upon
occurrence of the regional flood.
         (c)   Manufacturing and industrial uses - measures shall be taken to
minimize interference with normal plant operations especially along streams
having protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards
and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in
division (E)(5)(b) above. In considering permit applications, due consideration
shall be given to needs of an industry whose business requires that it be
located in floodplain areas.
         (d)   Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be
properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable
method. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria
for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures
properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation - FEMA’s
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection
standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should
be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of
special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
         (e)   Floodplain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic
capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse
or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been
specified on the Official Zoning Map.
         (f)   Standards for recreational vehicles are contained in division
(I)(3).
         (g)   All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse, and
lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited
to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in
addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind
forces.
   (F)   Reserved for future use. 
   (G)   Subdivisions.
      (1)   Review criteria. No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable
for the reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage
treatment facilities. All lots within the floodplain districts shall be able to
contain a building site outside of the Floodway District at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation. All subdivisions shall have water and
sewage treatment facilities that comply with the provisions of this Ordinance
and have road access both to the subdivision and to the individual building
sites no lower than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation.
For all subdivisions in the floodplain, the Floodway and Flood Fringe District
boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation and the required
elevation of all access roads shall be clearly labeled on all required
subdivision drawings and platting documents.
      (2)   Removal of special flood hazard area designation. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the
special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated
on fill above the 1% annual chance flood elevation (100-year flood elevation).
FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope
protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These
standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if
a change of special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
   (H)   Public utilities, railroads, roads, and bridges.
      (1)   Public utilities. All public utilities and facilities such as gas,
electrical, sewer, and water supply systems to be located in the floodplain
shall be flood proofed in accordance with the State Building Code or elevated
to above the regulatory flood protection elevation.
      (2)   Public transportation facilities. Railroad tracks, roads, and
bridges to be located within the floodplain shall comply with divisions (D) and
(E) of this chapter. Elevation to the regulatory flood protection elevation
shall be provided where failure or interruption of these transportation
facilities would result in danger to the public health or safety or where such
facilities are essential to the orderly functioning of the area. Minor or
auxiliary roads or railroads may be constructed at a lower elevation where
failure or interruption of transportation services would not endanger the
public health or safety.
      (3)   On-site sewage treatment and water supply systems. Where public
utilities are not provided: 1) On-site water supply systems must be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and 2) new
or replacement on-site sewage treatment systems must be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the
systems into flood waters and they shall not be subject to impairment or
contamination during times of flooding. Any sewage treatment system designed in
accordance with the state's current statewide standards for on-site sewage
treatment systems shall be determined to be in compliance with this section.
   (I)   Manufactured homes and manufactured home parks and placement of
recreational vehicles.
      (1)   New manufactured home parks and expansions to existing manufactured
home parks shall be subject to the provisions placed on subdivisions by
division (G) of this chapter.
      (2)   The placement of new or replacement manufactured homes in existing
manufactured home parks or on individual lots of record that are located in
floodplain districts will be treated as a new structure and may be placed only
if elevated in compliance with division (E) of this chapter. If vehicular road
access for pre-existing manufactured home parks is not provided in accordance
with division (E)(5)(a), then replacement manufactured homes will not be
allowed until the property owner(s) develops a flood warning emergency plan
acceptable to the governing body.
         (a)   All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse, and
lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited
to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in
addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind
forces.
      (3)   Recreational vehicles that do not meet the exemption criteria
specified in division (I)(3)(a) below shall be subject to the provisions of
this chapter and as specifically spelled out in divisions (I)(3)(c) through (I)
(3)(d) below.
         (a)   Exemption. Recreational vehicles are exempt from the provisions
of this chapter if they are placed in any of the areas listed in division (I)
(3)(b) below and further they meet the following criteria:
            1.   Have current licenses required for highway use.
            2.   Are highway ready meaning on wheels or the internal jacking
system, are attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities
commonly used in campgrounds and recreational vehicle parks and the
recreational vehicle has no permanent structural type additions attached to it.
            3.   The recreational vehicle and associated use must be
permissible in any pre-existing, underlying zoning use district.
         (b)   Areas exempted for placement of recreational vehicles.
            1.   Individual lots or parcels of record.
            2.   Existing commercial recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds.
            3.   Existing condominium type associations.
         (c)   Recreational vehicles exempted in division (I)(3)(a) lose this
exemption when development occurs on the parcel exceeding $500 for a structural
addition to the recreational vehicle or exceeding $500 for an accessory
structure such as a garage or storage building. The recreational vehicle and
all additions and accessory structures will then be treated as a new structure
and shall be subject to the elevation/flood proofing requirements and the use
of land restrictions specified in divisions (D) and (E) of this chapter. There
shall be no development or improvement on the parcel or attachment to the
recreational vehicle that hinders the removal of the recreational vehicle to a
flood free location should flooding occur.
         (d)   New commercial recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds and new
residential type subdivisions and condominium associations and the expansion of
any existing similar use exceeding 5 units or dwelling sites shall be subject
to the following:
            1.   Any new or replacement recreational vehicle will be allowed in
the Floodway or Flood Fringe Districts provided said recreational vehicle and
its contents are placed on fill above the regulatory flood protection elevation
and proper elevated road access to the site exists in accordance with division
(E)(5)(a) of this chapter. No fill placed in the floodway to meet the
requirements of this chapter shall increase flood stages of the 100-year or
regional flood.
            2.   All new or replacement recreational vehicles not meeting the
criteria of division (I)(3)(d)1. above may, as an alternative, be allowed as a
conditional use if in accordance with the following provisions and the
provisions of (J)(4) of this chapter. The applicant must submit an emergency
plan for the safe evacuation of all vehicles and people during the 100-year
flood. Said plan shall be prepared by a registered engineer or other qualified
individual, shall demonstrate that adequate time and personnel exist to carry
out the evacuation, and shall demonstrate the provisions of division (I)(3)

in duplicate to the Zoning Administrator on forms furnished by the Zoning
Administrator and shall include the following where applicable: plans in
duplicate drawn to scale, showing the nature, location, dimensions, and
elevations of the lot; existing or proposed structures, fill, or storage of
materials; and the location of the foregoing in relation to the stream channel.
         (c)   State and federal permits. Prior to granting a permit or
processing an application for a conditional use permit or variance, the Zoning
Administrator shall determine that the applicant has obtained all necessary
state and federal permits.
         (d)   Certificate of zoning compliance for a new, altered, or
nonconforming use. It shall be unlawful to use, occupy, or permit the use or
occupancy of any building or premises or part thereof hereafter created,
erected, changed, converted, altered, or enlarged in its use or structure until
a certificate of zoning compliance shall have been issued by the Zoning
Administrator stating that the use of the building or land conforms to the
requirements of this chapter.
         (e)   Construction and use to be as provided on applications, plans,
permits, variances and certificates of zoning compliance.  Permits, conditional
use permits, or certificates of zoning compliance issued on the basis of
approved plans and applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and
construction set forth in such approved plans and applications, and no other
use, arrangement, or construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at
variance with that authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and
punishable as provided by division (L) of this chapter.
         (f)   Certification. The applicant shall be required to submit
certification by a registered professional engineer, registered architect, or
registered land surveyor that the finished fill and building elevations were
accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Flood proofing
measures shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or registered
architect.

flood proofed.
         (h)   Notifications for watercourse alterations. The Zoning
Administrator shall notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and
the Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources prior to the community
authorizing any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. If the applicant has
applied for a permit to work in the beds of public waters pursuant to M.S.
Chapter 103G, this shall suffice as adequate notice to the Commissioner of
Natural Resources. A copy of said notification shall also be submitted to the
Chicago Regional Office of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
         (i)   Notification to FEMA when physical changes increase or decrease
the 100-year flood elevation.  As soon as is practicable, but not later than 6
months after the date such supporting information becomes available, the Zoning
Administrator shall notify the Chicago Regional Office of FEMA of the changes
by submitting a copy of said technical or scientific data.
      (3)   City Council.
         (a)   Rules. The City Council shall adopt rules for the conduct of
business and may exercise all of the powers conferred by state law.
         (b)   Administrative review.  The City Council shall hear and decide
appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision,
or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
         (c)   Variances. The City Council may authorize upon appeal in
specific cases such relief or variance from the terms of this chapter as will
not be contrary to the public interest and only for those circumstances such as
hardship, practical difficulties, or circumstances unique to the property under
consideration, as provided for in the respective enabling legislation for
planning and zoning for cities or counties as appropriate. In the granting of
such variance, the City Council shall clearly identify in writing the specific
conditions that existed consistent with the criteria specified in this chapter,
any other zoning regulations in the community, and in the respective enabling
legislation that justified the granting of the variance. No variance shall have
the effect of allowing in any district uses prohibited in that district, permit
a lower degree of flood protection than the regulatory flood protection
elevation for the particular area, or permit standards lower than those
required by state law. The following additional variance criteria of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency must be satisfied:
            1.   Variances shall not be issued by a community within any
designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base
flood discharge would result;
            2.   Variances shall only be issued by a community upon:
               a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
               b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
               c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances; and
            3.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         (d)   Hearings. Upon filing with the City Council of an appeal from a
decision of the Zoning Administrator, or an application for a variance, the
City Council shall fix a reasonable time for a hearing and give due notice to
the parties in interest as specified by law. The City Council shall submit by
mail to the Commissioner of Natural Resources a copy of the application for
proposed variances sufficiently in advance so that the Commissioner will
receive at least 10 days notice of the hearing.
         (e)   Decisions. The City Council shall arrive at a decision on such
appeal or variance within 30 days. In passing upon an appeal, the City Council
may, so long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order,
requirement, decision, or determination of the Zoning Administrator or other
public official. It shall make its decision in writing setting forth the
findings of fact and the reasons for its decisions. In granting a variance the
City Council may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards such as those
specified in division (J)(4)(f), which are in conformity with the purposes of
this chapter. Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of
the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of
this chapter punishable under division (L). A copy of all decisions granting
variances shall be forwarded by mail to the Commissioner of Natural Resources
within 10 days of such action.
         (f)   Appeals. Appeals from any decision of the City Council may be
made, and as specified in this community’s official controls and also by
Minnesota Statutes.
         (g)   Flood insurance notice and record keeping. The Zoning
Administrator shall notify the applicant for a variance that: 1) The issuance
of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result
in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for
$100 of insurance coverage; and 2) Such construction below the 100-year or
regional flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification
shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions. A community shall
maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their
issuance, and report such variances issued in its annual or biennial report
submitted to the Administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program.
      (4)   Conditional uses. The City Council shall hear and decide
applications for conditional uses permissible under this chapter. Applications
shall be submitted to the City Clerk who shall forward the application to
Planning Commission for consideration.
         (a)   Hearings. Upon filing with the City Clerk an application for a
conditional use permit, the City Clerk shall submit by mail to the Commissioner
of Natural Resources a copy of the application for proposed conditional use
sufficiently in advance so that the Commissioner will receive at least 10 days
notice of the hearing.
         (b)   Decisions. The City Council shall arrive at a decision on a
conditional use within the time period governed by M.S. § 15.99. In granting a
conditional use permit the City Council shall prescribe appropriate conditions
and safeguards, in addition to those specified in division (J)(4)(f), which are
in conformity with the purposes of this chapter. Violations of such conditions
and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the conditional use
permit is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter punishable under
division (L). A copy of all decisions granting conditional use permits shall be
forwarded by mail to the Commissioner of Natural Resources within 10 days of
such action.

technical assistance, where necessary, in evaluating the proposed project in
relation to flood heights and velocities, the seriousness of flood damage to
the use, the adequacy of the plans for protection, and other technical matters.
            3.   Based upon the technical evaluation of the designated engineer
or expert, the Zoning Administrator shall determine the specific flood hazard
at the site and evaluate the suitability of the proposed use in relation to the
flood hazard.
         (d)   Factors upon which the decision of the City Council shall be
based. In passing upon conditional use applications, the City Council shall
consider all relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
            1.   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights
or velocities caused by encroachments;
            2.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or
downstream to the injury of others or they may block bridges, culverts, or
other hydraulic structures;
            3.   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the
ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary
conditions;
            4.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
            5.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
            6.   The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location;
            7.   The availability of alternative locations not subject to
flooding for the proposed use;
            8.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing
development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future;
            9.   The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan
and Floodplain Management Program for the area;
            10.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
            11.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and
            12.   Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this
chapter.
         (e)   Time for acting on application. The City Council shall act on an
application in the manner described above pursuant to the requirements of M.S.
§ 15.99 from the date of receiving a completed application, except that where
additional information is required pursuant to division (J)(4)(c) of this
chapter. The City Council shall render a written decision within the time
provided in M.S. § 15.99 from the receipt of such additional information.
          (f)   Conditions attached to conditional use permits. Upon
consideration of the factors listed above and the purpose of this chapter, the

Flood Fringe District, respectively.
         (f)   If a substantial improvement occurs, as defined in division (B)
(8)(u) of this chapter, from any combination of a building addition to the
outside dimensions of the existing building or a rehabilitation,
reconstruction, alteration, or other improvement to the inside dimensions of an
existing nonconforming building, then the building addition and the existing
nonconforming building must meet the requirements of division (D) or (E) of
this chapter for new structures, depending upon whether the structure is in the
Floodway or Flood Fringe District, respectively.
   (L)   Penalties for violation.
      (1)   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply
with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with grants of variances or conditional uses) shall
constitute a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as defined by law.

taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation. Such actions may include but are not limited to:
         (a)   In responding to a suspected violation of this chapter, the
Zoning Administrator and local government may utilize the full array of
enforcement actions available to it including but not limited to prosecution
and fines, injunctions, after-the-fact permits, orders for corrective measures,
or a request to the National Flood Insurance Program for denial of flood
insurance availability to the guilty party. The community must act in good
faith to enforce these official controls and to correct violations fo this
chapter to the extent possible so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in the
National Flood Insurance Program.
         (b)   When a violation of this chapter is either discovered by or
brought to the attention of the Zoning Administrator, the Zoning Administrator
shall immediately investigate the situation and document the nature and extent
of the violation of the official control. As soon as is reasonably possible,

Resources and Federal Emergency Management Agency Regional Office along with
the community’s plan of action to correct the violation to the degree possible.
         (c)   The Zoning Administrator shall notify the suspected party of the
requirements of this chapter and all other official controls and the nature and
extent of the suspected violation of these controls. If the structure and/or
use is under construction or development, the Zoning Administrator may order
the construction or development immediately halted until a proper permit or
approval is granted by the community. If the construction or development is
already completed, then the Zoning Administrator may either: (1) issue an order
identifying the corrective actions that must be made within a specified time
period to bring the use or structure into compliance with the official
controls; or (2) notify the responsible party to apply for an after-the-fact
permit/development approval within a specified period of time not to exceed 30
days.
         (d)   If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the
Zoning Administrator within the specified period of time, each additional day
that lapses shall constitute an additional violation of this chapter and shall
be prosecuted accordingly. The Zoning Administrator shall also upon the lapse
of the specified response period notify the landowner to restore the land to
the condition which existed prior to the violation of this chapter.
   (M)   Amendments.
      (1)   The floodplain designation on the Official Zoning Map shall not be
removed from floodplain areas unless it can be shown that the designation is in
error or that the area has been filled to or above the elevation of the
regulatory flood protection elevation and is contiguous to lands outside the
floodplain. Special exceptions to this rule may be permitted by the
Commissioner of Natural Resources if he or she determines that, through other
measures, lands are adequately protected for the intended use.
      (2)   All amendments to this chapter, including amendments to the
Official Zoning Map, must be submitted to and approved by the Commissioner of
Natural Resources prior to adoption. Changes in the Official Zoning Map must
meet the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Technical Conditions and
